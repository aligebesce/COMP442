That's temperature and that's rainfall.
"Yeah but which line refers to which, how can I tell?"
You need to put the dotted line there  and square there
No you can look like that.
How?
"Rain, ten millimetres of rain equals one millimetre  ten of rain equals one millimetre and this one  one degrees  celsius  equals"
Well I'm sorry  I don't think that is very clever  for you!
there and
"one degrees, how can temperature"
What?
one degree celsius equals one millimetre
Yes.
So it's twenty five degrees celsius in January?
No.
Well I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to put some sort of  clue on it.
She left before she was pregnant.

"It's staying on the dual carriageway, well I went round Steven's to see if he thought to tow it round mine cos the  already been on my back once  oh no he said I've only just walked in from work  I'm having my tea then I'm going to bed he said, there's no way I'm towing no motor for the   he said, just f off!"
Well well we'd have
What did you say?

So you should have said to him
Going mad because

Bernie's been out at ten o'clock at night before with him.
Aha.
That really got on my nerves that did.
"he comes round, and just say no, I'm not doing nothing for you."
Oh.

When's he coming back?
Next Friday.
"Next Friday, oh right."
And is that the microphone?

And are you supposed to wear that?
"Er stick it in your t wherever, yeah."
In your
Stick it where you like.
", you what?"
Stick it where you like.
But d does it need to be uncovered?
No.
It's got erm  it's own recording level.
Yeah.
And even if it  and are you supposed to tell people that you're recording what they're saying or just record it
Erm
and then tell them afterwards?
"I suppose you should tell them that you're going to tape the conversation maybe, yeah."
Yes.
I don't suppose that matters really.
"But I mean, if you erm  if you put your headphones on you see, they might just think erm  you're listening to a Walkman."
And er  they would come up with some bad language towards you.
Then especially if you told them you were recording what they  said .
Could be dangerous.
"I've asked Brian to take the dog out as well, when he comes back."
I won't have time now.
No.
And I'm going to Chester tomorrow.
Are you?

Ah!
Yes.
Isn't Scott down there?
"No, he's gone to a  play at the college   and a   yeah  I was er like  when I realised  that had come on I thought  does he know?"
Just don't say anything !
And thought that they were picking his nose  !
Maybe he's not in !
"I thought, oh never mind !"
Put the phone down again.
"And then I thought, well you can always and like say, can you tell Scott!"
And I will
Can you tell I've come on so I'm not pregnant!
Alright?
And I thought like  his mum might not find that really amusing or anything
Yeah.
so  and I thought I could just leave him sort of like  a message that was subtle enough
"so he'd know, like  erm"
Tell him he's not a daddy!
Yes !
"ring  , could you tell Scott that er  that erm  oh God, I don't know!"
"Actually I was thinking of some really good, funny things I could say earlier"
I can't think of any now!
"Things like erm  oh yeah, could yo could you tell Scott that  er, he doesn't have to go to church  and pray any more, something like that !"
Tell him he doesn't have to go to confession with Helena!
That's right !
Oh gee!
He doesn't have to book me an appointment  at the clinic !
Ooh I wonder what that could be about ?
"Er, like this morning at break  I walked, I walked straight past Peter  right  and er  come up to me and he goes  that's not very nice is it?"
I thought what !
"He  just walked straight past me, oh well I'm so sorry and he goes  what's wrong with you anyway lately?"
Nothing!
Nothing wrong with me !
You're flipping  massive one !
I dunno.
"If  Zena saw it  and, and made a  a subtle comments like"
Mm.

Oh got a nasty
Ah
bruise there!
"Yeah, actually se , I sa , actually she said  oh what, have you been walking into this time?"
"Hah, shut up!"
Shut up before I punch your face in!
But like erm  no one else saw it.
"But, I tell you what, it was so embarrassing!"
"The, it was the Mo , the Monday after the Saturday got, the Saturday it was done, I had P E  oh great!"
"So there's me like  I'm sat in first lesson we have  P E last lesson  sat in the first lesson  and I'm th , I've thought  God my bra strap feels really lose!"
So I'm right  I thought  oh my God!
"There's a gap in between, they're not attached any more!"
What would you do ?
".I mean, like, okay it wasn't bad I mean  let's face it and I'm not exactly flipping  Dolly Parton am I?!"
exploding everywhere wouldn't she !
"But like, I was thinking  this is gonna be so embarrassing like in P E!"
With ha half a bra on !
!
my cups down  my cups down to my waist !
"I sa , I was sat there and  and then we was in maths, like the lesson before and I was going Zena, I don't wanna do P E!"
I just do not want to do P E!
"And she's going, why not?"
"You like P E, I don't wanna do it Zena  will you write me a letter to get me out of it?"
"She's going  no I won't, you know, not unless you tell me what it i , why it is you don't wanna do it!"
"So in the end I wro , I wrote her this letter because I couldn't say it out loud  in case anyone else heard me!"
And say that I've busted my bra strap !
"So she goes, oh don't worry about it."
you'd ordered everything
no
Sorry.
I only need a bit.
"I can get some from er  Chester perhaps, for what I want you know?"
"So er  how often does this  do they go to  then, how often is this order?"
Is it
Er this is just one that  I wanted some stuff and I said to a few people
Oh you went round?
"I see, yeah."
and they're delivering it.
I've actually  the last time I got some delivered for me was February  so I tend to sort of get something about once a month I think.
Mm
"It really depends what I'm doing, if I'm doing a lot of   stuff, then I don't need"
Yeah
to go because I've got all the hair
Loads yeah
But at the moment I seem to have done a lot of  stuff with foam so
"I tend to forget, me, honest to god I think I've  plenty and then you come to the  you say oh god  you know  it's  never mind."
Well next time I'll remember you.
"Next time if you'd ask me, and I still won't know."
Half past twelve!
"I might as well go through on this, I was gonna go in that one."
Yeah
"I'll, I'll go, this fellow's moving now so I'll go in there."
So you've got a big garden have you Arth?
"Oh, no"
Oh.
got a  decent size back garden.
"Mine is, yes yes, yeah."
It's er Birkenhead you live is it?
I live in
So here we've got
This is less than one.
squared.
squared it gets smaller and smaller.
So that's going to be nought point four.
Mm.
So the gradient at that point is about two.
Erm what wh where were we  where did I say find the gradient?
Where X equal to three?
Yeah.
Sorry  something wrong that.
"So we'd be, oh, okay, that's good cos you can do it."
When X is three?
"So when X is two point nine, say."
"Two point nine, and then"
Y
when X  one see what Y is down here.
It was three point one.
"Don't forget you can look at this, Y equals X plus one times X minus one, which, when you see it that way tells you where it's going to, where its roots are."
Where it's going to cut the axes.
Yeah.
X  So there Y will be two point nine plus times two point nine minus one.
Right.
"Which is three point nine times nought point nine,"
Okay.
"But f we can, we can, we can save that to the end because  I think that was"
Aye.
confusing probably wasn't it?
"When we're doing it this way, we can forget about the, with this X, X two is going to be three point one squared"
Minus one .
minus one.
"This one is going to be two point nine squared, minus one."
We compromised.
Okay.
Here's Mr .
You better get your head down  Wesley.
"When we used to sit with you in Humanities  sat next to you right, and I was saying like erm  erm, you were saying  I got you to say  so who are gonna bring down the school to beat me up?"

What are they doing?
They used to break up all their things on stage.
Dreadful isn't it?
Why?
Well that's what pop groups used to do.
They went to total excess and  then they had to come back the other way.
Well look at them now.

In it.
On Saturday.
Mm.
"Well, just be very careful."
And don't get over cocky.
And keep away from big lorries.

I mean a bit of fear  is a good thing.
"Erm, I'm still scared every time I pull away."
"You know,ji little jitterbugs."
Yeah.
And  I went up Iver Road as well.
On a bike?
"O o on the way back from Andrew's, yeah."

"Cos you've gotta have one foot on the ground  and you've gotta have one o ha foot, one on the brake"
Yeah.
"one on the clutch, one on the throttle"
"Well, that's my point you see."
"from erm, an alleyway or"
But that man does live near you that can give you a lift.
"I know, but then I, I'd have"
Yeah but you'd also have
to endure the pub with  the other  with Don.

"you don't, you don't even feel ."

Is it really?
Yeah.
"As I say I, that's why, that's really why I was expecting you  more towards twelve o'clock time."
So I said well if they're gonna get .

"Cos she was trying to find a, a reason  or an excuse  to sue them for it."
She stated that.

And he said how can they do that?
Is it in the law?
They don't break the law.
They can't afford to break the law.
No well

"What's that, chickens or ducks?"
Dunno.
They keep everything round there.
"You look out one window you see a chicken, look out another window you see pigs."
Another way you see goats.

They come round in the morning
Marjie ain't had a goat yet .
No.
"You, you'd love it."
You'd be in your element you would.
These tiles are all throughout.

No polish or anything.

This timing will enable even the youngest children to take part.
"Well I'm not bound to, no."
What?
Have a bath tomorrow.
Well you can have one .
"Good god, you can have one now if you want it."
I hope  you know I'd er  see he'll have to put the back seat of the car down into a van.

"Bloody cheek, do him the world of good to go without for a day or two."
He won't eat it.
"Well that's it, he he"
It's treating him like a kid of  five or six year old isn't it?
He forgets that he
Well the thing is he doesn't have a dinner every day of the week.
It won't hurt him.
Lots of people don't have one at all.
And then he looks forward to the weekends and that.
It was low cost through the
No cos it's concert.
There's going
Oh concert.
to be a concert there.
"All Saints, they were going to have a concert weren't they."
No.
This is at the Rhodes Centre.

I mean he kept  he didn't know.
He said to me on the phone he didn't know a great deal cos he was just getting it all together.
"And he said, today he phoned me just as I was going out and I didn't really sort of stop and talk to him very long."
He just asked me what we needed and I said well a table.
We don't really need anything else do we?
Like power supply or
Oh no  quite
something with flashing lights on it!
So what time of the day is that?
It's evening.
seven or eight o'clock.
He told me.
How long does it go on for?
No idea.
He said he'd phone me again you see.
I think if there's a concert there'll be a rush at the beginning and there'll be a rush at the end.
"Possibly a rush at the, at an interval I suppose."
What concert is it then?
I mean
I don't know her but
"It is really nice  and like, she's the most gorgeous looking girl you've seen in your life!"
"I've probably, I've probably seen her but"
"I've, I've talked about her haven't I?"
Mm.
About Rachel.
I've heard the  name.
And erm  come up to me today and she goes  have you got any scissors?
I goes  no why?
Oh it doesn't matter.
"She walked to Zeena, Zeena got any scissors?"
No  why do you want them?
"So, oh it doesn't matter."
"Oh come on Rach , come on tell us, you know!"
She's going  I wanna cut my hair.
And she was deadly serious!
"I'm going, no you're not, don't be stupid!"
"She gone, I've had enough of it, it's really getting me down!"
"I thought, and she was really depressed about it!"
Oh my God!
"But like, Mr  really really bad  like  maths teacher, he goes erm  he goes to , she goes to him the other day  oh you're only picking on me cos I got ginger hair!"
"Yeah, you're right I am!"
And he was being really nasty!
"And I thought, I was thinking  God that is really, really nasty that is!"
"But like  then er, she, she just turned round to him and she goes  tell you what, I would really, really, love it if you woke up tomorrow and you had ginger hair, cos that'd really, really give you a dose of your own medicine!"
"Then  then er  and he was going, oh don't be childish Rachel and all this!"
"And, it's nothing to do with that!"
"And she goes, oh yeah, as if you'd know!"
"And like, he's really getting her down!"
Yeah.
I feel really sorry for her cos her hair is gorgeous!
"I mean, I'd kill for hair that colour!"
Mhm.
It was at a church in Hertford.
And we were completely frozen cos the boiler had broken down and we were there at two o'clock to rehearse.
"And  I had one rehearsal of two Bach pieces which were really difficult  and I was com , feeling completely frantic during the break in rehearsal, and went over  to look at the music  and some fellow called Don bounded over to me  and said, oh you can't be  you know you sh can't be looking at that now, ba, la dee da dee da!"
He must have heard that I'd come back from  Ireland.
"So, he was talking about Ireland, really raving about it and  his name's Kennedy and  he's from Liverpool and he likes to think he's got Irish blood in him, he's been there twice this year and"
Mhm.
all that.
Really enthusing about it.
So we were chatting away about that.
"And then erm  after the rehearsal  some of us went off to get a pizza  before the concert  and he said to me, erm  are you interested in going to hear the  Mozart Requiem, it's on at the Barbican on Wednesday?"
"So I said, yeah!"
"Co , I've always wanted to hear it, and as you know it's our next concert."
"So erm  that was fine, until  after the concert"
Was that a subsidised concert by  were all the tickets one price or not?
At the Barbican?
I don't know.
It was packed!
Princess Diana was there.

It's crap isn't it?
"No, not really!"
Crap weather!
It's crazy!
It isn't raining is it?
"Just, it's not cold."

Don't you?
Yeah.
Especially if you've got nothing  to do.
Is Curly working or not?
No.
He hasn't had a job for ages has he?
A no.
Well there's no point in him working cos he just loses his
I jus I can't believe that that  can be true!
I mean
"Annie, Annie works twenty four hours a we , Annie works twenty four hours a week in this shop right  and the , she claims family credit as well and i i ,we if Adrian works  all the benefits go under  he has to"
Yeah but yo
earn something like two hundred quid a week to  to match what they're getting now!
It isn't like that!
It is!
"Well yeah, er okay I can accept that  but I think  mentally"
Yeah.
"you know, I think I mean, I mean he even to  going back to college doing a couple of  A levels wouldn't alter his benefit."
"I mean, do something, you know!"
Yeah.
I could not live like that!
No I couldn't.
I'd go mad!
Especially out there over that shop in Kings Dainton.

And I met  some of them cha you know that chap  and
Mm.

Well I wonder however that that got through to touch that.
"We came out of the shop, turned left  turned left there, and then turned right."
We're going down this road and John was in front of me  and just as John went past this wagon  it pulled out and there was a car coming the other way.
Eeeeh hit my horn.
Ha  I could have shouted louder.
And he stopped and  luckily there was just enough room for me to slow down and just go between them.
I mean that guy just pulled out in front of me.
Mm.
"Huge, huge lorry."
Oh he  he didn't see you or just didn't ?
Didn't care.
Oh.
He saw me alright cos  like John said I had the headlights on.

What no right turn signs ?
You what?
I said to the bloke I said how do you get out that junction?
"He said you don't, there's no right turn."
"I looked up the road and there was two great big signs, no right turn."
I'd already gone that way twice.
Yeah.
And turned right.
Yeah.
Cos it's a very awkward junction.

Consignments.
If it's going  erm
To different .

addresses it's two consignments.
That's what I meant.
"If it goes at different times, it's a different consignment."
"So in, parcel or parcels, going from one address to another at one time in one load  that is a consignment."
"If you just say  erm  a group of parcels  er er, in one load that's not enough  cos it can be"
Yeah I know.
part of a load.

"It's surprising actually cos th the more, the more  common ones do run out because of course th the other ones are a bit pricey."
The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round  and then they run out at Easter.
"That's happened, I couldn't get any  one year  I took the triplets to the erm  Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola  and one of them  won a Creme Egg"
"but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag  and er  it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some  I, I can't remember what we were doing afterwards  so I gave it to his mother, I thought she could share it."
"Mind, by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between  those three and their older brother"
Yeah.
There's not much of it left.
"No, but I could have seen a, there'd be an  almighty tantrums from the other two if Ji er"
Aha.
You don't think it's necessary?
"If they don't respond by the date, you know do it quickly"

"No I can get the  but I mean I can't go , I can go  like  and go  and that's it."

Mm.

Maybe just down the length of one side.
Or even just at the end.

"So what I'm, what I propose, is that this goes out because I don't think it changes anything significantly."
"Erm Jim you, you, you need to present it in a certain way to your staff, and er after you've considered that, if you don't feel it's workable then I think you need to talk to David and I."
Yeah.
"Well I've already, for a number, a number of cases, spoken to Dave about it."
And he knows this can't be worked.
That's why
Well I
"I'm rather surprised that it's, we're"

Ooh I  I loved that!
"They got this bloody knife  and cut half the bloody cheese, I thought  I mean, I'm not a polite person when it comes to food am I?"

So we had all that consequently!
Mm.
And erm
Hey!
"some of them of failed, and if they fail you have to pay so much."
You have to pay so much anyway to have it changed.
"But, as I say, we've been very unhappy about it!"
We had erm  notes through about  Out of
"ten pillows, seven needed replacing and we needed a new milk saucepan, a new frying pan, a new ashtray"
Mm!
cleaners etcetera!
"So, I replaced most of them myself and then whenever we came down  course we complained about the cleaning!"
When we came down  well  it was still  less that desirable!
It's terrible!
And erm
The cooker was filthy!
Because I'm because John Gummer's responsibilities extend a long way into things like housing and stuff as well don't they?
Whereas Robert Atkins has more specific responsibility perhaps for getting this area.
People of one
I don't know that's what I imagine.
people of one  of the environment and the other's Secretary of State for the Environment.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
It's just bizarre rules of procedure.
There are more Ministers of State that there are Secretaries of State.
Yeah.
To be honest I think we should be grateful they don't have to have the court magician come in
Wave their wand and recite the Lords Prayer.
Fair enough.
I assumed there would be a reason  assume there was going to be a good reason.
Erm so who else was on your  list of people we ought to write to
South East Cambridgeshire who's the Parl Parliamentary Secretary to John Gummer.
Who's the sorry your  and I can't
Sorry.

Parliamentary Private Secretary.
And
And
And James Paice  P A I C E
P A I C E
Yes.
Of
MP for South East Cambridgeshire  and he's P P S to John Gummer.
and these people are erm unpaid helpers to Ministers and Secretaries of State it says here.
Unpaid.
So
They're they're the eyes and ears of their boss and they have to report any political pressure so we have to  find something for them  to report basically.
"Oh, I'm fine, thank you."
Put that save.
Make sure I don't lose that.
Okay.
"Right, so, and you're going to the, what's the seminar at five is it or"
"That's right,oh, yes, I received this letter."

"So er, on the last seminar, they all talked about sending out letters to all the students who weren't there  the attendance was very low, and I received one, but"
Right.
enough.
"And er, I was also asked why I had  offered to  and I'd already spoken to the students' secretary about it."
Yeah.
So I wrote back to  and
Mm.
Yeah.
I'm not giving the paper for health reasons.
I have been
Right.
"I will, I will mention, I didn't know they were sending out such a letter, otherwise I would have er, told them in advance."
But I will
I'm on the street for the moment
"I, absolutely, I'll, I'll speak to everyone, don't worry."
"I mean, don't worry"
"So are you, are you be going to seminar?"
Yes.

"Yes, well that's their er  stipulations and  that's  what they're supposed to do once a year!"
It hasn't been done has it?
"No, they're not!"
Danny's paid for new curtains to go up!
"Yes, I know!"
But they haven't done it!
Mum!
No!
"So that's another twenty, thirty, forty, fifty pound in their pocket!"

Well that's right yeah.
I was told I should lend that classroom to them  I can't ge really get out first  and that should be my turn to be out first today.
Yeah cos I definitely shan't be out first shall I?

"So, I opened the door and I was so pleased when he answered, you know."
"He said, just at the right time he decided that he can't get bath any more."
Well that's not a problem.
"I said to him yesterday  wash all your important little places and I'll do the rest, you know."
"So when I got there this morning he was  still in his pyjamas he'd got on quite well, all he wanted me to do was wash his face."

velocity.
Okay.
"And we'll set up a, so we're going to, you, you devise an experiment, Neil."
Measure acceleration.
"There's a car, and we want to know its acceleration between two points."
doesn't matter.
There's your car.
Erm  you start the stopwatch.
Er stopwatch you m you time it from  there  to the ten metre.
Erm what's along your X axis?
Your independent variable?
Time.
Time.
"So, when would you next check its acceleration?"
Would you measure in terms of distance
"or in, in terms of other time"
Time.
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
We'll make it one second.
Okay.
Make it one second.
"Alright, make it ten."
"Sorry,, make it ten seconds."
Plus one second.
"Then the you have to  have y how far the car has travelled,"
Do you?

"I said cos I shall phone the bank first thing Monday and I shall say right, he's took the car so you can run to him for the money cos you'll be getting none out of me."
Then I had a letter from the social  security.
They've been paying me thirty nine pound sixty haven't they?
"And I've been, been  to fifty five pound  seventy five every week."
Oh.
So you'll get a bit back then?
Yeah.
So I think
it's better
Well they're on about backdating it to the third.
But if I write back and say I haven't actually had any wages since the seventeenth of January  I might get it backdated from then.
What's that?
Did  do what he said he was gonna do then?
Yeah.
Oh.
Have you had any repercussions?
Yeah they went to work in it the next day.
Did they?
Yeah.
"What, with all the tyres done?"
Yeah.
How'd they get there?
Well I dunno.
"Michael said it were there at  erm five to twelve, when he  erm quarter past twelve when he come out of work they got in it."
But he don't know what time they got there cos he don't work in that warehouse.
So he was gonna ask  if they got in late because  they could have had time to get it repaired.
Oh I see.
Did mum tell you we went to see the Bachelors last night?
Hint!
Hint!

And then as we approached the tube station the arm around me again and erm  and he
But was he a fellow choir man as well?
Yes!
It's awful you see because it's so
"I would have been, been very rude to him."
"But no, but I can't  couldn't afford to be rude to him, I've only just joined the choir."
Well in future whenever he suggests something  I think what you've got to do
There's some in here.
Okay?
I've got  two here.
"is never  you know, join the breaks or whatever  and just make sure  you're not left alone"
Mm.
you're with other girls.
"Well, I'm sorry, he just came on so strong."
Mm.
"And, so I was forced into lying."
I said erm  I've enjoyed the concert but I'm afraid
Yeah.
"a , er you know, I don't want there to be any."
"misunderstanding, and he, he said explain."
So I had to lie.
Certainly.
"and I said erm, I'm going out with someone."
Cos I thought he hasn't taken any of my hints so far.
"Erm, and he said, oh that sort of un , misunderstanding?"
And then I thought I'd really put my foot in it  and embarrassed both of us
Ha.
"so   there was silence until we got to the tube station and he said, how long have you been going out with this man?"
Said oh  I thought oh Becky would laugh if I told her this .
What was she wearing?
it was sponsored.
I read it in the
Black and white.
paper and thought   well that would have been quite nice.
Mm mm.
Did you go with him?
I'll come to that.
You said yes did anyway.
"I said yes thinking Mozart would be lovely, and not thinking any more of it  until he stuck to me like a limpet"
for the rest of the  concert and  the penny began to drop  erm  He said something about the tube station not being the most romantic place to meet  and I kind of brushed it off by saying well at least we won't get wet there or something.
Mm mm.
"And then he said er, I said to him about"
I've got to get the last train home.
"He said don't worry, I have the winter timetable."
He's a train spotter.
He's got a green anorak with toggles

And
I think it's better
Don't!
Alright.

"But, he's got  he's got a a big round red face  and little eyes"
"and a moustache, and the most peculiar little  bit under"
"Bit, yes."
there.
But really it's just like
Yeah.
you know?
"And I'm just gonna say  you know, I think it would  be better if Scott didn't rush in like that, you know?"
"I can understand why he did it, to be quite honest."
"Yeah but you say to her  that they're always on about how s Shrimpy can't do anything for himself, and it's between Emma, it's not between  it was al even Scott said to me at the beginning oh it's not between me, it's nothing to do with me, it's between Emma and Scott."
Emma and Shrimpy.
Emma and Shrimpy then.
"And erm  he's been, then he rushes ahead full storm  don't he?"
Mm.
"He shouldn't have done that really, he was a bit naughty."
"He,sh she ought to learn to sh she's, they was all on about how Shrimpy can't stick up for himself, and then flaming  Emma does exactly the same but worse cos she gets Scott to do it for her."
"She's gonna have to one of these, I'm not being funny but she can't stick up for herself, that girl can't."
"It's about time she had the courage to do it, herself if she's in a strop."
"There's no point getting Scott, cos what's gonna happen when she finishes with Scott?"
She really
Oh

And where do you spend your days?
"I mean, do you  do you sort of wander round the street  jabbering to people like this?"
"No, actually"
"Number one, number two"
or number three?
Or  er number three.
I make sure I ride on every bus going and sit next to somebody who really doesn't want to sit next to me!
How do you get the money to pay for the bus fares?
I  !
"No, I just sort of accost people and talk to them and normally they pay me to go away!"
Have you ever thought of prostitution?
I'm not that bad!
Excuse me!
Are you male or female

Twenty seven from the nine  two thousand one eight.
I still think it'd be good if my bike went walk about .
Be a good way of doing it.
Get it practically sawed up and that.
Got plenty of friends who would be willing to saw it up.
"Nineteen, I don't think that's a very good idea at all!"
I do!
Saying it's broken.
I'll stretch you for it.
Oh good!
Why?
"Well, only really because of erm  as mature, as policies mature  before the er"
What do you mean they mature?
You can collect them?
Yeah.
Before
Are they pensions?
"No, no, no, no!"
"They're, they're er  and er life insurance against the mortgage."

You borrow money
Yeah.

Oh.
And he said you'll be able to go round the roundabout then I  the flaming things!
So he said you couldn't have done!
"So I sa have, so I told him what he said, and he said  well that's exactly what it says in the book!"
"I said yes, well why don't you do it?"
I said because in the bloody book there's no cars on the roundabout and I says it !
I said you bring me three o'clock
You really
in the morning I'll go round the roundabout for you when it's empty!
"Mm, that's it  innit?"
"I said but when I come here there are cars everywhere, I says on  on the picture"
there isn't a car in sight!
"He sat there and burst out laughing but he said  yeah you're right,there isn't !"
Did you tend to come on
No well    well I've started again now.

"About the, yes, this"
Yes.

Well I suppose most corruption starts at the top doesn't it?
It has to for it to be  festering at the bottom!
But erm
Good grief man!
Good Lord Ken!
You've gone to town tonight seeing all this!

"Yeah I think he, I think he's, I've explained like everything, we're just paying the money for it that is all"
Oh is that what he said?

"And it wasn't, oh God!"
And we only did it as a joke!you !
I didn't even know they were there to be quite honest.

Mm.
"up the next morning  and, cos I had that  you know, that stripy top on?"
Yeah.
"And my mum, my mum was sat in  The Weathers with me  and I'd talked to her and everything and I didn't even know that that"
Yeah.

"And like,but like, I got"
up the next morning and I just went  oh Jesus!
But there was
They were like

and
up there and the one on my back as well!
"And Scott, Scott did this and like  and erm  he goes  oh it's not that bad!"
"And I goes, oh you stupid git!"
"Why did you have to do it there for, you know?"
"Put my school shirt on, oh you won't see it!"
Oh no won't see it with that flipping big collar on my school shirt!
"Actually, you couldn't see it, but you could see it through anyway so it didn't make really that much difference."
"But like, I got the mirror down and like, I looked at it  and whether it was the light or whether it just hadn't come up cos it was only like, a few seconds afterwards"
Mm.
"I looked at it and it was just like sort of, light brown  and I thought oh that's not too bad!"
"I got home and it was like, glowing  and I'm thinking oh my God!"
"There was like, arrows pointed to it still !"
"I mean, I only had that one on my neck and I thought  and like I was  I was   !"
"Wi , with your polos on !"
Well I shouldn't think so because
Mum!

Yeah.
Mm.
I mean
"They have their, their"
I said to him we've been conned!
I said we've been stitched up!
That's how I look at it!
I was furious last week!
"Mm, so I ju , I was just trying to find, but you see, there again you're new people, we found new people last week didn't we."
Yeah.
He wasn't happy  that man.
"He bought a big caravan, he was very unhappy!"
There we are!
The way they do
"No, but these caravans"
Should you carry on?
"I don't know, is it here or over there?."
"So you see, this is only way you can  them!"
"Get to a situation where you've had a caravan before  and to make any money to pay, you've then got to  buy another caravan  to subsidise that one  and you seem to be  it's sort of"
like a chain all time.
Mm.
Yeah.
And the profit you've had from one is paying the expense of the other!
"Tha , if you're lucky!"
"Come away now , you must not stand any longer ."
Come and rest while I fetch a dish to put the flowers in till you want them ; '' and Mrs. Pecq turned her round with her small Maying safely done .
"`` I did n't think I 'd ever be able to do even so much , and here I am walking and sitting up , and going to drive some day ."
Is n't it nice that I 'm not to be a poor Lucinda after all ? ''
and Jill drew a long sigh of relief that six months instead of twenty years would probably be the end of her captivity .
"`` Yes , thank Heaven !"
"I do n't think I could have borne that ; '' and the mother took Jill in her arms as if she were a baby , holding her close for a minute , and laying her down with a tender kiss that made the arms cling about her neck as her little girl returned it heartily , for all sorts of new , sweet feelings seemed to be budding in both , born of great joy and thankfulness ."
"Then Mrs. Pecq hurried away to see about tea for the hungry boys , and Jill watched the pleasant twilight deepen as she lay singing to herself one of the songs her friend taught her because it fitted her so well ."
"`` A little bird I am , Shut from the fields of air , And in my cage I sit and sing To Him who placed me there : Well pleased a prisoner to be , Because , my God , it pleases Thee !"
"`` Naught have I else to do ; I sing the whole day long ; And He whom most I love to please Doth listen to my song , He caught and bound my wandering wing , But still He bends to hear me sing . ''"
"`` Now we are ready for you , so bring on your flowers , '' said Molly to the boys , as she and Merry added their store of baskets to the gay show Jill had set forth on the long table ready for the evening 's work ."
"`` They would n't let me see one , but I guess they have had good luck , they look so jolly , '' answered Jill , looking at Gus , Frank , and Jack , who stood laughing , each with a large basket in his hands ."
`` Fair to middling .
Just look in and see ; '' with which cheerful remark Gus tipped up his basket and displayed a few bits of green at the bottom .
`` I did better .
"Now , do n't all scream at once over these beauties ; '' and Frank shook out some evergreen sprigs , half a dozen saxifrages , and two or three forlorn violets with hardly any stems ."
"`` I do n't brag , but here 's the best of all the three , '' chuckled Jack , producing a bunch of feathery carrot-tops , with a few half-shut dandelions trying to look brave and gay ."
"`` Oh , boys , is that all ? ''"
`` What shall we do ? ''
"`` We 've only a few house-flowers , and all those baskets to fill , '' cried the girls , in despair ; for Merry 's contribution had been small , and Molly had only a handful of artificial flowers `` to fill up , '' she said ."
`` It is n't our fault : it is the late spring .
"We ca n't make flowers , can we ? ''"
"asked Frank , in a tone of calm resignation ."
"`` Could n't you buy some , then ? ''"
"said Molly , smoothing her crumpled morning-glories , with a sigh ."
`` Who ever heard of a fellow having any money left the last day of the month ? ''
"demanded Gus , severely ."
`` Or girls either .
"I spent all mine in ribbon and paper for my baskets , and now they are of no use ."
It 's a shame ! ''
"lamented Jill , while Merry began to thin out her full baskets to fill the empty ones ."
`` Hold on ! ''
Something about the firm outlines of Anne 's lips told that Mrs. Rachel was not far astray in this estimate .
Anne 's heart was bent on forming the Improvement Society .
"Gilbert Blythe , who was to teach in White Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning , was enthusiastic about it ; and most of the other folks were willing to go in for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some `` fun . ''"
"As for what the `` improvements '' were to be , nobody had any very clear idea except Anne and Gilbert ."
"They had talked them over and planned them out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds , if nowhere else ."
Mrs. Rachel had still another item of news .
`` They 've given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant .
"Did n't you go to Queen 's with a girl of that name , Anne ? ''"
"`` Yes , indeed ."
Priscilla to teach at Carmody !
How perfectly lovely ! ''
"exclaimed Anne , her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars , causing Mrs. Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty girl or not ."
II Selling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took Diana Barry with her .
"Diana was , of course , a pledged member of the Improvement Society , and the two girls talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back ."
"`` The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted , '' said Diana , as they drove past the Avonlea hall , a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow , with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides ."
`` It 's a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his house down .
Father says we 'll never succeed in DOING that .
Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take . ''
"`` Perhaps he 'll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood , '' said Anne hopefully ."
`` We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first .
We ca n't expect to improve everything all at once .
"We 'll have to educate public sentiment first , of course . ''"
Diana was n't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant ; but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view .
"`` I thought of something last night that we could do , Anne ."
You know that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet ?
"It 's all grown over with young spruce ; but would n't it be nice to have them all cleared out , and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it ? ''"
"`` Splendid , '' agreed Anne gaily ."
`` And have a rustic seat put under the birches .
And when spring comes we 'll have a flower-bed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums . ''
"`` Yes ; only we 'll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram Sloane to keep her cow off the road , or she 'll eat our geraniums up , '' laughed Diana ."
"`` I begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment , Anne ."
There 's the old Boulter house now .
"I believe in Him now -- I have to -- there 's nothing else to fall back on but God -- humbly , starkly , unconditionally . '' ''"
"` Our help in ages past ' -- ` the same yesterday , to-day and for ever , ' '' said the minister gently ."
`` When we forget God -- He remembers us . ''
There was no crowd at the Glen Station the next morning to see Walter off .
It was becoming a commonplace for a khaki clad boy to board that early morning train after his last leave .
"Besides his own , only the Manse folk were there , and Mary Vance ."
"Mary had sent her Miller off the week before , with a determined grin , and now considered herself entitled to give expert opinion on how such partings should be conducted ."
"`` The main thing is to smile and act as if nothing was happening , '' she informed the Ingleside group ."
`` The boys all hate the sob act like poison .
Miller told me I was n't to come near the station if I could n't keep from bawling .
"So I got through with my crying beforehand , and at the last I said to him , ` Good luck , Miller , and if you come back you 'll find I have n't changed any , and if you do n't come back I 'll always be proud you went , and in any case do n't fall in love with a French girl . '"
"Miller swore he would n't , but you never can tell about those fascinating foreign hussies ."
"Anyhow , the last sight he had of me I was smiling to my limit ."
"Gee , all the rest of the day my face felt as if it had been starched and ironed into a smile . ''"
"In spite of Mary 's advice and example Mrs. Blythe , who had sent Jem off with a smile , could not quite manage one for Walter ."
But at least no one cried .
"Dog Monday came out of his lair in the shipping-shed and sat down close to Walter , thumping his tail vigorously on the boards of the platform whenever Walter spoke to him , and looking up with confident eyes , as if to say , `` I know you 'll find Jem and bring him back to me . ''"
"`` So long , old fellow , '' said Carl Meredith cheerfully , when the good-byes had to be said ."
`` Tell them over there to keep their spirits up -- I am coming along presently . ''
"`` Me too , '' said Shirley laconically , proffering a brown paw ."
Susan heard him and her face turned very grey .
"Una shook hands quietly , looking at him with wistful , sorrowful , dark-blue eyes ."
But then Una 's eyes had always been wistful .
"Walter bent his handsome black head in its khaki cap and kissed her with the warm , comradely kiss of a brother ."
"He had never kissed her before , and for a fleeting moment Una 's face betrayed her , if anyone had noticed ."
But nobody did ; the conductor was shouting `` all aboard '' ; everybody was trying to look very cheerful .
Walter turned to Rilla ; she held his hands and looked up at him .
She would not see him again until the day broke and the shadows vanished -- and she knew not if that daybreak would be on this side of the grave or beyond it .
"`` Good-bye , '' she said ."
On her lips it lost all the bitterness it had won through the ages of parting and bore instead all the sweetness of the old loves of all the women who had ever loved and prayed for the beloved .
"`` Write me often and bring Jims up faithfully , according to the gospel of Morgan , '' Walter said lightly , having said all his serious things the night before in Rainbow Valley ."
But at the last moment he took her face between his hands and looked deep into her gallant eyes .
Danger !
"` Are you sure , Wendy ? '"
` Oh yes . '
Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window .
It was securely fastened .
"She looked out , and the night was peppered with stars ."
"They were crowding round the house , as if curious to see what was to take place there , but she did not notice this , nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her ."
"Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry , ` Oh , how I wish that I was n't going to a party to-night ! '"
"Even Michael , already half asleep , knew that she was perturbed , and he asked , ` Can anything harm us , mother , after the night-lights are lit ? '"
"` Nothing , precious , ' she said ; ` they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children . '"
"She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them , and little Michael flung his arms round her ."
"` Mother , ' he cried , ` I 'm glad of you . '"
They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time .
"-LSB- Illustration : PETER FLEW IN -RSB- No. 27 was only a few yards distant , but there had been a slight fall of snow , and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes ."
"They were already the only persons in the street , and all the stars were watching them ."
"Stars are beautiful , but they may not take an active part in anything , they must just look on for ever ."
It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was .
"So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak -LRB- winking is the star language -RRB- , but the little ones still wonder ."
"They are not really friendly to Peter , who has a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out ; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night , and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way ."
"So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament , and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out : ` Now , Peter ! '"
"CHAPTER III COME AWAY , COME AWAY !"
For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly .
"They were awfully nice little night-lights , and one can not help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter ; but Wendy 's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also , and before they could close their mouths all the three went out ."
"There was another light in the room now , a thousand times brighter than the night-lights , and in the time we have taken to say this , it has been in all the drawers in the nursery , looking for Peter 's shadow , rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out ."
"It was not really a light ; it made this light by flashing about so quickly , but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy , no longer than your hand , but still growing ."
"It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf , cut low and square , through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage ."
She was slightly inclined to embonpoint .
"A moment after the fairy 's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars , and Peter dropped in ."
"He had carried Tinker Bell part of the way , and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust ."
"` Tinker Bell , ' he called softly , after making sure that the children were asleep , ` Tink , where are you ? '"
"She was in a jug for the moment , and liking it extremely ; she had never been in a jug before ."
"` Oh , do come out of that jug , and tell me , do you know where they put my shadow ? '"
We shall all go .
Selden was a man of his hands ; he was like a brother to me .
"Well , he has gone second ; well , we shall all follow !"
For what said their knave rhyme ?
-- ' A black arrow in each black heart . '
Was it not so it went ?
"Appleyard , Selden , Smith , old Humphrey gone ; and there lieth poor John Carter , crying , poor sinner , for the priest . ''"
Dick gave ear .
"Out of a low window , hard by where they were talking , groans and murmurs came to his ear ."
`` Lieth he there ? ''
he asked .
"`` Ay , in the second porter 's chamber , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` We could not bear him further , soul and body were so bitterly at odds ."
"At every step we lifted him , he thought to wend ."
"But now , methinks , it is the soul that suffereth ."
"Ever for the priest he crieth , and Sir Oliver , I wot not why , still cometh not ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' he said , `` here is a right intricate affair , the which , with your good leave , it shall be mine to examine and adjust ."
"Content ye , then ; your business is in careful hands ; justice shall be done you ; and in the meanwhile , get ye incontinently home , and have your hurts attended ."
"The air is shrewd , and I would not ye took cold upon these scratches . ''"
"He made a sign with his hand ; it was passed down the nave by obsequious servants , who waited there upon his smallest gesture ."
"Instantly , without the church , a tucket sounded shrill , and through the open portal archers and men-at-arms , uniformly arrayed in the colours and wearing the badge of Lord Risingham , began to file into the church , took Dick and Lawless from those who still detained them , and , closing their files about the prisoners , marched forth again and disappeared ."
"As they were passing , Joanna held both her hands to Dick and cried him her farewell ; and the bridesmaid , nothing downcast by her uncle 's evident displeasure , blew him a kiss , with a `` Keep your heart up , lion-driver ! ''"
that for the first time since the accident called up a smile to the faces of the crowd .
"CHAPTER V -- EARL RISINGHAM Earl Risingham , although by far the most important person then in Shoreby , was poorly lodged in the house of a private gentleman upon the extreme outskirts of the town ."
"Nothing but the armed men at the doors , and the mounted messengers that kept arriving and departing , announced the temporary residence of a great lord ."
"Thus it was that , from lack of space , Dick and Lawless were clapped into the same apartment ."
"`` Well spoken , Master Richard , '' said the outlaw ; `` it was excellently well spoken , and , for my part , I thank you cordially ."
"Here we are in good hands ; we shall be justly tried , and , some time this evening , decently hanged on the same tree . ''"
"`` Indeed , my poor friend , I do believe it , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Yet have we a string to our bow , '' returned Lawless ."
"`` Ellis Duckworth is a man out of ten thousand ; he holdeth you right near his heart , both for your own and for your father 's sake ; and knowing you guiltless of this fact , he will stir earth and heaven to bear you clear . ''"
"`` It may not be , '' said Dick ."
"`` James must have tint his wits , '' said Alan ."
"`` If this was the soldiers instead of you and me , he would be in a bonny mess ."
"But I dare say he 'll have a sentry on the road , and he would ken well enough no soldiers would find the way that we came . ''"
"Hereupon he whistled three times , in a particular manner ."
"It was strange to see how , at the first sound of it , all the moving torches came to a stand , as if the bearers were affrighted ; and how , at the third , the bustle began again as before ."
"Having thus set folks ' minds at rest , we came down the brae , and were met at the yard gate -LRB- for this place was like a well-doing farm -RRB- by a tall , handsome man of more than fifty , who cried out to Alan in the Gaelic ."
"`` James Stewart , '' said Alan , `` I will ask ye to speak in Scotch , for here is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other ."
"This is him , '' he added , putting his arm through mine , `` a young gentleman of the Lowlands , and a laird in his country too , but I am thinking it will be the better for his health if we give his name the go-by . ''"
"James of the Glens turned to me for a moment , and greeted me courteously enough ; the next he had turned to Alan ."
"`` This has been a dreadful accident , '' he cried ."
`` It will bring trouble on the country . ''
And he wrung his hands .
`` Hoots ! ''
"said Alan , `` ye must take the sour with the sweet , man ."
"Colin Roy is dead , and be thankful for that ! ''"
"`` Ay '' said James , `` and by my troth , I wish he was alive again !"
"It 's all very fine to blow and boast beforehand ; but now it 's done , Alan ; and who 's to bear the wyte * of it ?"
"The accident fell out in Appin -- mind ye that , Alan ; it 's Appin that must pay ; and I am a man that has a family . ''"
* Blame .
While this was going on I looked about me at the servants .
"Some were on ladders , digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings , from which they brought out guns , swords , and different weapons of war ; others carried them away ; and by the sound of mattock blows from somewhere farther down the brae , I suppose they buried them ."
"Though they were all so busy , there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts ; men struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their burning torches ; and James was continually turning about from his talk with Alan , to cry out orders which were apparently never understood ."
"The faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry and panic ; and though none spoke above his breath , their speech sounded both anxious and angry ."
It was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying a pack or bundle ; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan 's instinct awoke at the mere sight of it .
`` What 's that the lassie has ? ''
he asked .
"`` We 're just setting the house in order , Alan , '' said James , in his frightened and somewhat fawning way ."
"`` They 'll search Appin with candles , and we must have all things straight ."
"We 're digging the bit guns and swords into the moss , ye see ; and these , I am thinking , will be your ain French clothes ."
"We 'll be to bury them , I believe . ''"
`` Bury my French clothes ! ''
cried Alan .
"I helped her walk up through the maple grove and up to her room , and then she said , ` Rob -- is -- living , ' as if the words were torn out of her , and flung herself on her bed and cried and cried and cried ."
I never saw anyone cry so before .
All the tears that she had n't shed all that week came then .
"She cried most of last night , I think , but her face this morning looked as if she had seen a vision of some kind , and we were all so happy that we were almost afraid ."
`` Di and Nan are home for a couple of weeks .
Then they go back to Red Cross work in the training camp at Kingsport .
I envy them .
"Father says I 'm doing just as good work here , with Jims and my Junior Reds ."
But it lacks the romance theirs must have .
`` Kut has fallen .
"It was almost a relief when it did fall , we had been dreading it so long ."
It crushed us flat for a day and then we picked up and put it behind us .
Cousin Sophia was as gloomy as usual and came over and groaned that the British were losing everywhere . ''
"` They 're good losers , ' said Susan grimly ."
` When they lose a thing they keep on looking till they find it again !
"Anyhow , my king and country need me now to cut potato sets for the back garden , so get you a knife and help me , Sophia Crawford ."
It will divert your thoughts and keep you from worrying over a campaign that you are not called upon to run . '
"`` Susan is an old brick , and the way she flattens out poor Cousin Sophia is beautiful to behold ."
"`` As for Verdun , the battle goes on and on , and we see-saw between hope and fear ."
But I know that strange dream of Miss Oliver 's foretold the victory of France .
` They shall not pass . ' ''
"CHAPTER XX NORMAN DOUGLAS SPEAKS OUT IN MEETING `` Where are you wandering , Anne o ' mine ? ''"
"asked the doctor , who even yet , after twenty-four years of marriage , occasionally addressed his wife thus when nobody was about ."
"Anne was sitting on the veranda steps , gazing absently over the wonderful bridal world of spring blossom , Beyond the white orchard was a copse of dark young firs and creamy wild cherries , where the robins were whistling madly ; for it was evening and the fire of early stars was burning over the maple grove ."
Anne came back with a little sigh .
"`` I was just taking relief from intolerable realities in a dream , Gilbert -- a dream that all our children were home again -- and all small again -- playing in Rainbow Valley ."
"It is always so silent now -- but I was imagining I heard clear voices and gay , childish sounds coming up as I used to ."
"I could hear Jem 's whistle and Walter 's yodel , and the twins ' laughter , and for just a few blessed minutes I forgot about the guns on the Western front , and had a little false , sweet happiness . ''"
The doctor did not answer .
"Sometimes his work tricked him into forgetting for a few moments the Western front , but not often ."
There was a good deal of grey now in his still thick curls that had not been there two years ago .
"Yet he smiled down into the starry eyes he loved -- the eyes that had once been so full of laughter , and now seemed always full of unshed tears ."
"Thereupon he fell in a muse , looking in the embers of the fire ; and presently , getting a piece of wood , he fashioned it in a cross , the four ends of which he blackened on the coals ."
Then he looked at me a little shyly .
`` Could ye lend me my button ? ''
says he .
"`` It seems a strange thing to ask a gift again , but I own I am laith to cut another . ''"
"I gave him the button ; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his great-coat which he had used to bind the cross ; and tying in a little sprig of birch and another of fir , he looked upon his work with satisfaction ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there is a little clachan '' -LRB- what is called a hamlet in the English -RRB- `` not very far from Corrynakiegh , and it has the name of Koalisnacoan ."
"There there are living many friends of mine whom I could trust with my life , and some that I am no just so sure of ."
"Ye see , David , there will be money set upon our heads ; James himsel ' is to set money on them ; and as for the Campbells , they would never spare siller where there was a Stewart to be hurt ."
"If it was otherwise , I would go down to Koalisnacoan whatever , and trust my life into these people 's hands as lightly as I would trust another with my glove . ''"
`` But being so ? ''
"said I. `` Being so , '' said he , `` I would as lief they didnae see me ."
"There 's bad folk everywhere , and what 's far worse , weak ones ."
"So when it comes dark again , I will steal down into that clachan , and set this that I have been making in the window of a good friend of mine , John Breck Maccoll , a bouman * of Appin 's . ''"
* A bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and shares with him the increase .
"`` With all my heart , '' says I ; `` and if he finds it , what is he to think ? ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` I wish he was a man of more penetration , for by my troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it !"
But this is what I have in my mind .
"This cross is something in the nature of the crosstarrie , or fiery cross , which is the signal of gathering in our clans ; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise , for there it is standing in his window , and no word with it ."
"So he will say to himsel ' , THE CLAN IS NOT TO RISE , BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ."
"Then he will see my button , and that was Duncan Stewart 's ."
"And then he will say to himsel ' , THE SON OF DUNCAN IS IN THE HEATHER , AND HAS NEED OF ME . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` it may be ."
"But even supposing so , there is a good deal of heather between here and the Forth . ''"
"`` And that is a very true word , '' says Alan ."
"`` But then John Breck will see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine ; and he will say to himsel ' -LRB- if he is a man of any penetration at all , which I misdoubt -RRB- , ALAN WILL BE LYING IN A WOOD WHICH IS BOTH OF PINES AND BIRCHES ."
"Then he will think to himsel ' , THAT IS NOT SO VERY RIFE HEREABOUT ; and then he will come and give us a look up in Corrynakiegh ."
"And if he does not , David , the devil may fly away with him , for what I care ; for he will no be worth the salt to his porridge . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' said I , drolling with him a little , `` you 're very ingenious !"
But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black and white ? ''
"`` And that is an excellent observe , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , '' says Alan , drolling with me ; `` and it would certainly be much simpler for me to write to him , but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it ."
He would have to go to the school for two-three years ; and it 's possible we might be wearied waiting on him . ''
"`` This morning , '' he said , `` I was somewhat jealous of your favour ; it hath not been of a long growth ; and now , Sir Richard , it is with a very good heart that I offer you this horse -- to ride away with . ''"
"`` Suffer me yet a moment , '' replied Dick ."
`` This favour of mine -- whereupon was it founded ? ''
"`` Upon your name , '' answered Catesby ."
`` It is my lord 's chief superstition .
"Were my name Richard , I should be an earl to-morrow . ''"
"`` Well , sir , I thank you , '' returned Dick ; `` and since I am little likely to follow these great fortunes , I will even say farewell ."
"I will not pretend I was displeased to think myself upon the road to fortune ; but I will not pretend , neither , that I am over-sorry to be done with it ."
"Command and riches , they are brave things , to be sure ; but a word in your ear -- yon duke of yours , he is a fearsome lad . ''"
Catesby laughed .
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` of a verity he that rides with Crooked Dick will ride deep ."
"Well , God keep us all from evil !"
Speed ye well . ''
"Thereupon Dick put himself at the head of his men , and giving the word of command , rode off ."
"He made straight across the town , following what he supposed to be the route of Sir Daniel , and spying around for any signs that might decide if he were right ."
"The streets were strewn with the dead and the wounded , whose fate , in the bitter frost , was far the more pitiable ."
"Gangs of the victors went from house to house , pillaging and stabbing , and sometimes singing together as they went ."
"From different quarters , as he rode on , the sounds of violence and outrage came to young Shelton 's ears ; now the blows of the sledge-hammer on some barricaded door , and now the miserable shrieks of women ."
Dick 's heart had just been awakened .
He had just seen the cruel consequences of his own behaviour ; and the thought of the sum of misery that was now acting in the whole of Shoreby filled him with despair .
"At length he reached the outskirts , and there , sure enough , he saw straight before him the same broad , beaten track across the snow that he had marked from the summit of the church ."
"Here , then , he went the faster on ; but still , as he rode , he kept a bright eye upon the fallen men and horses that lay beside the track ."
"Many of these , he was relieved to see , wore Sir Daniel 's colours , and the faces of some , who lay upon their back , he even recognised ."
"About half-way between the town and the forest , those whom he was following had plainly been assailed by archers ; for the corpses lay pretty closely scattered , each pierced by an arrow ."
"And here Dick spied among the rest the body of a very young lad , whose face was somehow hauntingly familiar to him ."
"He halted his troop , dismounted , and raised the lad 's head ."
"As he did so , the hood fell back , and a profusion of long brown hair unrolled itself ."
At the same time the eyes opened .
`` Ah !
lion driver ! ''
said a feeble voice .
`` She is farther on .
Father and mother went up to Avonlea .
"Father thought the change would do mother good , and they wanted to see poor Aunt Diana , whose son Jock had been seriously wounded a short time before ."
"They left Susan and me to keep house , and father expected to be back the next day ."
But he never got back for a week .
"That night it began to storm again , and it stormed unbrokenly for four days ."
It was the worst and longest storm that Prince Edward Island has known for years .
"Everything was disorganized -- the roads were completely choked up , the trains blockaded , and the telephone wires put entirely out of commission ."
`` And then Jims took ill .
"`` He had a little cold when father and mother went away , and he kept getting worse for a couple of days , but it did n't occur to me that there was danger of anything serious ."
"I never even took his temperature , and I ca n't forgive myself , because it was sheer carelessness ."
The truth is I had slumped just then .
"Mother was away , so I let myself go ."
"All at once I was tired of keeping up and pretending to be brave and cheerful , and I just gave up for a few days and spent most of the time lying on my face on my bed , crying ."
I neglected Jims -- that is the hateful truth -- I was cowardly and false to what I promised Walter -- and if Jims had died I could never have forgiven myself .
"`` Then , the third night after father and mother went away , Jims suddenly got worse -- oh , so much worse -- all at once ."
Susan and I were all alone .
Gertrude had been at Lowbridge when the storm began and had never got back .
At first we were not much alarmed .
Jims has had several bouts of croup and Susan and Morgan and I have always brought him through without much trouble .
But it was n't very long before we were dreadfully alarmed . '' '
"I never saw croup like this before , ' said Susan ."
"`` As for me , I knew , when it was too late , what kind of croup it was ."
I knew it was not the ordinary croup -- ` false croup ' as doctors call it -- but the ` true croup ' -- and I knew that it was a deadly and dangerous thing .
And father was away and there was no doctor nearer than Lowbridge -- and we could not ` phone and neither horse nor man could get through the drifts that night .
"`` Gallant little Jims put up a good fight for his life , -- Susan and I tried every remedy we could think of or find in father 's books , but he continued to grow worse ."
It was heart-rending to see and hear him .
"He gasped so horribly for breath -- the poor little soul -- and his face turned a dreadful bluish colour and had such an agonized expression , and he kept struggling with his little hands , as if he were appealing to us to help him somehow ."
"I found myself thinking that the boys who had been gassed at the front must have looked like that , and the thought haunted me amid all my dread and misery over Jims ."
And all the time the fatal membrane in his wee throat grew and thickened and he could n't get it up .
"`` Oh , I was just wild !"
I never realized how dear Jims was to me until that moment .
And I felt so utterly helpless . ''
"The sheriff 's officer had run back at the first sound of the shot , to hasten the coming of the soldiers ."
"At last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road , and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger ."
"I believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses ; for he had no sooner done so than I began to scramble up the hill , crying out , `` The murderer !"
the murderer ! ''
"So little a time had elapsed , that when I got to the top of the first steepness , and could see some part of the open mountain , the murderer was still moving away at no great distance ."
"He was a big man , in a black coat , with metal buttons , and carried a long fowling-piece ."
`` Here ! ''
I cried .
`` I see him ! ''
"At that the murderer gave a little , quick look over his shoulder , and began to run ."
"The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches ; then he came out again on the upper side , where I could see him climbing like a jackanapes , for that part was again very steep ; and then he dipped behind a shoulder , and I saw him no more ."
"All this time I had been running on my side , and had got a good way up , when a voice cried upon me to stand ."
"I was at the edge of the upper wood , and so now , when I halted and looked back , I saw all the open part of the hill below me ."
"The lawyer and the sheriff 's officer were standing just above the road , crying and waving on me to come back ; and on their left , the red-coats , musket in hand , were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood ."
`` Why should I come back ? ''
I cried .
`` Come you on ! ''
`` Ten pounds if ye take that lad ! ''
cried the lawyer .
`` He 's an accomplice .
He was posted here to hold us in talk . ''
"At that word -LRB- which I could hear quite plainly , though it was to the soldiers and not to me that he was crying it -RRB- my heart came in my mouth with quite a new kind of terror ."
"Indeed , it is one thing to stand the danger of your life , and quite another to run the peril of both life and character ."
"The thing , besides , had come so suddenly , like thunder out of a clear sky , that I was all amazed and helpless ."
"The soldiers began to spread , some of them to run , and others to put up their pieces and cover me ; and still I stood ."
"`` Jock * in here among the trees , '' said a voice close by ."
* Duck .
"Indeed , I scarce knew what I was doing , but I obeyed ; and as I did so , I heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches ."
"Just inside the shelter of the trees I found Alan Breck standing , with a fishing-rod ."
He gave me no salutation ; indeed it was no time for civilities ; only `` Come ! ''
"says he , and set off running along the side of the mountain towards Balachulish ; and I , like a sheep , to follow him ."
Now we ran among the birches ; now stooping behind low humps upon the mountain-side ; now crawling on all fours among the heather .
"Look at the four of them , Wendy and Michael over there , John here , and Mrs. Darling by the fire ."
There should have been a fourth night-light .
While she slept she had a dream .
She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it .
"He did not alarm her , for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children ."
Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also .
"But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland , and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap ."
"The dream by itself would have been a trifle , but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open , and a boy did drop on the floor ."
"He was accompanied by a strange light , no bigger than your fist , which darted about the room like a living thing ; and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling ."
"She started up with a cry , and saw the boy , and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan ."
If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling 's kiss .
"He was a lovely boy , clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees ; but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth ."
"When he saw she was a grown-up , he gnashed the little pearls at her ."
"CHAPTER II THE SHADOW Mrs. Darling screamed , and , as if in answer to a bell , the door opened , and Nana entered , returned from her evening out ."
"She growled and sprang at the boy , who leapt lightly through the window ."
"Again Mrs. Darling screamed , this time in distress for him , for she thought he was killed , and she ran down into the street to look for his little body , but it was not there ; and she looked up , and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star ."
"She returned to the nursery , and found Nana with something in her mouth , which proved to be the boy 's shadow ."
"As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly , too late to catch him , but his shadow had not had time to get out ; slam went the window and snapped it off ."
"You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully , but it was quite the ordinary kind ."
Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow .
"She hung it out at the window , meaning ` He is sure to come back for it ; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children . '"
But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window ; it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house .
"She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling , but he was totting up winter greatcoats for John and Michael , with a wet towel round his head to keep his brain clear , and it seemed a shame to trouble him ; besides , she knew exactly what he would say : ` It all comes of having a dog for a nurse . '"
"She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer , until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband ."
Ah me !
"The opportunity came a week later , on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday ."
Of course it was a Friday . '
"I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday , ' she used to say afterwards to her husband , while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her , holding her hand ."
"` No , no , ' Mr. Darling always said , ' I am responsible for it all ."
"I , George Darling , did it ."
"Mea culpa , mea culpa ."
' He had had a classical education .
Take me in straight or I 'll break your arm . ''
"And he gave it , as he spoke , a wrench that made me cry out ."
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` it is for yourself I mean ."
The captain is not what he used to be .
He sits with a drawn cutlass .
"Another gentleman -- '' `` Come , now , march , '' interrupted he ; and I never heard a voice so cruel , and cold , and ugly as that blind man 's ."
"It cowed me more than the pain , and I began to obey him at once , walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour , where our sick old buccaneer was sitting , dazed with rum ."
"The blind man clung close to me , holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry ."
"`` Lead me straight up to him , and when I 'm in view , cry out , ` Here 's a friend for you , Bill . '"
"If you do n't , I 'll do this , '' and with that he gave me a twitch that I thought would have made me faint ."
"Between this and that , I was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of the captain , and as I opened the parlour door , cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice ."
"The poor captain raised his eyes , and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober ."
The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness .
"He made a movement to rise , but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body ."
"`` Now , Bill , sit where you are , '' said the beggar ."
"`` If I ca n't see , I can hear a finger stirring ."
Business is business .
Hold out your left hand .
"Boy , take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right . ''"
"We both obeyed him to the letter , and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain 's , which closed upon it instantly ."
"`` And now that 's done , '' said the blind man ; and at the words he suddenly left hold of me , and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness , skipped out of the parlour and into the road , where , as I still stood motionless , I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance ."
"It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our senses , but at length , and about at the same moment , I released his wrist , which I was still holding , and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm ."
`` Ten o'clock ! ''
he cried .
`` Six hours .
"We 'll do them yet , '' and he sprang to his feet ."
"Even as he did so , he reeled , put his hand to his throat , stood swaying for a moment , and then , with a peculiar sound , fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor ."
"I ran to him at once , calling to my mother ."
But haste was all in vain .
The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy .
"It is a curious thing to understand , for I had certainly never liked the man , though of late I had begun to pity him , but as soon as I saw that he was dead , I burst into a flood of tears ."
"It was the second death I had known , and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart ."
"And then there was water there , and water 's a thing that dauntons even me ."
"No , no , '' said Alan , `` it 's no you that 's to blame , it 's me . ''"
I asked him why .
"`` Why , '' said he , `` I have proved myself a gomeral this night ."
"For first of all I take a wrong road , and that in my own country of Appin ; so that the day has caught us where we should never have been ; and thanks to that , we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort ."
"And next -LRB- which is the worst of the two , for a man that has been so much among the heather as myself -RRB- I have come wanting a water-bottle , and here we lie for a long summer 's day with naething but neat spirit ."
"Ye may think that a small matter ; but before it comes night , David , ye 'll give me news of it . ''"
"I was anxious to redeem my character , and offered , if he would pour out the brandy , to run down and fill the bottle at the river ."
"`` I wouldnae waste the good spirit either , '' says he ."
"`` It 's been a good friend to you this night ; or in my poor opinion , ye would still be cocking on yon stone ."
"And what 's mair , '' says he , `` ye may have observed -LRB- you that 's a man of so much penetration -RRB- that Alan Breck Stewart was perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar ' . ''"
`` You ! ''
"I cried , `` you were running fit to burst . ''"
`` Was I so ? ''
said he .
"`` Well , then , ye may depend upon it , there was nae time to be lost ."
"And now here is enough said ; gang you to your sleep , lad , and I 'll watch . ''"
"Accordingly , I lay down to sleep ; a little peaty earth had drifted in between the top of the two rocks , and some bracken grew there , to be a bed to me ; the last thing I heard was still the crying of the eagles ."
"I dare say it would be nine in the morning when I was roughly awakened , and found Alan 's hand pressed upon my mouth ."
`` Wheesht ! ''
he whispered .
`` Ye were snoring . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , surprised at his anxious and dark face , `` and why not ? ''"
"He peered over the edge of the rock , and signed to me to do the like ."
"It was now high day , cloudless , and very hot ."
The valley was as clear as in a picture .
"About half a mile up the water was a camp of red-coats ; a big fire blazed in their midst , at which some were cooking ; and near by , on the top of a rock about as high as ours , there stood a sentry , with the sun sparkling on his arms ."
"All the way down along the river-side were posted other sentries ; here near together , there widelier scattered ; some planted like the first , on places of command , some on the ground level and marching and counter-marching , so as to meet half-way ."
"Higher up the glen , where the ground was more open , the chain of posts was continued by horse-soldiers , whom we could see in the distance riding to and fro ."
"Lower down , the infantry continued ; but as the stream was suddenly swelled by the confluence of a considerable burn , they were more widely set , and only watched the fords and stepping-stones ."
"I took but one look at them , and ducked again into my place ."
"It was strange indeed to see this valley , which had lain so solitary in the hour of dawn , bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and breeches ."
"`` Why , I am not running Rilla down , '' said Irene , opening her eyes widely ."
`` It was only her lack of feeling I was criticizing .
I suppose she ca n't help it .
"Of course , she 's a born manager -- everyone knows that ."
"She 's very fond of managing , too -- and people like that are very necessary I admit ."
"So do n't look at me as if I 'd said something perfectly dreadful , Betty , please ."
"I 'm quite willing to agree that Rilla Blythe is the embodiment of all the virtues , if that will please you ."
And no doubt it is a virtue to be quite unmoved by things that would crush most people . ''
Some of Irene 's remarks were reported to Rilla ; but they did not hurt her as they would once have done .
"They did n't matter , that was all ."
Life was too big to leave room for pettiness .
She had a pact to keep and a work to do ; and through the long hard days and weeks of that disastrous autumn she was faithful to her task .
"The war news was consistently bad , for Germany marched from victory to victory over poor Rumania ."
"`` Foreigners -- foreigners , '' Susan muttered dubiously ."
"`` Russians or Rumanians or whatever they may be , they are foreigners and you can not tie to them ."
But after Verdun I shall not give up hope .
"And can you tell me , Mrs. Dr. dear , if the Dobruja is a river or a mountain range , or a condition of the atmosphere ? ''"
"The Presidential election in the United States came off in November , and Susan was red-hot over that -- and quite apologetic for her excitement ."
"`` I never thought I would live to see the day when I would be interested in a Yankee election , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
"It only goes to show we can never know what we will come to in this world , and therefore we should not be proud . ''"
"Susan stayed up late on the evening of the eleventh , ostensibly to finish a pair of socks ."
"But she ` phoned down to Carter Flagg 's store at intervals , and when the first report came through that Hughes had been elected she stalked solemnly upstairs to Mrs. Blythe 's room and announced it in a thrilling whisper from the foot of the bed ."
`` I thought if you were not asleep you would be interested in knowing it .
I believe it is for the best .
"Perhaps he will just fall to writing notes , too , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I hope for better things ."
"I never was very partial to whiskers , but one can not have everything . ''"
"When news came in the morning that after all Wilson was re-elected , Susan tacked to catch another breeze of optimism ."
"`` Well , better a fool you know than a fool you do not know , as the old proverb has it , '' she remarked cheerfully ."
"`` Not that I hold Woodrow to be a fool by any means , though by times you would not think he has the sense he was born with ."
"But he is a good letter writer at least , and we do not know if the Hughes man is even that ."
All things being considered I commend the Yankees .
They have shown good sense and I do not mind admitting it .
"People thought the eager , enthusiastic little band who had worked so hard for their object had been badly used ."
Mrs. Lynde told them to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them .
"Mr. Major Spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense ; and Mrs. Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the `` Sassiety '' wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they need n't be afraid of her cow , for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds ."
"Even Mr. Harrison chuckled , if he chuckled at all , in private , and was all sympathy outwardly ."
"`` Never mind , Anne ."
"Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with , so it 's bound to fade prettier ."
And the roof is shingled and painted all right .
Folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on .
You 've accomplished so much anyhow . ''
"`` But Avonlea 's blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring settlements from this time out , '' said Anne bitterly ."
And it must be confessed that it was .
"X Davy in Search of a Sensation Anne , walking home from school through the Birch Path one November afternoon , felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing ."
The day had been a good day ; all had gone well in her little kingdom .
St. Clair Donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question of his name ; Prillie Rogerson 's face had been so puffed up from the effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the boys in her vicinity .
Barbara Shaw had met with only ONE accident ... spilling a dipper of water over the floor ... and Anthony Pye had not been in school at all .
`` What a nice month this November has been ! ''
"said Anne , who had never quite got over her childish habit of talking to herself ."
`` November is usually such a disagreeable month ... as if the year had suddenly found out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over it .
This year is growing old gracefully ... just like a stately old lady who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles .
We 've had lovely days and delicious twilights .
"This last fortnight has been so peaceful , and even Davy has been almost well-behaved ."
I really think he is improving a great deal .
How quiet the woods are today ... not a murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops !
It sounds like surf on a faraway shore .
How dear the woods are !
You beautiful trees !
I love every one of you as a friend . ''
Anne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its cream-white trunk .
"Diana , rounding a curve in the path , saw her and laughed ."
"`` Anne Shirley , you 're only pretending to be grown up ."
I believe when you 're alone you 're as much a little girl as you ever were . ''
"`` Well , one ca n't get over the habit of being a little girl all at once , '' said Anne gaily ."
"`` If he had been well spanked in his younger days he might have more sense now , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` But I suppose princes are never spanked , more is the pity ."
I see the Allies have sent him an ultimatum .
I could tell them that it will take more than ultimatums to skin a snake like Constantine .
"Perhaps the Allied blockade will hammer sense into his head ; but that will take some time I am thinking , and in the meantime what is to become of poor Serbia ? ''"
"They saw what became of Serbia , and during the process Susan was hardly to be lived with ."
"In her exasperation she abused everything and everybody except Kitchener , and she fell upon poor President Wilson tooth and claw ."
"`` If he had done his duty and gone into the war long ago we should not have seen this mess in Serbia , '' she avowed ."
"`` It would be a serious thing to plunge a great country like the United States , with its mixed population , into the war , Susan , '' said the doctor , who sometimes came to the defence of the President , not because he thought Wilson needed it especially , but from an unholy love of baiting Susan ."
"`` Maybe , doctor dear -- maybe !"
But that makes me think of the old story of the girl who told her grandmother she was going to be married .
"` It is a solemn thing to be married , ' said the old lady ."
"` Yes , but it is a solemner thing not to be , ' said the girl ."
"And I can testify to that out of my own experience , doctor dear ."
And I think it is a solemner thing for the Yankees that they have kept out of the war than it would have been if they had gone into it .
"However , though I do not know much about them , I am of the opinion that we will see them starting something yet , Woodrow Wilson or no Woodrow Wilson , when they get it into their heads that this war is not a correspondence school ."
"They will not , '' said Susan , energetically waving a saucepan with one hand and a soup ladle with the other , `` be too proud to fight then . ''"
"On a pale-yellow , windy evening in October Carl Meredith went away ."
He had enlisted on his eighteenth birthday .
John Meredith saw him off with a set face .
His two boys were gone -- there was only little Bruce left now .
He loved Bruce and Bruce 's mother dearly ; but Jerry and Carl were the sons of the bride of his youth and Carl was the only one of all his children who had Cecilia 's very eyes .
As they looked lovingly out at him above Carl 's uniform the pale minister suddenly remembered the day when for the first and last time he had tried to whip Carl for his prank with the eel .
That was the first time he had realised how much Carl 's eyes were like Cecilia 's .
Now he realised it again once more .
Would he ever again see his dead wife 's eyes looking at him from his son 's face ?
"What a bonny , clean , handsome lad he was !"
It was -- hard -- to see him go .
John Meredith seemed to be looking at a torn plain strewed with the bodies of `` able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five . ''
"Only the other day Carl had been a little scrap of a boy , hunting bugs in Rainbow Valley , taking lizards to bed with him , and scandalizing the Glen by carrying frogs to Sunday School ."
It seemed hardly -- right -- somehow that he should be an `` able-bodied man '' in khaki .
Yet John Meredith had said no word to dissuade him when Carl had told him he must go .
If he spent a shilling he got back a florin-such an excellent merchant he was till he died .
Now his son inherited all this money .
"He lived very merrily ; he went every night to the theatre , made paper kites out of five-pound notes , and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones ."
"In this way the money was likely to come soon to an end , and so it did ."
"At last he had nothing left but four shillings , and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown ."
His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him ; they would not even walk down the street with him .
"But one of them who was rather good-natured sent him an old trunk with the message , ` Pack up ! ''"
"That was all very well , but he had nothing to pack up , so he got into the trunk himself ."
"It was an enchanted trunk , for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly ."
"He pressed it , and away he flew in it up the chimney , high into the clouds , further and further away ."
"But whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces , for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault-just think of it !"
In this way he arrived at the land of the Turks .
"He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves , and then walked into the town ."
"He could do that quite well , for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers ."
He met a nurse with a little child .
` Halloa !
"you Turkish nurse , ' said he , ` what is that great castle there close to the town ?"
The one with the windows so high up ? '
"` The sultan 's daughter lives there , ' she replied ."
"` It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband , and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by . '"
"` Thank you , ' said the merchant 's son , and he went into the wood , sat himself in his trunk , flew on to the roof , and crept through the window into the princess 's room ."
"She was lying on the sofa asleep , and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her ."
"Then she woke up and was very much frightened , but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her , and that pleased her very much ."
"They sat close to each other , and he told her a story about her eyes ."
They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids .
"And her forehead was a snowy mountain , grand and shining ."
These were lovely stories .
"Then he asked the princess to marry him , and she said yes at once ."
"` But you must come here on Saturday , ' she said , ` for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me ."
They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks .
"But mind you have a really good story ready , for my parents like them immensely ."
"My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown , and my father likes something merry to make him laugh . '"
"asked Oliver Sloane , arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for Marilla ."
`` Have n't you heard ? ''
said Jane wrathfully .
"`` Well , its simply this ... Joshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green ... a deep , brilliant blue , the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows ."
"And Mrs. Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building , especially when combined with a red roof , that she ever saw or imagined ."
You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I heard it .
"It 's heartbreaking , after all the trouble we 've had . ''"
`` How on earth could such a mistake have happened ? ''
wailed Diana .
The blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the Pyes .
The Improvers had decided to use Morton-Harris paints and the Morton-Harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card .
A purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number .
"Number 147 was the shade of green desired and when Mr. Roger Pye sent word to the Improvers by his son , John Andrew , that he was going to town and would get their paint for them , the Improvers told John Andrew to tell his father to get 147 ."
"John Andrew always averred that he did so , but Mr. Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him 157 ; and there the matter stands to this day ."
That night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an Improver lived .
The gloom at Green Gables was so intense that it quenched even Davy .
Anne wept and would not be comforted .
"`` I must cry , even if I am almost seventeen , Marilla , '' she sobbed ."
`` It is so mortifying .
And it sounds the death knell of our society .
We 'll simply be laughed out of existence . ''
"In life , as in dreams , however , things often go by contraries ."
The Avonlea people did not laugh ; they were too angry .
Their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake .
Public indignation centered on the Pyes .
"Roger Pye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them ; and as for Joshua Pye , he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint ."
"Joshua Pye , when thus animadverted upon , retorted that the Avonlea taste in colors was no business of his , whatever his private opinion might be ; he had been hired to paint the hall , not to talk about it ; and he meant to have his money for it ."
"The Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit , after consulting Mr. Peter Sloane , who was a magistrate ."
"`` You 'll have to pay it , '' Peter told him ."
"`` You ca n't hold him responsible for the mistake , since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead ."
But it 's a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful . ''
"The luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them ; but instead , public sympathy veered around in their favor ."
"Well , four years ago his wife disappeared -- it was n't known how or when ."
"She just was n't ever seen again , that 's all ."
Whether she died or was murdered or went away nobody ever knew .
There was some talk of an investigation but nothing came of it .
"As for the girl , she 's always lived there with her father ."
She must be a perfect heathen .
"He never goes anywhere , but there used to be talk of strangers visiting him -- queer sort of characters who came up the lake in vessels from the American side ."
"I have n't heard any reports of such these past few years , though -- not since his wife disappeared ."
He keeps a yacht and goes sailing in it -- sometimes he cruises about for weeks -- that 's about all he ever does .
"And now you know as much about the Olivers as I do , Mr. Douglas . ''"
Alan had listened to this gossipy narrative with an interest that did not escape Isabel King 's observant eyes .
"Much of it he mentally dismissed as improbable surmise , but the basic facts were probably as Mrs. Danby had reported them ."
"He had known that the girl of the shore could be no commonplace , primly nurtured young woman ."
`` Has no effort ever been made to bring these people into touch with the church ? ''
he asked absently .
"`` Bless you , yes ."
Every minister that 's ever been in Rexton has had a try at it .
The old cousin met every one of them at the door and told him nobody was at home .
Mr. Strong was the most persistent -- he did n't like being beaten .
"He went again and again and finally the Captain sent him word that when he wanted parsons or pill-dosers he 'd send for them , and till he did he 'd thank them to mind their own business ."
"They say Mr. Strong met Lynde once along shore and wanted to know if she would n't come to church , and she laughed in his face and told him she knew more about God now than he did or ever would ."
Perhaps the story is n't true .
Or if it was maybe he provoked her into saying it .
Mr. Strong was n't overly tactful .
"I believe in judging the poor girl as charitably as possible and making allowances for her , seeing how she 's been brought up ."
You could n't expect her to know how to behave . ''
"Somehow , Alan resented Mrs. Danby 's charity ."
"Then , his sense of humour being strongly developed , he smiled to think of this commonplace old lady `` making allowances '' for the splendid bit of femininity he had seen on the shore ."
A plump barnyard fowl might as well have talked of making allowances for a seagull !
"Alan walked home with Isabel King but he was very silent as they went together down the long , dark , sweet-smelling country road bordered by its white orchards ."
"Isabel put her own construction on his absent replies to her remarks and presently she asked him , `` Did you think Lynde Oliver handsome ? ''"
The question gave Alan an annoyance out of all proportion to its significance .
A singular sneer played about the young nobleman 's mouth as he made answer : `` These are very brave words .
But to the more essential -- are ye Lancaster or York ? ''
"`` My lord , I make no secret ; I am clear for York , '' Dick answered ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"replied the other , `` it is well for you . ''"
"And so saying , he turned towards one of his followers ."
"`` Let me see , '' he continued , in the same sneering and cruel tones -- `` let me see a clean end of these brave gentlemen ."
Truss me them up . ''
There were but five survivors of the attacking party .
"Archers seized them by the arms ; they were hurried to the borders of the wood , and each placed below a tree of suitable dimension ; the rope was adjusted ; an archer , carrying the end of it , hastily clambered overhead ; and before a minute was over , and without a word passing upon either hand , the five men were swinging by the neck ."
"`` And now , '' cried the deformed leader , `` back to your posts , and when I summon you next , be readier to attend . ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said one man , `` beseech you , tarry not here alone ."
Keep but a handful of lances at your hand . ''
"`` Fellow , '' said the duke , `` I have forborne to chide you for your slowness ."
"Cross me not , therefore ."
"I trust my hand and arm , for all that I be crooked ."
Ye were backward when the trumpet sounded ; and ye are now too forward with your counsels .
But it is ever so ; last with the lance and first with tongue .
Let it be reversed . ''
"And with a gesture that was not without a sort of dangerous nobility , he waved them off ."
"The footmen climbed again to their seats behind the men-at-arms , and the whole party moved slowly away and disappeared in twenty different directions , under the cover of the forest ."
"The day was by this time beginning to break , and the stars to fade ."
"The first grey glimmer of dawn shone upon the countenances of the two young men , who now turned once more to face each other ."
"`` Here , '' said the duke , `` ye have seen my vengeance , which is , like my blade , both sharp and ready ."
"But I would not have you , for all Christendom , suppose me thankless ."
You that came to my aid with a good sword and a better courage -- unless that ye recoil from my misshapenness -- come to my heart . ''
"And so saying , the young leader held out his arms for an embrace ."
"In the bottom of his heart Dick already entertained a great terror and some hatred for the man whom he had rescued ; but the invitation was so worded that it would not have been merely discourteous , but cruel , to refuse or hesitate ; and he hastened to comply ."
"`` And now , my lord duke , '' he said , when he had regained his freedom , `` do I suppose aright ?"
Are ye my Lord Duke of Gloucester ? ''
"`` I am Richard of Gloucester , '' returned the other ."
`` And you -- how call they you ? ''
he asked .
`` I thought ye were of the other party . ''
Matcham began to sob .
`` What cheer ! ''
cried Dick .
`` Now the saints behold us !
would ye snivel for a word ? ''
"`` Ye hurt me , '' sobbed Matcham ."
`` Ye hurt me when ye threw me down .
Y ' are a coward to abuse your strength . ''
"`` Nay , that is fool 's talk , '' said Dick , roughly ."
"`` Y ' had no title to my windac , Master John ."
I would ` a ' done right to have well basted you .
"If ye go with me , ye must obey me ; and so , come . ''"
"Matcham had half a thought to stay behind ; but , seeing that Dick continued to scour full-tilt towards the eminence and not so much as looked across his shoulder , he soon thought better of that , and began to run in turn ."
"But the ground was very difficult and steep ; Dick had already a long start , and had , at any rate , the lighter heels , and he had long since come to the summit , crawled forward through the firs , and ensconced himself in a thick tuft of gorse , before Matcham , panting like a deer , rejoined him , and lay down in silence by his side ."
"Below , in the bottom of a considerable valley , the short cut from Tunstall hamlet wound downwards to the ferry ."
"It was well beaten , and the eye followed it easily from point to point ."
Here it was bordered by open glades ; there the forest closed upon it ; every hundred yards it ran beside an ambush .
"Far down the path , the sun shone on seven steel salets , and from time to time , as the trees opened , Selden and his men could be seen riding briskly , still bent upon Sir Daniel 's mission ."
"The wind had somewhat fallen , but still tussled merrily with the trees , and , perhaps , had Appleyard been there , he would have drawn a warning from the troubled conduct of the birds ."
"`` Now , mark , '' Dick whispered ."
`` They be already well advanced into the wood ; their safety lieth rather in continuing forward .
"But see ye where this wide glade runneth down before us , and in the midst of it , these two score trees make like an island ?"
There were their safety .
"An they but come sound as far as that , I will make shift to warn them ."
"But my heart misgiveth me ; they are but seven against so many , and they but carry cross-bows ."
"The long-bow , Jack , will have the uppermost ever . ''"
"Meanwhile , Selden and his men still wound up the path , ignorant of their danger , and momently drew nearer hand ."
"Once , indeed , they paused , drew into a group , and seemed to point and listen ."
"But it was something from far away across the plain that had arrested their attention -- a hollow growl of cannon that came , from time to time , upon the wind , and told of the great battle ."
"It was worth a thought , to be sure ; for if the voice of the big guns were thus become audible in Tunstall Forest , the fight must have rolled ever eastward , and the day , by consequence , gone sore against Sir Daniel and the lords of the dark rose ."
"Maimie cried , falling on her knees , for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread , but still quite complete ."
"But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself , and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey ' -RSB- Maimie stamped her foot naughtily , and was putting her fingers to her eyes , when she heard a kind voice say , ` Do n't cry , pretty human , do n't cry , ' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully ."
She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Peter 's Goat ' -RSB- VI PETER 'S GOAT Maimie felt quite shy , but Peter knew not what shy was . '"
"I hope you have had a good night , ' he said earnestly ."
"` Thank you , ' she replied , ' I was so cosy and warm ."
But you ' -- and she looked at his nakedness awkwardly -- ` do n't you feel the least bit cold ? '
"Now cold was another word Peter had forgotten , so he answered , ' I think not , but I may be wrong : you see I am rather ignorant ."
I am not exactly a boy ; Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between . '
"` So that is what it is called , ' said Maimie thoughtfully ."
"` That 's not my name , ' he explained , ` my name is Peter Pan . '"
"` Yes , of course , ' she said , ' I know , everybody knows . '"
You ca n't think how pleased Peter was to learn that all the people outside the gates knew about him .
"He begged Maimie to tell him what they knew and what they said , and she did so ."
"They were sitting by this time on a fallen tree ; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie , but he sat on a snowy bit himself ."
"` Squeeze closer , ' Maimie said ."
` What is that ? '
"he asked , and she showed him , and then he did it ."
"They talked together and he found that people knew a great deal about him , but not everything , not that he had gone back to his mother and been barred out , for instance , and he said nothing of this to Maimie , for it still humiliated him ."
` Do they know that I play games exactly like real boys ? '
he asked very proudly . '
"O Maimie , please tell them ! '"
"But when he revealed how he played , by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond , and so on , she was simply horrified ."
"` All your ways of playing , ' she said with her big eyes on him , ` are quite , quite wrong , and not in the least like how boys play . '"
"Poor Peter uttered a little moan at this , and he cried for the first time for I know not how long ."
"Maimie was extremely sorry for him , and lent him her handkerchief , but he did n't know in the least what to do with it , so she showed him , that is to say , she wiped her eyes , and then gave it back to him , saying , ` Now you do it , ' but instead of wiping his own eyes he wiped hers , and she thought it best to pretend that this was what she had meant ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Looking very undancey indeed -RSB- She said out of pity for him , ' I shall give you a kiss if you like , ' but though he once knew , he had long forgotten what kisses are , and he replied , ` Thank you , ' and held out his hand , thinking she had offered to put something into it ."
"This was a great shock to her , but she felt she could not explain without shaming him , so with charming delicacy she gave Peter a thimble which happened to be in her pocket , and pretended that it was a kiss ."
Poor little boy !
"he quite believed her , and to this day he wears it on his finger , though there can be scarcely any one who needs a thimble so little ."
"You see , though still a tiny child , it was really years and years since he had seen his mother , and I dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers ."
"They rode as for their lives , in complete disorder ; some of them were wounded ; riderless horses galloped at their side with bloody saddles ."
They were plainly fugitives from the great battle .
"The noise of their passage had scarce begun to die away towards Shoreby , before fresh hoofs came echoing in their wake , and another deserter clattered down the road ; this time a single rider and , by his splendid armour , a man of high degree ."
"Close after him there followed several baggage-waggons , fleeing at an ungainly canter , the drivers flailing at the horses as if for life ."
These must have run early in the day ; but their cowardice was not to save them .
"For just before they came abreast of where the lads stood wondering , a man in hacked armour , and seemingly beside himself with fury , overtook the waggons , and with the truncheon of a sword , began to cut the drivers down ."
"Some leaped from their places and plunged into the wood ; the others he sabred as they sat , cursing them the while for cowards in a voice that was scarce human ."
"All this time the noise in the distance had continued to increase ; the rumble of carts , the clatter of horses , the cries of men , a great , confused rumour , came swelling on the wind ; and it was plain that the rout of a whole army was pouring , like an inundation , down the road ."
Dick stood sombre .
"He had meant to follow the highway till the turn for Holywood , and now he had to change his plan ."
"But above all , he had recognised the colours of Earl Risingham , and he knew that the battle had gone finally against the rose of Lancaster ."
"Had Sir Daniel joined , and was he now a fugitive and ruined ?"
"or had he deserted to the side of York , and was he forfeit to honour ?"
It was an ugly choice .
"`` Come , '' he said , sternly ; and , turning on his heel , he began to walk forward through the grove , with Matcham limping in his rear ."
For some time they continued to thread the forest in silence .
It was now growing late ; the sun was setting in the plain beyond Kettley ; the tree-tops overhead glowed golden ; but the shadows had begun to grow darker and the chill of the night to fall .
`` If there were anything to eat ! ''
"cried Dick , suddenly , pausing as he spoke ."
Matcham sat down and began to weep .
"`` Ye can weep for your own supper , but when it was to save men 's lives , your heart was hard enough , '' said Dick , contemptuously ."
"`` Y ' ` ave seven deaths upon your conscience , Master John ; I 'll ne'er forgive you that . ''"
`` Conscience ! ''
"cried Matcham , looking fiercely up ."
`` Mine !
And ye have the man 's red blood upon your dagger !
"And wherefore did ye slay him , the poor soul ?"
"He drew his arrow , but he let not fly ; he held you in his hand , and spared you !"
"'T is as brave to kill a kitten , as a man that not defends himself . ''"
Dick was struck dumb .
`` I slew him fair .
"I ran me in upon his bow , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool , he had more in his sandal , or stitched into his tippet ."
"Y ' are but a child , Tom Cuckow ; ye have lost the fish . ''"
"But , for all that , Ellis pocketed the purse with nonchalance ."
"He stood leaning on his boar-spear , and looked round upon the rest ."
"They , in various attitudes , took greedily of the venison pottage , and liberally washed it down with ale ."
"This was a good day ; they were in luck ; but business pressed , and they were speedy in their eating ."
The first-comers had by this time even despatched their dinner .
"Some lay down upon the grass and fell instantly asleep , like boa-constrictors ; others talked together , or overhauled their weapons : and one , whose humour was particularly gay , holding forth an ale-horn , began to sing : `` Here is no law in good green shaw , Here is no lack of meat ; 'T is merry and quiet , with deer for our diet , In summer , when all is sweet ."
"Come winter again , with wind and rain -- Come winter , with snow and sleet , Get home to your places , with hoods on your faces , And sit by the fire and eat . ''"
"All this while the two lads had listened and lain close ; only Richard had unslung his cross-bow , and held ready in one hand the windac , or grappling-iron that he used to bend it ."
Otherwise they had not dared to stir ; and this scene of forest life had gone on before their eyes like a scene upon a theatre .
But now there came a strange interruption .
The tall chimney which over-topped the remainder of the ruins rose right above their hiding-place .
"There came a whistle in the air , and then a sounding smack , and the fragments of a broken arrow fell about their ears ."
"Some one from the upper quarters of the wood , perhaps the very sentinel they saw posted in the fir , had shot an arrow at the chimney-top ."
"Matcham could not restrain a little cry , which he instantly stifled , and even Dick started with surprise , and dropped the windac from his fingers ."
"But to the fellows on the lawn , this shaft was an expected signal ."
"They were all afoot together , tightening their belts , testing their bow-strings , loosening sword and dagger in the sheath ."
Ellis held up his hand ; his face had suddenly assumed a look of savage energy ; the white of his eyes shone in his sun-brown face .
"`` Lads , '' he said , `` ye know your places ."
Let not one man 's soul escape you .
Appleyard was a whet before a meal ; but now we go to table .
"I have three men whom I will bitterly avenge -- Harry Shelton , Simon Malmesbury , and '' -- striking his broad bosom -- `` and Ellis Duckworth , by the mass ! ''"
"Another man came , red with hurry , through the thorns . ''"
'T is not Sir Daniel ! ''
he panted .
`` They are but seven .
Is the arrow gone ? ''
"`` It struck but now , '' replied Ellis ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried the messenger .
`` Methought I heard it whistle .
"`` There is no Black Dog here , '' said the doctor , `` except what you have on your own back ."
"You have been drinking rum ; you have had a stroke , precisely as I told you ; and I have just , very much against my own will , dragged you headforemost out of the grave ."
"Now , Mr. Bones -- '' `` That 's not my name , '' he interrupted ."
"`` Much I care , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` It 's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance ; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness , and what I have to say to you is this ; one glass of rum wo n't kill you , but if you take one you 'll take another and another , and I stake my wig if you do n't break off short , you 'll die -- do you understand that ?"
"-- die , and go to your own place , like the man in the Bible ."
"Come , now , make an effort ."
I 'll help you to your bed for once . ''
"Between us , with much trouble , we managed to hoist him upstairs , and laid him on his bed , where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting ."
"`` Now , mind you , '' said the doctor , `` I clear my conscience -- the name of rum for you is death . ''"
"And with that he went off to see my father , taking me with him by the arm ."
"`` This is nothing , '' he said as soon as he had closed the door ."
`` I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile ; he should lie for a week where he is -- that is the best thing for him and you ; but another stroke would settle him . ''
3 The Black Spot ABOUT noon I stopped at the captain 's door with some cooling drinks and medicines .
"He was lying very much as we had left him , only a little higher , and he seemed both weak and excited ."
"`` Jim , '' he said , `` you 're the only one here that 's worth anything , and you know I 've been always good to you ."
Never a month but I 've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself .
"And now you see , mate , I 'm pretty low , and deserted by all ; and Jim , you 'll bring me one noggin of rum , now , wo n't you , matey ? ''"
`` The doctor -- '' I began .
"But he broke in cursing the doctor , in a feeble voice but heartily ."
"`` Doctors is all swabs , '' he said ; `` and that doctor there , why , what do he know about seafaring men ?"
"I been in places hot as pitch , and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack , and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes -- what to the doctor know of lands like that ?"
"-- and I lived on rum , I tell you ."
"It 's been meat and drink , and man and wife , to me ; and if I 'm not to have my rum now I 'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore , my blood 'll be on you , Jim , and that doctor swab '' ; and he ran on again for a while with curses ."
"`` Look , Jim , how my fingers fidges , '' he continued in the pleading tone ."
"`` I ca n't keep 'em still , not I. I have n't had a drop this blessed day ."
"That doctor 's a fool , I tell you ."
"If I do n't have a drain o ' rum , Jim , I 'll have the horrors ; I seen some on 'em already ."
"I seen old Flint in the corner there , behind you ; as plain as print , I seen him ; and if I get the horrors , I 'm a man that has lived rough , and I 'll raise Cain ."
Your doctor hisself said one glass would n't hurt me .
"I 'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin , Jim . ''"
"He was growing more and more excited , and this alarmed me for my father , who was very low that day and needed quiet ; besides , I was reassured by the doctor 's words , now quoted to me , and rather offended by the offer of a bribe ."
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way everyone may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together , and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the fight , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully , and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- and she accepted them with a disturbing smile .
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by-and-by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying `` Hsh !
what was that ? ''
Tony beseeches her !
"`` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! ''"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
`` It is coming nearer ! ''
"she cries ; `` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , oh , Tony , oh ! ''"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly , not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
But this was different .
Perhaps she needed the advice or assistance only he could give .
"To whom else in Bayside could she turn for it but to him , her old friend ?"
Was it possible that she must leave Pinehurst ?
The thought struck cold dismay to his soul .
How could he bear his life if she went away ?
He had loved Sara Stuart from childhood .
"He remembered vividly the day he had first seen her -- a spring day , much like this one had been ; he , a boy of eight , had gone with his father to the big , sunshiny hill field and he had searched for birds ' nests in the little fir copses along the crest while his father plowed ."
"He had so come upon her , sitting on the fence under the pines at the back of Pinehurst -- a child of six in a dress of purple cloth ."
"Her long , light brown curls fell over her shoulders and rippled sleekly back from her calm little brow ; her eyes were large and greyish blue , straight-gazing and steadfast ."
To the end of his life the boy was to carry in his heart the picture she made there under the pines .
"`` Little boy , '' she had said , with a friendly smile , `` will you show me where the mayflowers grow ? ''"
"Shyly enough he had assented , and they set out together for the barrens beyond the field , where the arbutus trailed its stars of sweetness under the dusty dead grasses and withered leaves of the old year ."
The boy was thrilled with delight .
She was a fairy queen who thus graciously smiled on him and chattered blithely as they searched for mayflowers in the fresh spring sunshine .
He thought it a wonderful thing that it had so chanced .
"It overjoyed him to give the choicest dusters he found into her slim , waxen little fingers , and watch her eyes grow round with pleasure in them ."
"When the sun began to lower over the beeches she had gone home with her arms full of arbutus , but she had turned at the edge of the pineland and waved her hand at him ."
"That night , when he told his mother of the little girl he had met on the hill , she had hoped anxiously that he had been `` very polite , '' for the little girl was a daughter of Colonel Stuart , newly come to Pinehurst ."
"Jeffrey , reflecting , had not been certain that he had been polite ; `` But I am sure she liked me , '' he said gravely ."
A few days later a message came from Mrs. Stuart on the hill to Mrs. Miller in the valley .
Would she let her little boy go up now and then to play with Sara ?
Sara was very lonely because she had no playmates .
"So Jeff , overjoyed , had gone to his divinity 's very home , where the two children played together many a day ."
All through their childhood they had been fast friends .
Sara 's parents placed no bar to their intimacy .
They had soon concluded that little Jeff Miller was a very good playmate for Sara .
"He was gentle , well-behaved , and manly ."
Sara never went to the district school which Jeff attended ; she had her governess at home .
"With no other boy or girl in Bayside did she form any friendship , but her loyalty to Jeff never wavered ."
"As for Jeff , he worshipped her and would have done anything she commanded ."
He belonged to her from the day they had hunted arbutus on the hill .
"Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife , and he died without moving ."
"After that he landed on the beach , skinned the wolf , and taking the skin to his cottage , he hung it up before the fire to dry ."
"Not many days later the wolf 's grandmother , who , with the help of her relations , had been searching for him everywhere , entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins ' eggs , and saw the skin , which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson . '"
I knew he was dead -- I knew it !
I knew it ! '
"she cried , weeping bitterly , till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet ."
"So , half-blinded by her tears , the old woman went home the way she had come , and running in at the door , she flung herself down in front of the fire ."
` What are you crying for ? '
asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him . '
I shall never see my grandson any more ! '
answered she .
"` Mink has killed him , oh !"
oh ! '
"And putting her head down , she began to weep as loudly as ever ."
` There !
there ! '
"said her husband , laying his paw on her shoulder ."
"` Be comforted ; if he IS dead , we will avenge him . '"
And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan .
"It took them a long time to make up their minds , as one wolf proposed one thing and one another ; but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house , and that the mink should be invited to the party ."
And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him .
"Now the wolves thought they were very cunning , but the mink was more cunning still ; and though he sent a message by a white hare , that was going that way , saying he should be delighted to be present , he determined that he would take his precautions ."
"So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn , and greeted her with his best bow . '"
"I have a favour to ask of you , friend mouse , ' said he , ` and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill . '"
"` The favour is mine , ' answered the mouse ."
` Tell me what it is that I can have the honour of doing for you . '
"` Oh , something quite easy , ' replied the mink . '"
"I only want you -- between to-day and the next full moon -- to gnaw through the bows and paddles of the wolf people , so that directly they use them they will break ."
But of course you must manage it so that they notice nothing . '
"` Of course , ' answered the mouse , ` nothing is easier ; but as the full moon is to-morrow night , and there is not much time , I had better begin at once . '"
"Then the mink thanked her , and went his way ; but before he had gone far he came back again ."
"` Perhaps , while you are about the wolf 's house seeing after the bows , it would do no harm if you were to make that knot-hole in the wall a little bigger , ' said he ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"`` We 're a-changing of the powder , Jack , '' answers one ."
"`` Why , by the powers , '' cried Long John , `` if we do , we 'll miss the morning tide ! ''"
`` My orders ! ''
said the captain shortly .
"`` You may go below , my man ."
Hands will want supper . ''
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' answered the cook , and touching his forelock , he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley ."
"`` That 's a good man , captain , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Very likely , sir , '' replied Captain Smollett ."
"`` Easy with that , men -- easy , '' he ran on , to the fellows who were shifting the powder ; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships , a long brass nine , `` Here you , ship 's boy , '' he cried , `` out o ' that !"
Off with you to the cook and get some work . ''
"And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , `` I 'll have no favourites on my ship . ''"
"I assure you I was quite of the squire 's way of thinking , and hated the captain deeply ."
"10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place , and boatfuls of the squire 's friends , Mr. Blandly and the like , coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return ."
"We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work ; and I was dog-tired when , a little before dawn , the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars ."
"I might have been twice as weary , yet I would not have left the deck , all was so new and interesting to me -- the brief commands , the shrill note of the whistle , the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship 's lanterns ."
"`` Now , Barbecue , tip us a stave , '' cried one voice ."
"`` The old one , '' cried another ."
"`` Aye , aye , mates , '' said Long John , who was standing by , with his crutch under his arm , and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- '' And then the whole crew bore chorus : -- `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
And at the third `` Ho ! ''
drove the bars before them with a will .
"Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second , and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus ."
"But soon the anchor was short up ; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows ; soon the sails began to draw , and the land and shipping to flit by on either side ; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure ."
I am not going to relate that voyage in detail .
It was fairly prosperous .
"The ship proved to be a good ship , the crew were capable seamen , and the captain thoroughly understood his business ."
"But before we came the length of Treasure Island , two or three things had happened which require to be known ."
"Mr. Arrow , first of all , turned out even worse than the captain had feared ."
"He had no command among the men , and people did what they pleased with him ."
"But that was by no means the worst of it , for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye , red cheeks , stuttering tongue , and other marks of drunkenness ."
Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace .
"`` Oh , that is the postmaster 's son , '' said Alan disappointedly ."
`` That puts us further off the scent than ever .
The letter was probably dropped in the box at the office and there will consequently be no way of tracing the writer . ''
"`` Well , I ca n't tell you anything more , '' said Emily ."
`` You 'll have to ask Lynde for the truth . ''
This Alan was determined to do whenever he should meet her .
"He did not go to the house with Emily but wandered about the shore , watching for Lynde and not seeing her ."
"At length he went home , a prey to stormy emotions ."
He realized at last that he loved Lynde Oliver .
He wondered how he could have been so long blind to it .
He knew that he must have loved her ever since he had first seen her .
The discovery amazed but did not shock him .
There was no reason why he should not love her -- should not woo and win her for his wife if she cared for him .
She was good and sweet and true .
Anything of doubt in her antecedents could not touch her .
"Probably the world would look upon Captain Anthony as a somewhat undesirable father-in-law for a minister , but that aspect of the question did not disturb Alan ."
"As for the trouble of the letter , he felt sure he would easily be able to clear it away ."
Probably some malicious busybody had become aware of his frequent calls at Four Winds and chose to interfere in his private affairs thus .
For the first time it occurred to him that there had been a certain lack of cordiality among his people of late .
"If it were really so , doubtless this was the reason ."
At any other time this would have been of moment to him .
But now his thoughts were too wholly taken up with Lynde and the estrangement on her part to attach much importance to anything else .
What she thought mattered incalculably more to Alan than what all the people in Rexton put together thought .
"He had the right , like any other man , to woo the woman of his choice and he would certainly brook no outside interference in the matter ."
After a sleepless night he went back to Four Winds in the morning .
Lynde would not expect him at that time and he would have more chance of finding her .
"The result justified his idea , for he met her by the spring ."
Alan felt shocked at the change in her appearance .
She looked as if years of suffering had passed over her .
"Her lips were pallid , and hollow circles under her eyes made them appear unnaturally large ."
He had last left the girl in the bloom of her youth ; he found her again a woman on whom life had laid its heavy hand .
"A burning flood of colour swept over her face as they met , then receded as quickly , leaving her whiter than before ."
I came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again .
She has let it occur again .
"Where 's your aunt , miss ?"
"I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind ... a piece of J. A. Harrison 's mind , miss . ''"
"`` If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert , she is not my aunt , and she has gone down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill , '' said Anne , with due increase of dignity at every word ."
`` I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats ... she is my cow and not Miss Cuthbert 's ... Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell . ''
"`` Sorry , miss !"
Sorry is n't going to help matters any .
"You 'd better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats ... trampled them from center to circumference , miss . ''"
"`` I am very sorry , '' repeated Anne firmly , `` but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in ."
It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition . ''
"`` My fence is all right , '' snapped Mr. Harrison , angrier than ever at this carrying of the war into the enemy 's country ."
`` The jail fence could n't keep a demon of a cow like that out .
"And I can tell you , you redheaded snippet , that if the cow is yours , as you say , you 'd be better employed in watching her out of other people 's grain than in sitting round reading yellow-covered novels , '' ... with a scathing glance at the innocent tan-colored Virgil by Anne 's feet ."
Something at that moment was red besides Anne 's hair ... which had always been a tender point with her .
"`` I 'd rather have red hair than none at all , except a little fringe round my ears , '' she flashed ."
"The shot told , for Mr. Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald head ."
"His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly at Anne , who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage ."
"`` I can make allowance for you , Mr. Harrison , because I have an imagination ."
I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you for the things you 've said .
I promise you that Dolly shall never break into your oats again .
I give you my word of honor on THAT point . ''
"`` Well , mind you she does n't , '' muttered Mr. Harrison in a somewhat subdued tone ; but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him growling to himself until he was out of earshot ."
"Grievously disturbed in mind , Anne marched across the yard and shut the naughty Jersey up in the milking pen ."
"`` She ca n't possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down , '' she reflected ."
`` She looks pretty quiet now .
I daresay she has sickened herself on those oats .
"I wish I 'd sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted her last week , but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together ."
I believe it is true about Mr. Harrison being a crank .
Certainly there 's nothing of the kindred spirit about HIM . ''
Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits .
"Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the house , and the latter flew to get tea ready ."
"Y ' are called to count for this ; in the end , I wot not how , ye have ever the uppermost at law , and ye think all patched ."
"But give me leave , Sir Oliver : the man that ye have dispossessed and beaten is but the angrier , and some day , when the black devil is by , he will up with his bow and clout me a yard of arrow through your inwards . ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , y ' are in the wrong ."
"Bennet , ye should be glad to be corrected , '' said Sir Oliver ."
"`` Y ' are a prater , Bennet , a talker , a babbler ; your mouth is wider than your two ears ."
"Mend it , Bennet , mend it . ''"
"`` Nay , I say no more ."
"Have it as ye list , '' said the retainer ."
"The priest now rose from the stool , and from the writing-case that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper , and a flint and steel ."
"With these he sealed up the chest and the cupboard with Sir Daniel 's arms , Hatch looking on disconsolate ; and then the whole party proceeded , somewhat timorously , to sally from the house and get to horse . ''"
"'T is time we were on the road , Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , as he held the priest 's stirrup while he mounted ."
"`` Ay ; but , Bennet , things are changed , '' returned the parson ."
`` There is now no Appleyard -- rest his soul !
-- to keep the garrison .
"I shall keep you , Bennet ."
I must have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows .
"` The arrow that flieth by day , ' saith the evangel ; I have no mind of the context ; nay , I am a sluggard priest , I am too deep in men 's affairs ."
"Well , let us ride forth , Master Hatch ."
The jackmen should be at the church by now . ''
"So they rode forward down the road , with the wind after them , blowing the tails of the parson 's cloak ; and behind them , as they went , clouds began to arise and blot out the sinking sun ."
"They had passed three of the scattered houses that make up Tunstall hamlet , when , coming to a turn , they saw the church before them ."
Ten or a dozen houses clustered immediately round it ; but to the back the churchyard was next the meadows .
"At the lych-gate , near a score of men were gathered , some in the saddle , some standing by their horses ' heads ."
"They were variously armed and mounted ; some with spears , some with bills , some with bows , and some bestriding plough-horses , still splashed with the mire of the furrow ; for these were the very dregs of the country , and all the better men and the fair equipments were already with Sir Daniel in the field ."
"`` We have not done amiss , praised be the cross of Holywood !"
"Sir Daniel will be right well content , '' observed the priest , inwardly numbering the troop ."
`` Who goes ?
Stand !
if ye be true ! ''
shouted Bennet .
"A man was seen slipping through the churchyard among the yews ; and at the sound of this summons he discarded all concealment , and fairly took to his heels for the forest ."
"The men at the gate , who had been hitherto unaware of the stranger 's presence , woke and scattered ."
"Howbeit , if he is to marry , marry him in the name of Mary , and be done ! ''"
"`` Nay , he is a brave lad -- I know it , '' said Lord Foxham ."
"`` Content ye , then , Sir Richard ."
"I have compounded this affair with Master Hamley , and to-morrow ye shall wed. '' Whereupon Dick judged it prudent to withdraw ; but he was not yet clear of the refectory , when a man , but newly alighted at the gate , came running four stairs at a bound , and , brushing through the abbey servants , threw himself on one knee before the duke ."
"`` Victory , my lord , '' he cried ."
"And before Dick had got to the chamber set apart for him as Lord Foxham 's guest , the troops in the holm were cheering around their fires ; for upon that same day , not twenty miles away , a second crushing blow had been dealt to the power of Lancaster ."
"CHAPTER VII -- DICK 'S REVENGE The next morning Dick was afoot before the sun , and having dressed himself to the best advantage with the aid of the Lord Foxham 's baggage , and got good reports of Joan , he set forth on foot to walk away his impatience ."
"For some while he made rounds among the soldiery , who were getting to arms in the wintry twilight of the dawn and by the red glow of torches ; but gradually he strolled further afield , and at length passed clean beyond the outposts , and walked alone in the frozen forest , waiting for the sun ."
His thoughts were both quiet and happy .
"His brief favour with the Duke he could not find it in his heart to mourn ; with Joan to wife , and my Lord Foxham for a faithful patron , he looked most happily upon the future ; and in the past he found but little to regret ."
"As he thus strolled and pondered , the solemn light of the morning grew more clear , the east was already coloured by the sun , and a little scathing wind blew up the frozen snow ."
"He turned to go home ; but even as he turned , his eye lit upon a figure behind , a tree ."
`` Stand ! ''
he cried .
`` Who goes ? ''
The figure stepped forth and waved its hand like a dumb person .
"It was arrayed like a pilgrim , the hood lowered over the face , but Dick , in an instant , recognised Sir Daniel ."
"He strode up to him , drawing his sword ; and the knight , putting his hand in his bosom , as if to seize a hidden weapon , steadfastly awaited his approach ."
"`` Well , Dickon , '' said Sir Daniel , `` how is it to be ?"
Do ye make war upon the fallen ? ''
"`` I made no war upon your life , '' replied the lad ; `` I was your true friend until ye sought for mine ; but ye have sought for it greedily . ''"
"`` Nay -- self-defence , '' replied the knight ."
"`` And now , boy , the news of this battle , and the presence of yon crooked devil here in mine own wood , have broken me beyond all help ."
"I go to Holywood for sanctuary ; thence overseas , with what I can carry , and to begin life again in Burgundy or France . ''"
"`` Ye may not go to Holywood , '' said Dick ."
`` How !
May not ? ''
asked the knight .
"`` Look ye , Sir Daniel , this is my marriage morn , '' said Dick ; `` and yon sun that is to rise will make the brightest day that ever shone for me ."
"Your life is forfeit -- doubly forfeit , for my father 's death and your own practices to meward ."
But I myself have done amiss ; I have brought about men 's deaths ; and upon this glad day I will be neither judge nor hangman .
"An ye were the devil , I would not lay a hand on you ."
`` Of course you may !
"This proves to me that we have a hold on the boy 's heart , and I would no more send him away now than I would my own Rob . ''"
"Dan heard a soft little sound , as if Mrs. Jo thanked her husband without words , and , in the instant 's silence that followed , two great tears that had slowly gathered in the boy 's eyes brimmed over and rolled down his dusty cheeks ."
"No one saw them , for he brushed them hastily away ; but in that little pause I think Dan 's old distrust for these good people vanished for ever , the soft spot in his heart was touched , and he felt an impetuous desire to prove himself worthy of the love and pity that was so patient and forgiving ."
"He said nothing , he only wished the wish with all his might , resolved to try in his blind boyish way , and sealed his resolution with the tears which neither pain , fatigue , nor loneliness could wring from him ."
`` Come and see his foot .
"I am afraid it is badly hurt , for he has kept on three days through heat and dust , with nothing but water and an old jacket to bind it up with ."
"I tell you , Fritz , that boy is a brave lad , and will make a fine man yet . ''"
"`` I hope so , for your sake , enthusiastic woman , your faith deserves success ."
"Now , I will go and see your little Spartan ."
Where is he ? ''
"`` In my room ; but , dear , you 'll be very kind to him , no matter how gruff he seems ."
I am sure that is the way to conquer him .
"He wo n't bear sternness nor much restraint , but a soft word and infinite patience will lead him as it used to lead me . ''"
`` As if you ever like this little rascal ! ''
"cried Mr. Bhaer , laughing , yet half angry at the idea ."
"`` I was in spirit , though I showed it in a different way ."
"I seem to know by instinct how he feels , to understand what will win and touch him , and to sympathize with his temptations and faults ."
"I am glad I do , for it will help me to help him ; and if I can make a good man of this wild boy , it will be the best work of my life . ''"
"`` God bless the work , and help the worker ! ''"
"Mr. Bhaer spoke now as earnestly as she had done , and both came in together to find Dan 's head down upon his arm , as if he was quite overcome by sleep ."
"But he looked up quickly , and tried to rise as Mr. Bhaer said pleasantly , `` So you like Plumfield better than Page 's farm ."
"Well , let us see if we can get on more comfortably this time than we did before . ''"
"`` Thanky , sir , '' said Dan , trying not to be gruff , and finding it easier than he expected ."
"`` Now , the foot !"
Ach !
this is not well .
We must have Dr. Firth to-morrow .
"Warm water , Jo , and old linen . ''"
"Mr. Bhaer bathed and bound up the wounded foot , while Mrs. Jo prepared the only empty bed in the house ."
"It was in the little guest-chamber leading from the parlor , and often used when the lads were poorly , for it saved Mrs. Jo from running up and down , and the invalids could see what was going on ."
"When it was ready , Mr. Bhaer took the boy in his arms , and carried him in , helped him undress , laid him on the little white bed , and left him with another hand-shake , and a fatherly `` Good-night , my son . ''"
I had a big puncheon of rainwater by the spout which I was reserving for making soap .
And you and Walter began quarrelling over the kitten .
"Walter was at one side of the puncheon standing on a chair , holding the kitten , and you were standing on a chair at the other side ."
You leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled .
You were always a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony .
"Walter held on tight and the poor kitten yelled but you dragged Walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost your balance and tumbled into that puncheon , kitten and all ."
If I had not been on the spot you would both have been drowned .
"I flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before much harm was done , and your mother , who had seen it all from the upstairs window , came down and picked you up , dripping as you were , and gave you a beautiful spanking ."
"Ah , '' said Susan with a sigh , `` those were happy old days at Ingleside . ''"
"`` Must have been , '' said Ken ."
His voice sounded queer and stiff .
Rilla supposed he was hopelessly enraged .
The truth was he dared not trust his voice lest it betray his frantic desire to laugh .
"`` Rilla here , now , '' said Susan , looking affectionately at that unhappy damsel , `` never was much spanked ."
She was a real well-behaved child for the most part .
But her father did spank her once .
"She got two bottles of pills out of his office and dared Alice Clow to see which of them could swallow all the pills first , and if her father had not happened in the nick of time those two children would have been corpses by night ."
"As it was , they were both sick enough shortly after ."
But the doctor spanked Rilla then and there and he made such a thorough job of it that she never meddled with anything in his office afterwards .
"We hear a great deal nowadays of something that is called ` moral persuasion , ' but in my opinion a good spanking and no nagging afterwards is a much better thing . ''"
Rilla wondered viciously whether Susan meant to relate all the family spankings .
But Susan had finished with the subject and branched off to another cheerful one .
"`` I remember little Tod MacAllister over-harbour killed himself that very way , eating up a whole box of fruitatives because he thought they were candy ."
It was a very sad affair .
"He was , '' said Susan earnestly , `` the very cutest little corpse I ever laid my eyes on ."
"It was very careless of his mother to leave the fruitatives where he could get them , but she was well-known to be a heedless creature ."
One day she found a nest of five eggs as she was going across the fields to church with a brand new blue silk dress on .
"So she put them in the pocket of her petticoat and when she got to church she forgot all about them and sat down on them and her dress was ruined , not to speak of the petticoat ."
Let me see -- would not Tod be some relation of yours ?
Your great grandmother West was a MacAllister .
Her brother Amos was a MacDonaldite in religion .
I am told he used to take the jerks something fearful .
"A splashing noise near by drew him down to a valley through which ran a large river , and up a waterfall some salmon were leaping ."
"How their silver sides glistened in the light , and how he longed to catch some of the great fellows !"
But how could he do it ?
"He had beheld no one except the old women , and it was not very likely that they would be able to help him ."
"So with a sigh he turned away and went back to them , but , as he walked , a thought struck him ."
"He pulled out one of his hairs which hung nearly to his waist , and it instantly became a strong line , nearly a mile in length ."
"` Weave me a net that I may catch some salmon , ' said he ."
"And they wove him the net he asked for , and for many weeks he watched by the river , only going back to the old women when he wanted a fish cooked ."
"At last , one day , when he was eating his dinner , the old woman who always spoke first , said to him : ` We have been very glad to see you , grandson , but now it is time that you went home . '"
"And pushing aside a rock , he saw a deep hole , so deep that he could not see to the bottom ."
"Then they dragged a basket out of the house , and tied a rope to it ."
"` Get in , and wrap this blanket round your head , ' said they ; ` and , whatever happens , do n't uncover it till you get to the bottom . '"
"Then they bade him farewell , and he curled himself up in the basket ."
"Down , down , down he went ; would he ever stop going ?"
"But when the basket did stop , the young man forgot what he had been told , and put his head out to see what was the matter ."
"In an instant the basket moved , but , to his horror , instead of going down , he felt himself being drawn upwards , and shortly after he beheld the faces of the old women ."
"` You will never see your wife and son if you will not do as you are bid , ' said they ."
"` Now get in , and do not stir till you hear a crow calling . '"
"This time the young man was wiser , and though the basket often stopped , and strange creatures seemed to rest on him and to pluck at his blanket , he held it tight till he heard the crow calling ."
"Then he flung off the blanket and sprang out , while the basket vanished in the sky ."
"He walked on quickly down the track that led to the hut , when , before him , he saw his wife with his little son on her back ."
` Oh !
"there is father at last , ' cried the boy ; but the mother bade him cease from idle talking ."
"` But , mother , it is true ; father is coming ! '"
repeated the child .
"And , to satisfy him , the woman turned round and perceived her husband ."
"Oh , how glad they all were to be together again !"
"And when the wind whistled through the forest , and the snow stood in great banks round the door , the father used to take the little boy on his knee and tell him how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun ."

"` Mother , I have seen such a wonderful man , ' said a little boy one day , as he entered a hut in Lapland , bearing in his arms the bundle of sticks he had been sent out to gather ."
"` Have you , my son ; and what was he like ? '"
"asked the mother , as she took off the child 's sheepskin coat and shook it on the doorstep ."
"Do ye gang easier so , Davie ? ''"
"`` Ay , '' said I , `` I can be doing this way ; '' and I pressed his arm with my hand ."
Again he came near sobbing .
"`` Davie , '' said he , `` I 'm no a right man at all ; I have neither sense nor kindness ; I could nae remember ye were just a bairn , I couldnae see ye were dying on your feet ; Davie , ye 'll have to try and forgive me . ''"
"`` O man , let 's say no more about it ! ''"
said I. `` We 're neither one of us to mend the other -- that 's the truth !
"We must just bear and forbear , man Alan ."
"O , but my stitch is sore !"
Is there nae house ? ''
"`` I 'll find a house to ye , David , '' he said , stoutly ."
"`` We 'll follow down the burn , where there 's bound to be houses ."
"My poor man , will ye no be better on my back ? ''"
"`` O , Alan , '' says I , `` and me a good twelve inches taller ? ''"
"`` Ye 're no such a thing , '' cried Alan , with a start ."
"`` There may be a trifling matter of an inch or two ; I 'm no saying I 'm just exactly what ye would call a tall man , whatever ; and I dare say , '' he added , his voice tailing off in a laughable manner , `` now when I come to think of it , I dare say ye 'll be just about right ."
"Ay , it 'll be a foot , or near hand ; or may be even mair ! ''"
It was sweet and laughable to hear Alan eat his words up in the fear of some fresh quarrel .
"I could have laughed , had not my stitch caught me so hard ; but if I had laughed , I think I must have wept too ."
"`` Alan , '' cried I , `` what makes ye so good to me ?"
What makes ye care for such a thankless fellow ? '' ''
"` Deed , and I do n't know '' said Alan ."
"`` For just precisely what I thought I liked about ye , was that ye never quarrelled : -- and now I like ye better ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXV IN BALQUHIDDER At the door of the first house we came to , Alan knocked , which was of no very safe enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of Balquhidder ."
"No great clan held rule there ; it was filled and disputed by small septs , and broken remnants , and what they call `` chiefless folk , '' driven into the wild country about the springs of Forth and Teith by the advance of the Campbells ."
"Here were Stewarts and Maclarens , which came to the same thing , for the Maclarens followed Alan 's chief in war , and made but one clan with Appin ."
"Here , too , were many of that old , proscribed , nameless , red-handed clan of the Macgregors ."
"They had always been ill-considered , and now worse than ever , having credit with no side or party in the whole country of Scotland ."
"Their chief , Macgregor of Macgregor , was in exile ; the more immediate leader of that part of them about Balquhidder , James More , Rob Roy 's eldest son , lay waiting his trial in Edinburgh Castle ; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and Lowlander , with the Grahames , the Maclarens , and the Stewarts ; and Alan , who took up the quarrel of any friend , however distant , was extremely wishful to avoid them ."
"Chance served us very well ; for it was a household of Maclarens that we found , where Alan was not only welcome for his name 's sake but known by reputation ."
"Here then I was got to bed without delay , and a doctor fetched , who found me in a sorry plight ."
"But whether because he was a very good doctor , or I a very young , strong man , I lay bedridden for no more than a week , and before a month I was able to take the road again with a good heart ."
"All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him , and indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with the two or three friends that were let into the secret ."
"The little wild creatures peeped at him from beneath the bushes , and he nodded and smiled , and wished them ` Good-morning . '"
After he had been walking for some time he met an old white-bearded man who was coming along the footpath .
"The boy would not step aside , and the man was determined not to do so either , so they ran against one another with a bump ."
"` It seems to me , ' said the old fellow , ` that a boy should give way to an old man . '"
"` The path is for me as well as for you , ' answered young Hans saucily , for he had never been taught politeness ."
"` Well , that 's true enough , ' answered the other mildly ."
` And where are you going ? ' '
"I am going into service , ' said Hans ."
"` Then you can come and serve me , ' replied the man ."
"Well , Hans could do that ; but what would his wages be ?"
"` Two pounds a year , and nothing to do but keep some rooms clean , ' said the new-comer ."
"This seemed to Hans to be easy enough ; so he agreed to enter the old man 's service , and they set out together ."
"On their way they crossed a deep valley and came to a mountain , where the man opened a trapdoor , and bidding Hans follow him , he crept in and began to go down a long flight of steps ."
When they got to the bottom Hans saw a large number of rooms lit by many lamps and full of beautiful things .
While he was looking round the old man said to him : ` Now you know what you have to do .
"You must keep these rooms clean , and strew sand on the floor every day ."
"Here is a table where you will always find food and drink , and there is your bed ."
"You see there are a great many suits of clothes hanging on the wall , and you may wear any you please ; but remember that you are never to open this locked door ."
If you do ill will befall you .
"Farewell , for I am going away again and can not tell when I may return ."
"No sooner had the old man disappeared than Hans sat down to a good meal , and after that went to bed and slept until the morning ."
"At first he could not remember what had happened to him , but by-and-by he jumped up and went into all the rooms , which he examined carefully ."
"` How foolish to bid me to put sand on the floors , ' he thought , ` when there is nobody here by myself !"
I shall do nothing of the sort . '
"And so he shut the doors quickly , and only cleaned and set in order his own room ."
"And after the first few days he felt that that was unnecessary too , because no one came there to see if the rooms where clean or not ."
"At last he did no work at all , but just sat and wondered what was behind the locked door , till he determined to go and look for himself ."
The key turned easily in the lock .
"Hans entered , half frightened at what he was doing , and the first thing he beheld was a heap of bones ."
That was not very cheerful ; and he was just going out again when his eye fell on a shelf of books .
"Here was a good way of passing the time , he thought , for he was fond of reading , and he took one of the books from the shelf ."
"It was all about magic , and told you how you could change yourself into anything in the world you liked ."
"Both were glad to get out of sight , and dropped upon the steps red , rumpled , and breathless , after the late exciting scene ."
"Gus generously forebore to speak , though he felt that he was the least to blame ; and Frank , after eating a bit of snow to moisten his dry lips , said , handsomely , -- `` Now , do n't you worry , old man ."
"I 'll pay the damages , for it was my fault ."
"Joe will dodge , but I wo n't , so make your mind easy ."
"`` We sha 'n' t hear the last of this in a hurry , '' responded Gus , relieved , yet anxious , as he thought of the reprimand his father would give him ."
`` I hope mother wo n't hear of it till I tell her quietly myself .
"She will be so frightened , and think I 'm surely smashed up , if she is told in a hurry ; '' and Frank gave a shiver , as all the danger he had run came over him suddenly ."
`` I thought we were done for when we saw that train .
Guess we should have been if you had not had your wits about you .
"I always said you were a cool one ; '' and Gus patted Frank 's back with a look of great admiration , for , now that it was all over , he considered it a very remarkable performance ."
"`` Which do you suppose it will be , fine or imprisonment ? ''"
"asked Frank , after sitting in a despondent attitude for a moment ."
`` Should n't wonder if it was both .
"Running off with an engine is no joke , you know . ''"
`` What did possess me to be such a fool ? ''
"groaned Frank , repenting , all too late , of yielding to the temptation which assailed him ."
"`` Bear up , old fellow , I 'll stand by you ; and if the worst comes , I 'll call as often as the rules of the prison allow , '' said Gus , consolingly , as he gave his afflicted friend an arm , and they walked away , both feeling that they were marked men from that day forth ."
"Meantime , Joe , as soon as he recovered from the shock of seeing the boys actually go off , ran away , as fast as his legs could carry him , to prepare Mrs. Minot for the loss of her son ; for the idea of their coming safely back never occurred to him , his knowledge of engines being limited ."
"A loud ring at the bell brought Mrs. Pecq , who was guarding the house , while Mrs. Minot entertained a parlor full of company ."
"`` Frank 's run off with No. 11 , and he 'll be killed sure ."
"Thought I 'd come up and tell you , '' stammered Joe , all out of breath and looking wild ."
"He got no further , for Mrs. Pecq clapped one hand over his mouth , caught him by the collar with the other , and hustled him into the ante-room before any one else could hear the bad news ."
"`` Tell me all about it , and do n't shout ."
What 's come to the boy ? ''
"she demanded , in a tone that reduced Joe to a whisper at once ."
"`` Go right back and see what has happened to him , then come and tell me quietly ."
I 'll wait for you here .
"I would n't have his mother startled for the world , '' said the good soul , when she knew all ."
"`` Oh , I dar ` s n't !"
"I opened the switch as they told me to , and Bill will half kill me when he knows it ! ''"
"cried Joe , in a panic , as the awful consequences of his deed rose before him , showing both boys mortally injured and several trains wrecked ."
`` Then take yourself off home and hold your tongue .
"""Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense."" George kicked his boots against the fencing to warm his toes. ""It's half the world away."""
"""It looks very near,"" said Jane, hunching up her shoulders to keep her neck warm."
"""They're close to the North Pole,"" said George. ""Look here I don't care a straw about the Aurora Borealis, but I shouldn't mind discovering the North Pole: It's awfully difficult and dangerous, and then you come home and write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody says how brave you are."""
Jane got off the fence.
"""Oh, George, let's,"" she said. ""We shall never have such a chance again all alone by ourselves and quite late, too."""
"""I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you,"" George answered gloomily, ""but you know they always say I lead you into mischief and if we went to the North Pole we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and you remember what they said about not going on the grass."""
"""They said the lawn,"" said Jane. ""We're not going on the lawn. Oh, George, do, do let's. It doesn't look so very far we could be back before they had time to get dreadfully angry."""
"""All right,"" said George, ""but mind, I don't want to go."""
"So off they went. They got over the fence, which was very cold and white and shiny because it was beginning to freeze, and on the other side of the fence was somebody else's garden, so they got out of that as quickly as they could, and beyond that was a field where there was another big bonfire, with people standing around it who looked quite dark-skinned."
"""It's like Indians,"" said George, and wanted to stop and look, but Jane pulled him on, and they passed by the bonfire and got through a gap in the hedge into another field a dark one; and far away, beyond quite a number of other dark fields, the Northern Lights shone and sparkled and twinkled."
"Now, during the winter the Arctic regions come much farther south than they are marked on the map. Very few people know this, though you would think they could tell it by the ice in the jugs of a morning. And just when George and Jane were starting for the North Pole, the Arctic regions had come down very nearly as far as Forest Hill, so that, as the children walked on, it grew colder and colder, and presently they saw that the fields were covered with snow, and there were great icicles hanging from all the hedges and gates. And the Northern Lights still seemed some way off."
"They were crossing a very rough, snowy field when Jane first noticed the animals. There were white rabbits and white hares and all sorts and sizes of white birds, and some larger creatures in the shadows of the hedges that Jane was sure were wolves and bears."
"""Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean,"" she said, for she did not want George to think her stupid again."
"There was a great hedge at the end of this field, all covered with snow and icicles; but the children found a place where there was a hole, and as no bears or wolves seemed to be just in that part of the hedge, they crept through and scrambled out of the frozen ditch on the other side."
And then they stood still and held their breath with wonder.
"For in front of them, running straight and smooth right away to the Northern Lights, lay a great wide road of pure dark ice, and on each side were tall trees all sparkling with white frost, and from the boughs of the trees hung strings of stars threaded on fine moonbeams, and shining so brightly that it was like a beautiful fairy daylight. Jane said so; but George said it was like the electric lights at the Earl's Court Exhibition."
The rows of trees went as straight as ruled lines away away and away and at the other end of them shone the Aurora Borealis.
"There was a signpost of silvery snow, and on it in letters of pure ice the children read: THIS WAY TO THE NORTH POLE."
"Then George said: ""Way or no way, I know a slide when I see one so here goes."" And he took a run on the frozen snow, and Jane took a run when she saw him do it, and the next moment they were sliding away, each with feet half a yard apart, along the great slide that leads to the North Pole."
"This great slide is made for the convenience of the Polar bears, who, during the winter months, get their food from the Army and Navy Stores and it is the most perfect slide in the world. If you have never come across it, it is because you have never let off fireworks on the eleventh of December, and have never been thoroughly naughty and disobedient. But do not be these things in the hope of finding the great slide because you might find something quite different, and then you will be sorry."
"The great slide is like common slides in that when once you have started you have to go on to the end unless you fall down and then it hurts just as much as the smaller kind on ponds. The great slide runs downhill all the way, so that you keep on going faster and faster and faster. George and Jane went so fast that they had not time to notice the scenery. They only saw the long lines of frosted trees and the starry lamps, and on each side, rushing back as they slid on, a very broad, white world and a very large, black night; and overhead as well as in the trees the stars were bright like silver lamps, and far ahead shone and trembled and sparkled the line of fairy spears. Jane said that, and George said: ""I can see the Northern Lights quite plain."""
"It is very pleasant to slide and slide and slide on clear, dark ice especially if you feel you are really going somewhere, and more especially if that somewhere is the North Pole. The children's feet made no noise on the ice, and they went on and on in a beautiful white silence. But suddenly the silence was shattered and a cry rang out over the snow."
"""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and he fell down at once, because it is the only way to stop. Jane fell on top of him and then they crawled on hands and knees to the snow at the edge of the slide and there was a sportsman, dressed in a peaked cap and a frozen moustache, like the one you see in the pictures about Ice-Peter, and he had a gun in his hand."
"""You don't happen to have any bullets about you?"" said he."
"""No,"" George said, truthfully. ""I had five of father's revolver cartridges, but they were taken away the day Nurse turned out my pockets to see if I had taken the knob of the bathroom door by mistake."""
"""Quite so,"" said the sportsman, ""these accidents will occur. You don't carry firearms, then, I presume?"""
"""I haven't any firearms,"" said George, ""but I have a firework. It's only a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's any good."" And he began to feel among the string and peppermints, and buttons and tops and nibs and chalk and foreign postage stamps in his knickerbocker pockets."
"""One could but try,"" the sportsman replied, and he held out his hand."
"But Jane pulled at her brother's jacket-tail and whispered, ""Ask him what he wants it for."""
"So then the sportsman had to confess that he wanted the firework to kill the white grouse with; and, when they came to look, there was the white grouse himself, sitting in the snow, looking quite pale and careworn, and waiting anxiously for the matter to be decided one way or the other."
"George put all the things back in his pockets, and said, ""No, I shan't."
"Once, Queen Victoria herself gave medals to some wounded and disabled soldiers who had fought very bravely. Some of these men could not raise their arms to salute their queen; some could not walk, but had to be wheeled in chairs to her side; but all were proud to receive their medals of honour from her hands."
"""Noble fellows,"" she wrote of them afterwards, ""I feel as if they were my own children."""
The Relief of Lucknow
"During the time of the terrible Indian Mutiny, when most of the native troops rose against their British rulers, and vowed to kill every white person in the land, many cruel deeds were done. A great number of white people were slain before the British troops could come to their rescue, but in some places they managed to hold out until help reached them."
"This was the case in the city of Lucknow, where the British governor with a small body of troops, and a great many women and children, took refuge in the Government House from a vast host of rebels who came to attack them. Many of the brave defenders were killed by the shot and shell of the enemy. Many others, and especially the little children, fell sick and died, for the heat was very great, and there was no good water to be had. Then, after many days, a small body of white soldiers fought their way into the city, and brought help and hope to the rest of the party. They were only just in time. Had they come a few days later they would have found the Government House a heap of ruins, and their friends dead, for the rebels were making a mine under the building and meant to blow it up with gunpowder. But alas! the newcomers were not strong enough to fight their way out of Lucknow with a crowd of helpless women and children and sick folk, so they, too were now shut in. For two months longer they held out. Then at last, when they had almost lost hope, the great Sir Colin Campbell with his brave Highlanders and other soldiers defeated the rebels, and brought the band of sick, starving, and weary people safely away."
Grace Darling
"On a small rocky island, off the north coast of England, there is a lighthouse. A man named William Darling was once keeper of this lighthouse, and his daughter Grace lived with him. Every day Grace Darling helped her father to trim the lamps, so that at night they might shine brightly, and warn sailors to steer their ships away from the dangerous rocks, upon which they would have been dashed to pieces."
"One stormy night Grace woke with the sound of screams in her ears. The screams came from the sea, so she knew that some ship must be in distress. She roused her father, but they could see nothing in the darkness. When daylight came, they found that a ship had been wrecked upon the rocks some way off, and a few people were clinging to the masts. Grace wished to go at once in a boat to save them; but at first her father hung back, for the wind and sea were wild, and he feared that the small boat would be overturned by the great waves. Then Grace ran to the boat, and seized an oar, for she could not bear to let the poor men die without trying to save them; and the father could not let his brave, daughter go alone, so he followed, and they rowed off."
"It was hard work pulling against the strong sea, and several times the small boat was almost sunk. But at last it reached the wreck, and William Darling managed to land upon the rock, and with great care and skill helped the half-frozen people into the small boat. Then they were taken to the lighthouse, where Grace warmed and fed them, until the storm ceased, and they could return to their homes."
David Livingstone
"At one time many people believed that the middle of Africa was a sandy desert, where nothing could live but camels and ostriches. But they were mistaken. The great traveller, David Livingstone, journeyed into this unknown country, and he found that it was not a desert but a beautiful land, where many tribes of black people dwelt. He also saw that these people were often seized by strangers, and taken away to be sold as slaves. This sight filled him with sadness, and he made up his mind to put a stop to this cruel traffic. He worked hard, tracing the courses of the rivers, finding the best tracts of land, and teaching the natives."
"Then he urged his countrymen to send others after him to settle in this fair country, to help the natives to learn useful trades, and to drive away the slave-merchants."
"For some years he was quite alone, with his black servants, in the midst of this wild land. His friends grew anxious, and sent Mr. Stanley, another great traveller, to look for him. Stanley marched for nearly a year before he found Livingstone. The old explorer was white and worn with sickness and hardship, and he was overjoyed to clasp once more the hand of a white man, and to hear again the English tongue. But he would not return to England. He said his work was not yet done, and he set out once more on his travels. It was his last journey. One morning his servants found him dead upon his bed. Since that time much has been done to make Central Africa a prosperous land. Other white men have followed where Livingstone led, and wherever they have settled, the wicked slave-trade has been stopped."
The Battle of Waterloo
"Fields of waving corn, green woods, fruitful orchards, a pretty farmhouse and a few cottages such was the plain of Waterloo. And there, on a summer Sunday, nearly a hundred years ago, was fought a famous battle, in which the British troops under the Duke of Wellington beat the French army, and broke the power of the great Napoleon for ever."
"""We have them,"" cried Napoleon as he saw the British drawn up before him. He thought it would be easy to destroy this army, so much smaller than his own, before their friends the Prussians, who were on the way to help them, came up. But he was mistaken. Wellington had placed his foot-soldiers in squares, and though the French horsemen, then the finest soldiers in the world, charged again and again, these little clumps of brave men stood fast. On his favourite horse ""Copenhagen"", Wellington rode to and fro cheering his men. ""Stand firm, my lads,"""
"cried he. ""What will they say to this in England?"""
"Not till evening, when the Prussians came, would he allow them to charge the French in their turn. Then, waving his cocked hat over his head, he gave the order, ""The whole line will advance"", and the impatient troops dashed forward. The French bravely tried to stand against this terrific charge, but they were beaten back, and the battle of Waterloo was ended."
"Sixty thousand men lay dead or wounded under the fruit-trees, and among the trampled corn and grass at the end of that terrible day."
The Charge of the Light Brigade
Forward the Light!
"Such was the order given during a great battle to the leader of a band of six hundred British soldiers. Forward! And there in front was a line of cannon ready to shoot them down as they came, while on the hills on either side of the valley were the guns and riflemen of the Russians."
"""Surely someone has blundered! My men are sent to certain death,"""
thought the leader of the Light Brigade.
"""Forward! Attack!"""
"The order was repeated, and with the obedience of well-trained soldiers the Brigade started."
"But at teatime another thing happened. Effie's brother Harry fished something out of his tea, which he thought at first was an earwig. He was just getting ready to drop it on the floor, and end its life in the usual way, when it shook itself in the spoon spread two wet wings, and flopped onto the tablecloth. There it sat, stroking itself with its feet and stretching its wings, and Harry said: ""Why, it's a tiny newt!"""
"The professor leaned forward before the doctor could say a word. ""I'll give you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad,"" he said, speaking very fast; and then he picked it up carefully on his handkerchief."
"""It is a new specimen,"" he said, ""and finer than yours, Doctor."""
"It was a tiny lizard, about half an inch long with scales and wings."
"So now the doctor and the professor each had a specimen, and they were both very pleased. But before long these specimens began to seem less valuable. For the next morning, when the knife-boy was cleaning the doctor's boots, he suddenly dropped the brushes and the boot and the blacking, and screamed out that he was burnt."
"And from inside the boot came crawling a lizard as big as a kitten, with large, shiny wings."
"""Why,"" said Effie, ""I know what it is. It is a dragon like the one St."
"George killed."""
"And Effie was right. That afternoon Towser was bitten in the garden by a dragon about the size of a rabbit, which he had tried to chase, and the next morning all the papers were full of the wonderful ""winged lizards"""
"that were appearing all over the country. The papers would not call them dragons, because, of course, no one believes in dragons nowadays and at any rate the papers were not going to be so silly as to believe in fairy stories. At first there were only a few, but in a week or two the country was simply running alive with dragons of all sizes, and in the air you could sometimes see them as thick as a swarm of bees. They all looked alike except as to size. They were green with scales, and they had four legs and a long tail and great wings like bats' wings, only the wings were a pale, half-transparent yellow, like the gear-boxes on bicycles."
"They breathed fire and smoke, as all proper dragons must, but still the newspapers went on pretending they were lizards, until the editor of the Standard was picked up and carried away by a very large one, and then the other newspaper people had not anyone left to tell them what they ought not to believe. So when the largest elephant in the Zoo was carried off by a dragon, the papers gave up pretending and put ALARMING PLAGUE OF DRAGONS at the top of the paper."
"You have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same time how aggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible certainly, but when once you had found out that the dragons always went to bed early because they were afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors all day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. But the smaller sizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big as earwigs got in the soap, and they got in the butter. The ones as big as dogs got in the bath, and the fire and smoke inside them made them steam like anything when the cold water tap was turned on, so that careless people were often scalded quite severely. The ones that were as large as pigeons would get into workbaskets or corner drawers and bite you when you were in a hurry to get a needle or a handkerchief. The ones as big as sheep were easier to avoid, because you could see them coming; but when they flew in at the windows and curled up under your eiderdown, and you did not find them till you went to bed, it was always a shock. The ones this size did not eat people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the sheets and pillowcases dreadfully."
"Of course, the County Council and the police did everything that could be done: It was no use offering the hand of the Princess to anyone who killed a dragon. This way was all very well in olden times when there was only one dragon and one Princess; but now there were far more dragons than Princesses although the Royal Family was a large one. And besides, it would have been a mere waste of Princesses to offer rewards for killing dragons, because everybody killed as many dragons as they could quite out of their own heads and without rewards at all, just to get the nasty things out of the way. The County Council undertook to cremate all dragons delivered at their offices between the hours of ten and two, and whole wagonloads and cartloads and truckloads of dead dragons could be seen any day of the week standing in a long line in the street where the County Council had their offices. Boys brought barrowloads of dead dragons, and children on their way home from morning school would call in to leave the handful or two of little dragons they had brought in their satchels, or carried in their knotted pocket handkerchiefs. And yet there seemed to be as many dragons as ever. Then the police stuck up great wood and canvas towers covered with patent glue. When the dragons flew against these towers, they stuck fast, as flies and wasps do on the sticky papers in the kitchen; and when the towers were covered all over with dragons, the police inspector used to set fire to the towers, and burnt them and dragons and all."
"And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. The shops were full of patent dragon poison and anti-dragon soap, and dragonproof curtains for the windows; and indeed, everything that could be done was done."
And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.
"It was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon, because, you see, they ate such different things. The largest kind ate elephants as long as there were any, and then went on with horses and cows. Another size ate nothing but lilies of the valley, and a third size ate only Prime Ministers if they were to be had, and, if not, would feed freely on servants in livery. Another size lived on bricks, and three of them ate two thirds of the South Lambeth Infirmary in one afternoon."
"But the size Effie was most afraid of was about as big as your dining room, and that size ate little girls and boys."
"At first Effie and her brother were quite pleased with the change in their lives. It was so amusing to sit up all night instead of going to sleep, and to play in the garden lighted by electric lamps. And it sounded so funny to hear Mother say, when they were going to bed: ""Good night, my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too soon. You must not get up before it's quite dark. You wouldn't like the nasty dragons to catch you."""
"But after a time they got very tired of it all: They wanted to see the flowers and trees growing in the fields, and to see the pretty sunshine out of doors, and not just through glass windows and patent dragonproof curtains. And they wanted to play on the grass, which they were not allowed to do in the electric lamp-lighted garden because of the night-dew."
"And they wanted so much to get out, just for once, in the beautiful, bright, dangerous daylight, that they began to try and think of some reason why they ought to go out. Only they did not like to disobey their mother."
"But one morning their mother was busy preparing some new dragon poison to lay down in the cellars, and their father was bandaging the hand of the boot boy, which had been scratched by one of the dragons who liked to eat Prime Ministers when they were to be had, so nobody remembered to say to the children: ""Don't get up till it is quite dark!"""
"""Go now,"" said Harry. ""It would not be disobedient to go. And I know exactly what we ought to do, but I don't know how we ought to do it."""
"""What ought we to do?"" said Effie."
"""We ought to wake St. George, of course,"" said Harry. ""He was the only person in his town who knew how to manage dragons; the people in the fairy tales don't count. But St. George is a real person, and he is only asleep, and he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St."
"George now. I heard father say so."""
"""We do,"" said Effie."
"""Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very reason why we could wake him? You can't wake people if you don't believe in them, can you?"""
"Effie said no, but where could they find St. George?"
"""We must go and look,"" said Harry boldly. ""You shall wear a dragonproof frock, made of stuff like the curtains. And I will smear myself all over with the best dragon poison, and """
"Effie clasped her hands and skipped with joy and cried: ""Oh, Harry! I know where we can find St. George! In St. George's Church, of course."""
"""Um,"" said Harry, wishing he had thought of it for himself, ""you have a little sense sometimes, for a girl."""
"And the Snow Buntings and Juncos, who are bright and honest, nodded their dainty little heads and said, ""Nobody in our own dear north country ever spoke a truer word than that."" So they became firm friends of the Ground Hog, even if he were not so large as the rock."
THE END.
True Stories of Wonderful Deeds
The Royal Oak
"There is in Shropshire a fine oak-tree which the country people there call the ""Royal Oak"". They say it is the great-grandson, or perhaps the great-great-grandson of another fine old oak, which more than two hundred years ago stood on the same spot, and served once as a shelter to an English king. This king was Charles II, the son of the unlucky Charles I who had his head cut off by his subjects because he was a weak and selfish ruler."
"On the very day on which that unhappy king lost his head, the Parliament passed a law forbidding anyone to make his son, Prince Charles of Wales, or any other person, king of England. But the Scottish people did not obey this law. They persuaded the young prince to sign a paper, solemnly promising to rule the country as they wished; then they crowned him king. As soon as the Parliament heard of this they sent Cromwell and his Ironsides against the newly-crowned king and his followers, and after several battles the Scottish army was at last broken up and scattered at Worcester."
"Charles fled and hid in a wood, where some poor wood-cutters took care of him and helped him. He put on some of their clothes, cut his hair short, and stained his face and hands brown so that he might appear to be a sunburnt workman like them. But it was some time before he could escape from the wood, for Cromwell's soldiers were searching it in the hope of finding some of the king's men. One day, Charles and two of his friends had to climb into the tall oak to avoid being caught. They had with them some food, which proved very useful, for they were obliged to stay in their strange hiding-place for a whole day. The top of the oak-tree had been cut off some few years before this time, and this had made the lower branches grow thick and bushy, so that people walking below could not easily see through them. It was a fortunate thing for Charles, for while he was in the tree, he heard the soldiers beating the boughs and bushes in the wood as they searched here and there, and even caught glimpses of them through the leaves as they rode about below."
"When they had gone, without even glancing up into the tall oak-tree, he came down, and rode away from the wood on an old mill-horse, with his friends the wood-cutters walking beside him to take care of him as best they could. The saddle was a poor one, and the horse's pace jolted Charles so much, that at last he cried out that he had never seen so bad a steed. At this the owner of the horse jestingly told him that he should not find fault with the poor animal, which had never before carried the weight of three kingdoms upon its back. He meant, of course, that Charles was king of the three kingdoms of England, and Scotland, and Ireland."
"Carried by the old horse, and helped by the poor wood-cutters, Charles at last reached the house of a friend. Here he hid for a time, and then went on to try and escape from the country. This time, so that he might not be discovered, he was dressed as a servant, and rode on horseback, with a lady sitting on a cushion behind him, as was then the fashion."
After several more dangers he managed to get on board a ship and sailed away to France.
Bonnie Prince Charlie
"Prince Charlie was the grandson of King James II, who was driven away from the throne of England because he was a selfish man and a bad ruler."
"The young prince tried to win the crown back again. He came over to Scotland from France, with only seven followers; but soon a great many of the Scots joined him, for he was so gay, and handsome, and friendly, that all who saw him loved him. They called him ""Bonnie Prince Charlie""."
"But though the prince and his followers were very brave, they had no chance against the well-trained soldiers of King George of England. They won a few victories; then they were thoroughly beaten in the battle of Culloden. Thousands of brave Scots were slain, and the prince had to fly for his life."
"After this, for many weeks, he hid among the moors and mountains from the English soldiers who were trying to find him. He lived in small huts, or in caves, and many times had nothing but the wild berries from the woods to eat. Once he stayed for three weeks with a band of robbers, who were very kind to him; and though the king offered a large sum of money to anyone who would give him up, not one of his poor friends was false to him."
"At last, a young and beautiful Scottish lady, named Flora MacDonald, helped him to escape. She gave him woman's clothes, and pretended that he was her servant, called Betty Burke. Then she took him with her away from the place where the soldiers were searching, and after a time he reached the sea, and got safely away to France."
Nelson and Hardy
"Lord Nelson was one of the greatest seamen that ever lived. He commanded the British fleet at the battle of Trafalgar, when the navies of France and Spain were beaten, and England was saved from a great danger. He did not look like a famous admiral on board his ship, the Victory, that day. He was a small man, and his clothes were shabby. He had lost one arm and one eye in battle; but with the eye which remained he could see more than most men with two, and his brain was busy planning the course of the coming fight. Just before it began, he went over his ship, giving orders to the crew, and cheering them with kind words, which touched the hearts of the rough men, who loved their leader and were proud of him."
"""England expects every man to do his duty"" was the last message he sent them. Every man did his duty nobly that day, though the battle was fierce and long; but it was the last fight of the brave commander. He was shot in the back as he walked the deck with his friend Captain Hardy, and was carried below."
"He lay dying for several hours, but, in spite of his great pain, his one thought was of the battle. ""How goes the day with us?"" he asked of Hardy; and when told that many of the enemies' ships were taken, he cried eagerly, ""I am glad. Whip them, Hardy, as they have never been whipped before."" Later, when his friend came to tell him that the victory was won, Nelson pressed his hand. ""Good-bye, Hardy!"" said he, ""I have done my duty, and I thank God for it."" These were the last words of one of England's bravest sons."
Watt and the Kettle
"There was once a little Scotch boy named James Watt. He was not a strong child, and could not always run and play with other boys, but had often to amuse himself at home. One holiday afternoon little James amused himself in this way. He held a saucer over the stream of steam which came from the spout of a boiling kettle, and as he watched he saw little drops of water forming on the saucer. He thought this was very strange, and wondered why it happened, for he did not know that steam is just water changed in form by the heat, and that as soon as it touches something cold it turns again into water. He asked his aunt to explain it, but she only told him not to waste his time. If she could have foreseen the work which her nephew would do when he became a man, she would not have thought he was wasting his time."
"When James Watt grew up, he was as much interested in steam and its wonderful power, as he had been as a boy. He was sure it could be made of great service to men. It was already used for driving engines, but the engines were not good, and it cost much money to work them. Watt thought they could be improved, but it was long before he found out the way to do this. Often, he sat by the fire watching the lid of the kettle as it was made to dance by the steam, and thinking of many plans; and at last a happy thought came to him. His plan enabled great improvements to be made in the working of engines, and now steam drives our trains and ships, our mills and factories, and is one of our most useful servants."
Queen Victoria and her Soldiers
"Queen Victoria was always proud of her brave soldiers. In time of war, she gave orders that news of them was to be sent to her every day, and when the generals returned home, they were commanded to visit her, and to tell her of the bravery of the troops."
"During the long war with the Russians in the Crimea, the British soldiers suffered greatly from the freezing winds, and rain, and snow, of that cold land. When Queen Victoria heard of this, she and her children worked with their own hands to make warm clothing for them. A great many of the wounded and sick men were sent home in ships, to be nursed in the English hospitals, and the Queen paid several visits to the poor fellows as they lay there. Moving from one bed to another, she cheered them with hopeful words, and listened gladly to their stories of the battles in which they had fought. When she saw that the hospitals were crowded, and not very comfortable, she told Parliament that better ones ought to be provided, and after a time this was done, and the fine hospital of Netley was built, of which the Queen laid the first stone."
"The following spring Washington was sent under General Fry to drive out the French, who had started farming at Pittsburg. Fry died, and Washington took command. He liked it very much. After that Washington took command whenever he could, and soon rose to be a great man."
"The first expedition against Fort Duquesne (pronounced du-kane) was commanded by General Braddock, whose portrait we are able to give, showing him at the time he did not take Washington's advice in the Duquesne matter. Later we show him as he appeared after he had abandoned his original plans and immediately after not taking Washington's advice."
"""The Indians,"" said Braddock, ""may frighten Colonial troops, but they can make no impression on the king's regulars. We are alike impervious to fun or fear."""
"Braddock thought of fighting the Indians by man[oe]uvring in large bodies, but the first body to be man[oe]uvred was that of General Braddock, who perished in about a minute."
"We give the reader, above, an idea of Braddock's soldierly bearing after he had been man[oe]uvring a few times."
"It was then that Washington took command, as was his custom, and began to fight the Indians and French as one would hunt varmints in Virginia."
"Braddock's men fired by platoons into the trees and tore a few holes in the State line, but when most of the Colonial troops were dead the regulars presented their tournures to the foe and fled as far as Philadelphia, where they each took a bath and had some laundry-work done."
General Forbes took command of the second expedition. He spent most of his time building roads.
"Time passed on, and Forbes built viaducts, conduits, culverts, and rustic bridges, till it was November, and they were yet fifty miles from the fort. He then decided to abandon the expedition, on account of the cold, and also fearing that he had not made all of his bridges wide enough so that he could take the captured fort home with him."
"Washington, however, though only an aidy kong of General Forbes, decided to take command. His mother had said to him over and over, ""George, in an emergency always take command."" He done so, as General Rusk would say. As he approached, the French set fire to the fort, and retreated, together with the Indians and Molly Maguires."
"Pittsburg now stands on this historic ground, and is one of the most delightful cities of America."
Many other changes were going on at this time. The English got possession of Acadia and the French forts at the head of the Bay of Fundy.
"In 1757 General Loudon collected an army for an attack on Louisburg. He drilled his troops all summer, and then gave up the attack because he learned that the French had one more skiff than he had."
The Loudons of America at the time of this writing are more quiet and sensible regarding their ancestry than any of the doodle-bug aristocracy of our promoted peasantry and the crested Yahoos of our cowboy republic.
The Loudons or Lowdowns of America had a very large family. Some of them changed their names and moved.
"The next year after the fox pass of General Loudon, Amherst and Wolfe took possession of the entire island."
"About the time of Braddock's justly celebrated expedition another started out for Crown Point. The French, under Dieskau (pronounced dees-kow), met the army composed of Colonial troops in plain clothes, together with the regular troops led by officers with drawn swords and overdrawn salaries. The regular general, seeing that the battle was lost, excused himself and retired to his tent, owing to an ingrowing nail which had annoyed him all day. Lyman, the Colonial officer now took command, and wrung victory from the reluctant jaws of defeat. For this Johnson, the English general, received twenty-five thousand dollars and a baronetcy, while Lyman received a plated butter-dish and a bass-wood what-not. But Lyman was a married man, and had learned to take things as they came."
"Four months prior to the capture of Duquesne, one thousand boats loaded with soldiers, each with a neat little lunch-basket and a little flag to wave when they hurrahed for the good kind man at the head of the picnic, viz., General Abercrombie, sailed down Lake George to get a whiff of fresh air and take Ticonderoga."
"When they arrived, General Abercrombie took out a small book regarding tactics which he had bought on the boat, and, after refreshing his memory, ordered an assault. He then went back to see how his rear was, and, finding it all right, he went back still farther, to see if no one had been left behind."
Abercrombie never forgot or overlooked any one. He wanted all of his pleasure-party to be where they could see the fight.
In that way he missed it himself. I would hate to miss a fight that way.
The Abercrombies of America mostly trace their ancestry back by a cut-off avoiding the general's line.
"Niagara had an expedition sent against it at the time of Braddock's trip. The commander was General Shirley, but he ran out of money while at the Falls and decided to return. This post did not finally surrender till 1759."
"This gave the then West to the English. They had tried for one hundred and forty years to civilize it, but, alas, with only moderate success."
"Prosperous and happy even while sniping in their fox-hunting or canvas-back-duck clothes, these people feel somewhat soothed for their lack of culture because they are well-to-do."
"In 1759 General Wolfe anchored off Quebec with his fleet and sent a boy up town to ask if there were any letters for him at the post-office, also asking at what time it would be convenient to evacuate the place."
"The reply came back from General Montcalm, an able French general, that there was no mail for the general, but if Wolfe was dissatisfied with the report he might run up personally and look over the W's."
"Wolfe did so, taking his troops up by an unknown cow-path on the off side of the mountain during the night, and at daylight stood in battle-array on the Plains of Abraham. An attack was made by Montcalm as soon as he got over his wonder and surprise. At the third fire Wolfe was fatally wounded, and as he was carried back to the rear he heard some one exclaim,"
"""They run! They run!"""
"Then Balna said to her sisters, ""Do you not see that girl watching us?"
"Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us."""
"But the other sisters said, ""Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit."" And calling her to them, they gave her one of the pomeloes."
"No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went home and said to her mother, ""I do not wonder the seven Princesses will not eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day and eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever tasted."""
"The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she stayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache. The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, ""What can I do for you?"" She answered, ""There is only one thing that will make my headache well. By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put a little of the water in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and that will cure my headache."" So the Raja sent his servants, and had the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee desired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was put on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well."
"Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of their mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to cry very bitterly."
"Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were crying they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, which quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all the Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it; and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days. Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter: ""I cannot tell how it is, I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad, though they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot tell how it is!"""
"And her daughter said, ""I will watch."""
"Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should come by but their step-mother's daughter. Balna saw her first, and said, ""See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the edge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some of our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very unfortunate for us."""
"The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, and instead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter some of the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it."
"The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly angry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and fill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she next day pretended to be very, very ill in fact, at the point of death and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was in his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: ""Only one thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it."" He replied, ""Yes, whatever it is, I will do it."" She then said, ""To save my life, you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death will be my life."" At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but because he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find his daughters."
He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.
"Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them, and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made a fire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the afternoon, it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when he saw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and left them (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: ""It is better my poor daughters should die here, than be killed by their step-mother."""
"He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the forehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had really killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well."
"Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to call out as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but he was by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been as loud as thunder."
"It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they were returning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest Prince said to his brothers: ""Stop, I think I hear some one crying and calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of the sound, and find out what it is."""
So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.
"At the sight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and still more so on learning their story; and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her."
"So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him, and married her."
And the second took the second;
And the third took the third;
And the fourth took the fourth;
And the fifth took the fifth;
And the sixth took the sixth;
"And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna."
"And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing throughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to seven such beautiful Princesses."
"About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any children, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged their heir by all the rest."
"They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the seventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and away he went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back."
"Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him; and they went away, but they also did not return."
"And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their kind husbands must have been killed."
"One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her baby's cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below, there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said that he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, ""You cannot go into the palace the Raja's sons have all gone away; we think they must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by your begging."" But he said, ""I am a holy man, you must let me in."""
"Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not know that this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin."
"At that minute the great Black Brahma Cock came up behind Mr. Crow. He had heard from the Hens how rude Mr. Crow had been, and he thought that as the head of the house he ought to see about it. Well! one cannot say very much about what happened next, but the Black Brahma Cock did see about it quite thoroughly, and when the Hen-house door swung open, it was a limp, ragged, and meek-looking Crow who came out, leaving many of his feathers inside."
"The next morning Mr. Crow flew over the forest and far away. He did not want to go back there again. He heard voices as he passed a tall tree by the edge of the forest. Miss Crow was out with the Crow whom he had beaten, and they were looking for a good place in which to build. ""I don't think they will know me if they see me,"" said Mr. Crow, ""and I am sure that I don't want them to."""
THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER CHILDREN
Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker bent her handsome head down and listened.
"""Yes, it is! It certainly is!"" she cried, as she heard for a second time the faint ""tap-tap-tap"" of a tiny beak rapping on the inside of an egg shell. She hopped to one side of her nest and stood looking at the four white eggs that lay there. Soon the rapping was heard again and she saw one of them move a bit on its bed of chips."
"""So it is that one,"" she cried. ""I thought it would be. I was certain that I laid that one first."" And she arched her neck proudly, as the beak of her eldest child came through a crack in the shell. Now nobody else could have told one egg from another, but mothers have a way of remembering such things, and it may be because they love their children so that sometimes their sight is a little sharper, and their hearing a little keener than anybody else's."
"However that may be, she stood watching while the tiny bird chipped away the shell and squeezed out of the opening he had made. She did not even touch a piece of the shell until he was well out of it, for she knew that it is always better for children to help themselves when they can."
"It makes them strong and fits them for life. When the little Red-headed Woodpecker had struggled free, she took the broken pieces in her beak and carried them far from the nest before dropping them to the ground."
"If she had done the easiest thing and let them fall by the foot of the hollow tree where she lived, any prowling Weasel or Blue Jay might have seen them and watched for a chance to reach her babies. And that would have been very sad for the babies."
"The newly hatched bird was a tired little fellow, and the first thing he did was to take a nap. He was cold, too, although the weather was fine and sunshiny. His down was all wet from the moisture inside the egg, and you can imagine how he felt, after growing for so long inside a warm, snug shell, to suddenly be without it and know that he could never again have it around him. Even if it had been whole once more, he could not have been packed into it, for he had been stretching and growing every minute since he left it. It is for this reason that the barn-yard people have a wise saying: ""A hatched chicken never returns to his shell."""
"When Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker came back, she covered her shivering little one with her downy breast, and there he slept, while she watched for her husband's coming, and thought how pleased and proud he would be to see the baby. They were a young couple, and this was their first child."
"But who can tell what the other three children, who had not cracked the shell, were thinking? Could they remember the time when they began to be? Could they dream of what would happen after they were hatched? Could they think at all? They were tiny, weak creatures, curled up within their shells, with food packed all around them. There had been a time when they were only streaks in the yellow liquid of the eggs. Now they were almost ready to leave this for a fuller, freer life, where they could open their bills and flutter their wings, and stretch their legs and necks. It had been a quiet, sheltered time in the shell; why should they leave it? Ah, but they must leave it, for they were healthy and growing, and when they had done so, they would forget all about it. By the time they could talk, and that would be very soon, they would have forgotten all that happened before they were hatched. That is why you can never get a bird to tell you what he thought about while in the egg."
"After the young Woodpecker's three sisters reached the outside world, the father and mother were kept busy hunting food for them, and they were alone much of the time. It was not long before they knew their parents' voices, although, once in a while, before they got their eyes open, they mistook the call of the Tree Frog below for that of the Woodpeckers. And this was not strange, for each says, ""Ker-r-ruck!"
"Ker-r-ruck!"" and when the Tree Frog was singing in his home at the foot of the tree, the four Woodpecker children, in their nest-hollow far above his head, would be opening their bills and stretching their necks, and wondering why no juicy and delicious morsel was dropped down their throats."
"When they had their eyes open there was much to be seen. At least, they thought so. Was there not the hollow in their dear, dry old tree, a hollow four or five times as high as they could reach? Their mother had told them how their father and she had dug it out with their sharp, strong bills, making it roomy at the bottom, and leaving a doorway at the top just large enough for them to pass through. Part of the chips they had taken away, as the mother had taken the broken shells, and part had been left in the bottom of the hollow for the children to lie on. ""I don't believe in grass, hair, and down, as a bed for children,"" their father had said. ""Nice soft chips are far better."""
"And the Woodpecker children liked the chips, and played with them, and pretended that they were grubs to be caught with their long and bony tongues; only of course they never swallowed them."
"It was an exciting time when their feathers began to grow. Until then they had been clothed in down; but now the tiny quills came pricking through their skin, and it was not so pleasant to snuggle up to each other as it had once been. Now, too, the eldest of the family began to show a great fault. He was very vain. You can imagine how sorry his parents were."
Every morning when he awakened he looked first of all at his feathers.
"Those on his breast were white, and he had a white band on his wings."
"His tail and back and nearly the whole of his wings were blue-black. His head, neck, and throat were crimson. To be sure, while the feathers were growing, the colors were not very bright, for the down was mixed with them, and the quills showed so plainly that the young birds looked rather streaked."
"The sisters were getting their new suits at the same time, and there was just as much reason why they should be vain, but they were not. They were glad (as who would not be?) and they often said to each other: ""How pretty you are growing!"" They looked exactly like their brother, for it is not with the Woodpeckers as with many other birds, the sons and daughters are dressed in precisely the same way."
"As for the vain young Woodpecker, he had many troubles. He was not contented to let his feathers grow as the grass and the leaves grow, without watching. No indeed! He looked at each one every day and a great many times every day. Then, if he thought they were not growing as fast as they should, he worried about it. He wanted to hurry them along, and sometimes, when his sisters did not seem to be looking, he took hold of them with his bill and pulled. Of course this did not make them grow any faster and it did make his skin very sore, but how was he to know? He had not been out of the shell long enough to be wise."
"It troubled him, too, because he could not see his red feathers. He twisted his head this way and that, and strained his eyes until they ached, trying to see his own head and neck. It was very annoying. He thought it would have been much nicer to have the brightest feathers in a fellow's tail, where he could see them, or at any rate on his breast; and he asked his mother why it couldn't be so."
"""I once knew a young Woodpecker,"" she said, ""who thought of very little but his own beauty. I am afraid that if he had been allowed to wear his red feathers in his tail, he would never have seen anything else in this wonderful great world, but just his own poor little tail."" She looked out of the doorway as she spoke, but he knew that she meant him."
"Things went on in this way until the children were ready to fly. Then there were daily lessons in flying, alighting, clinging to branches, and tapping for food on the bark of trees. They learned, too, how to support themselves with their stiff tails when they were walking up trees or stopping to eat with their claws hooked into the bark. Then Mrs."
"Red-headed Woodpecker taught them how to tell the ripest and sweetest fruit on the trees before they tasted it. That is something many people would like to know, but it is a forest secret, and no bird will tell anyone who cannot fly."
"It was on his way back from an orchard one day, that the vain young Woodpecker stopped to talk with an old Gray Squirrel. It may be that the Gray Squirrel's sight was not good, and so he mistook the Woodpecker for quite another fellow. He was speaking of an old tree where he had spent the last winter. ""I believe a family of Red-headed Woodpeckers live there now,"" he said. ""I have met them once or twice. The father and mother are fine people, and they have charming daughters, but their son must be a great trial to them. He is one of these silly fellows who see the world through their own feathers."""
"As the young Red-headed Woodpecker flew away, he repeated this to himself: ""A silly fellow, a silly fellow, who sees the world through his own feathers."" And he said to his father, ""Whose feathers must I look through?"""
"This puzzled his father. ""Whose feathers should you look through?"" said he. ""What do you mean?"""
"""Well,"" answered the son, ""somebody said that I saw the world through my own feathers, and I don't see how I can get anybody else's."""
"How his father did laugh! ""I don't see why you should look through any feathers,"" said he. ""What he meant was that you thought so much of your own plumage that you did not care for anything else; and it is so. If it were intended you should look at yourself all the time, your eyes would have been one under your chin and the other in the back of your head."
"""You come rather sharply,"" said the soldier."
"""As you whistle so I come,"" answered the eagle. So he asked her if she knew any means by which he could get away from the world in which they were."
"""You can't get away from here unless you can fly,"" said the eagle, ""but if you will slaughter twelve oxen for me, so that I can have a really good meal, I will try and help you. Have you got a knife?"""
"""No, but I have a sword,"" he said. When the eagle had swallowed the twelve oxen she asked the soldier to kill one more for victuals on the journey. ""Every time I gape you must be quick and fling a piece into my mouth,"" she said, ""else I shall not be able to carry you up to earth."""
"He did as she asked him and hung two large bags of meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers. The eagle then began to flap her wings and off they went through the air like the wind. It was as much as the soldier could do to hold on, and it was with the greatest difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the eagle's mouth every time she opened it."
"At last the day began to dawn, and the eagle was then almost exhausted and began flapping with her wings, but the soldier was prepared and seized the last hind quarter and flung it to her. Then she gained strength and brought him up to earth. When she had sat and rested a while at the top of a large pine-tree she set off with him again at such a pace that flashes of lightning were seen both by sea and land wherever they went."
"Close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle flew home again, but first she told him that if he at any time should want her he need only blow the whistle and she would be there at once."
"In the meantime everything was ready at the palace, and the time approached when the captain and lieutenant were to be married with the two eldest Princesses, who, however, were not much happier than their youngest sister; scarcely a day passed without weeping and mourning, and the nearer the wedding-day approached the more sorrowful did they become."
"At last the King asked what was the matter with them; he thought it was very strange that they were not merry and happy now that they were saved and had been set free and were going to be married. They had to give some answer, and so the eldest sister said they never would be happy any more unless they could get such checkers as they had played with in the blue mountain."
"That, thought the King, could be easily managed, and so he sent word to all the best and cleverest goldsmiths in the country that they should make these checkers for the Princesses. For all they tried there was no one who could make them. At last all the goldsmiths had been to the palace except one, and he was an old, infirm man who had not done any work for many years except odd jobs, by which he was just able to keep himself alive. To him the soldier went and asked to be apprenticed. The old man was so glad to get him, for he had not had an apprentice for many a day, that he brought out a flask from his chest and sat down to drink with the soldier. Before long the drink got into his head, and when the soldier saw this he persuaded him to go up to the palace and tell the King that he would undertake to make the checkers for the Princesses."
"He was ready to do that on the spot; he had made finer and grander things in his day, he said. When the King heard there was some one outside who could make the checkers he was not long in coming out."
"""Is it true what you say, that you can make such checkers as my daughters want?"" he asked."
"""Yes, it is no lie,"" said the goldsmith; that he would answer for."
"""That's well!"" said the King. ""Here is the gold to make them with; but if you do not succeed you will lose your life, since you have come and offered yourself, and they must be finished in three days."""
"The next morning when the goldsmith had slept off the effects of the drink, he was not quite so confident about the job. He wailed and wept and blew up his apprentice, who had got him into such a scrape while he was drunk. The best thing would be to make short work of himself at once, he said, for there could be no hope for his life; when the best and grandest goldsmiths could not make such checkers, was it likely that he could do it?"
"""Don't fret on that account,"" said the soldier, ""but let me have the gold and I'll get the checkers ready in time; but I must have a room to myself to work in,"" he said. This he got, and thanks into the bargain."
"The time wore on, and the soldier did nothing but lounge about, and the goldsmith began to grumble, because he would not begin with the work."
"""Don't worry yourself about it,"" said the soldier, ""there is plenty of time! If you are not satisfied with what I have promised you had better make them yourself."" The same thing went on both that day and the next; and when the smith heard neither hammer nor file from the soldier's room the whole of the last day, he quite gave himself up for lost; it was now no use to think any longer about saving his life, he thought."
But when the night came on the soldier opened the window and blew his whistle. The eagle then came and asked what he wanted.
"""Those gold checkers, which the Princesses had in the blue mountain,"" said the soldier; ""but you'll want something to eat first, I suppose? I have two ox carcases lying ready for you in the hay-loft yonder; you had better finish them,"" he said. When the eagle had done she did not tarry, and long before the sun rose she was back again with the checkers. The soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to sleep."
Early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked at his door.
"""What are you after now again?"" asked the soldier. ""You rush about enough in the day, goodness knows! If one cannot have peace when one is in bed, whoever would be an apprentice here?"" said he."
"Neither praying nor begging helped that time; the goldsmith must and would come in, and at last he was let in."
"And then, you may be sure, there was soon an end to his wailing."
"But still more glad than the goldsmith were the Princesses, when he came up to the palace with the checkers, and gladdest of all was the youngest Princess."
"""Have you made them yourself?"" she asked."
"""No, if I must speak the truth, it is not I,"" he said, ""but my apprentice, who has made them."""
"""I should like to see that apprentice,"" said the Princess. In fact all three wanted to see him, and if he valued his life, he would have to come."
"He was not afraid, either of women-folk or grand-folk, said the soldier, and if it could be any amusement to them to look at his rags, they should soon have that pleasure."
"The youngest Princess recognised him at once; she pushed the soldiers aside and ran up to him, gave him her hand, and said:"
"""Good day, and many thanks for all you have done for us. It is he who freed us from the trolls in the mountain,"" she said to the King. ""He is the one I will have!"" and then she pulled off his cap and showed them the ring she had tied in his hair."
"It soon came out how the captain and lieutenant had behaved, and so they had to pay the penalty of their treachery with their lives, and that was the end of their grandeur. But the soldier got the golden crown and half the kingdom, and married the youngest Princess."
"It looked odd to the English, of course, to see him come into the royal presence, and, leaning his wet umbrella up against the throne, ask the king, ""How's trade?"""
"Franklin never put on any frills, but he was not afraid of a crowned head. He used to say, frequently, that a king to him was no more than a seven-spot."
"He did his best to prevent the Revolutionary War, but he couldn't do it."
"Patrick Henry had said that the war was inevitable, and had given it permission to come, and it came."
"He also went to Paris, and got acquainted with a few crowned heads there. They thought a good deal of him in Paris, and offered him a corner lot if he would build there and start a paper. They also promised him the county printing; but he said, No, he would have to go back to America or his wife might get uneasy about him. Franklin wrote ""Poor Richard's Almanac"" in 1732 to 1757, and it was republished in England."
"Franklin little thought, when he went to the throne-room in his leather riding-clothes and hung his hat on the throne, that he was inaugurating a custom of wearing groom clothes which would in these days be so popular among the English."
"Dr. Franklin entered Philadelphia eating a loaf of bread and carrying a loaf under each arm, passing beneath the window of the girl to whom he afterwards gave his hand in marriage."
"Nearly everybody in America, except Dr. Mary Walker, was once a poor boy."
CHAPTER XVI.
THE CRITICAL PERIOD.
"Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold on the 10th of May led two small companies to Ticonderoga, a strong fortress tremendously fortified, and with its name also across the front door. Ethan Allen, a brave Vermonter born in Connecticut, entered the sally-port, and was shot at by a guard whose musket failed to report. Allen entered and demanded the surrender of the fortress."
"""By whose authority?"" asked the commandant."
"""By the authority of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress,"""
"said Allen, brandishing his naked sword at a great rate."
"""Very well,"" said the officer: ""if you put it on those grounds, all right, if you will excuse the appearance of things. We were just cleaning up, and everything is by the heels here."""
"""Never mind,"" said Allen, who was the soul of politeness. ""We put on no frills at home, and so we are ready to take things as we find them."""
"The Americans therefore got a large amount of munitions of war, both here and at Crown Point."
"General Washington was now appointed commander-in-chief of all the troops at the second session of the Continental Congress. On his arrival at Boston there were only fourteen thousand men. He took command under the historic elm at Cambridge. He was dressed in a blue broadcloth coat with flaps and revers of same, trimmed with large beautiful buttons. He also wore buff small-clothes, with openings at the sides where pockets are now put in, but at that time given up to space. They were made in such a way as to prevent the naked eye from discovering at once whether he was in advance or retreat. He also wore silk stockings and a cocked hat."
"The lines of Dryden starting off ""Mark his majestic fabric"" were suggested by his appearance and general style. He always dressed well and rode a good horse, but at Valley Forge frosted his feet severely, and could have drawn a pension, ""but no,"" said he, ""I can still work at light employment, like being President, and so I will not ask for a pension."""
"Each soldier had less than nine cartridges, but Washington managed to keep General Gage penned up in Boston, and, as Gage knew very few people there, it was a dull winter for him."
"The boys of Boston had built snow hills on the Common, and used to slide down them to the ice below, but the British soldiers tore down their coasting-places and broke up the ice on the pond."
"They stood it a long time, rebuilding their playground as often as it was torn down, until the spirit of American freedom could endure it no longer. They then organized a committee consisting of eight boys who were noted for their great philosophical research, and with Charles Sumner Muzzy, the eloquent savant from Milk Street, as chairman, the committee started for General Gage's head-quarters, to confer with him regarding the matter."
"In the picture Mr. Muzzy is seen addressing General Gage. The boy in the centre with the colored glasses is Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who discovered and first brought into use the idea of putting New Orleans molasses into Boston brown bread. To the left of Mr. Cobb is Mr. Jehoab Nye, who afterwards became the Rev. Jehoab Nye and worked with heart and voice for over eight of the best years of his life against the immorality of the codfish-ball, before he learned of its true relations towards society."
"Above and between these two stands Whomsoever J. Opper, who wrote ""How to make the Garden Pay"" and ""What Responsible Person will see that my Grave is kept green?"" In the background we see the tall form of Wherewithal G. Lumpy, who introduced the Pompadour hair-cut into Massachusetts and grew up to be a great man with enlarged joints but restricted ideas."
"Charles Sumner Muzzy addressed General Gage at some length, somewhat to the surprise of Gage, who admitted in a few well-chosen words that the committee was right, and that if he had his way about it there should be no more trouble."
"Charles was followed by Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who spoke briefly of the boon of liberty, closing as follows: ""We point with pride, sir, to the love of freedom, which is about the only excitement we have. We love our country, sir, whether we love anything else much or not. The distant wanderer of American birth, sir, pines for his country. 'Oh, give me back,' he goes on to say, 'my own fair land across the bright blue sea, the land of beauty and of worth, the bright land of the free, where tyrant foot hath never trod, nor bigot forged a chain. Oh, would that I were safely back in that bright land again!'"""
"Mr. Wherewithal G. Lumpy said he had hardly expected to be called upon, and so had not prepared himself, but this occasion forcibly brought to his mind the words also of the poet, ""Our country stands,"" said he, ""with outstretched hands appealing to her boys; from them must flow her weal or woe, her anguish or her joys. A ship she rides on human tides which rise and sink anon: each giant wave may prove her grave, or bear her nobly on. The friends of right, with armor bright, a valiant Christian band, through God her aid may yet be made, a blessing to our land."""
"General Gage was completely overcome, and asked for a moment to go apart and think it over, which he did, returning with an air which reminded one of ""Ten Nights in a Bar-Room."""
"""You may go, my brave boys; and be assured that if my troops molest you in the future, or anywhere else, I will overpower them and strew the Common with their corses."
Helen H. Gardener.
"LETTER TO THE CLEVELAND CONGRESS OF FREETHINKERS, OCTOBER, 1885."
I send my greetings to the Congress of Freethinkers assembled at
"Cleveland, and regret, more than I can express, that I am unable to"
"be there and hear all the good things you will hear, and see all the"
earnest workers you will see.
The Freethinkers of America ought to be a very proud and enthusiastic
"body, when they have in their presidential chair the ablest orator"
"of modern times, and the broadest, bravest, and most comprehensive"
"intellect that has ever been called ""Mr. President"" in this land of"
bravery and presidents. Washington was a patriot of whom we are all
justly proud. He was liberal in his religion and progressive in his
views of personal rights. And yet he had his limitations. To him liberty
"and personal rights were modified by the words, ""free, white, adult,"
"males."" He got no farther. He who fought for freedom upheld slavery! And"
yet we are all proud and glad to pay honor and respect to the memory of
Washington.
"Abraham Lincoln we place still higher on the roll of honor; for, added"
"to his still more liberal religious views, in his conceptions of freedom"
and justice he had at least two fewer limitations than had the patriot
"of 1776. He struck both ""free"" and ""white"" from his mental black list,"
and gave once more an impulse to liberty that thrilled a nation and gave
fresh dignity to the human race.
Mr. Jobling sank still lower in his seat.
"""In return for that,"" Slyne went on, ""he must sign a clear deliverance"
"from any further claim on any of us, subject, of course, to due payment"
of the note.
"""Then, I want a document drawn up to confirm my engagement to the girl"
and granting me the fullest possible power of attorney on her behalf
both before and after our marriage. She's so simple and inexperienced
that I must do everything for her.
"""And, lastly, you'd better make out a brief private agreement between"
"yourself and me--just as a matter of form, you know--to the effect that"
"you are willing to act in my interests throughout, in return for a"
commission of ten per cent. on the accumulated revenues of the Jura
"estates at the date of my marriage."""
Mr. Jobling looked at him for a time as a man suddenly bereft of his
spine might.
"""There's no time to spare,"" Slyne mentioned. ""I want all that sort of"
thing settled right off the reel--before lunch.
"""If the old man makes any kick about anything, you must back me up in"
all I say. Although if he tries to raise his price by a few thousand
"dollars, we needn't stick at that. The great thing is to get him to sign"
"the deliverance in return for our note. The girl has already agreed--"""
"""And what if _I_ refuse?"" croaked his companion with the courage of"
desperation. It was evident that Mr. Jobling saw through his daring
"scheme. ""What if I insist on my fair share? What if I--"""
Fluffy Reubens winked at the others:
“I don’t see that this chap Anthony Bickersteth’s work is a snap better
than Caroline Baddlesmere’s; and he’s prigged a lot of her ideas----”
"Aubrey turned round to the room, took up a picturesque literary"
"attitude, elbow on mantel, his cheek leaning on his long fingers,"
"legs crossed, essaying to realize the portraits of the thirties, and,"
"rousing from his adoration of himself, he said petulantly:"
"“My dear fluffsome Robbins, I have repeatedly told you that Caroline"
Baddlesmere lacks breadth of view and a man’s humour--to say nothing of
that certain something of subtle atmosphere that is called genius....
You really ought not to give me the trouble of reiterating these simple
truths.... You compel me to feel as blatantly insistent as a bookmaker
on a race-course----”
"He was interrupted by the entrance of the old butler, ushering in"
Bartholomew Doome and Andrew Blotte--Andrew in very much crushed and
"wrinkled evening dress, and looking unutterably shabby, Doome well"
groomed.
Bartholomew Doome laughed:
"“Yes,” said he, “yes, yes--I heard what Aubrey was saying; but Aubrey"
"is a poet, not a critic.”"
Lovegood laughed a funny deep nasal laugh.
But Rippley had turned to the strange figure of Andrew Blotte. He smote
him on the shoulder with strong genial hand:
"months of German occupation, though Vivie, in her solitude at"
"Tervueren, seldom heard them."
After her business at the bank she walked about the town. No one
took any notice of her or annoyed her in any way. The restaurants
"seemed crowded with Belgians as well as Germans, and the Belgians"
did not seem to have lost their appetites. The Palace Hotel had
become a German officers' club. On all the public buildings the
German Imperial flag hung alongside the Belgian. Only a few of the
"trams were running. Yet you could still buy, without much difficulty"
"at the kiosques, Belgian and even French and British newspapers."
From these she gathered that the German forces were in imminent
peril between the Belgian Antwerp army on the north and the British
army advancing from the south; and that in the plains of Alsace the
"French had given the first public exhibition of the new ""Turpin"""
explosive. The results had been _foudroyant_ ... and simple.
Complete regiments of German soldiers had been destroyed in _one
"minute_. It seemed curious, she thought, that with such an arm as"
this the French command did not at once come irresistibly to the
rescue of Brussels....
"However, it was four o'clock, and there was her friend the enemy's"
"automobile drawn up outside the bank, awaiting her. She got in, and"
"the soldier chauffeur whirled her away to the Villa Beau-séjour,"
beyond Tervueren.
On her return she found her mother prostrate with bad news. Their
"nearest neighbour, Farmer Oudekens who had driven them into Brussels"
the preceding day had been executed in his own orchard only an hour
ago. It seemed that the lieutenant in charge of the soldiers
"billeted there had disappeared in the night, leaving his uniform and"
watch and chain behind him. The farmer's story was that in the night
"A month later I received a letter from George, written in cipher, which I"
here give translated:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""I reached Paris three weeks ago and was received by Monsieur Le G."
"most graciously. Although I cannot give definite news, I hope for great"
"improvement in my fortune soon, and perhaps may write you more fully"
thereof before the week is spent.
"""Good fortune has but one meaning for me, of which you already know. I"
beg you to say to one that a letter from her hand would give me greater
"joy than she can know, and that I would now send one to her if I felt"
"safe in so doing. Please send all letters in cipher, addressed: 'Monsieur"
"le Blanc, in care of 'Sieur de Catanet, at the sign of the Double Arrow"
"on the Rue St. Antoine, counting nine doors from the street corner"
nearest the Bastile.'
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"When George wrote that he hoped for good fortune, I knew he had"
"sound reason to expect it, for he was one who never permitted a mere"
"possibility to take the form of hope, nor hope, however assuring, to"
"take the aspect of certainty. Knowing this to be true, I found great"
"joy in the letter, and when I told Frances, she did not pause even to"
"give me one smile of thanks, but broke into a flood of tears and seemed"
to take great happiness in her tribulation.
"I told Frances that we should answer the letter at once, and suggested"
"that she have hers ready in my hands the following day, if she wished to"
from a German mercantile sub-marine. So he says. Fifty francs a
"metre--very, very wide. But they are too much trouble to carry in a"
"knapsack, though their brilliance fascinates."
*       *       *       *       *
"So we stroll and look at the shops, at the filigree gold jewelling of"
"the peasants, at a good bookshop. But there is little to see and"
"therefore the question is, shall we go on? Shall we go forward?"
There are two ways of leaving Cagliari for the north: the State railway
"that runs up the west side of the island, and the narrow-gauge secondary"
railway that pierces the centre. But we are too late for the big trains.
"So we will go by the secondary railway, wherever it goes."
"There is a train at 2.30, and we can get as far as Mandas, some fifty"
miles in the interior. When we tell the queer little waiter at the
"hotel, he says he comes from Mandas, and there are two inns. So after"
lunch--a strictly fish menu--we pay our bill. It comes to sixty odd
"francs--for three good meals each, with wine, and the night's lodging,"
"this is cheap, as prices now are in Italy."
"Pleased with the simple and friendly Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack"
and we walk off to the second station. The sun is shining hot this
"afternoon--burning hot, by the sea. The road and the buildings look dry"
"and desiccated, the harbour rather weary and end of the world."
There is a great crowd of peasants at the little station. And almost
every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great flat strip of
"coarse-woven wool, with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with"
purchases. These are almost the only carrying bags. The men sling them
"over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one"
spirit?”
"“If it's as you say, it's uncanny,” said Risca, unconvinced."
Yet when Sir Oliver and Julia both assured him that Stella never doubted
"his luxurious happiness, and that the ordering of the picture was due to"
"no subtle suggestion, he had to believe them."
"“You always make the mistake, John, of thinking Stellamaris mortal,”"
"said Herold, at the supper-table, for, on receipt of the young men's"
"telegram, the Blounts had deferred their dinner to the later hour of"
"supper. “You are utterly wrong,” said he. “How can she be mortal when"
she talks all day to winds and clouds and the sea-children in their cups
"of foam? She's as elemental as Ariel. When she sleeps, she's really away"
on a sea-gull's back to the Isles of Magic. That's why she laughs at the
"dull, clumsy old world from which she is cut off in her mortal guise."
What are railway-trains and omnibuses to her? What would they be to
"you, John, if you could have a sea-gull's back whenever you wanted to go"
"anywhere? And she goes to places worth going to, by George! What could"
she want with Charing Cross or the Boulevard des Italians? Fancy the
nymph Syrinx at a woman writers' dinner!”
"“I don't know what you 're talking about, Walter,” said Lady Blount,"
whose mind was practical.
"“Syrinx,” said Sir Oliver, oracularly (he was a little, shrivelled man,"
to whose weak face a white moustache and an imperial gave a false air
"of distinction)--“Syrinx,” said he, “was a nymph beloved of Pan,--it's a"
"common legend in Greek mythology,--and Pan turned her into a reed.”"
"“And then cut the reed up into Pan-pipes,” cried Herold, eagerly, “and"
made immortal music out of them--just as he makes immortal music out of

"forth a roll of paper from your breast as you came in.  That action,"
"together with your face, told me much.  You have the gift of a creative"
"fancy.  You have written a poem or a play."""
"""Neither the one nor the other, but a romance,"" answered Grey, the"
colour flushing his face as it flushes that of a maiden when the love of
"her heart is named by her.  ""I scarce know how to call it, but methinks"
it savours more of a romance than of aught besides.  When I was rudely
"awakened from my pleasure-loving life, saw the folly and futility"
"thereof, and desired to amend, I did take a quiet lodging high up in a"
"building off Holborn, and there I did set myself to the task, and right"
"happy was I in it.  I had a score of gold pieces still left me, and my"
"needs I did think modest; though, looking back, they seem many to me"
"now.  The weeks fled by, and my work reached its close.  When my romance"
"was finished, my money was all but spent.  For the past week or more I"
have been seeking a publisher for it.  In my folly I did think that it
would bring me gold as fast as I wanted.  My eyes have been rudely
"opened these last days."""
The Old Lion nodded his head many times.
"""You made a mistake in seeking a publisher, young sir.  You should first"
"have sought a patron."""
"Grey’s face flushed slightly, and he hesitated before he spoke."
"""Others have said the same to me; but there are difficulties.  I have"
not learned to go cap in hand to cringe for patronage to the great ones
"of the earth.""  But, as Grey saw a slight smile flicker in the old man’s"
"eyes, he added rather hastily, ""And then I desire not to be known and"
"With a choked, inarticulate outcry the duke snatched bow and arrow"
"from the nearest sentry, and ere the Pisan could grasp the meaning of"
"what he saw, or prevent, he set and sped the bolt. A moan died on the"
"stillness. A form collapsed, shuddered and lay still."
"The duke dropped bow and arrow, staring like a madman, then rushed"
towards the prostrate form.
"Bending over it, a moan broke from his lips, as he threw his arms"
"about the lifeless clay of her he had loved in the days of yore, ere"
the honeyed treachery of the Frangipani had sundered and broken their
lives. The woman of the Red Tower had expiated her guilt.
He saw at once that no human agency might here avail. Death had been
instantaneous. The arrow had pierced the heart.
"The duke knelt long by her side, and the strong man's frame heaved"
"with convulsive sobs, as he closed the eyes and muttered an Ave for"
her untimely departed soul.
"When he arose, he looked into the pale face of Francesco, whose"
blood-stained sword and garments told a tale his lips would not. He
"understood without a word. Silently he extended his hand to the duke,"
"then, taking off his own mantle, he covered therewith the woman's"
body.
It was midnight when the Pisans and the duke's men groped their way
cautiously down the steep winding path to the shore. The Pisans made
"for their ships and Spoleto's men for the dusk of their native woods,"
carrying on a hurriedly constructed bier the body of the woman of the
Red Tower.
grounded with a coaxial sheath. But there was a clear section that led
"directly down to the CPU. That's where he'd place the blade, and hope"
it'd at least short- circuit the power feed even if it didn't sever the
wires completely.
"He tested the radio transmitter one last time, making sure it would"
"activate the blade, then reached down and clamped the mechanism onto"
"the wire, tightening it with thumb screws. When it was as secure as he"
"could make it, he stood back and examined his handiwork. If somebody"
"decided to remove the faceplate, they'd spot it in a second, but"
otherwise . . .
"Quickly, hands trembling from the cold, he fitted the cover back on the"
module and began replacing the screws with the tiny screwdriver. It
"wasn't magnetized, a deliberate choice, so the small screws kept"
"slipping between his bulky fingers, a problem made more acute by the"
numbing cold.
Three screws to go . . . then he heard the noise. Footsteps on the
aluminum catwalk in the pressure bay above. . . . _Shit_.
"He kept working as fast as he could, grimly holding the screws secure"
and fighting back the numbness and pain in his freezing fingers.
"Only one more. Above, he could hear the sounds of someone checking each"
"of the equipment bays, methodically opening and then resecuring them."
"First the starboard side bay was opened and closed, then the portside"
bay. Now he heard footsteps advancing down the metal stairs leading to
the computer bay. They were five seconds away from discovering him.
The last screw was in.
lacked the strength that was needed to run counter to all. I was no
"knight-errant, but a plain man, and I reeled on through the last hour"
"of the night and the first grey streaks of dawn, with my head on my"
breast and sobs of despair in my throat.
CHAPTER XXV.
NUREMBERG.
If it had been our fate after that to continue our flight in the same
"weary fashion we had before devised, lying in woods by day, and all"
"night riding jaded horses, until we passed the gates of some free"
"city, I do not think that I could have gone through with it. Doubtless"
it was my duty to go with my lady. But the long hours of daylight
"inaction, the slow brooding tramp, must have proved intolerable. And"
"at some time or other, in some way or other, I must have snapped the"
ties that bound me.
"But, as if the loss of my heart had rid us of some spell cast over us,"
"by noon of that day we stood safe. For, an hour before noon, while we"
"lay in a fir-wood not far from Weimar, and Jacob kept watch on the"
"road below, and the rest slept as we pleased, a party of horse came"
"along the way, and made as if to pass below us. They numbered more"
"than a hundred, and Jacob's heart failed him, lest some ring or buckle"
of our accoutrements should sparkle and catch their eyes. To shift the
"burden he called us, and we went to watch them."
'Do they go north or south?' I asked him as I rose.
"steel-grey sea with wistful, far-away eyes."
At his instigation she veiled herself very closely. And he had brought
with him a hooded cloak for Ambrizette. No one took any particular
notice of the inconspicuous party which presently left the Hôtel de
"Paris in a hired car, as if for an excursion along the coast."
At a station fifty miles away they left the car and caught the
"night-mail for Paris. Slyne's baggage was on board it, in the care of a"
"sullen chauffeur, and there were also berths reserved for them all."
"""Did you see any more of Dubois?"" Sallie heard Slyne ask the man, who"
shook his head indifferently in reply.
The long night-journey passed without other incident than a dispute
"between Captain Dove and the sleeping-car attendant, which raged until"
Slyne threatened to have the train stopped at the next station and send
for the police. And the sun was shining brightly when they reached
Paris.
"Mr. Jobling went straight on to London, but Slyne took Sallie and"
"Captain Dove to a quiet but expensive hotel, where they remained for a"
"few days, which passed in a perfect whirl of novelty and excitement for"
"her. And when they in their turn crossed the Channel, she had for"
baggage at least a dozen new trunks containing the choicest spoils of
the Rue de la Paix. Slyne had pooh-poohed all her timid protests against
"his lavish expenditure on her account, and had also provided for Captain"
Dove and Ambrizette in their degree. He had evidently a fortune at his
"disposal, and was bent on showing her how generous he could be."
He was also unostentatiously displaying other good qualities which had
all gone to make those days pass very pleasantly for her. She could not
announced that the prisoner had been placed in cell No. 2. Dawson
"sprang up. ""We will have a look at him through the peephole, and if it"
"is our man--"" One glance was enough. Before me I saw him whom I had"
expected to see. He and his cargo of whisky bottles had reached the
"last stage of their long journey; at one end had been peace, reasonable"
"prosperity, and a happy home; at the other was, perhaps, a rope or a"
bullet.
"Dawson began once more to descant upon his own astuteness, but I was"
too sick at heart to listen. I remembered only the visit years before
"which that man's wife had paid to me. ""Will you not open the parcel?"""
"I interposed. He fell upon it, exposed its contents of bread,"
"chocolate, and sardine tins, and called for a can opener. He shook the"
"tins one by one beside his ear, and then, selecting that which gave"
"out no ""flop"" of oil, stripped it open, plunged his fingers inside,"
and pulled forth a clammy mess of putty and sawdust. In a moment he
had come upon a paper which after reading he handed to me. It bore the
"words in English, ""Informant arrested: dare not send more."""
"""What a fool!"" cried Dawson. ""As if the evidence against him were not"
"sufficient already he must give us this."""
"""You will let that poor devil of a draughtsman down easily?"" I"
murmured.
"""We want him as a witness,"" replied Dawson. ""Tit for tat. If he helps"
"us, we will help him. And now we will cut along to the Admiral. He is"
"eager for news."""
"We broke in upon the Admiral in his office near the shipyards, and he"
"greeted me with cheerful badinage. ""So you are in the hands of the"
"police at last, Copplestone. I always told you what would be the end"
"I took down the address, but I was most ungracious to Eilert. Why couldn't"
he have kept the other knapsack--why this particular one?
Eilert replied that it was true the gentleman had offered him the other
"one, but he could see from the outside that it was not so good as this"
one. And I should remember that the money the missis had paid him hadn't
covered more than the bill for one of them. So it was only reasonable that
"he should take the fullest knapsack. As a matter of fact, he had behaved"
"very well, and that was the truth. Because when she gave him the larger"
"knapsack, and wrote the address, she had scolded, but he had kept quiet,"
"and said not another word. And anyway, nobody had better try it on"
"him--they'd better not, or he'd know the reason why!"
Eilert shook a long-armed fist at the sky.
"When he had eaten, drunk his coffee, and rested for a while, he was not so"
lively and talkative as on the previous day. He had been brooding and
"speculating ever since last summer, when the motor traffic started, and"
"did I think it would be a good idea for him to hire three grown men, too,"
and build a much bigger house than Olaus's?
"So he had caught it, too--the great, modern Norwegian disease!"
"The knapsack was back in her room again; yes, these were her clothes; I"
"recognized her blouses, her skirts and her shoes. I hardly looked at them,"
"of course; just unpacked them, folded them neatly, and put them back in"
the bag again; because no doubt Eilert had had them all out in a heap.
This was really my only reason for unpacking them.
"""Sunderland"" than it had hitherto been, since the distance between"
the two airships was less than a thousand yards and was visibly
decreasing.
"""They're going to take her in tow, by Jove!"" ejaculated Aubyn, who"
had brought his binoculars to play upon the scene.
Oswestry gave a snort that implied disbelief in his brother-officer's
"assertion, but presently he exclaimed:--"
"""Well, blest if you aren't right, old man. And a deuced smart move,"""
"he added, with a true sailor's admiration for a smart manoeuvre,"
whether executed by friend or foe.
"""What a chance for our seaplanes!"" said the torpedo lieutenant."
"""They ought to have been on the spot before this."""
"""They're on the way all right, Torps,"" declared the commander. ""I"
wouldn't mind betting a month's pay that they've spotted their
"quarry. By Jove, they've established communication!"""
The undamaged Zeppelin had circled round her consort and was now
forging gently ahead. An upward jerk of the other's bows announced
that the strain on the towing hawser was beginning to be felt.
"Gradually the hitherto uncontrollable airship began to gather way,"
both vessels rolling sluggishly in the light air-currents.
"The aerial searchlight had now been switched off, but by means of the"
rays directed from the British ships the progress of the two

"in the silvery light, moved slowly in a north-easterly direction."

of dark and plumy cypresses rise among the flat graves of the enclosure.
"In the south, cemeteries are walled off and isolated very tight. The"
"dead, as it were, are kept fast in pound. There is no spreading of"
"graves over the face of the country. They are penned in a tight fold,"
with cypresses to fatten on the bones. This is the one thoroughly
"strange note in the landscape. But all-pervading there is a strangeness,"
"that strange feeling as if the _depths_ were barren, which comes in the"
"south and the east, sun-stricken. Sun-stricken, and the heart eaten out"
by the dryness.
"""I like it! I like it!"" cries the q-b."
"""But could you live here?"" She would like to say yes, but daren't."
We stray back. The q-b wants to buy one of those saddle-bag
arrangements. I say what for? She says to keep things in. Ach! but
"peeping in the shops, we see one and go in and examine it. It is quite a"
"sound one, properly made: but plain, quite plain. On the white"
cross-stripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and
magenta: the three favorite Sardinian colors: nor are there any of the
fantastic and griffin-like beasts. So it won't do. How much does it
cost? Forty-five francs.
There is nothing to do in Mandas. So we will take the morning train and
"go to the terminus, to Sorgono. Thus, we shall cross the lower slopes of"
"the great central knot of Sardinia, the mountain knot called"
Gennargentu. And Sorgono we feel will be lovely.
"Back at the station we make tea on the spirit lamp, fill the thermos,"
"pack the knapsack and the kitchenino, and come out into the sun of the"
"platform. The q-b goes to thank the black-cap for the white bread,"
"reward in the proverbial ""nice young man."""
"Mr. White agreed with her on every point but this. ""If she deserted"
that household it would fall! She's the only one that isn't like her
"father."""
"""Then she must find someone who'll take the family with her,"" Mrs."
White asserted determinedly. But having no godmother's fairy wand she
"had not been able, during the summer weeks, to bring the prince to"
Edgeacres; her husband's acquaintances were too bald and round to play
the part of princes.
Trude had not minded the dearth of young men. Since her unhappy
experience on a former visit she was glad of that dearth. The serenity
"of the summer, the relaxation and rest from responsibilities had"
"brought a lovely freshness to her face, a brightness to her eyes that"
was not all a reflection of the brightness about her. The sheer luxury
"of loafing, of not having to think out petty problems or worry one"
"single minute was all her old-young heart now asked. Once in awhile, of"
"course, she fretted because Isolde was not enjoying Edgeacres with her,"
or getting to know how really nice Aunt Edith White was. Where Vick and
"Sidney were concerned she had no remorse for Vick was seeing new lands,"
"doubtless conquering them, and Sidney was happy at Cape Cod; but she"
could not help thinking that Issy must be working too hard at the
Deerings--getting up early in the morning and typing all through the
hot day and doubtless fussing over the housework and the small babies
as well.
Trude thought of the mail. Again there had been no letter from either
Issy or Sidney! Sidney really _ought_ to write. Perhaps it _had_ not
been wise to let her go off alone with relatives of whom they knew
nothing!

against the eastern sky.
"""How far?"" queried Francesco."
The goatherd was anointing himself with spittle.
"""Each mile in these parts grows more evil,"" he said, tracing the sign"
"of the cross. ""It behooves a Christian to be circumspect!"""
Francesco prodded him with his scabbard.
"""How far?"""
"""Some ten leagues,"" replied the gnome. ""The day is clear, and the"
"place looks nearer than it is!"""
"It occurred to Francesco that there must be some human abode close by,"
"as the goatherd, entirely familiar with the region, would not wander"
too far from habitations of the living. And upon having made known his
"request, the little man preceded him at a lively pace. At a lodge in"
"the forest deeps they halted, and here Francesco and his guide rested"
"during the hot hours of noon, partaking of such food as the liberality"
"of their host, an old anchorite, set before them."
"After men and steed had rested, they set out anew."
"The goatherd's inclination to invoke untold saints, whenever there"
"seemed occasion and whenever there was not, was curbed by a hard line"
"round Francesco's lips, and they plunged into the great silence. A"
"sense of green mystery encompassed them, as they traversed the green"
forest-aisles. The sky seemed to have receded to a greater distance.
"fain hope that some day I may see him again."""
"""You had speech with him?  You saw his manner and his port?  Tell"
"me—show me—how did he carry himself?"""
"Grey rose to his feet, laughing.  He humoured the whim of the old actor."
"He was not lacking in the histrionic gift, and threw himself into his"
"part with good will.  He uttered quick commands, as though to his"
"officers; he threw out his arms, as though directing one man here,"
"another there.  He recalled numbers of words spoken by the General, and"
these he reproduced faithfully and with an excellent imitation of
"Marlborough’s polished, courteous, yet commanding air.  Then he let his"
"face soften, and addressed the old man as he himself had been addressed,"
"with words of thanks and with promises of friendship.  Finally, throwing"
"off the mask, he broke into a laugh, and was astonished at the eager"
change which had come upon the Old Lion.
"""Boy!"" he cried, with a new access of energy, ""I trow I see for both of"
"us a way to fame and fortune."""
Grey’s eyes lighted as he eagerly asked his meaning.
"""That is soon told.  Have you heard how, after the victory of Blenheim,"
none could be found to hymn the praises of the great General till the
"poet Addison was introduced to notice, and penned his immortal lines?"
"Now, since the victory of Ramillies, I have burned with desire to show"
the world by somewhat more than verse alone the power and genius of
"England’s mighty soldier.  See here!"""
"The old man rose and crossed to his table, where he fetched from a"
"drawer a scroll covered with writing, which he put in the hands of his"
"companion.  Grey saw that it was a dialogue cast in dramatic form, and"
finger-bowls.
The name of the other waitress was Tildy. Why do you suggest Matilda?
"Please listen this time—Tildy—Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and"
too anxious to please to please. Repeat the last clause to yourself
"once or twice, and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite."
"The Voice at Bogle’s was invisible. It came from the kitchen, and did"
"not shine in the way of originality. It was a heathen Voice, and"
contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the
waitresses concerning food.
Will it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful? Had she
donned a few hundred dollars’ worth of clothes and joined the Easter
"parade, and had you seen her, you would have hastened to say so"
yourself.
The customers at Bogle’s were her slaves. Six tables full she could
wait upon at once. They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience
"for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving, graceful figure."
They who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the
light of her smiles. Every man there—and they were mostly men—tried to
make his impression upon her.
Aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once.
"And every smile that she sent forth lodged, like pellets from a"
"scatter-gun, in as many hearts. And all this while she would be"
"performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans, pot roasts,"
"ham-and, sausage-and-the-wheats, and any quantity of things on the iron"
and in the pan and straight up and on the side. With all this feasting
and flirting and merry exchange of wit Bogle’s came mighty near being a
"salon, with Aileen for its Madame Récamier."
"gumming up their dope. Well, it's about time to plug in on E2. Here's"
"where the fireworks start!"" He closed the connections which transferred"
the central portion of the upper lookout screen to a small micrometer
screen at Breckenridge's desk and plugged it into the first
"check-station. Instantly a point of red light, surrounded by a vivid"
"orange circle, appeared upon the screen, low down and to the left of"
"center, and the timing galvanometer showed a wide positive deflection."
"""Hashed again!"" growled Breckenridge. ""I must be losing my grip,"
"I guess. I put everything I had on that sight, and missed it ten"
divisions. I think I'll turn in my badge--I've cocked our perfect curve
"already, before we got to the first check-station!"" His hands moved"
"toward the controls, to correct their course and acceleration."
"""As you were--hold everything! Lay off those controls!"" snapped the"
"computer. ""There's something screwy, just as I thought--and it isn't"
"you, either. I'm no pilot, of course, but I do know good compensation"
"when I see it, and if you weren't compensating that point I never saw it"
"done. Besides, with your skill and my figures I know darn well that we"
aren't off more than a tenth of one division. He's cuckoo! Don't call
"him--let him start it, and refer him to me."""
"""All x--I'll be only too glad to pass the buck. But I still think,"
"Steve, that you're playing with dynamite. Who ever heard of an"
"astronomer being wrong?"""
"""You'd be surprised,"" grinned the physicist, ""Since this fuss has"
"just started, nobody has tried to find out whether they were wrong"
"or not...."""

"anything worth noting, from our biggest provision dealer to our latest"

There was a touch of genuine anxiety in her voice that was almost
"pathetic, but Villiers made no attempt to soothe her wounded vanity."
"""I have no recollection whatever of the name,"" he said bluntly--""But"
"that is easily accounted for, as I never read newspaper descriptions of"
"celebrities. So you are an 'interviewer' for the Press?"""
"""Exactly!"" and the lady leaned back more comfortably in the Louis"

"enumerated,--""I want to describe his personal appearance,--to know when"
"he was born, and where he was educated,--whether his father or mother"
"had literary tastes,--whether he had, or has, brothers or sisters, or"
"both,--whether he is married, or likely to be, and how much money he"
"has made by his book."" She paused and gave an upward glance at"
"Villiers, who returned it with a blank and stony stare."

methods of work;--WHERE he gets his ideas and HOW he elaborates
"them,--how many hours he writes at a time, and whether he is an early"
He saw not the rival queens of beauty in their gorgeous apparel.  He saw
"not the surging crowd that eddied around them, appraising, flattering,"
"admiring, laughing.  He only saw one white figure, standing aloof and"
"for the moment alone, the moonbeams glimmering upon the shining"
"whiteness of her dress, the fair face bent, as though in some sort of"
"sorrow or shame.  He saw it, and he was instantly at her side."
"Whether or not he spoke, he knew not.  He offered his arm, and the next"
"moment he was leading her away from that giddy, mocking crowd; and he"
felt the clinging clasp of her fingers thrilling him to his heart’s
core.  He heard the breath of relief as the chorus of flippant merriment
"died away in the distance. He paused, and a quick exclamation escaped"
his lips.
"""This is no place for you, Lady Geraldine.  Why do they bring you"
"hither?"""
"She answered not, but turned her gaze for a moment towards him, and then"
"dropped her eyes. With an impulse for which he could not account, he"
"covered the fingers which lay upon his arm with his own disengaged hand,"
and passionate words sprang to his lips.
"""Give me only the right, fair lady, and I will save you from them all."
I ask only to live and die as your knight—your champion—without
"wages—without reward!"""
Then he was silent.  His breath came thick and fast.  He felt the quiver
"of the hand he held.  He knew not how long the silence lasted, it was so"
"strangely sweet, so full of mysterious meaning."
"""I thank you, sir.  I trow that you speak truth, and that your words are"
not idle froth—gone in a moment—as the words of so many of yonder
face had lighted at the girl’s words.
"""Methought I had come to a world where naught was dreamed of save"
"fashion and frippery, false adulation and falser scorn.  I am well-nigh"
"stunned by the clamour of tongues, the strife of parties, the bustle of"
"this gay life of fashion."""
"""Oh, and I too—I too!"" breathed the girl softly: and he flashed at her a"
"quick, keen glance of sympathy and interest."
"""I was bred in the country; my grandam brought me up.  I lived with my"
"books, amid silvan solitudes, the songs of birds, the scent of flowers."
This great glittering world of folly and fashion is like a fiery wheel
"going round in my head.  Ofttimes I could cry aloud for mercy, the pain"
and bewilderment are so great.  I know there must be noble men and good
"in this strange Pandemonium; but I know not where to find them, and my"
heart grows sick.  Would that I could go back to my books and my dreams!
"But alas! a maiden may not choose for herself."""
"""Still there is life here,"" spoke Grey quickly, ""and it behoves us to"
know men as well as books.  I have studied both.  I will study them
"again.  I would fain learn all that life has to teach, whether for weal"
or woe.  No hermit-monk was ever truly a man. Yet there be times when
"one shrinks in amaze from all one sees and hears."""
The chord of sympathy was struck.  They passed from one thing to
another.  She found one at last who knew and loved the poets of her
"childhood’s dreams—who could talk of Spenser and Sidney, of Watson,"
"Greville, and Drayton, quoting their verses, and often lighting upon her"
"favourite passages.  Here was a man who knew Milton and Clarendon,"

Clear days and clear nights followed each other. Sometimes a train would
"stop in front of the C.C.S., hissing and puffing, and throwing up a"
"great shaft of light. We would curse it, fearing that it would attract"
German raiders.
If only the fine weather would come to an end! Give us wind and rain so
that we could lie in bed without being oppressed by anxiety! But the sun
continued to shine and the stars to glitter.
"The disaster that had befallen the adjoining C.C.S., which had been"
"brilliantly lit up during the raid, had acted as a warning example to"
us. At nightfall the windows of the theatre were screened with blankets
and no lights were allowed to show in the wards or on the duckboards.
If only the trains would halt somewhere else at night-time!
One day a number of Flemish peasants began to collect hop-refuse in the
surrounding fields. They made three great heaps of it and set fire to
"them. In the evening the heaps were burning brightly, but no one took"
any notice.
The canteen was crowded. All the benches were occupied and men who were
unable to find seats stood around in groups. There was noisy
conversation and singing and shouting. Nearly everyone was drinking
beer. Those who sat at the tables were playing cards. The air was thick
with tobacco-smoke. Two or three candles were burning on every table.
"And all at once, without any warning, the thunder was loosened upon us."
"There was an ear-splitting roar and in a moment candles were swept away,"
"benches and tables overturned, and the whole crowd of men was down on"
"the floor, trembling and panic-stricken. Another detonation, and then"
aside o' me an' smothers me with earth. Then another'n bursts an' I
"'ears a man 'oller out--krikey, 'e didn't 'alf scream. I gets up and"
"another'n bursts, so I flops down agin, but it didn't come so near that"
time. I waits a bit an' then I gets up an' goes to see what they done. I
"couldn't see nothin' at first, but I sees some fellers runnin' about wi'"
"lights. There was a noise in one o' the wards, so I goes in. A bomb must"
'a' burst on the roof--there was a big 'ole in the canvas. The bed
"underneath was all twisted an' torn, but there wasn't nobody in it."
"There was some wounded lyin' in beds at the fur end of the ward, an' one"
of 'em was cryin' somethin' chronic. Then someone brings a light an' I
sees an orderly lyin' by the side o' the bed with a big 'ole in 'is face
an' the blood pourin' out. I goes roun' to the other side--gorblimy--an'
there I sees the Sister lyin' on the floor with 'er 'ead blown clean

Private Trotter was trembling in every limb. He was the pluckiest man I
ever knew and capable of any piece of foolhardy daring. But this time he
was near a nervous breakdown.
"We went to bed full of anxiety. For a long while we lay awake, straining"
our ears to catch the sound of firing or the drone of German propellers.
"But no sound broke the stillness of the night, and one by one we dropped"
off to sleep.
The next morning was clear and sunny. The sky remained blue all day. Not
"a cloud could be seen. ""Our turn next""--that was the thought in"
everybody's mind.
The evening was starlit once again. As we lay on the floor of the
"marquee, wrapped up in our blankets, we heard the sound of bombing and"
"'This is the place,' Steve muttered. 'It will be dawn in another hour."
"What do you think, Master Martin?'"
"'That we had better get off the road,' I answered. 'Take it they found"
him at midnight; the orderly's patience would scarcely last longer.
"Then, if they started after us a quarter of an hour later, they should"
be here in another twenty minutes.'
"'It is an aguey place,' he said doubtfully."
"'It will suit us better than the camp,' I answered."
"No one else expressed an opinion, and Steve, taking my lady's rein,"
led her horse on until he came to the hollow part of the road. Here
"the moonlight disclosed a kind of water-lane, running away between the"
"osiers, at right angles from the road. Steve turned into it, leading"
"my lady's horse, and in a moment was wading a foot deep in water. The"
"Waldgrave followed, then the women. I came last, with Marie's rein in"
"my hand. We kept down the lane about one hundred and fifty paces, the"
"horses snorting and moving unwillingly, and the water growing ever"
"deeper. Then Steve turned out of it, and began to advance, but more"
"cautiously, parallel with the road."
"We had waded about as far in this direction, sidling between the"
"stumps and stools as well as we could, when he came again to a stand"
"and passed back the word for me. I waded on, and joined him. The"
"osiers, which were interspersed here and there with great willows,"
rose above our heads and shut out the moonlight. The water gurgled
"black about our knees. Each step might lead us into a hole, or we"
might trip over the roots of the osiers. It was impossible to see a
"foot before us, or anything above us save the still, black rods and"
"again, would explain nothing, and name no quarter from which help"
"might come. All the afternoon the camp lay grilling in the sunshine,"
and in the shuttered room in the middle of it my lady suffered. Had
the house lain by the river she might have tried to escape; but the
"camp girdled it on three sides, and on the fourth, where a swampy"
"inlet guarded one flank of the village, a deep ditch as well as the"
morass forbade all passage.
She remained in her room until she heard the unwelcome sounds which
"told of the general's return. Then she came into the outer room, her"
"eyes glittering, a red spot on either cheek, all pretence at an end."
"Her glance withered Fraulein Max, who sat blinking in a corner with a"
"very evil conscience. And to Marie Wort, when the girl came near her"
"on the pretence of adjusting her lace sleeves, she had only one word"
to say.
"'You slut!' she hissed, her breath hot on the girl's cheek. 'If you"
fail me I will kill you. Begone out of my sight!'
"The child, excited before, broke down at that, and, bursting into a"
"fit of weeping, ran out. Her sobs were still in the air when General"
Tzerclas entered.
"The Countess's face was flushed, and her bearing, full of passion and"
"defiance, must have warned him what to expect, if he felt any doubt"
"before. The sun was just setting, the room growing dusk. He stood"
"awhile, after saluting her, in doubt how he should come to the point,"
or in admiration; for her scorn and anger only increased her beauty
"and his feeling for her. At length he pointed lightly to the women,"
who kept their places by the door.
"'Is it your wish, fair cousin,' he said slowly, 'that I should speak"
Our talk began over Mr. Bruce Smith's notice of motion in the Australian
Parliament.
"'Yes, I have seen the proposal,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'and I am very"
glad an Australian representative has taken up the question. He proposes
to amend the Immigration Restriction Act so as to permit Japanese to
enter the Commonwealth. The reason given is that Japan has placed
"herself in the front rank of nations, has granted religious freedom, has"
"established consulates, and become the honoured ally of Great Britain. I"
understand that Australian papers are saying there is no chance of the
motion being carried. I care not whether the motion is carried or not
this time. Of one thing I am certain--it will be carried eventually.
'What reason has Australia for shutting out the Japanese?'
"'The dread of cheaper labour and of the ""Yellow Peril,"" as it is called."
"Whatever there be in that, it certainly does not apply to the Japanese."
"This is already being realised in Australia, as Mr. Bruce Smith's motion"
shows. The Japanese are making it clear that they have to be regarded by
Europeans in a different light from the rest of Asiatics. Europeans
consider themselves superior to all other races. I do not blame them for
"thinking that, for of modern civilisations theirs is certainly the best."
"But with the exception of the British people, Europeans have not yet"
realised that modern Japan is built up on European methods. She has no
"more to do with the so-called ""Yellow Peril"" than America has. She takes"
"her place by the side of the other powers, with very much the same"
civilisation as theirs. England having been the first to recognise the
"new Japan, I am certain her colonies will soon follow. That is why I"
feel it is only a question of time before Australia excludes Japan from
its Restriction Act.'
"And the people answered her, and told her who it was. And when she"
"heard, she fell down upon the road as one dead: for it was her father"
"and mother who had died yesterday, and it was their funeral train that"
"she saw. They were all dead now, husband and sons and father and mother;"
in all the world she was quite alone.
"So she went mad, for her trouble was more than she could bear. She threw"
"off all her clothes, and let down her long hair and wrapped it about her"
"naked body, and walked about raving."
"At last she came to where the Buddha was teaching, seated under a"
"fig-tree. She came up to the Buddha, and told him of her losses, and how"
she had no one left; and she demanded of the Buddha that he should
restore to her those that she had lost. And the Buddha had great
"compassion upon her, and tried to console her."
"'All die,' he said; 'it comes to everyone, king and peasant, animal and"
man. Only through many deaths can we obtain the Great Peace. All this
"sorrow,' he said, 'is of the earth. All this is passion which we must"
"get rid of, and forget before we reach heaven. Be comforted, my"
"daughter, and turn to the holy life. All suffer as you do. It is part of"
"our very existence here, sorrow and trouble without any end.'"
"But she would not be comforted, but demanded her dead of the Buddha."
"Then, because he saw it was no use talking to her, that her ears were"
"deaf with grief, and her eyes blinded with tears, he said to her that he"
would restore to her those who were dead.
"'You must go,' he said, 'my daughter, and get some mustard-seed, a pinch"
"of mustard-seed, and I can bring back their lives. Only you must get"
this seed from the garden of him near whom death has never come. Get
vulgarly self-assertive. Be righteous. Let your words and deeds
correspond. Lead no double life. Proclaim what you think right.
IDEAL OF KINGSHIP
The Indian ideal of kingship will be clear to you if I recite the
invocation with which we crowned our kings from the Vedic Times:
"""Be with us. We have chosen thee"
Let all the people wish for thee
Stand steadfast and immovable
Be like a mountain unremoved
"And hold thy kingship in thy grasp."""
"We have chosen thee, our prayers have consecrated thee, for all the"
wishes of the people went with thee. Thou art to stand as mountain
"unremoved, for thy throne is planted secure on the hearts of thy people."
"Stand steadfast then, for we have endowed thee with power irresistible."
Fall therefore not away; but let thy sceptre be held firmly in thy
grasp.
"Which is more potent, Matter or Spirit? Is the power with which the"
people endow their king identical with the power of wealth with which we
enrich him by paying him his Royal dues? We make him irresistible not by
"wealth but by the strength of our lives, the strength of our mind, may,"
"we have to pay him more according to our ancient Lawgivers, in as much"
"as the eighth part of our deeds and virtues, and the merit we have"
ourselves acquired. We can only make him irresistible by the strength of
"our lives, the strength of our minds, and the strength that comes out of"
righteousness.
"Slyne was not beyond feeling somewhat ashamed of himself, but found easy"
solace in the reflection that all he had said was for her good as well
as his own. He could see that his last brutal argument had struck home.
"For Sallie could no longer doubt, now, in the lurid light of her recent"
"experiences, that Captain Dove looked upon her as a mere chattel, to be"
turned into cash as soon as occasion should offer.
"In a little she looked up at him again out of pleading, desperate eyes."
Some most unusual impulse of pity stirred him. She was only a young girl
"yet, and her helplessness spoke its own appeal, even to him. He made up"
"his mind again, quite apart from any question of policy, to deal with"
her as generously as might be practicable.
"""Will Captain Dove let me go now if I promise to marry you, Jasper?"" she"
asked. And he nodded solemnly.
"""And not unless I do?"" she insisted. ""You _know_ I didn't--before,"
"although you say I did."""
"""I swear to God, Sallie,"" he declared, ""that I can't raise the money the"
Old Man wants any other way. And--I won't say another word about what's
past and done with.
"""If you'll really promise to marry me,"" he said eagerly, ""I'll prove to"
you that all I have told you is true before you need even leave Captain
Dove; I won't ask you to go a step farther with me until you're
perfectly satisfied; I'll take you safely to your own home as soon as
you _are_ satisfied that you can trust me. And I won't ask you to keep
"your promise till--"""
An irrepressible light of longing had leaped up behind the despair in
her eyes.
"After they had eaten, the king's daughter said: ""O, do look at the"
"handsome apples up there on the tree! If you were really kind, you would"
"fetch me down a couple of them!"" The youth was not lazy, and climbed up."
"But he had forgotten his table-cloth and his purse, and these she took."
And while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off. She at once
"put it on and wished herself back in her own room, and there she was"
that minute.
"""You might have known it,"" said the youth to himself, and hurried down"
the tree. He began to cry and did not know what to do. And as he was
"sitting there, he sampled the apples which he had thrown down. No sooner"
"had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head, and when he"
"looked more closely, he had a pair of horns. ""Well, now it can do me no"
"more harm,"" said he, and calmly went on eating the apples. But suddenly"
"the horns had disappeared, and he was as before. ""Good enough!"" said the"
"youth. And with that he put the apples in his pocket, and set out to"
search for the king's daughter.
"He went from city to city, and sailed from country to country; but it"
"was a long journey, and lasted a year and a day, and even longer."
"But one day he got there after all. It was a Sunday, and he found out"
that the king's daughter was at church. Then he sat himself down with
"his apples before the church door, and pretended to be a peddler."
"""Apples of Damascus! Apples of Damascus!"" he cried. And sure enough, the"
"king's daughter came, and told her maidens to go and see what desirable"
"things the peddler from abroad might have to offer. Yes, he had apples"
"of Damascus. ""What do the apples give one?"" asked the maiden. ""Wisdom"
"and beauty!"" said the peddler, and the maiden bought."
"When the king's daughter had eaten of the apples, she had a pair of"
horns. And then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was
other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other
"during the lecture, but not _my_ sister! She hung on every word, took"
"notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser"
really work in those orientation periods.
"""I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,"" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,"
"""but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro"
Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand
"square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of"
"tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that--Wait, I remember"
something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an
edible one. The wild _dunging_ drug is harvested there by criminal
"speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing"
"in recent years. In fact--"""
"""Pardon me, sir,"" I broke in, ""but doesn't _dunging_ come only from"
Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?
"You remember, purser--Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the"
"island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?"""
"The purser nodded slowly. ""I forgot,"" he admitted. ""Sorry, ladies, but"
"the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes."""
"But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one."
"She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while"
I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture
of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the
opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out
with her.
"""Ferdinand,"" Sis said, ""let's go back to our cabin."""
Johnson was strangely silent. He was wondering how his coming there
to-night had really come about. But he could find no solution to the
problem unless it was in response to that perverse instinct which
prompts us all at times to do the very thing which in our hearts we know
"to be wrong. The Girl, meanwhile, after a final creasing of the"
"neatly-folded cover, started for the cupboard, stopping on the way to"
pick up various articles which the wind had strewn about the room.
Flinging them quickly into the cupboard she now went over to the window
"and once more attempted to peer out into the night. But as before, it"
was of no avail. With a shrug she straightened the curtains at the
windows and started for the door. Her action seemed to quicken his
"decision, for, presently, with a gesture of resignation, he threw down"
his hat and coat on the table and said as if speaking to himself:
"""Well, it is Fate--my Fate that has always made the thing I shouldn't do"
"so easy."" And then, turning to the Girl, he added: ""Come, Girl, as you"
"say, if I can't go, I can't. But I know as I stand here that I'll never"
"give you up."""
The Girl looked puzzled.
"""Why, what do you mean?"""
"""I mean,"" began Johnson, pacing the floor slowly. Now he stopped by a"
"chair and pointed as though to the falling snow. ""Suppose we say that's"
an omen--that the old trail is blotted out and there is a fresh road.
"Would you take it with me a stranger, who says: From this day I mean to"
be all you'd have me. Would you take it with me far away from here and
"forever?"""
It did not take the Girl long to frame an answer. Taking Johnson's hand
she said with great feeling:
"to which, thanks to the Captain's co-operation, he had fallen."
"""Now, then, my friend!"" said the Captain, glancing critically at the"
"restored client, ""we have a coat and jacket.  When I had respectable"
trousers I lived in town like a respectable man.  But when the trousers
"wore out, I too fell off in the opinion of my fellow-men and had to"
"come down here from the town.  Men, my fine mannikin, judge everything"
"by the outward appearance, while, owing to their foolishness, the"
actual reality of things is incomprehensible to them.  Make a note of
"this on your nose, and pay me at least half your debt.  Go in peace;"
"seek, and you may find."""
"""How much do I owe you, Aristid Fomich?"" asks the client, in confusion."
"""One rouble and 70 kopecks....  Now, give me only one rouble, or, if"
"you like, 70 kopecks, and as for the rest, I shall wait until you have"
"earned more than you have now by stealing or by hard work, it does not"
"matter to me."""
"""I thank you humbly for your kindness!"" says the client, touched to the"
"heart.  ""Truly you are a kind man....; Life has persecuted you in"
"vain....  What an eagle you would have been in your own place!"""
The Captain could not live without eloquent speeches.
"""What does 'in my own place' mean?  No one really knows his own place"
"in life, and every one of us crawls into his harness.  The place of the"
"merchant Judas Petunikoff ought to be in penal servitude, but he still"
"walks through the streets in daylight, and even intends to build a"
factory. The place of our teacher ought to be beside a wife and
"half-a-dozen children, but he is loitering in the public-house of"
"Vaviloff.  And then, there is yourself.  You are going to seek a"
"old, old babies inside. She holds up a lace parasol; he sucks the knob"
"of his cane, and the fat old bodies roll together as the cradle rocks,"
and the steaming horse leaves a trail of manure as it ambles down the
hill.
"Under a tree, Professor Leonard, in cap and gown, stands beside his"
"banner. He is here “for one day,” from the London, Paris and Brussels"
"Exhibition, to tell your fortune from your face. And he stands, smiling"
"encouragement, like a clumsy dentist. When the big men, romping and"
"swearing a moment before, hand across their sixpence, and stand before"
"him, they are suddenly serious, dumb, timid, almost blushing as the"
Professor’s quick hand notches the printed card. They are like little
"children caught playing in a forbidden garden by the owner, stepping"
from behind a tree.
The top of the hill is reached. How hot it is! How fine it is! The
"public-house is open, and the crowd presses in. The mother sits on the"
"pavement edge with her baby, and the father brings her out a glass of"
"dark, brownish stuff, and then savagely elbows his way in again. A reek"
"of beer floats from the public-house, and a loud clatter and rattle of"
voices.
"The wind has dropped, and the sun burns more fiercely than ever."
Outside the two swing-doors there is a thick mass of children like
flies at the mouth of a sweet-jar.
"And up, up the hill come the people, with ticklers and golliwogs, and"
"roses and feathers. Up, up they thrust into the light and heat,"
"shouting, laughing, squealing, as though they were being pushed by"
"something, far below, and by the sun, far ahead of them—drawn up into"
"the full, bright, dazzling radiance to... what?"
"that day, despite the fact that Big George, bruised, ragged, and torn,"
doubled his force of pickets and took personal charge of them.
"That night, under glaring headlines, the evening papers told the story,"
"reporting one fisherman fatally hurt, one striker dead of a gunshot"
"wound, and many others injured."
CHAPTER XVIII
WILLIS MARSH SPRINGS A TRAP
"The ensuing days were strenuous ones for the partners, working as they"
"did, with a crippled force and under constant guard. Riot was in the"
"air, and violence on every side. By the police, whose apathy"
disappeared only when an opportunity occurred of arresting the men they
"were supposed to protect, they were more handicapped than helped. The"
appearance of a fisherman at any point along the water-front became a
sure signal for strife.
"Day by day the feeling on both sides grew stronger, till the non-union"
"men were cemented together in a spirit of bitterest indignation, which"
materially lessened their zeal for work. Every act of violence
"intensified their rage. They armed themselves, in defiance of orders,"
"tossed restraint to the winds, and sought the slightest opportunity of"
wreaking vengeance upon their enemies. Nor were the rioters less
"determined. Authority, after all, is but a hollow shell, which, once"
"broken, is quickly disintegrated. Fierce engagements took place,"
"back of her hand with a most unchildlike gesture, and forthwith"
concealed it in her silken _faja_. Then she laid her hand once more on
the Sergeant's arm.
"""You will lead us, will you not, José Maria?"" she said pleadingly. ""I"
can trust you. You have done many great deeds. My nurse was a woman of
Ronda and told me of your exploits on the road from Madrid to Sevilla.
You will lead us to-night. Only you must leave these three in the palace
"to me. If you will, you shall have also my share of the plunder. But"
"what do I say, I know you are too noble to think only of that--as these"
"wolves do!"""
She cast a haughty glance around upon the gipsies at their card-play.
"""I, that am of Old Castile and noble by four descents, have demeaned"
"myself to mix with _Gitanos_,"" she said, ""but it has only been that I"
might work out my revenge. I told Pépe there of my plan. I showed him
"the way. He was afraid. He told ten men, and they were afraid. Fifty,"
"and they were afraid. Now there are a hundred and more, and were it not"
"that they know that all lies open and unguarded, even I could not lead"
"them thither. But they will follow you, because you are José Maria of"
"Ronda."" The Sergeant took the girl's hand in his. She was shaking as"
"with an ague fit, but her eyes, blue and mild as a summer sky, had that"
within them which was deadlier than the tricksome slippery demon that
"lurks in all black orbs, whether masculine or feminine."
"""Chica,"" he said, ""your wrongs are indeed bitter. I would give much to"
help you to set the balance right. Perhaps I may do so yet. But I cannot
be the commander of these men. They are not of my folk or country. They
have not even asked me to lead them. They are jealous of me! You see it
"as well as I!"""
Something was wrong. The shelling of the back-areas continued; air-raids
became more and more frequent. These were ominous signs.
Then the newspapers arrived. The Somme front had collapsed. The Fifth
Army was in full retreat. The Germans had taken Bapaume and Peronne and
were threatening Amiens.
*       *       *       *       *
Had I been living in Germany during the war I would have felt a powerful
"tendency to defend the cause of the Allies, to excuse their misdeeds, to"
"overrate their ability, while being highly critical and censorious of"
every German shortcoming.
"A nation at war is a mob whose very blatancy, injustice and cruelty"
drive one to hatred and opposition. The enemy mob seems less detestable
"because it is out of sight and one thinks almost involuntarily: ""It"
"cannot be as bad as our own."""
I could not bear to hear a victory joyfully announced. The jubilation
"and the self-glorification of the crowd filled me with loathing, and I"
could only think of the intensified slaughter and misery that are the
"price of every victory. They who pay the price, they alone have the"
"right to rejoice, but they do not rejoice. The German mob revealed its"
depravity when it hung out flags in the streets to celebrate the first
"German victories. And, when the first battle of Cambrai was won, London"
jeered at the bereaved and mocked the dead by ringing the joy-bells.
Every genuine patriot is called a traitor in his own country. But
"patriotism, however genuine, is a thing that must be surmounted. There"
"is only one good that war can bring to a nation--defeat. A patriot,"
"loving his own country, would therefore wish his country defeat in war."
"""Sounds like raving, sonny. Who the dickens is Basil the Wolf? No, Jack,"
"that doesn't tell us anything."""
"""It tells us he couldn't have been inspired like that unless the place"
"and people were real to him!"""
"""Well, pirate or priest,"" Tommy laughed, ""he'll do if he waltzes us up"
"to the big adventure. You're about fit enough to tackle one now!"" During"
the past forty-eight hours he had openly rejoiced with Gates at my
"improvement and tried, with the indifferent success of an unbeliever, to"
play up at top speed that silly idea of an approaching adventure.
"We had strolled aft, and now stopped to watch a tall Jamaica negro--or"
so we thought him to be--asking Gates for a place in the crew. His
"clothing was too scant to hide the great muscles beneath, and Tommy"
"touched my arm, saying:"
"""There's a specimen for you!"""
"Had he been cast in bronze a critic might have said that the sculptor,"
"by over-idealizing masculine perfection, had made the waist too small,"
"the hips too slender, for the powerful chest and shoulders; the wrists"
and ankles might have been thought too delicate as terminals for the
"massive sinews leading into them. He smiled continually, and spoke in a"
"soft, almost timid voice."
"""I like that big fellow,"" I said. Perhaps I had been well called a"
"pantheist, having always extravagantly admired the perfect in form or"
face or the wide outdoors.
"Feeling my interests he turned from Gates, looking at me with dog-like"
pathetic trustfulness. Among the things he told us briefly--for the crew
watches when they turned up the slope. They would have felt less
comfortable during the latter part of their journey if they had known
that they were passing within a few hundred yards of the headquarters of
the outlaws at the old mission.
After a time they came to what looked like a wrinkle in the face of the
"grand old mountain. They proceeded up this with no little caution, not"
knowing but enemies might be watching there. It was just such a place as
outlaws lurking for prey or cowering from officers would be apt to seek.
"The wrinkle, or gully, led almost to the snow line and finally ended in"
"a little dip which lay between two summits rising side by side, like"
jagged rows of teeth.
"“I’m half starved and half frozen!” Harry declared, as he rested for a"
"time in the depth of what had once been a mountain lake, but which had"
been drained by the gully. “If I ever get back in little old New York
"again, I’m going to get Dad to make me a gasoline buggy with a snout"
"nine feet long, and I’m going to push traffic aside on Broadway for the"
next thousand years.”
“How often have you said that?” laughed Jack.
"“Let’s see,” Frank put in, “this is the twelfth trip we boys have taken,"
"either in the interests of the Secret Service or on vacations, so this"
makes twelve times that Harry has promised never to leave New York again
once he gets back there.”
“That’s all right!” Harry grinned. “You fellows ain’t half so hungry as
I am or you wouldn’t feel so gay over it.”
"“Now, how far are we from camp?” asked Jack."
was you. I'm so sorry I didn't have a chance to introduce you to mother
this morning. But mother wants me to take you back to the hotel. You
can have a room right next to mine and we'll have scads of fun--You'll
"come, won't you?"" For Sidney's face was unyielding."
"Like one cornered, Sidney stood straight against the table, her hands,"
"red from the hot dish water, clasped tightly behind her back. Though"
she knew that Pola was trying to make amends for her rudeness of the
"morning, something within her heart turned hard. The dusty idol was"
crumbling to bits of clay.
"""She's only inviting me because Mr. Dugald has told her to,"" she"
reasoned inwardly. And aloud she answered in a steady voice:
"""I'm sorry, but I simply can't leave Aunt Achsa. You must come here and"
"we'll find lots of jolly things to do--"""
"""Here?"" laughed Pola, glancing around the old kitchen."
"""Why not here?"" roared Mr. Dugald. ""As long as you've broken into our"
Secret Garden we'll introduce you to some things you've never done
before in your life. Only Sid will have to find some suitable clothes
"for you, and you'd better leave your complexion on the dressing table."""
"Pola accepted his banter good-naturedly. ""I shall be deeply grateful,"
"old dear, if you _will_ introduce me to any sensations I have not"
"experienced before. There, now, will that hold you for awhile?"" She"
"turned to Sidney. ""We quarrel like this all the time, but it's fun and"
I always have the last word. I make him so mad he can't think of
anything withering enough to say and I seize that strategic moment to
"cease firing. You see, I practice on Dug. I _will_ come tomorrow if I"
"may. Now, Duggie dear, lead me out of this funny lane or else I'll"
since in neither case were the abdominal symptoms a prominent
feature.
(184) _Possible wound of cæcum._--Wounded at Spion Kop. Bullet
"(Mauser) perforated the right forearm, then entered belly."
"_Entry_, 3 inches from the right anterior superior iliac spine,"
in the line of the supra-pubic fold of the belly wall (a
"transverse slit); _exit_, in right buttock, on a level with the"
tip of the great trochanter and 2 inches within it. The wound
was received immediately after breakfast had been eaten. There
"was retention of urine and constipation for three days, but no"
"sickness. Local pain and tenderness were severe, and at the end"
"of three weeks there was still local tenderness, slight"
"induration, and dragging pain on defæcation. The patient"
"returned to England at the end of a month well, except for"
slight local tenderness.
(185) _Possible wound of colon._--Wounded at Paardeberg; range
200 yards. Walking at time. The bullet (Mauser) perforated the
"left forearm, just below the elbow-joint. _Entry_, into belly 1"
inch anterior to the tip of the left eleventh costal cartilage;
no exit.
The injury was followed by pain in the left half of the abdomen
"and vomiting, which continued for two days. The bowels acted on"
"the third day; no nourishment was taken for two days, but a"
small quantity of water was allowed. No further symptoms were
"noted, and at the end of a fortnight the patient was well,"
except for slight local tenderness. The bullet could not be
detected with the X-rays.

CHAPTER IV
RISE OF COMEDY AND TRAGEDY
"No great discernment is required to see that, after the appearance of"
"_Johan Johan_, all that was needed for the complete development of"
comedy was the invention of a well-contrived plot. For reasons already
"indicated, Interludes were naturally deficient in this respect. Nor were"
the Moralities and Bible Miracles much better: their length and
"comprehensive themes were against them. There were the Saint Plays, of"
which some still lingered upon the stage; these offered greater
"possibilities. But here, again, originality was limited; the"
"_dénouement_ was more or less a foregone conclusion. Clearly, one of two"
things was wanted: either a man of genius to perceive the need and to
"supply it, or the study of new models outside the field of English"
"drama. The man of genius was not then forthcoming, but by good fortune"
the models were stumbled upon.
"We say stumbled upon, because the absence of tentative predecessors and"
"of anything approaching an eager band of successors, suggests an"
unpreparedness for the discovery when it came. Thus _Calisto and
"Melibaea_ (1530), an imitation of a Spanish comedy of the same name,"

General--Lost kit--Swallows and flies--Forces available--
Communications freed--The Kacha levy and a shock--Mirjawa    37

A FULL BAG OF PRISONERS
The march to Kacha--The food supply--Flowers in the
with just the right inflection of sarcasm to sting. It had suddenly
occurred to him that the fellow’s object was to make him lose his
"temper, and thus precipitate a clash, during which almost anything might"
"be accomplished. Not only did he refuse to let go his grip, but he did"
"his very best to goad Joyce himself into flaming out, and possibly"
betraying a few secrets.
"“That’s hardly the question, though,” he went on swiftly. “Strikes me"
you’ve been rather premature in running out the boom. Your mill isn’t
"operating, and I have yet to see a single log coming downstream except"
our own.”
"“Never you mind that,” retorted Joyce hotly. “Do you think a man’s going"
to wait till his timber comes in sight afore makin’ arrangements to take
care of it? You can’t come over me with no soft talk like that. The
"boom’s there, an’ there it stays. Half the river’s clear for you to use,"
an’ that’s all you gets.”
"“Hum! That’s your last word, is it?” inquired Bainbridge quietly. “You"
even refuse to let us swing the boom around so we can break our jam?”
“I do!” replied the red-haired individual emphatically. “The first man
"that tries to monkey with my property will wish he hadn’t, that’s all I"
got to say.”
"He raised his automatic significantly, but Bob was not even looking at"
"him. The young man’s gaze had swept out to the face of the jam, and in"
an incredibly short space an accurate picture of its appearance had been
photographed on his brain. Still without giving Joyce the satisfaction
"of a glance, he turned away, motioning Peters to accompany him."
"“A put-up job, of course,” he said tersely, when they were through the"
to prevent me. I had only to lie close among the rocks until Count
"Hugo left, and then I might plod back on foot and search as I pleased."
"In a flash I saw the poplars, and the road running beneath the"
"ash-tree, and the woman's body lying stiff and stark on the sward. And"
I burned to be there.
Left to myself I should have gone too. But the plan was no sooner
"formed than shattered. While I stood, hotfoot to be about it, and"
"pausing only to consider which way I could steal off most safely, a"
"rustling warned me that some one was coming, and before I could stir,"
a burly trooper broke through the bushes and confronted me. He saluted
me stolidly.
"'Sergeant,' he said, 'the general is waiting for you.'"
'The general?' I said.
"'The Count, if you like it better,' he answered. 'Come, if you"
please.'
"I followed him, full of vexation. It was but a step into the road. The"
"moment I appeared, some one gave the word 'Mount!' A horse was thrust"
"in front of me, two or three troopers who still remained afoot swung"
themselves into the saddle; and I followed their example. In a trice
"we were moving down the valley at a dull, steady pace--southwards,"
"southwards. I looked back, and saw the fir trees and rocks where we"
"had lain hidden, and then we turned a corner, and they were gone."
"Gone, and all round me I heard the measured tramp of the troop-horses,"
"the swinging tones of the men, and the clink and jingle of sword and"
"spur. I called myself a cur, but I went on, swept away by the force of"
"numbers, as the straw by the current. Once I caught Count Hugo's eye"
"fixed on me, and I fancied he had a message for me, but I failed to"
Nelson. More than once Sidney donned the cherry crêpe de chine and
"dined with Mrs. Allan and Pola and Dugald at the hotel, feeling very"
grand and traveled.
But to Sidney's deep regret Pola professed an abhorrence of swimming.
"""Just please don't _ask_ me,"" she had begged, shuddering. ""I loathe it!"
It's one of my complexes. Of course I've gone swimming in almost every
"body of water on the globe, but I hate it. You'll spoil my fun"
"_utterly_ if you even try to make me!"" After that Sidney could not"
"urge. She did not know what complexes were, but Pola had made them"
sound real and convincing and a little delicate. Though Sidney missed
the jolly swims with Lavender and Mart she refrained from even a hint
of her feelings.
Often when they were together Pola waxed confidential over her cousin.
"""He's a thorn in Aunt Lucy's side,"" she explained one day as the girls"
"lounged in Pola's room at the hotel, a huge box of candy on a stool"
"between them. ""She always wants him to go in for society and to go"
"abroad with her and do all the fashionable resorts on the Continent,"
"but couldn't you _see_ him? Not for Duggie boy, ever! When she starts"
planning something like that he bolts off somewhere and the next thing
you hear is that he's painted a wonderful picture and sold it or had
first mention or a gold medal. Of course that makes him terribly
interesting and there are dozens of single ladies from forty to
fourteen itching to catch him. And Dug's such a simple old dear that he
doesn't know it. But his mother does and she has them all sorted over
and the eligible ones ticketed. You see Dug will be dreadfully rich
some day and goodness knows what he'll do with the money for he hasn't
the brains of a child where business is concerned. His father's even
"richer than Dad."""
"the slightest; is it not so?  Have you met before, since that evening in"
"the water theatre when I did first present you to each other?"""
"""I have seen her but once between,"" answered Grey, still in the same"
"quiet, stunned fashion; and when they had entered the house, he made"
"excuse to go at once to his room, declining all proffer of refreshment"
or further converse.
"Lord Sandford looked after him with an intent look upon his face, which"
"slowly clouded over, till there was something almost malignant and"
ferocious in his aspect.
"""So it is as I thought.  He has been hit, and hard hit.  Where can he"
"have seen her in the interim?  They would not have been standing thus,"
"talking thus, if some bond had not been established between them.  Yet I"
thought I had kept an eye upon him.  I knew there might be danger.  I
saw it the first moment that they met.  There is something akin in their
natures.  They feel it themselves. Hr-r-r-rr! that must be put a stop
to.  I will have no rival in Geraldine’s heart.  She does not love me
"yet; but she fears me a little, and she thinks of me. That is no bad"
"basis to build upon.  I shall win her yet, if I have a fair field.  But"
"a rival—no, that must not be!  And yet I read somewhat in her eyes"
to-night which had not been there before.  The fiend take all false
"friends!  I must rid myself of this one, and that speedily.  I have"
"liked him; but he shall not stand in my way.  Well, ’tis I have made"
him: I can quickly unmake him.  Let me but think of the way and the
"means.  Grey Dumaresq, you are a pretty fellow and a pleasant comrade;"
but you shall never be suffered to stand in the light of Sandford’s
"hopes and plans and desires.  Look to yourself, my friend; for evil is"
"abroad for you!"""
"to Slyne's; both of whom met it without winking, although Captain Dove"
was no doubt glad of the protection of his smoked glasses.
"""I'll have to go through the proofs, of course,"" said his lordship"
"reflectively and let his gaze rest on Sallie again. ""But--if"
"everything's as you say, I don't think it will be long before Lady"
Josceline finds herself in full enjoyment of all her rights and
"privileges. If everything's as you say, I'll do whatever lies in my"
power to expedite matters; I think I can promise you that the case will
"be called immediately the vacation is over. Meanwhile, however, and till"
"I have looked through the proofs, I can make no further order."""
"He rose, and they also got up from their chairs as he came round from"
"behind his desk and confronted Sallie, a tall, stooping old man with a"
wrinkled face and tired but kindly eyes.
"She looked up into them frankly, and he laid a hand on her shoulder."
"""Yours has been a very sad history so far, my dear young lady,"" he said,"
"his head on one side, still studying her. ""I hope it will be all the"
brighter henceforth. I knew--the last Earl of Jura--when we were both
"young men--before he married. You remind me of him, as he was then, in"
"many respects. Good day to you now; my time here is not my own, you"
"know. But some day, perhaps you will allow me to pay my respects to"
"you--at Justicehall, since we're to be neighbours; my own home isn't"
"very far from yours."""
"Outside in the corridor, Mr. Jobling shook hands rapturously with every"
"one, even with Captain Dove."
"""We've turned the trick already,"" he declared. ""You heard what his"
"lordship said. With him on our side, the whole thing's as good as"
"ordering, but that they shall not. On every breach of her vigorous laws"
Nature waits with weaponed hand. At the elbow of every vice stands
foul-breathed disease.
There is no sin in the love of man and woman. The woman has committed
no sin in loving--she has but accepted the overwhelming urging of life.
It is her chiefest glory. Man has committed no sin in loving; his life
has ordered it; and the Masterfolk obey life. It is his chiefest glory.
Who so glum a dullard but smiles to see lovers meeting! But he sins
"foully who is guilty of the repudiation--foully against the woman,"
"criminally against his race, blasphemously against his godhood, and"
damnably against his manhood. Such are not of the Masterfolk.
"They of the inferior manhood, lacking in the force of character"
necessary to the full acceptance of the duties of the Masterfolk in
"love, have not the virile force to abide by a woman of the Masterfolk;"
and these come out when the lamps are lit and there are shadows in the
"land, and skulk about the by-lanes, and commit mean adulteries with"
"frail women, and have the habit of repudiating debt. Such cannot breed"
the Masterfolk. They shall not. For these cower from the strengthening
risks that dog a strenuous life; they would have the delight of
marriage without the courage....”
Noll opened the window.
There came from the street below the hoarse cry of a prostitute.
"He went into the room, lit a candle, and sat down at his desk."
Everything in the place whispered of Betty this night.
He wrote a letter:
"most ""un-Spanish"" characteristic."
"It is true that, as Buckle argues, the many earthquakes in Spain"
tended to promote superstitious fear; but then on his principles
"the Dutch seafaring habits, and the constant risks and frequent"
"disasters of inundation, had the same primary tendency. For the"
"rest, the one serious oversight in Buckle's theory of Spanish"
"civilisation is his assumption (cp. 3-vol. ed. ii, 455-61; 1-vol."
"ed. p. 550) that Spanish ""loyalty"" was abnormal and continuous from"
the period of the first struggles with the Moors. As to this see
"the present writer's notes in the 1-vol. ed. of Buckle, as cited."
"Even Ferdinand, as an Aragonese, was disrespectfully treated by the"
"Castilians (cp. Armstrong as cited, pp. 5, 31, etc.; De Castro,"
"_History of Religious Intolerance in Spain_, Eng. tr. 1853, pp. 40,"
41); and Philip I and Charles V set up a new resistance. An alien
dynasty could set up disaffection in Spain as elsewhere.
"It should be noted, finally, that the stiff ceremonialism which is"
held to be the special characteristic of Spanish royalty was a
"Burgundo-Teutonic innovation, dating from Philip I, and that even"
"in the early days of Philip the Cortes petitioned ""that the"
household of the Prince Don Carlos should be arranged on the old
"Spanish lines, and not in the pompous new-fangled way of the House"
"of Burgundy"" (Major Hume's _Spain_, p. 127). Prescott (_Philip II_,"
"ed. cited, pp. 655, 659) makes the petition refer to the king's own"
"household, and shows it to have condemned the king's excessive"
"expenditure in very strong terms, saying the expense of his"
"household was ""as great as would be required for the conquest of a"
"kingdom."" At the same time the Cortes petitioned against"
"bull-fights, which appear to have originated with the Moors, were"
"strongly opposed by Isabella the Catholic, and were much encouraged"
"by the Teutonic Charles V (U.R. Burke, _History of Spain_, 1895,"
"drama and epic, lyric and sonnet.  He could speak of Poetry as one who"
had loved and courted her as a mistress.  The girl longed to ask him if
"he had written himself, but maiden shyness withheld her.  Yet her eyes"
"brightened as she talked, and the peach-like colour rose and deepened in"
"her cheeks; and Lord Sandford, turning back once again from the mother"
"to look at the daughter, was struck dumb with admiration and delight."
"""There is a rose worth winning and wearing, though the stem may not be"
"free from a sharp thorn,"" he said to himself; and Lady Romaine, who"
chanced to catch sight of Geraldine during a shifting of the admirers
"who surrounded her, gave something very like a start, and felt a curious"
thrill run through her in which pride and envy were blended.
"""Gracious!  I did not know I had so handsome a daughter!  I must wed her"
"as fast as may be, else shall I find my beaux going from me to her,"" was"
"her unspoken thought; and aloud she said, tapping Lord Sandford with her"
"fan, ""Pray tell my daughter that I am about to depart.  We have had"
"enough of the naiads and dryads, and I am tired and hungry.  Who will"
"come home with me to supper—to take pot-luck with us?"""
There was an eager clamour in response; but when the supper-party
assembled round Lady Romaine’s chocolate tables in her favourite private
"parlour, she noted that Geraldine had disappeared to bed, and that Sir"
Grey Dumaresq had not availed himself of her open invitation.

"purifying yourself from the lust of life, you will come unto that lake"

CHAPTER XX
'NOBLESSE OBLIGE'
"'Sooner shall the cleft rock reunite so as to make a whole, than"
may he who kills any living being be admitted into our
society.'--_Acceptance into the Monkhood._
It is very noticeable throughout the bazaars of Burma that all the beef
"butchers are natives of India. No Burman will kill a cow or a bullock,"
and no Burman will sell its meat. It is otherwise with pork and fowls.
Burmans may sometimes be found selling these; and fish are almost
"invariably sold by the wives of the fishermen. During the king's time,"
any man who was even found in possession of beef was liable to very
"severe punishment. The only exception, as I have explained elsewhere,"
"was in the case of the queen when expecting an addition to her family,"
"and it was necessary that she should be strengthened in all ways. None,"
"not even foreigners, were allowed to kill beef, and this law was very"
"stringently observed. Other flesh and fish might, as far as the law of"
"the country went, be sold with impunity. You could not be fined for"
"killing and eating goats, or fowls, or pigs, and these were sold"
"occasionally. It is now ten years since King Thibaw was overthrown, and"
"there is now no law against the sale of beef. And yet, as I have said,"
no respectable Burman will even now kill or sell beef. The law was
"founded on the beliefs of the people, and though the law is dead, the"
had marvellously recovered from his over-night's nervous break-down. A
"sound sleep, a visit from the barber, a bath and a liberal breakfast had"
all helped to alter him outwardly and inwardly for the better. He was
"once more the respectably prosperous, self-confident solicitor."
"""I believe you've been out all night,"" he observed in a jocular tone of"
"reproof, a waggish forefinger uplifted."
"""I've covered a couple of hundred miles in the car while you've been"
"asleep,"" answered Slyne, turning into his dressing-room. ""I've brought"
"the girl back with me--and the old man, her guardian. We're going to"
"have trouble with him unless we're very careful. So listen, and I'll"
"tell you how things stand."""
"Mr. Jobling composed his features into their most professional aspect,"
"but that gave place by degrees to a variety of other expressions, while"
"Slyne, busy changing his clothes, related all he himself knew as to"
Sallie's past history.
"""And now the old man thinks he is entitled to put a price on her,"" Slyne"
"concluded. ""She's promised to marry me, but he won't let her go till I"
"hand him a hundred thousand dollars."""
Mr. Jobling lay back limply in his chair. In all his career he had
"never, he asserted, heard a more scandalous suggestion."
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne cut him short. ""The money's no object to"
me. But you can understand what a difficult fellow he is to deal with.
"And what I'm going to do, merely as a precaution against his playing us"
"false in the end, is to give him my note of hand for the amount he"
"demands, endorsed by you, and payable the day I marry his adopted"
"daughter."""
"""Please don't make scenes in the street, and don't follow me like this."
"If you want to talk to me, you can--at home."""
"Then, very calmly, she turned and walked on.  But he was still following"
"her, some paces off.  She did not quicken her steps, and to the first"
"taxicab driver that passed she made a sign, and saying:"
"""Bury Street--quick!"" got in.  She saw Fiorsen rush forward, too late to"
"stop her.  He threw up his hand and stood still, his face deadly white"
under his broad-brimmed hat.  She was far too angry and upset to care.
"From the moment she turned to the window at Monsieur Harmost's, she had"
determined to go to her father's.  She would not go back to Fiorsen; and
the one thought that filled her mind was how to get Betty and her baby.
"Nearly four!  Dad was almost sure to be at his club.  And leaning out,"
"she said: ""No; Hyde Park Corner, please."""
"The hall porter, who knew her, after calling to a page-boy: ""Major"
"Winton--sharp, now!"" came specially out of his box to offer her a seat"
and The Times.
"Gyp sat with it on her knee, vaguely taking in her surroundings--a thin"
"old gentleman anxiously weighing himself in a corner, a white-calved"
footman crossing with a tea-tray; a number of hats on pegs; the
"green-baize board with its white rows of tapelike paper, and three"
"members standing before it.  One of them, a tall, stout,"
"good-humoured-looking man in pince-nez and a white waistcoat, becoming"
"conscious, removed his straw hat and took up a position whence, without"
"staring, he could gaze at her; and Gyp knew, without ever seeming to"
"glance at him, that he found her to his liking.  She saw her father's"
"unhurried figure passing that little group, all of whom were conscious"
"now, and eager to get away out of this sanctum of masculinity, she met"
"Kennedy went to look at a picture by Sassoferrato, which is in one of"
"the chapels, and meanwhile the rosary-seller showed the church door to"
"Cæsar and explained the different bas-reliefs, cut in cypress wood by"
"Greek artists of the V Century, and representing scenes from the Old and"
New Testaments.
"Kennedy came back, they got into the carriage again, and they drove to"
the Benedictine abbey.
“Is the abbot Hildebrandus here?” asked Kennedy.
"Out came the abbot, a man of about fifty, with a gold cross on his"
"breast. They exchanged a few friendly words, and the superior showed"
them the convent.
The refectory was clean and very spacious; the long table of shining
"wood; the floor made of mosaic. The crypt held a statue, which Cæsar"
"assumed must be of Sant’ Anselmo. The church was severe, without"
"ornaments, without pictures; it had a primitive air, with its columns of"
"fine granite that looked like marble. A monk was playing the harmonium,"
"and in the opaque veiled light, the thin music gave a strange impression"
of something quite outside this life.
Afterwards they crossed a large court with palm-trees. They went up to
"the second story, and down a corridor with cells, each of which had on"
the lintel the name of the patron saint of the respective monk. Each
door had a card with the name of the occupant of the room.
It looked more like a bath-house than a monastery. The cells were
"comfortable inside, without any air of sadness; each held a bed, a"
"divan, and a small bookcase."
"Vance's attention, however, was riveted on what awaited at the end of"
"the stony walkway. It was a traditional teahouse, set in a grove of"
flowering azaleas. And standing in the doorway was a silver-haired
figure dressed in a formal black kimono. He was beckoning.
"""Did I neglect to tell you I prefer Japanese _cha-no-yu _to the usual"
"British afternoon tea?"" Tanzan Mino announced. ""It is a ritual designed"
"to renew the spirit, to cleanse the mind. It goes back hundreds of"
"years. I always enjoy it in the afternoon, and I find it has"
marvelously restorative powers. This seemed the ideal occasion for us
"to meet and chat."""
"""Don't want to slight tradition."" Vance slipped on the pair of wooden"
clogs that awaited at the bottom of the path.
"""My feelings entirely,"" the CEO continued, smiling as he watched him"
"approach. ""You understand the Japanese way, Dr. Vance, which is one"
"reason we have so much to discuss."""
He bowed a greeting as Vance deposited his clogs on the stepping stone
by the teahouse door. Together they stooped to enter.
A light murmur of boiling water came from a brazier set into the
"_tatami_-matted floor, but otherwise the room was caught in an ethereal"
"silence. The decor was more modern than most teahouses, with fresh"
cedar and pine for the ceiling and walls rather than the customary
"reed, bark, and bamboo."
Tanzan Mino gestured for him to sit opposite as he immediately began
"the formalities of ritually cleaning the bamboo scoop, then elevating"
the rugged white tea bowl like an ancient chalance and ceremonially
trace of her did he find. But what he did discover solved the mystery
of the grewsome feast of death which he had just witnessed. In a
"corner where he had dropped it, there lay a silken banderol belonging"
"to a man-at-arms of Anjou's Provencals. They had been here, and the"
"nuns, to escape the violation of their bodies, had died, thus cheating"
the fiends out of the gratification of their lusts.
The terrible discovery unnerved Francesco so completely that for a
"time he stood as if turned to stone, looking about him like a"
traveller who has stumbled blindly into a charnel house. Urged by
"manifold forebodings, he then rushed from room to room, from cell to"
cell. The same silence met him everywhere. Of Ilaria he found not a
"trace. Had the fiends of Anjou carried her away, or had she, in"
"endeavoring to escape, found her death outside of the walls of San"
Nicandro?
He dared not think out the thought.
"The shadows of the place, the staring faces, the stiff hands clawing"
"at things inanimate, were like the phantasms of the night. Francesco"
took the sea-air into his nostrils and looked up into the blue
radiance of the sky. All about him the garden glistened in the dawn;
the cypresses shimmered with dew. The late roses made very death more
apparent to his soul.
"As he stood in deep thought, half dreading what he but half knew, a"
"voice called to him, breaking suddenly the ponderous silence of the"
"place. Guided by its sound, Francesco unlatched the door and found"
himself face to face with the Duke of Spoleto.
For a moment they faced each other in silence.
"So, the same dawn, the self-same lamp of day, sees us all going each on"
our so different way.
OF THE BLOSSOMING OF THE TREE OF LIFE
CHAPTER LXXXVII
_Which has to do with the Binding of Books in Half-calf and the
Whimsies of Calf Love_
"When Noll had left his baggage in a quiet hotel by the Strand, and"
had refreshed his body with much splashing of himself in water and a
"change of clothes, he sallied out into the streets of London in a vague"
"wonder and surprise as to how to begin the search for Betty, yet firmly"
determined to start straightway in his quest--the Baddlesmere jaw set
firm.
"The summer afternoon was closing in, and the Strand was gay with"
people cheerily making their way homewards from work or amusement. But
homewards Noll did not take his steps; he felt a certain sense of shame
"about going to his own people without Betty at his side--and this, too,"
"not on his own account, but that it seemed disloyal to Betty and likely"
to make her future entrance into the family circle an embarrassment to
"George's brother, Count Anthony Hamilton. He had never been friendly to"
"his younger brother, and had ceased to look upon him as a brother at all"
after his disgraceful reformation. Then when the king turned against
"George, Anthony, good courtier that he was, turned likewise, and there is"
no bitterness that may be compared with that of an apostate brother.
"After we had talked for a minute or two, Count Anthony asked if I knew"
"anything of ""the fool,"" as he was pleased to call his brother."
"""I know nothing of your brother George, my lord, if it is him you mean."""
"""He is no brother of mine, and if you wish to become a member of our"
"family, you will cease to consider him your friend,"" returned his"
"Lordship, making an effort to conceal his anger."
"I was not in the mood to take his remark kindly, therefore I answered"
warmly:--
"""Shall my entering the ranks of your noble family curtail my privilege of"
"choosing my own friends?"""
"""No, with one exception,"" he replied."
"""The honor of the alliance is great, my lord, but I shall not consent to"
"even one exception at your dictation. Your sister, my future wife, loves"
"her brother, and if she does not object to my friendship for him, your"
"Lordship oversteps your authority, as head of your house, by protesting."""
"He turned angrily upon me, saying: ""You have been paying your court with"
"lukewarm ardor of late, Baron Clyde. Perhaps you would not grieve if your"
"friendship for a family outcast were to bar you from the family."""
"""Yes, master, and so I am; and this is the hostelry at Hampstead where I"
have taken up my quarters with the horse; and hither it was that you
"came yestere’en, with Lord Sandford and his friends, to be ready for the"
match to-day.  But beshrew me if I did think yesterday you would be fit
for the saddle to-day!  Is it strange I should mutter and grumble to
"myself when such things happen?"""
"""Nay now, what things, good Dicon?  I pray you tell me,"" spoke Grey, as"
"he drained at one draught the ice-cold water, and drew a long breath of"
"relief. ""I feel like a man waking from a strange and fevered dream; for,"
"in sooth, I know but little of what has been passing these last days."
Some strange madness seems to have possessed me.  I had meant to say
"farewell to Lord Sandford and his world, and seek mine own fortunes in"
some other field.  Yet methinks I have not made the break.  I have
visions of wild orgies and furious gaming—such as I held aloof from
"before.  Dicon, I fear me I have made a desperate fool of myself, and of"
"my fortunes too.  Tell me, what money have I with me now?"""
"""Not much, master.  I took what you had—a matter of some twenty guineas"
perhaps.  I have it safe in a bag.  But surely that is not all.  You had
"won a fortune, you did tell me—"""
"""Ay, and now I have lost it.  I can recollect how the guineas flew, and"
"how the stakes were doubled, and how I lost again and yet again.  I take"
"it I am a ruined man, good Dicon.  These twenty guineas saved from the"
"wreck are all the fortune I possess, and belike it is better so—better"
"so."""
"""Better!"" echoed the dismayed Dick; ""nay, my master.  But you will win"
it back again.  The luck cannot always be against you.  Think how it was
"at the first!"""
"caring for her little ones, fearful to leave them alone, till at last"
"the gray light came down, down from the sky to the branches, and from"
"the branches to the ground, and she could see her way. Then, with her"
new-born babe in her arms and the elder little fellow trotting by her
"side, she went out to search for her husband. Soon enough she found him,"
"not far off, stiff and cold beside his half-cut bundle of firewood. A"
"snake had bitten him on the ankle, and he was dead."
"So Ma Pa Da was alone in the great forest, but a girl still, with two"
little children to care for.
"But she was brave, despite her trouble, and she determined to go on and"
gain some village. She took her baby in her arms and the little one by
"the hand, and started on her journey."
"And for a time all went well, till at last she came to a stream. It was"
"not very deep, but it was too deep for the little boy to wade, for it"
"came up to his neck, and his mother was not strong enough to carry both"
"at once. So, after considering for a time, she told the elder boy to"
"wait. She would cross and put the baby on the far side, and return for"
him.
"'Be good,' she said; 'be good, and stay here quietly till I come back;'"
and the boy promised.
The stream was deeper and swifter than she thought; but she went with
"great care and gained the far side, and put the baby under a tree a"
"little distance from the bank, to lie there while she went for the other"
"boy. Then, after a few minutes' rest, she went back."
"She had got to the centre of the stream, and her little boy had come"
"down to the margin to be ready for her, when she heard a rush and a cry"
the name of these societies and they are known outside of the
State by its name. Cross-reference when necessary.
Enter churches under the name of the place.
"Single churches have usually been entered under the place, a practice"
"which arose in American indexes from our way of naming churches ""The"
"First Church in----,"" ""The Second Church of----,"" etc., and applies"
"very well to a majority of English churches, whose name generally"
includes the name of the parish. It is more in accordance with indexing
"principles to limit the local entry of churches to _First Church_,"
"etc., and those which have only the name of the town or parish, and to"
"put all others (as _St. Sepulchre's_, _St. Mary Aldermansbury_) under"
"their names, as they read, and to treat convents and monasteries in the"
same way; but the convenience of having a single definite rule has been
held to outweigh in this case the claims of consistency.
"The parishes of London (as _Kensington_, _Marylebone_, _Southwark_),"
"like the parts of Boston (_Dorchester_, _Roxbury_, etc.), or of any"
"other composite city, would be put under their own names, not under the"
name of the city.
A few cathedrals generally known by some other name may be entered
"under it: e.g., _St. Paul's, London; Notre Dame, Paris; St."
"Peter's, Rome; St. Sophia, Constantinople_."
"Put monasteries and convents, like churches, under the place,"
unless better known by the name.
National banks designated merely by number (as _First National Bank
of Boston_) go under the name of the place.
gridded with radio location finders so accurate that the position of
two ships a hundred yards apart shows a hundred yards of difference in
absolute position in the loran.
Some day in the distant future space would be solid-gridded with
infrawave navigation signals. Then the space coordinates of any
spacecraft could be found to a fine degree of precision. But now all
that Wilson and his nav-techs could do was to keep sighting the fixed
"stars, and from them compute their position."
"This sort of space navigation was good enough to keep a ship on course,"
"but far from precise enough to pinprick a true position. But, after"
"all, a crude positioning in the middle of interstellar space is good"
enough. One literally has cubic light years to float around in. Once
"the spacecraft begins to approach a destination, the space positioning"
can be made.
"Again, few spacecraft pause in mid-flight between stars long enough to"
"care about their interstellar position. After all, space flight does"
provide a mode of travel where the destination lies within eyesight.
"Or rather, it has lain within eyesight ever since it became commonly"
"accepted that these ultimate destinations were places, instead of holes"
poked in an inverted ceramic bowl.
"Then, in the middle of the communications confusion, came a call from"
one of Commander Hatch's scout flights.
"""Pilot Logan, Flight Eighteen, to Commander Hatch. Report."""
"""Hatch to Logan. Go ahead. Find something, Will?"""
"Will Logan said, ""Solid target detected on radar, Commander. Approached"
that bombing-stunt a few months ago. It was bloody awful too--the worst
thing I've ever been in. I was standing next to him when the first one
"exploded. He flopped down and lay flat on the ground, but I rushed away"
into the fields with a lot of others. When it was all over we went back
and heard the wounded crying out in a way that was dreadful to hear.
"This fellow was still lying on the ground by the duckboards, trembling"
"all over and paralysed with fear. We went to help the wounded, but he"
"was in such a state that he could not come with us, so we left him"
behind. There was an inquiry afterwards and _we_ got into a frightful
"row for running away. He got the M.M. for sticking to his post!"""
VII
THE GERMAN PUSH
"""What madness there is in this arithmetic that counts men by the"
millions like grains of corn in a bushel.... A newspaper has just
written about an encounter with the enemy: 'Our losses were
"insignificant, one dead and five wounded.' It would be interesting"
to know for whom these losses are insignificant? For the one who
"was killed?... If he were to rise from his grave, would he think"
the loss 'insignificant'? If only he could think of everything from
"the very beginning, of his childhood, his family, his beloved wife,"
"and how he went to the war and how, seized by the most conflicting"
"thoughts and emotions, he felt afraid, and how it all ended in"
death and horror.... But they try to convince us that 'our losses
"are insignificant.' Think of it, godless writer! Go to your master"
the Devil with your clever arithmetic.... How this man revolts
"should not reach the men around; ""these, when they get there, will think"
of nothing but plunder. As if rags and diamonds and gold were worth
"venturing one's life for. But I desire death--death--death, do you hear?"
"To see the Italian woman and her paramour pleading for their lives, one"
"wailing over against the other, on their knees. Oh, I know them and the"
brat they call the little Queen! To-night they shall lie dead under my
"hands--with this--with this!"""
And the girl flashed a razor-keen blade out of her red waistband. She
thrust the hilt forward into the Sergeant's hands as if in token of
fealty.
"""See,"" she said, touching the edge lovingly, ""is it not sharp? Will it"
"not kill surely and swiftly? For months I have sharpened it--ah, and"
"to-night it will give me my desire!"""
"It was the Sergeant's belief that the girl was mad, nevertheless he"
"watched her with his usual quiet scrutiny, the power of which she"
evidently felt. For she avoided his eyes and hastened on with her story
before he had time to cross-question her.
"""Why do I hate them? I see the question on your lips. Because the"
Italian woman hath taken away my father and slain my mother--slain her
as truly and with far sharper agony than she herself shall know when I
"set this knife to her throat. I am the daughter of Muñoz, and I swore"
revenge on the man and on the woman both when I closed my mother's eyes.
"My mother's heart was broken. Ah, you see, she was weak--not like me! It"
would take a hundred like the Neapolitan to break my heart; and as for
"the man, though he were thrice my father, he should beg his life in"
"vain."""
"She snatched her knife jealously out of his hand, tried its edge on the"
"was a curious hush--a new thing in their struggle, and one that seemed"
surcharged with calamity. After a moment Colonel Carmichael looked up.
"He was many years the senior of his companions, but just then there"
"seemed no difference in years between them. They were three wan,"
"haggard men, weakened with hunger, exhausted with sleepless watching."
That week had killed the youth in two of them.
"""Geoffries has just given me this,"" Carmichael said. ""It is a list of"
"our provisions. We have enough food, but there is no fresh water. The"
enemy has cut off the supply. We could not expect them to do
"otherwise."" He waited, and then, as neither spoke, he went on: ""I have"
"spoken with the others. You know, gentlemen, we can not go on another"
"twenty-four hours without water. We have made a good fight for it, but"
"this is the end. We must look the fact in the face."""
"""Surely they must know at headquarters what a state we are in--"""
Saunders began.
The Colonel shrugged his shoulders.
"""No doubt they know, but they can not help in time. This is not a"
petty frontier business. It is something worse--a rising with a leader.
"A rising with a leader is a lengthy business to tackle, and it"
"requires its victims. In this case we are the victims."" He smiled"
"grimly. ""We have only one thing left to do--make a dash for it while we"
have the strength. You must know as well as I do that there is
"scarcely anything worth calling a hope, but it's a more agreeable way"
of dying than being starved out like rats and then butchered like
"sheep. I know these devils."" He glanced around the shadowy room with a"
"curious light in his eyes. ""My best friend was murdered in this room,"""
"he added. ""Personally, I prefer a fair fight in the open."""
"avenue, distancing the enthusiasts who would have had the horses out of"
"the shafts. They passed a long row of carriages, belonging to people who"
"had not feared to come and look on from a distance, and at last, knowing"
"the procession would go back another way, Medland bade his driver stop"
"under the trees, and lit a cigar."
"""And I wonder if it will all make any difference!"" said he, puffing"
delightedly. He had all an old political organiser's love for a big
"meeting, which does not exclude scepticism as to its value."
"""Oh, you gave it 'em finely,"" said the Treasurer."
"""I believe it'll frighten two or three anyhow,"" observed Norburn."
"""I _know_ we shall win to-morrow,"" cried Daisy, squeezing her father's"
arm.
"""Ah! here's a special Sunday evening paper--how we encourage"
"wickedness!"" said the Premier, seeing a newsvendor approaching. ""Let's"
"see what they say of us!"""
"""I've seen it all for myself,"" remarked Daisy, and she went on"
"chattering to the other two, who were ready to talk over every incident"
"of the meeting, as people who have been to meetings ever are. On they"
"went, reminding one another of the bald man in the third row who cheered"
"so lustily, of the fat woman who had somehow got into the front row and"
"fanned herself all the time, of rude things shouted about Messrs."
"Puttock and Coxon, and so forth. The Premier, listening with one ear,"
opened his paper; but the first thing he saw was not about his
"procession. He started and looked closer, then gave a sudden, covert"
"glance at his companions; they were busy in talk, and, with breathless"
"haste, he devoured the meagre details of Benham's wretched death. The"
"and is situated within Jiand's jurisdiction, although he is not the"
"actual owner of the town. The word Khwash literally means ""sweet,"""
"and, I believe, owes its name to the water, which is, by the way,"
quite warm when it appears at the surface of the ground in the
immediate vicinity.
"The Western portion of the Sarhad, extending roughly from Khwash to"
"Galugan, is held by the Ismailzais under their redoubtable leader,"
Juma Khan.
All three of these tribes possess approximately one thousand
"families apiece, and, of course, each family has many members, as"
"well as large numbers of camels, and herds of sheep and goats."
"Each of these tribes, at the time of which I write, could muster,"
"roughly, from one to two thousand riflemen, chiefly armed with Mauser"
"courage. As the man emerges upon the narrow platform, he is engulfed in"
"the swirling flakes, and often is pinned against the masonry so tightly"
by the wind that he cannot move a limb; at other times he is swept
"almost off his feet. While engaged in his freezing task, he also runs"
the risk of being drenched by a rising comber.

"The men on the lonely, exposed Tillamook Rock, off the Oregon coast,"
"have had more than one occasion to respect the storm-fiend. One night,"
"while a fearful gale was raging, a huge mass of rock was torn away from"
"the islet, snatched by the waves, and thrown high into the air. It"
Steve put it into words after his fashion. 'It must be a big place we
"are going to,' he said, about noon of the second day, 'or who is to"
"eat all this? And do you mark, Master Martin? We meet no one coming"
back. All go south. This place Nuremberg that they talk of must be
worth seeing.'
"'It should be,' I said."
And after that the excitement of the march began to take hold of me. I
"began to think and wonder, and look forward, with an eagerness I did"
"not understand, to the issues of this."
"We lay a night at Bamberg, where the crowd and confusion and the"
stress of people were so great that Steve would have it we had come to
"Nuremberg. And certainly I had never known such a hurly-burly, nor"
heard of it except at the great fair at Dantzic. The night after we
"lay at Erlangen, which we found fortified, trenched, and guarded, with"
"troops lying in the square, and the streets turned into stables. From"
that place to Nuremberg was a matter of ten miles only; but the press
was so great on the road that it took us a good part of the day to
ride from one to the other. In the open country on either side of the
way strong bodies of horse and foot were disposed. It seemed to me
that here was already an army and a camp.
"But when late in the afternoon we entered Nuremberg itself, and viewed"
"the traffic in the streets, and the endless lines of gabled houses,"
"the splendid mansions and bridges, the climbing roofs and turrets and"
"spires of this, the greatest city in Germany, then we thought little"
of all we had seen before. Here thousands upon thousands rubbed
shoulders in the streets; here continuous boats turned the river into
solid land. Here we were told were baked every day a hundred thousand
The late-night security team had listened sympathetically. They had no
objection if Androv wanted to roll a stair-truck under the fuselage of
"_Daedalus /, _then climb into the underbay and inspect turbo pumps in"
"the dead of night. Everybody knew he was eccentric. No, make that"
insane. You'd have to be to want to ride a rocket. They'd just waved
"him in. After all, the classified avionics in the forward bays were"
secured.
He smiled grimly to think that he'd been absolutely right. Hangar
Control was getting lax about security in these waning days before the
big test. It always happened after a few months of mechanics trooping
in and out.
That also explained why he now had a full set of magnetic access cards
"for all the sealed forward bays. Just as he'd figured, the mechanics"
were now leaving them stuffed in the pockets of the coveralls they kept
in their lockers in the changing room.
Time to get started.
"There was, naturally, double security, with a massive airlock port"
"opening onto a pressure bay, where three more secure ports sealed the"
"avionics bays themselves. The airlock port was like an airplane door,"
"double reinforced to withstand the near vacuum of space, and in the"
center was a green metallic slot for a magnetic card.
"He began trying cards, slipping them into the slot. The first, the"
"second, the third, the fourth, and then, payoff. The three green diodes"
above the lock handle flashed.
"He quickly shoved down the grip and pushed. The door eased inward, then"
"rotated to the side, opening onto the pressure bay."
conveyed no meaning. And then sleep descended and brought entire
oblivion.

HOME ON LEAVE
"""I have several times expressed the thought that in our day the"
"feeling of patriotism is an unnatural, irrational, and harmful"
"feeling, and a cause of a great part of the ills from which mankind"
"is suffering; and that, consequently, this feeling should not be"
"cultivated, as is now being done, but should, on the contrary, be"
"suppressed and eradicated by all means available to rational men."""
(TOLSTOY.)
A change had come over us all. Instead of long spells of dreary silence
"interrupted by outbursts of irritability, by grumbling and by violent"
"quarrels over nothing, there was animated conversations and sometimes"
"even gaiety. Our talk was all about one subject--not about peace, for we"
had abandoned all hope of peace and hardly ever thought of it--but about
"leave. We had been waiting for seventeen months when, without warning, a"
leave allotment was assigned to our unit. About half a dozen men were
going every day and no one knew whose turn would come next. We were full
"of intense excitement and glad expectation, but also of anxiety in case"
something should happen to stop our leave altogether.
I made up my mind to enjoy myself thoroughly. I would see parents and
"""I do not think that he regards them at all! He has scarcely looked at"
"one of them ever since I first knew him."""
"Sergeant Cardono groaned, seemingly greatly perturbed in spirit."
"""I feared as much,"" he said, shaking his head; ""he hath not the right"
"wandering eye. Now, that young Frenchman is a devil untamed! And the"
"Englishman--well, though he is deeper, he also hath it in him. But the"
colonel is all for fighting and his duty. It is easy to see that he will
rise but little higher. When was there ever a great soldier without a
"weakness for a pretty woman and a good dinner? Why, the thing is"
"against nature. Now, my father fought in the War of the Independence,"
and the tales that he told of El Gran' Lor'--he was a soldier if you
"like, worthy of the white plumes! A cook all to himself closer at his"
"elbow than an aide-de-camp--and as to the women--ah----!"""
Sergeant Cardono nodded as one who could tell tales and he would. Yet
the Sergeant Cardono found some reason to change his mind as to Rollo's
qualifications for field-officership before the end of their first day
apart from Cabrera.
It was indeed with a feeling of intense relief that the little company
of five men separated from the white and red _boinas_ of the
butcher-general's cavalcade. Well-affected to them as Cabrera might be
"for the time being, his favour was so brief and uncertain, his affection"
"so tiger-like, that even Sergeant Cardono sighed a sigh of satisfaction"
when they turned their horses' heads towards the far-away Guadarrama
beyond which lay the goal of their adventuring.
Presently the tongues of the little cavalcade were unloosed. El Sarria
"and Sergeant Cardono having found subjects of common interest, communed"
"for nine millions of square miles over half Asia, much of Persia,"
and now claim to control the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor? If
England might claim a large section of Persia as her sphere of
"influence, and Egypt likewise and a fourth part of Africa, much of"
"Arabia, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, why might not Germany and"
Austria expect to have their little spheres of influence in the
"Balkans, in Asia Minor, in Mesopotamia? We had helped France to"
Morocco and Italy to Tripoli; why should we bother about Servia? It
"might be unkind, but then were we not unkind towards her father's"
"country, Ireland? Were we very tender towards national independence"
"in Egypt, in Persia?"
"Yet this brutal invasion of France, this unprovoked attack on Liège"
were ugly things. France had shown no disposition to egg Servia on
"against Austria, and Sir Edward Grey in the last days of June--she"
"now learnt for the first time, for she had seen no newspapers in"
"prison, where it is part of the dehumanizing policy of the Home"
"Office to prevent their entry, or the dissemination of any"
information about current events--Sir Edward Grey had clearly shown
Great Britain did not approve of Servian intrigues in Bosnia. Well:
let the best man win. Germany was just as likely to give the Vote to
her women as was Britain. The Germans were first in Music and in
"Science. She for her part didn't wish to become a German subject,"
but once the War was over she would willingly naturalize herself
Belgian or Swiss.
And the War must soon be over. Europe as a whole could not allow
this devastation of resources. America would intervene. Already the
Germans realized their gigantic blunder in starting the attack.
Their men were said to be--she read--much less brave than people had
expected. The mighty German Armies had been held up for ten days by
a puny Belgian force and the forts of Liège and Namur. There would

“The other day he said to me in his macaronic Italian:
"“‘Mr. Spaniard, I have good eyesight, good hearing, a good sense of"
"smell, and... lots of sentiment.’"
"“I didn’t exactly understand what he meant me to think, and I didn’t pay"
any attention to him.
"“It seems that the Norwegian is going away soon, and as the day of his"
"departure approaches, he grows funereal.”"
_THE SADNESS OF LIFE_
"“I don’t know why I don’t go away,” Cæsar wrote to his friend another"
time. “When I go out in the evening and see the ochre-coloured houses on
"both sides and the blue sky above, a horrible sadness takes me. These"
"spring days oppress me, make me want to weep; it seems to me it would"
"be better to be dead, leaving no tomb or name or other ridiculous and"
"disagreeable thing, but disappearing into the air or the sea. It"
doesn’t seem natural; but I have never been so happy as one time when I
"was in Paris sick, alone and with a fever. I was in an hotel room and"
"my window looked into the garden of a fine house, where I could see the"
"tops of the trees; and I transformed them into a virgin forest, wherein"
marvellous adventures happened to me.
“Since then I have often thought that things are probably neither good
"nor bad, neither sad nor happy, in themselves; he who has sound, normal"
"nerves, and a brain equally sound, reflects the things around him like a"
"good mirror, and feels with comfort the impression of his conformity to"
"laid hold on fame while as yet deeming himself unfamous. It's curious,"
"but true, nevertheless, that very often the writers who thought least"
of themselves during their lifetime have become the most universally
"renowned after their deaths. Shakespeare, I dare say, had no very"
"exaggerated idea of the beauty of his own plays,--he seems to have"
"written just the best that was in him, without caring what anybody"
thought of it. And I believe that is the only way to succeed in the
"end."""
"""In the end!"" repeated Alwyn dreamily--""In the end, no worldly success"
"is worth attaining,--a few thousand years and the greatest are"
"forgotten!"""
"""Not the GREATEST,""--said Villiers warmly--""The greatest must always be"
"remembered."""
"""No, my friend!--Not even the greatest! Do you not think there must"
"have been great and wise and gifted men in Tyre, in Sidon, in Carthage,"
"in Babylon?--There are five men mentioned in Scripture, as being 'ready"
"to write swiftly'--Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Ariel--where is"
the no doubt admirable work done by these? Perhaps ... who knows? ...
"one of them was as great as Homer in genius,--we cannot tell!"""
"""True,--we cannot tell!"" responded Villiers meditatively--""But, Alwyn,"
if you persist in viewing things through such tremendous vistas of
"time, and in measuring the Future by the Past, then one may ask what is"
"the use of anything?"""
"""There IS no use in anything, except in the making of a strong,"
"persistent, steady effort after good,"" said Alwyn earnestly ... ""We men"
"are cast, as it were, between two swift currents, Wrong and"
"Right,--Self and God,--and it seems more easy to shut our eyes and"
"There was an Old Man of Cape Horn,"
Who wished he had never been born;
"So he sat in a chair till he died of despair,"
That dolorous Man of Cape Horn.
"Now, except in case of very young children, this could not possibly be"
taken seriously. The least observant normal boy or girl would recognise
the hollowness of the pessimism that prevents a man from at least an
attempt to rise from his chair.
The following I have chosen as repeated with intense appreciation and
much dramatic vigour by a little boy just five years old:
"There was an Old Man who said, “Hush!"
I perceive a young bird in this bush!”
"When they said, “Is it small?” he replied, “Not at all!"
It is four times as big as the bush!”[32]
One of the most desirable of all elements to introduce into our stories
is that which encourages kinship with animals. With very young children
"this is easy, because in those early years when the mind is not clogged"
"with knowledge, the sympathetic imagination enables them to enter into"
the feelings of animals. Andersen has an illustration of this point in
his “Ice Maiden”:
“Children who cannot talk yet can understand the language of fowls and
"ducks quite well, and cats and dogs speak to them quite as plainly as"
"Father and Mother; but that is only when the children are very small,"
and then even Grandpapa's stick will become a perfect horse to them
"that can neigh and, in their eyes, is furnished with legs and a tail."
"With some children this period ends later than with others, and of such"
"autumn use, but he keeps putting it off, and probably it will not be done"
"at all. So far it hasn't mattered, but this morning's first wet snow has"
covered the hay outdoors and the maltreated land. And so it will remain
"till next spring. Poor Paul! He is an easygoing man at heart, but he"
"pushes doggedly on against a whirlwind; sometimes he smiles to himself,"
knowing how useless it is to struggle--a distorted smile.
"His father, the old man alone in his room, stands sometimes on his"
"threshold, as he used to do, and reflects. He is lost in memories, for he"
has ninety years behind him. The many houses on the farm confuse him a
"little; the roofs are all too big for him, and he is afraid they might"
come down and carry him off. Once he asked Josephine if it was right that
his hands and fingers should run away from him every day across the
"fields. So they put mittens on his hands, but he took to chewing them; in"
"fact he ate everything he was given, and enjoyed a good digestion. So they"
"must be thankful he had his health, Josephine said, and could be up and"
about.
*       *       *       *       *
"I did not follow the others across the field, but returned the way I had"
"come last spring, down toward the woods and the sea. It is fitting that I"
"should go back, always back, never forward again."
"I passed the hut where Solem and I had lived together, and then the"
"Lapps--the two old people and Olga, this strange cross between a human"
"being and a dwarf birch. A stove stood against the peat wall, and a"
paraffin lamp hung from the roof of their stone-age dwelling. Olga was
"kind and helpful, but she looked tiny and pathetic, like a ruffled hen; it"
"pained me to watch her flit about the room, tiny and crooked, as she"
looked for a pair of reindeer cheeses for me.
Rollo coloured high.
"""General,"" he said, ""I will not conceal it from you that I have wasted"
too much time already; but if you wish for our assistance in your
"designs for twenty-four hours, I am not the man to deny you."""
"""I thought not,"" cried Cabrera, much pleased. ""And now have you any"
"business to despatch before we leave this place? If so, let it be seen"
"to at once!"""
"""None, Excellency,"" said Rollo, ""save that if you are satisfied of our"
good faith I should like to see Luis Fernandez the miller dealt with
"according to his deserts!"""
"""I will have him shot instantly,"" cried Cabrera; ""he hath given false"
tidings to his Majesty's generals. He hath belied his honest servants.
"Guard, bring Luis Fernandez hither!"""
This was rather more than Rollo had bargained for. He was not yet
"accustomed to the summary methods of Cabrera, even though the butcher's"
hand had hardly yet unclosed from himself. He was already meditating an
"appeal in favour of milder measures, when the guard returned with the"
"news that Luis Fernandez was nowhere to be found. Dwelling-house,"
"strong-room, mill, garden, and gorge beneath--all had been searched. In"
vain--they were empty and void. The tumbled beds where the general and
"his staff had slept, the granary with its trampled heaps of corn ready"
"for grinding, the mill-wheel with the pool beneath where the lights and"
"shadows played at bo-peep, where the trout lurked and the water-boxes"
seemed to descend into an infinity of blackness--all were deserted and
lonesome as if no man had been near them for a hundred years.
"""The rascal has escaped!"" cried Cabrera, full of rage; ""have I not told"
"theirs. They suspect me of being a spy in German pay. Besides, your"
"von Bissing has ordered now that all Belgian, British, and French"
wounded shall be taken to the German Red Cross. Well: if you want
"to be kind, give me an introduction there. Surely it would be bare"
humanity on your part to let an Englishwoman be with some of those
"poor lads who are sorely wounded, dying perhaps""--she broke"
"down--""The other day I followed two of the motor ambulances along"
"the Boulevard d'Anspach. Blood dripped from them as they passed, and"
"I could hear some English boy trying to sing 'Tipperary--'"""
"""My _tear_ Miss Warren--I will try to do all that you want--You will"
"not do _anything I_ want, but never mind. I will show you that"
Germans can be generous. I will speak about your mother. I am sorry
that there are bad-mannered Germans in the hotel. There are
"some--what-you-call 'bounders'--among us, as there are with you. It"
"is to be regretted. As to our Red Cross hospitals, I know of a"
person who can make things easy for you. I will write a letter to my
cousin--like me she is a Saxon and comes from Leipzig--Minna von
"Stachelberg. She is but a few months widow, widow of a Saxon"
"officer, Graf von Stachelberg who was killed at Namur. Oh! it was"
very sad; they were but six months married. Afterwards she came here
"to work in our Red Cross--I think now she is in charge of a ward..."""
So Vivie found a few months' reprieve from acute sorrow and bitter
humiliation. Gräfin von Stachelberg was as kind in her way as her
"cousin the Colonel, but much less sentimental. In fact she was of"
"that type of New German woman, taken all too little into account by"
our Press at the time of the War. There were many like her of the
"upper middle class, the professorial class, the lesser nobility to"
"be found not only in Leipzig but in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfort,"
"Halle, Bonn, München, Hannover, Bremen, Jena, Stuttgart,"
"Cologne--nice to look at, extremely modern in education and good"
Then he saw a gleam of blue metal in Fraser's hands.
"""Give me that gun!"" he panted, but his deliverer held him off."
"""I may need it myself, and I ain't got but the one here! Let's get"
"Clyde out of this."""
"Stepping over the motionless form at his feet, Fraser lifted the young"
"club-man, who was huddled in a formless heap as if he had fallen from a"
"great height, and together the two dragged him toward _The Bedford"
"Castle_. As they went aboard, they were nearly run down by a body of"
reinforcements that Captain Peasley had finally mustered from between
"decks. Down the gang-plank and over the side they poured, grimy"
"stokers, greasy oilers, and swearing deckhands, equipped with"
"capstan-bars, wrenches, and marlin-spikes. Without waiting to observe"
"the effect of these new-comers, Boyd and Fraser bundled Alton into the"
"first cabin at hand, then turned back."
"""Better stay here and look after him. You're all in, yourself,"" the"
"adventurer advised. ""I'm going to hunt up George."""
"He was away on the instant, with Boyd staggering after him, still weak"
"and shaking, the vague discomfort of running blood at the back of his"
"neck, muttering thickly as he went: ""Give me your gun, Fraser! Give me"
"your gun!"""
"The battle was still raging when the police arrived, after an"
"interminable delay, and it ceased only at the rough play of"
"night-sticks, and after repeated charges of the uniformed men had"
"broken up the ranks of the strikers. The dock was cleared at length,"
"and wagon-loads of bleeding, struggling combatants rolled away to jail,"
union and non-union men bundled in together. But work was not resumed
"“Fine man,” commented the younger man aloud. “Hope I do run into him"
"again. Meanwhile, however, the rear isn’t coming along half quick"
"enough, and I haven’t seen a darn thing all afternoon of the wangan. I"
hope nothing’s happened to it and the grub. That would be one awful
blow!”
It was one that was spared him. Within half an hour the clumsy scow hove
"in sight. It tied up to the bank a little later, and before dark"
preparations for supper were going on merrily.
Bob did not get in till later. Assured that all was well with the cook
"and his staff, he went on downstream to see how Peters and his gang were"
progressing. On his return he discovered a stranger warming himself by
"the drying fire. He looked like an old-time woodsman, and the instant"
"Bainbridge appeared he was on his feet, extracting an envelope from the"
interior of his hat.
"“From Mr. Tweedy, sir.”"
The young lumberman ripped it open without a premonition of the blow in
store for him. It was natural for Tweedy to write. He would be reporting
"his success in the matter of credit, of course, and probably gloating"
over the amount of manufactured lumber he had sold in so short a time.
Bainbridge noted that it had been written in the Bangor office the night
"before. Then, settling himself by the fire, he proceeded to read:"
"Dear Bobby: It’s all up with us, boy. We’re done, and we may as well"
admit it first as last and make what terms we can with the gang. I
can’t get credit anywhere. Crane’s been ahead of me and spilled the
"beans each time. What’s more, Gastich absolutely refuses to renew that"
"note. Says he must have the cash for some stocks he’s carrying, and"
"all that; but you know what it means. It’s due in less than a week,"
"What HAVE I done?""  No answer came.  And such rage against men flared up"
"that she just stood there, twisting her garden-gloves in her hands, and"
"biting the lips he would have kissed.  Then, going to her bureau, she"
"took up her address book and looked for the name: Wing, 88, Frankland"
"Street, Fulham. Unhooking her little bag from off the back of the chair,"
"she put her cheque-book into it.  Then, taking care to make no sound, she"
"passed into the hall, caught up her sunshade, and went out, closing the"
door without noise.
She walked quickly toward Baker Street.  Her gardening-hat was right
"enough, but she had come out without gloves, and must go into the first"
"shop and buy a pair.  In the choosing of them, she forgot her emotions"
"for a minute.  Out in the street again, they came back as bitterly as"
"ever.  And the day was so beautiful--the sun bright, the sky blue, the"
clouds dazzling white; from the top of her 'bus she could see all its
brilliance.  There rose up before her the memory of the man who had
"kissed her arm at the first ball.  And now--this!  But, mixed with her"
"rage, a sort of unwilling compassion and fellow feeling kept rising for"
"that girl, that silly, sugar-plum girl, brought to such a pass by--her"
husband. These feelings sustained her through that voyage to Fulham.  She
"got down at the nearest corner, walked up a widish street of narrow grey"
houses till she came to number eighty-eight.  On that newly scrubbed
"step, waiting for the door to open, she very nearly turned and fled."
What exactly had she come to do?
The door was opened by a servant in an untidy frock.  Mutton!  The smell
"of mutton--there it was, just as the girl had said!"
"""Is Miss--Miss Daphne Wing at home?"""
"In that peculiar ""I've given it up"" voice of domestics in small"
"households, the servant answered:"
opportunity of trying those boots. Meanwhile he used to talk about
"them at meals, and he would polish them up every night before he went"
to bed.  When the great day came for the first trial of them to be
"made, he took a patronising farewell of his wife and family, ignored"
"the many eager noses pressed against the upper windows of the Palace,"
"and sailed off.  The motion, as perhaps you know, is a little"
"disquieting at first, but one soon gets used to it.  After that it is"
fascinating. He had gone some two thousand miles before he realised
that there might be a difficulty about finding his way back.  The
difficulty proved at least as great as he had anticipated. For the
rest of that day he toured backwards and forwards across the country;
and it was by the merest accident that a very angry King shot in
through an open pantry window in the early hours of the morning.  He
removed his boots and went softly to bed. . . .
"It was, of course, a lesson to him.  He decided that in the future he"
"must proceed by a recognised route, sailing lightly from landmark to"
landmark.  Such a route his Geographers prepared for him--an early
"morning constitutional, of three hundred miles or so, to be taken ten"
times before breakfast.  He gave himself a week in which to recover
his nerve and then started out on the first of them.
"[Illustration: _""Most extraordinary,"" said the King_]"
"Now the Kingdom of Euralia adjoined that of Barodia, but whereas"
"Barodia was a flat country, Euralia was a land of hills.  It was"
"natural then that the Court Geographers, in search of landmarks,"
"should have looked towards Euralia; and over Euralia accordingly,"
"about the time when cottage and castle alike were breakfasting, the"
King of Barodia soared and dipped and soared and dipped again.

"Let's see what our surroundings look like."""
"They walked to the nearest window-aperture, and gazed out on a"
startling and marvelous scene.
*       *       *       *       *
"Beneath their high tower window, extending as far as the eye could"
"reach, lay the city, lit by the reddish glare of the peculiar metal"
with which its streets were paved. For the most part the metropolis
consisted of perfectly square buildings pierced by many windows to
indicate that each housed a large number of inmates. But here and
"there grotesque turrets lanced the sky, and symbolic domes arched"
above the surrounding flat metal roofs.
One building in particular they noticed. This was an enormous
structure in the shape of a half-globe that reared its spherical
height less than an eighth of a mile from the building they were in.
"It was situated off to their right at the foot of a vast, high-walled"
enclosure whose near end seemed to be formed by the right wall of
their prison. They could only see it by leaning far out of the
window; and it would not have come to their attention at all had they
"not heard it first--or, rather, heard the sound of something within"
it: for from it came a curious whining hum that never varied in
"intensity, something like the hum of a gigantic dynamo, only greater"
and of a more penetrating pitch.
"""Sounds as though it might be some sort of central power station,"""
"said Brand. ""But what could it supply power for?"""
"""Give it up,"" said Dex. ""For their damned shock-tubes, perhaps, among"
"other things--"""
and waited in the field. But this time there were several further
shell-bursts. No dull boom in the distance followed by a long-drawn
"whine, but only the earth and smoke thrown darkly up and then the"
deafening double detonation.
"The next day more shells came over, and the next day also."
The big holes with their earthen rims began to dot the fields in many
"places. No damage of ""military importance"" had been done. Not even a"
"soldier had been killed, but only an inoffensive cow."
"At night the sky was alive with the whirr of propellers, and shells"
whistled overhead and burst a long way off.
"One Sunday, toward the end of March, when we had a half-holiday, I"
walked up the hill that was crowned by a large monastery and sat down
on the slope by a group of sallows. They were in full bloom. A swarm of
bees and flies were buzzing round. Peacock and Tortoiseshell butterflies
were flitting to and fro. The sunlight filtered down through the bluish
haze. I rested and let an hour or two slip by. Then I got up and crossed
a little brook and strolled along a narrow path that wound its way
"through a copse. The ground was starred with wood-anemones, oxlips,"
"violets, cuckoo-flowers, and in damp places with green-golden saxifrage."
I came to a small cottage that had pots of flowers in every window. I
sat down while a hospitable old woman made coffee and chattered volubly
in Flemish. Another soldier arrived soon after. Had I heard the news?
The Germans had broken through on the Somme and had captured Bapaume. I
"asked him if he had seen it in print. No, he had heard it from an A.S.C."
"driver. He hoped it wasn't true, but he feared it was."
I returned to camp full of suppressed excitement.
"peculiar conditions of this particular drive, and before Bainbridge"
realized it he had given a brief narrative of his fight with the Lumber
Trust and the events which had grown out of it.
"“You interest me extraordinarily, Mr. Bainbridge,” the older man said,"
"in his crisp, decisive way, when at last they paused at the point"
"several miles below the scene of the last jam, where Sears had to branch"
"off to reach his camp. “Things of this sort always do, for it’s only"
those one has to struggle for which are really worth while. You’ve
"certainly had to fight hard in this case, but you’ve practically won"
"out, haven’t you? After this last fracas I shouldn’t suppose there’d be"
much chance for further interference.”
Bob shrugged his shoulders and smiled a little. “You sadly underestimate
"the power of the trust, Mr. Sears. I shan’t be beyond the chance of"
"interference until the drive is safe in our mill booms at Lancaster, and"
even then it wouldn’t surprise me if they’d try to work some dirty
trick.”
Sears frowned indignantly; then his face brightened.
“In spite of everything I think I should bet on you.” he chuckled.
“There’s a certain vigor in your method of dealing with these people
"which makes for success. I really believe you’ll win, Mr. Bainbridge,"
"and I surely hope so. It has been a great pleasure to meet you, and I"
"trust one to be repeated. I shall be hereabouts for some time yet, and"
may run across you before I leave.”
"Bob warmly reciprocated his feeling, and, after a hearty handshake,"
"turned south along the river, while Sears disappeared in the undergrowth"
to the westward.
"men-of-war as a petty officer. Until July, 1723, when 40 years of age,"
"Upton lived a perfectly honest life, but his wife dying, Upton found she"
had contracted various debts and that he was in danger of being arrested
"by the creditors. Leaving his four orphans, Upton hurried to Poole in"
"Dorsetshire, and was taken on as boatswain in the _John and Elizabeth_"
"(Captain Hooper), bound for Bonavista in Newfoundland. He seems to have"
"continued to sail as an honest seaman until November 14th, 1725, when"
"serving as boatswain in the _Perry_ galley, on a voyage between Barbadoes"
"and Bristol, the vessel was taken by a pirate, Cooper, in the _Night"
Rambler_. At his subsequent trial witnesses declared that Upton willingly
"joined the pirates, signed their articles, and was afterwards one of their"
most active and cruel men.
"Upton kept a journal, which was his only witness for his defence, in which"
he described how he was forced to sign the pirates' articles under threats
"of instant death. If his journal is to be believed, Upton escaped from the"
"pirates at the first opportunity, landing on the Mosquito coast. After"
"being arrested by the Spaniards as a spy, he was sent from one prison to"
"another in Central America, at last being put on board a galleon at Porto"
"Bello, to be sent to Spain. Escaping, he got aboard a New York sloop and"
"arrived at Jamaica in December, 1726. While at Port Royal he was pressed"
"on board H.M.S. _Nottingham_, serving in her for more than two years as"
"quartermaster, until one day he was accused of having been a pirate. Under"
"this charge he was brought a prisoner to England in 1729, tried in London,"
"and hanged, protesting his innocence to the last."

"forces along the various jutting balconies of the second floor,"
"carefully darkening all the rooms in their rear, so that, till the"
"moment of the attack itself, the assailants would have no idea that they"
were expected. It was his idea that the small doors on the garden side
"of the house, which led right and left to the servants' quarters, would"
be attacked first. He was the more assured of this because the Sergeant
"had recognised, in the bivouac of the gipsies, a man who had formerly"
been one of the royal grooms both at La Granja and at Aranjuez. He would
"be sure to be familiar, therefore, with that part of the interior of the"
"palace. Besides, being situated upon the side most completely removed"
"from the town, the assailants would have the less fear of interruption."
"While Rollo was thus cogitating, Concha came softly to his side,"
appearing out of the gloom with a suddenness that startled the young
man.
"""I have pulled up the ladder by which we ascended and laid it across the"
"balcony,"" she said. ""Was that right?"""
"""You--alone?"" cried Rollo in astonishment."
She nodded brightly.
"""Certainly,"" she answered; ""women are not all so great weaklings as you"
"think them--nor yet such fools!"""
"""Indeed, you have more sense than I,"" Rollo responded, gloomily; ""I"
"ought to have remembered that before. But, as you know, I have had many"
"things to think of."""
"""I am glad,"" she said, more quietly and submissively than ever in her"
"life, ""that even in so small a matter I am permitted to think a little"
"business puzzles me, though you and your friends here seem to find it"
"devilish amusing. When I told the Chief Constable, the manager of the"
"shipyard, and the Admiral Superintendent of Naval Work that you were"
"the guilty party, they all roared. For some reason the Admiral and the"
shipyard manager kept winking at one another and gurgling till I
"thought they would have choked. What _is_ the joke?"""
"""If you are good, Dawson, I will tell you some day. This is November,"
and the _Rampagious_--the ship described on your paper--left for
"Portsmouth in August. In July--"" I broke off hurriedly, lest I should"
"tell my visitor too much. ""It has taken our friend who put the paper"
in the sardine tin three months to find out details of her. I could
"have done better than that, Dawson."""
"""That is just what the Admiral said, though he wouldn't explain why."""
"""The truth is, Dawson, that the Admiral and I both come from Devon,"
"the land of pirates, smugglers, and buccaneers. We are law breakers by"
instinct and family tradition. When we get an officer of the law on
"toast, we like to make the most of him. It is a playful little way of"
"ours which I am sure you will understand and pardon."""
"""You know, of course, that I am justified in arresting you. I have a"
"warrant and handcuffs in my pocket."""
"""Admirable man!"" I cried, with enthusiasm. ""You are, Dawson, the"
perfect detective. As a criminal I should be mightily afraid of you.
"But, as in my buttonhole I always wear the white flower which"
"proclaims to the world my blameless life, I am thoroughly enjoying"
this visit and our cosy chat beside the fire. Shall I telephone to my
office and say that I shall be unavoidably detained from duty for an
indefinite time? 'Detained' would be the strict truth and the _mot
"nothing is wasted.  But a baby!""  And he chirruped his lips. ""Well;"
"courage!  We shall do things yet!"""
Gyp turned her head away to hide the quiver of her lips.  The scent of
"latakia tobacco that had soaked into things, and of old books and music,"
"a dark smell, like Monsieur Harmost's complexion; the old brown curtains,"
"the sooty little back garden beyond, with its cat-runs, and its one"
stunted sumach tree; the dark-brown stare of Monsieur Harmost's rolling
"eyes brought back that time of happiness, when she used to come week"
"after week, full of gaiety and importance, and chatter away, basking in"
"his brusque admiration and in music, all with the glamourous feeling that"
"she was making him happy, and herself happy, and going to play very"
finely some day.
"The voice of Monsieur Harmost, softly gruff, as if he knew what she was"
"feeling, increased her emotion; her breast heaved under the humming-bird"
"blouse, water came into her eyes, and more than ever her lips quivered."
He was saying:
"""Come, come!  The only thing we cannot cure is age.  You were right to"
"come, my child.  Music is your proper air.  If things are not all what"
"they ought to be, you shall soon forget.  In music--in music, we can get"
"away.  After all, my little friend, they cannot take our dreams from"
"us--not even a wife, not even a husband can do that.  Come, we shall have"
"good times yet!"""
"And Gyp, with a violent effort, threw off that sudden weakness. From"
those who serve art devotedly there radiates a kind of glamour.  She left
"Monsieur Harmost that afternoon, infected by his passion for music."
Poetic justice--on which all homeopathy is founded--was at work to try
"and cure her life by a dose of what had spoiled it.  To music, she now"
"gave all the hours she could spare. She went to him twice a week,"
Books of the beginning of last century to realise the difference of
appeal. Everything offered then was either an appeal to fear or to
"priggishness, and one wonders how it is that our grandparents and their"
parents ever recovered from the effects of such stories as were offered
to them. But there is the consoling thought that no lasting impression
"was made upon them, such as I believe _may_ be possible by the right"
kind of story.
I offer a few examples of the old type of story:
Here is an encouraging address offered by a certain Mr. Janeway to
children about the year 1828:
"“Dare you do anything which your parents forbid you, and neglect to"
"do what they command? Dare you to run up and down on the Lord's Day,"
"or do you keep in to read your book, and learn what your good parents"
command?”
Such an address would have almost tempted children to envy the lot of
"orphans, except that the guardians and less close relations might have"
"been equally, if not more, severe."
"From “The Curious Girl,” published about 1809: “Oh! papa, I hope you"
"will have no reason to be dissatisfied with me, for I love my studies"
"very much, and I am never so happy at my play as when I have been"
assiduous at my lessons all day.”
"“Adolphus: How strange it is, papa, you should believe it possible for"
"me to act so like a child, now that I am twelve years old!”"
Here is a specimen taken from a Chap-book about 1825:
"for you!"""
"Whereupon, though the connection of idea is not obvious, Rollo"
remembered the moment when he had faced the black muzzles of Cabrera's
"muskets in the chill of the morning, and the bitter regret which had"
"then arisen to his mind. Out there in the dark of the palace-garden,"
death fronted him as really though not perhaps so immediately. He
"resolved quickly that he should not have the same regret again, if the"
worst came to the worst. There was no one in the alcove where Concha had
"found him. The Queen-Regent had disappeared to her suite of rooms, and"
thither after a time Señor Muñoz had followed her. The rest were at that
moment being placed in their various posts by the Sergeant according to
Rollo's directions.
So he stooped quickly and kissed Concha upon the mouth.
It was strange. The girl's inevitable instinct on such matters seemed to
have deserted her. In a somewhat wide experience Concha could always
"tell to a second when an attempt of this kind was due. Most women can,"
"and if they are kissed it is because they want to be. (In which, sayeth"
"the Wise Man, is great wisdom!) A fire-alarm rings in their brain with"
"absolute certainty, giving them time to evite the conflagration by a"
healthy douche of cold water. But Rollo the Firebrand again proved
himself the Masterly Incalculable. Or else--but who could suspect
Concha?
"It is, again sayeth the Wise Man, the same with kicking a dog. The brute"
sees the kick coming before a muscle is in motion. He watches the eye of
his opponent and is forearmed. He vanisheth into space. But when Rollo
"interviewed an animal in this fashion, he kicked first and thought"
"afterwards. Hence no sign of his intention appeared in his eye, and the"
dog's yelp arrived almost as a surprise to himself.
"down to earth! Breathless, bewildered, lifted to a height of transport"
"beyond all words, Alwyn gazed upon her in entranced, devout"
"silence,--the vast cathedral seemed to swing round and round in great"
"glittering circles, and nothing was real, nothing steadfast, but that"
"slight, sweet maiden in her soft gray robes, with the Ardath-blossoms"
"gleaming white against her breast! Angel she was,--angel she ever would"
"be,--and yet--what did she SEEM? Naught but:"
"""A child-like woman, wise and very fair,"
"Crowned with the garland of her golden hair!"""
"This, and no more,--and yet in this was all earth and all heaven"
"comprised!--He gazed and gazed, overwhelmed by the amazement of his own"
"bliss,--he could have gazed upon her so in speechless ravishment for"
"hours, when, with a gesture of infinite grace and appeal, she stretched"
out her hands toward him:
"""Speak to me, dearest one!"" she murmured wistfully--""Tell me,--am I"
"welcome?"""
"""O exquisite humility!--O beautiful maiden-timid hesitation! Was"
"she,--even she, God's Angel, so far removed from pride, as to be"
uncertain of her lover's reception of such a gift of love? Roused from
"his half-swooning sense of wonder, he caught those gentle hands, and"
"laid them tenderly against his breast,--tremblingly, and all devoutly,"
"he drew the lovely, yielding form into his arms, close to his"
"heart,--with dazzled sight he gazed down into that pure, perfect face,"
those clear and holy eyes shining like new-created stars beneath the
soft cloud of clustering fair hair!
"""Welcome!"" he echoed, in a tone that thrilled with passionate awe and"
"ecstasy;--""My Edris! My Saint! My Queen! Welcome, more welcome than the"
"of Death coming in heroic form, as when a man or woman dies for a great"
"cause, in which he has opportunity of admiring courage, devotion and"
"unselfishness; or of Death coming as a result of treachery, such as"
"we find in the death of Baldur, of Siegfried, and of others, so that"
children may learn to abhor such deeds; but also a fair proportion of
"stories dealing with death that comes naturally, when our work is done"
"and our strength gone, which has no more tragedy than the falling of"
a leaf from the tree. In this way we can give children the first idea
that the individual is so much less than the whole.
Quite small children often take Death very naturally. A boy of five
met two of his older companions at the school door. They said sadly
"and solemnly: “We have just seen a dead man!” “Well,” said the little"
"philosopher, “that's all right. We've _all_ got to die when our work's"
done.”
"In one of the Buddha stories which I reproduce at the end of this book,"
"the little Hare (who is, I think, a symbol of nervous Individualism)"
"constantly says: “Suppose the Earth were to fall in, what would become"
of me?”
"As an antidote to the ordinary attitude towards death, I commend an"
"episode from a German folk-lore story called “Unlucky John,” which is"
included in the list of stories recommended at the end of this book.
The following sums up in poetic form some of the material necessary for
the wants of a child:
THE CHILD.
"The little new soul has come to Earth,"
"ravine. It was decided, too, that there was not a moment to be lost in"
"putting their plan into execution. In consequence, Castro immediately"
took his departure.
The hour that passed before the time set for Johnson to leave the cabin
"was a most trying one for both of them. It was not so hard on the man,"
"of course, for he was excited over the prospect of escaping; but the"
"Girl, whose mind was filled with the dread of what might happen to him,"
"had nothing to sustain her. Despite his objection, she had stipulated"
"that, with Jackrabbit as a companion, she should accompany him to the"
"outskirts of the camp. And so, at the moment of departure, throwing"
"about her a cloak of some rough material, she went up to her lover and"
said with a quiver in her voice:
"""I'm ready, Dick, but I'm a-figurin' that I can't let you go alone--you"
"jest got to take me below with you, an' that's all there is to it."""
The man shook his head.
"""There's very little risk, believe me. I'll join Castro and ride all"
through the night. I'll be down below in no time at all. But we must be
"going, dear."""
The man passed through the door first. But when it came the Girl's turn
"she hesitated, for she had seen a dark shadow flit by the window. It was"
"as if someone had been stealthily watching there. In another moment,"
"however, it turned out to be Jackrabbit and, greatly relieved, the Girl"
whispered to Johnson that he was to descend the trail between the Indian
"and herself, and that on no account was he to utter a word until she"
gave him permission.
"For another moment or so they stood in silence; Johnson, appreciating"
"Fiorsen, who had leaped out of bed, put his hand to his head.  The cursed"
"fellow!  Cursed be every one of them--the father and the girl, Rosek and"
all the other sharks!  He went out on to the landing.  The house was
"quite still below.  Rosek had gone--good riddance!  He called, ""Gyp!""  No"
answer.  He went into her room. Its superlative daintiness struck his
fancy.  A scent of cyclamen! He looked out into the garden.  There was
"the baby at the end, and that fat woman.  No Gyp!  Never in when she was"
"wanted.  Wagge!  He shivered; and, going back into his bedroom, took a"
brandy-bottle from a locked cupboard and drank some.  It steadied him; he
"locked up the cupboard again, and dressed."
"Going out to the music-room, he stopped under the trees to make passes"
with his fingers at the baby.  Sometimes he felt that it was an adorable
"little creature, with its big, dark eyes so like Gyp's. Sometimes it"
"excited his disgust--a discoloured brat.  This morning, while looking at"
"it, he thought suddenly of the other that was coming--and grimaced."
Catching Betty's stare of horrified amazement at the face he was making
"at her darling, he burst into a laugh and turned away into the"
music-room.
"While he was keying up his violin, Gyp's conduct in never having come"
there for so long struck him as bitterly unjust.  The girl--who cared
about the wretched girl?  As if she made any real difference!  It was all
"so much deeper than that.  Gyp had never loved him, never given him what"
"he wanted, never quenched his thirst of her!  That was the heart of it."
No other woman he had ever had to do with had been like that--kept his
thirst unquenched. No; he had always tired of them before they tired of
him.  She gave him nothing really--nothing!  Had she no heart or did she
give it elsewhere?  What was that Paul had said about her music-lessons?
"And suddenly it struck him that he knew nothing, absolutely nothing, of"
where she went or what she did.  She never told him anything.
"Music-lessons?  Every day, nearly, she went out, was away for hours.  The"
was simply the train of thought aroused which struck Bainbridge
unpleasantly. He felt Schaeffer to be capable of almost any villainy
provided it could be accomplished with safety to himself. The
"humiliation of that fight, too, had added a powerful incentive to the"
one already offered by Crane and the Lumber Trust for the eclipse of Bob
Bainbridge. And a total eclipse would be so easy! Just a single shot
fired from the bushes at a moment when there was no one else about to
see or hear. In this wild country the chances of escaping were infinite.
The man might not even be suspected.
"Bob suddenly moved his shoulders impatiently, frowned, and turned away."
A moment later his eyes twinkled mirthfully.
"“Another minute and I’d have the undertaker picked out,” he chuckled."
"“The scoundrel hasn’t the common courage to do murder. All the same,” he"
"added, with a decisive squaring of the shoulders, “I’ll put a crimp in"
"his little game about those records. I’ll have cookee scrape ’em all up,"
"and ship the whole bunch down to John. That clerk, Wiggins, can put ’em"
"together, I’ll bet! Patience is his middle name--patience and picture"
"puzzles. We’ll have the laugh on Pete, after all--hanged if we won’t!”"
CHAPTER IX. IN THE SWIFT CURRENT
"The clumsy, slow-moving scow loaded with the cook’s outfit and a supply"
"of bedding followed the drive downstream, and, that night, fastened up"
"to the bank close to the inlet of Deer Pond, the middle one of three"
small bodies of water strung along the length of the Megantic. It was a
"full day’s work, much better than Bainbridge had hoped for, and, as he"
approached the big drying fire flaming up at one side of the camp made
"by Charlie Hanley, the cook, Bob shook his own hand in silent, grinning"
self-congratulation. He knew that they were far from being out of the
"abdomen slightly tumid; tenderness over lower half, especially"
on left side; the lower half moves little with respiration.
Twenty-four hours later the patient had improved. He was
comfortable and hopeful; slept well with morphia 1/3 grain
"hypodermically. Tongue moist, covered with white fur; has been"
"taking milk only, [Symbol: ounce]ij every half-hour. No"
sickness. Temperature
99°. Pulse 104. Respirations 24. Abdomen flatter; general
respiratory movement; tenderness now mainly localised to an
"area 2-1/2 inches in diameter, to the left of the umbilicus,"
above exit wound.
"The patient continued to improve, and on the fifth day"
travelled six hours in a bullock wagon to Bloemfontein. Soon
"after arrival his temperature was normal: pulse 80,"
"respirations 16, with good abdominal movement. Local tenderness"
"persisted in the same area, but was less in degree. Tongue"
"rather dry, bowels confined. Micturition normal. Two drachms of"
castor oil and an enema were given.
"On the ninth day patient was practically well, except for"
slight deep tenderness. He remained in bed on ordinary light
"diet, but at the end of the third week he was seized by a"
"sudden attack of pain, the temperature rising to 103° and the"
"pulse to 140, the abdomen becoming swollen and tender. He was"
"then under the charge of Mr. Bowlby, who ordered some opium,"
and the symptoms rapidly subsided. Although this wound crossed
"the small intestine area, it is probable that the symptoms may"
have been due to an injury of the rectum or sigmoid flexure.
disturbances Captain Peasley made his way shoreward from the ship to
"scan the scene, and the sight of his uniform excited the ire of the"
"strikers afresh. After a glance over the mob, he remarked to Emerson:"
"""Bli'me! It looks like a bloody riot already, doesn't it? Four hundred"
pounds to those dock wallopers! Huh! You know if I allowed them to
"bleed me that way--"""
"At that instant, from some quarter, a railroad spike whizzed past the"
"Captain's head, banging against the boards behind him with such a thump"
that the dignified Englishman ducked quickly amid a shout of derision.
He began to curse them roundly in his own particular style.
"""You'd better keep under cover, Captain,"" advised Emerson. ""They don't"
"seem to care for you."""
"""So it would appear,"" he agreed. ""They're getting nawsty, aren't they?"
"I hope it doesn't lawst."""
"""Well, I hope it does,"" said George Balt. ""If they'll only keep at it"
and beat up some of our boys at quitting-time the whole gang will be
"here in the morning."""
"It seemed that his wishes bade fair to be realized, for, as the day"
"wore on, instead of diminishing, the excitement increased. By evening"
it became so menacing that Boyd was forced to send in an urgent demand
"for a squadron of bluecoats to escort his men to their lodgings, and it"
was only by the most vigorous efforts that a serious clash was averted.
Nor was this task the easier since it did not meet with the approval of
"the fishermen themselves, who keenly resented protection of any sort."
"True to George's prediction, the next morning found the non union men"
convinced than ever before that there were at least distinct periods of
_good_ fortune in every man's life.
"Before reaching Gravesend, we halted at a grassy spot near the river"
"bank, where we ate our dinner. When the horses had rested, we set off for"
"Rochester, in which place we expected to spend the night at the Maid's"
"Garter, a famous old inn kept by a friend of Pickerings."
I had noticed a twinkle in Pickering's eyes when he directed us to go to
"this tavern, but did not understand the cause of his merriment until I"
"learned that by a curious old custom, a maid seeking entrance for the"
first time must contribute one of her garters before being admitted. The
worst feature of the usage was that the garter must be taken off at the
"door, and then and there presented to the porter, who received it on the"
point of his official staff.
"After entering Rochester, we went to the Maid's Garter and at once drove"
"into the courtyard, as the custom is with travellers intending to remain"
all night.
"When we left the coach and started to climb the steps to the great door,"
we found the landlord and his retinue waiting to receive us. Frances was
"in the lead, and when we reached the broad, flat stone in front of the"
"door, the head porter stepped before her, bowed, and asked humbly:--"
"""Is my lady maid or madam?"""
"Frances looked up in surprise, and he repeated his question."
"""What is that to you, fellow?"" asked Frances."
"""It is this, my lady,"" returned the porter. ""If my lady be a maid, she"
"Jogues, Isaac, referred to, 73."
"Orange, Fort, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Rochelle, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Torture, Indian, Bressani by the Iroquois, 73."
ESCAPE OF BRESSANI                           73
"march of several days,--during which Bressani, in wading a rocky"
"stream, fell from exhaustion and was nearly drowned,--they reached"
an Iroquois town. It is needless to follow the revolting details
of the new torments that succeeded. They hung him by the feet
"with chains; placed food for their dogs on his naked body, that"
they might lacerate him as they ate; and at last had reduced his
emaciated frame to such a condition that even they themselves stood
"in horror of him. ""I could not have believed,"" he writes to his"
"Superior, ""that a man was so hard to kill."" He found among them"
"those who, from compassion or from a refinement of cruelty, fed"
"him, for he could not feed himself. They told him jestingly that"
they wished to fatten him before putting him to death.
The council that was to decide his fate met on the nineteenth of
"June, when to the prisoner's amazement, and, as it seemed, to their"
"own surprise, they resolved to spare his life. He was given, with"
"due ceremony, to an old woman, to take the place of a deceased"
"relative; but since he was as repulsive, in his mangled condition"
"as, by the Indian standard, he was useless, she sent her son"
"with him to Fort Orange, to sell him to the Dutch. With the same"
"humanity which they had shown in the case of Jogues, they gave a"
"for a fresh dwelling place, the hotel servants or the police raided"
her bedroom and found the little hoard of notes? This imagined
"danger made her want to cry. They were so friendless now, she in"
particular felt so completely deserted. Had she deserved this
punishment by Fate? Was there after all a God who minded much about
the sex foolishnesses and punished you for irregularities--for
"having lovers in your youth, for selling your virtue and inducing"
other women to sell theirs? Was she going to die soon and was there
a hereafter?' She burst out crying in an abandonment of grief.
An elderly gardener who had been snipping and sweeping in the next
house came up and vaguely recognized her as a well-known
"Bruxelloise, a good-natured lady, a foreigner who, strange to say,"
"spoke Flemish. ""Ach,"" he said, looking out where he thought lay the"
"source of her tears, at the dim view of beautiful Brussels through"
"the steamy glass, ""Onze arme, oude Brüssel."" Mrs. Warren wept"
"unrestrainedly. ""Madame is ill?"" he enquired. Mrs. Warren"
nodded--she felt indeed very ill and giddy. He left her and returned
"shortly with a small glass of Schnapps. ""If Madame is faint--?"" She"
sipped the cordial and presently felt better. Then they talked of
old times. Madame had kept the Hotel Leopold II in the Rue
"Royale? Ah, _now_ he placed her. A _superb_ establishment, always"
"well-spoken of. Her self-respect returned a little. ""Yes,"" she said,"
"""never a complaint! I looked after those girls like a mother, indeed"
"I did. Many a one married well from there."" The gardener"
"corroborated her statement, and added that her _clientèle_ had been"
of the most chic. He had a private florist's business of his own and
he had been privileged often to send bouquets to the pensionnaires
of Madame. But Madame was not alone surely in these sad times. Had
he not seen her come here with a handsome English lady who was said
to have been--to have been--fortunately--_au mieux_ with one of the
German officials?
"“Thank you--Curly,” Bainbridge said in a level voice. “That was"
touch-and-go for a minute.”
"That was all, but somehow Curly knew that what he had done was"
understood and appreciated. In the stress of the peril which the two had
"shared shoulder to shoulder like common brother river hogs, Kollock’s"
anger and hate had vanished utterly. He no longer desired revenge. His
attitude of a scant half hour before seemed small and mean and petty. He
"had saved the life of the man his brother wanted out of the way, and,"
"given the opportunity, he would do it as promptly again."
CHAPTER XIII. THE LIMIT
Curly Kollock’s interest and liking for his boss grew stronger day after
day. There was something about Bob Bainbridge which stirred the finer
"qualities in his nature, and brought twinges of shame to the young"
riverman whenever he thought how near he had come to throwing his lot
with his brother. If Bill ever showed up he resolved to tell him just
"what he thought of him, too. But in the meantime, not being much of a"
"penman, he made no effort to answer the letter. It was sufficient that"
he considered himself cut loose from the whole miserable bunch. If they
were expecting aid from him in their plotting they were doomed to
disappointment.
"More and more often as they descended the Katahdin River, the boy was"
stirred to anger at the constant succession of moves made by that gang
of crooks against the man who fought them practically alone and
singlehanded.
Along the river were several dams placed for the purpose of regulating
the head of water and facilitating the process of driving. They belonged
they had nothing to fear. He was sorry the soldiers had helped
themselves so freely to the livestock; but everything had now
"settled down. Henceforth they would be sure of something to eat, as"
he himself had got to be fed. And all he asked of them was their
agreeable society.
"Two months went by of this strange life. Two months, in which Vivie"
only saw German newspapers--which she read with the aid of von
Giesselin. Their contents filled her with despair. They made very
"little of the Marne rebuff, much of the capture of Antwerp and"
"Ostende, and the occupation of all Belgium (as they put it). Vivie"
noted that the German Emperor's heart had bled for the punishment
"inflicted on Louvain. (She wondered how that strange personality,"
"her father, had fared in the destruction of monastic buildings.) But"
"she had then no true idea of what had taken place, and the"
far-reaching harm this crime had done to the German reputation. She
noted that the German Press expressed disappointment that the cause
"of Germany, the crusade against Albion, had received no support from"
"the Irish Nationalists, or from the ""revolting"" women, the"
"Suffragettes, who had been so cruelly maltreated by the"
administration of Asquith and Sir Grey.
"This point was discussed by the Colonel, but Vivie found herself"
speaking as a patriot. How _could_ the Germans expect British women
to turn against their own country in its hour of danger?
"""Then you would not,"" said von Giesselin, ""consent to write some"
"letters to your friends, if I said I could have them sent safely to"
"their destination?--only letters,"" he added hastily, seeing her"
"nostrils quiver and a look come into her eyes--""to ask your Suffrage"
friends to bring pressure to bear on their Government to bring this
"d-r-r-eadful War to a just peace. That is all we ask."" But Vivie"
"father, and two other men. Susanna was most smart; she greeted Laura and"
"Cæsar very affably, and presented her father, Mr. Russell; then she"
"presented an English author, tall, skinny, with blue eyes, a white"
"beard, and hair like a halo; and then a young Englishman from the"
"Embassy, a very distinguished person named Kennedy, who was a Catholic."
_TEA_
"After the introductions they passed into the dining-room, which was"
"most impressive. It was an exhibition of very smart women, some of"
"them ideally beautiful, and idle men. All about them resounded a nasal"
English of the American sort.
Susanna Marchmont served the tea and did the honours to her guests.
"They all talked French, excepting Mr. Russell, who once in a long while"
uttered some categorical monosyllable in his own language.
Mr. Russell was not of the classic Yankee type; he looked like a vulgar
"Englishman. He was a serious man, with a short moustache, grey-headed,"
with three or four gold teeth.
What to Cæsar seemed wonderful in this gentleman was his economy of
"words. There was not one useless expression in his vocabulary, and"
"not the slightest redundancy; whatever partook of merit, prestige, or"
"nobility was condensed, for him, to the idea of value; whatever partook"
"of arrangement, cleanliness, order, was condensed to the word “comfort”;"
"so that Mr. Russell, with a very few words, had everything specified."
"To Susanna, imbued with her preoccupation in supreme _chic_, her father"
no doubt did not seem a completely decorative father; but he gave Cæsar
I am glad to add that the views we hold seem to have come at last to be
shared by the more responsible part of the French amongst the
"governmental circle, as well as by the general public. The newspapers"
"which are still sticking to their old contention are very few in number,"
and they seem to have some particular reasons of their own. I can never
think a nation like France could consciously and wilfully offend against
"justice and equity, and the only thing we anxiously hope for is that the"
declaration of the French Government may be honestly and effectually
"followed up. Whatever may be one's intention, the drift of events often"
"creates unlooked-for incidents, and that too often against one's will,"
when it is too late to avoid the consequences. Let all parties concerned
be careful in this matter of vital importance.

JAPAN AND EUROPE[1]
You ask my opinion on the future of the Yellow Peril cry. From an
ethical point of view it is an unjust and unreasonable accusation. From
a practical point of view it is idle and useless talk.
I have spoken and written on these particular points so often that I do
"not feel inclined to reiterate any more. I will, however, consider the"
matter from a different point of view and solicit any answer which may
be advanced against my conviction. I do not do this from any thought of
vanity; I should be very sorry if it were ever taken in that sense. I
"The ""Sunderland,"" like her consorts, was already cleared for action."
"All the crew were behind the protected portions of the ship, but the"
captain and seven of the officers elected to fight the ship not from
the armoured conning-tower but from the fore-bridge.
"""By Jove! They're at it already,"" exclaimed Oswestry, as a series of"
rapid detonations came from across the dunes.
By the aid of their glasses the officers could discern the fleecy
mushrooms of smoke caused by the bursting of the anti-aerial guns
directed against the British airmen. Viewed from a distance it seemed
impossible that a frail aeroplane could exist amid that tornado of
shell.
"""Wireless reports mobile battery three hundred yards sou'-sou'-east"
"of Clemskercke church, sir,"" reported a signalman."
Promptly the news was transmitted to the fire-control platform. In
his lofty perch a gunnery-lieutenant was busy with a complication of
"instruments, assisted by a midshipman and three seamen."
"""Fire-control to for'ard 6-inch gun: stand by!"" came the telephonic"
"order. ""Fire-control to port battery stand by."""
"Round swung the guns, ""laid"" by the master hand of the"
gunnery-lieutenant on the fire-control platform. Docilely obedient to
the delicate mechanism they reared their muzzles high in the air.
"Then, with a crash that shook the ship, five of the 6-inch guns spoke"
simultaneously. To the accompaniment of a long-drawn shriek the
100-pound missiles hurtled through space.

In the meantime he received the news of the papal absolution. In
"connection with this he had, once more, to visit England, little"
dreaming that it would be the last time he should set foot on British
soil. In Ammonius's house of Saint Stephen's Chapel at Westminster on 9
"April 1517, the ceremony of absolution took place, ridding Erasmus for"
good of the nightmare which had oppressed him since his youth. At last
he was free!
Invitations and specious promises now came to him from all sides.
Mountjoy and Wolsey spoke of high ecclesiastical honours which awaited
him in England. Budaeus kept pressing him to remove to France. Cardinal
"Ximenes wanted to attach him to the University of Alcalá, in Spain. The"
Duke of Saxony offered him a chair at Leipzig. Pirckheimer boasted of
"the perfections of the free imperial city of Nuremberg. Erasmus,"
"meanwhile, overwhelmed again with the labour of writing and editing,"
"according to his wont, did not definitely decline any of these offers;"
neither did he accept any. He always wanted to keep all his strings on
his bow at the same time. In the early summer of 1517 he was asked to
"accompany the court of the youthful Charles, who was on the point of"
leaving the Netherlands for Spain. But he declined. His departure to
Spain would have meant a long interruption of immediate contact with the
"great publishing centres, Basle, Louvain, Strassburg, Paris, and that,"
"in turn, would have meant postponement of his life-work. When, in the"
"beginning of July, the prince set out for Middelburg, there to take ship"
"for Spain, Erasmus started for Louvain."
"He was thus destined to go to this university environment, although it"
"displeased him in so many respects. There he would have academic duties,"
young latinists would follow him about to get their poems and letters
"The cooks served out the greasy stew as quickly as they could, but we"
were so tired and ill-tempered that we shouted abuse at them without
"reason and without being provoked, and banged our plates and tins. The"
"war, the advance, the slaughter were forgotten. We were conscious of"
"nothing but weariness, stiffness, and petty irritation."
The following day we marched to a ration dump. The wooden cases of
"rations were piled up in gigantic cubes, so that the entire dump looked"
"like a town of windowless, wooden buildings. We formed one long file"
"that circled slowly past the stacks, each man taking one case on to his"
shoulder or back and carrying it to the train. And so we circled round
and round throughout the monotonous day.
"In the evening I did not wait in the dinner queue, but went to the St."
Martin. It was kept by an old woman and her two daughters. They were
tortured by anxiety:
"""Les Allemands vont venir ici--de Shermans come heer?"" they asked. But I"
"knew no more than they did. I told them, against my own conviction, that"
"the German advance would be held up, but they remained anxious. The"
uproar of the cannonade was louder than ever. All the windows of the
"building shook and rattled. The old woman muttered: ""'Tis niet goet,"
"'tis niet goet,"" and the elder daughter echoed: ""Oh, 'tiss no bon, 'tiss"
"no bon."""
Two British officers entered. They looked round and saw that private
soldiers were sitting at the tables. But the St. Martin was the biggest
"estaminet in the village and provided the best wines and coffees, so"
"they stood in the doorway, undecided what to do. They asked one of the"
girls if there was a restaurant for officers in the neighbourhood. She
"answered: ""No--no restaurant for officeerss--you come heer--privates,"
"zey no hurt you--privates, officeerss, all same."""

ANTIMONII ET POTASSII TARTARS--ANTIMONY AND POTASSIUM TARTRATE--TARTAR
EMETIC
"DERIVATION.--Make a white paste with cream of tartar, antimony trioxide"
"and water. Set aside 24 hours, boil in water 15 minutes and crystallize."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, transparent crystals of the rhombic system,"
"becoming opaque and white on exposure to the air, or a white granular"
"powder without odor and having a sweet, afterwards disagreeable,"
"metallic taste. Soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep, 2 to 5 gr.; pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1"
"gr.; dogs, ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ gr. As an emetic for pigs, 4 to 10 gr.; dogs, 1"
to 2 gr.
"ACTIONS.--Tartar emetic is a systemic and local emetic, a diaphoretic,"
cardiac and arterial sedative and a gastro-intestinal irritant. It is a
"powerful waste producer and stimulates the secretions of the stomach,"
"intestines, salivary glands, liver and pancreas. Large doses cause"
"nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, while toxic doses are followed by"
"vomiting (in animals that can vomit), serious blood purging, great"
"depression of the circulation and respiration weakness, collapse and"
death. Tartar emetic is also a vermifuge.
The duke's features were hard as steel. Yet he read the other's humor
and joined him with the zest of the hour.
"""You smile once more!"" said the grim lord of the woods, turning to the"
slender form in the saddle.
"""I shall smile in the hour when the Frangipani lies at my feet,"""
"Francesco replied with heaving chest. ""It is good to be strong!"""
"The duke's horsemen were scouring ahead, keeping cover, scanning the"
"horizon for the Provencals. By noon they had left the open land,"
plunged up hills covered thick with woods. The duke's squadrons sifted
"through, and he halted them in the woods under the brow of the hill."
"Below lay a broad valley running north and south, chequered with"
pine-thickets and patches of brushwood. On a hill in the centre stood
a ruined tower. Towards the south a broad loop of the river closed the
"valley, while all around on the misty hills shimmered the giants of"
"the forest, mysterious and silent. The duke's outriders had fallen"
back and taken cover in the thickets. Down the valley could be seen a
"line of spears, glittering snake-like towards the tower on the hill."
"Companies of horse were crossing the river, pushing up the slopes,"
mass on mass. In the midst of the flickering shields and spears blew a
great banner with the Fleur-de-Lis.
"It was a contingent of Charles of Anjou, which had been on the march"
since dawn. They had thrown their advance guard across the river and
"were straggling up the green slopes, while the main host crossed the"
ford.
The sound of a clarion re-echoed from crag to crag: and down towards
were moving in and out amongst them. The French had arrived.
"The next morning, about breakfast time, the first shell burst near the"
camp--a short rapid squeal followed by a sharp report. The second shell
"burst a few minutes after, throwing up earth and smoke. A steel fragment"
came sailing over in a wide parabola and struck the foot of a man
"standing in the breakfast queue. He limped to the first-aid hut, looking"
"very pale. When he got there, he had some difficulty in finding his"
"wound, it was so slight."
We paraded and marched off. Several shells burst in the neighbouring
fields. We reached the ration dump and began to load the train. A
civilian arrived with the newspapers. Our N.C.O.'s were powerless to
stop the general stampede that surged towards the paper-vendor.
The Germans had advanced on a wide front ... Armentières had fallen. The
news was several days old and much might have happened since.
We went back to our work and discussed events. We were bullied and
"threatened with arrest, but we talked in groups while we carried cases"
of rations. Would we be involved in the advance? We might even be
captured--that would at least be an experience and a change.
In the evening a few of us went to the St. Martin to see if the old
woman and her daughter had been able to fetch their property away. We
"observed that the windows, where tinned fruit, chocolate, cakes, soap,"
"postcards, and other articles used to be exhibited, had been cleared"
completely. We entered and found one of the girls in tears:
"""All gone--all gone--I show you--you come into de cellar--all de wine"
"gone--bottles all, all broken. English soldiers come in de night and"
take everysing 'vay--ve nussing left--it's de soldiers in de camp over
SPIRITUS FRUMENTI--WHISKY
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid obtained by the distillation of the
"mash of fermented grain (usually of mixtures of corn, wheat and rye) and"
at least four years old.
PROPERTIES.--An amber-colored liquid having a distinctive odor and
"taste, and a slightly acid reaction. Its specific gravity should not be"
"more than 0.945, nor less than 0.924, corresponding, approximately, to"
"an alcoholic strength of 37 to 47.5 per cent, by weight, or 44 to 55 per"
"cent, by volume. Contains no more than traces of fusel oil. The"
alcoholic liquors owe their flavor to bouquet to ethers which are only
"developed in course of time. The amylic alcohol, or fusel oil, in whisky"
"is therefore converted into ethers, which give the characteristic flavor"
to whisky.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep and swine, 1 to 2 oz.; dogs,"
"1 to 4 dr., diluted three to four times its bulk in water."
SPIRITS VINI GALLICI--BRANDY
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid obtained by the distillation of the
"fermented unmodified juice of fresh grapes, and at least four years old."
"PROPERTIES.--A pale amber-colored liquid, having a distinctive odor and"
taste and a slightly acid reaction. Its specific gravity should not be
"more than 0.941, nor less than 0.925 at 15.6° C. (60° F.),"
"corresponding, approximately, to an alcoholic strength of 39 to 47 per"
"cent, by weight, or 46 to 55 per cent, by volume, of absolute alcohol."
"dead within him. If a man has lived a wicked life, he dies a wicked man,"
and no wicked man can obtain the perfect rest of the sinless dead.
Heaven is shut to him. But if heaven is shut it is not shut for ever; if
"hell may perhaps open to him it is only for a time, only till he is"
purified and washed from the stain of his sins; and then he can begin
"again, and have another chance to win heaven. If there is no immediate"
"heaven there is no eternal hell, and in due time all will reach heaven;"
"all will have learnt, through suffering, the wisdom the Buddha has shown"
"to us, that only by a just life can men reach the Great Peace even as he"
did.
So that if Buddhism has none of the consolation for the dying man that
"Christianity holds out, in the hope of heaven, so it has none of the"
threats and terrors of our faith. There is no fear of an angry Judge--of
a Judge who is angry.
"And yet when I came to think over the matter, it seemed to me that"
surely there must be something to calm him in the face of death. If
"Buddhism does not furnish this consolation, he must go elsewhere for it."
"And I was not satisfied, because I could find nothing in the sacred"
"books about a man's death, that therefore the creed of the people had"
"ignored it. A living creed must, I was sure, provide for this somehow."
"So I went to a friend of mine, a Burman magistrate, and I asked him:"
"'When a man is dying, what does he try to think of? What do you say to"
"comfort him that his last moments may be peace? The monks do not come, I"
know.'
"'The monks!' he said, shaking his head; 'what could they do?'"
I did not know.
"do not suffer."""
CHAPTER VI
GUESSWORK
"Cary tried to shake my resolution, but I was obdurately silent. While"
"he canvassed the whole position, bringing to bear his really profound"
knowledge of naval equipment and routine--and incidentally helping me
greatly to realise the improbability of my own guesswork solution--I
was able to maintain an air of lofty superiority. I must have
"aggravated him intensely, unpardonably, for I was his guest. He ought"
to have kicked me out. Yet he bore with me like the sweet-blooded
"kindly angel that he is, and when at the end it appeared that I was"
"right after all, Cary was the first to pour congratulations and honest"
admiration upon me. If he reads this book he will know that I am
repentant--though I must confess that I should behave in just the same
abominable way if the incident were to occur again. There is no great
value in repentance such as this.
"We reached Dawson's office in the early afternoon, and found his chief"
"assistant there, but no Dawson. ""The old man,"" remarked that officer,"
"a typical, stolid, faithful detective sergeant, ""is out on the"
rampage. He ought by rights to sit here directing the staff and leave
"the outside investigations to me. He is a high-up man, almost a deputy"
"assistant commissioner, and has no call to be always disguising"
himself and playing his tricks on everybody. I suppose you know that
"white-haired old gent down here ain't a bit like Bill Dawson, who's"
its way as Trafalgar. It proved that the whole German Fleet could not
fight out an action against our full force and have the smallest hope
of success. I am just praying for the chance of a whack at them in the
"_Malplaquet_. My destroyer was a bonny ship, the best in the flotilla,"
"but the _Malplaquet_ is a real peach. You should see her."""
"""We mean to,"" said Cary. ""This very afternoon. You shall take us back"
"with you."""
"The Commander opened his eyes at this cool proposal, but we prevailed"
"upon him to seek the permission of the Admiral-Superintendent, who, a"
"good deal to my surprise, proved to be quite pliable. Cary's"
reputation for discretion must be very high in the little village
where he lives if it is able to guarantee so disreputable a scribbler
"as Bennet Copplestone! The Admiral, fortunately, had not read any of"
my Works before they had been censored. When printed in _Cornhill_
they were comparatively harmless.
I must not describe the _Malplaquet_. Her design was not new to me--I
had seen more than one of her type--but as she is now a unit in
Beatty's Fleet her existence is not admitted to the world. As we went
"up and down her many steep narrow ladders, and peered into dark"
"corners, I looked everywhere for a Marine sentry whom I could identify"
"by mark of ear as Dawson. I never saw him, but Trehayne passed me"
"twice, and I found myself again admiring his splendid young manhood."
"He was not big, being rather slim and wiry than strongly built, but in"
"sheer beauty of face and form he was almost perfectly fashioned. ""Do"
"you know that man?"" I asked of our commander, indicating Trehayne."
"""No,"" said he. ""He is one of the shore party. But I should like to"
have him with me. He is one of the smartest looking petty officers
"that I have ever seen."""
"walls, considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and"
"knees, rummaging mantel and tables, the curtains and hangings, the"
"drunken cabinet in the corner, for a visible sign, unable to perceive"
"that she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging"
"to him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses"
that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call. Once again he
"answered loudly: “Yes, dear!” and turned, wild-eyed, to gaze on"
"vacancy, for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and"
"outstretched arms in the odour of mignonette. Oh, God! whence that"
"odour, and since when have odours had a voice to call? Thus he groped."
"He burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes."
These he passed in passive contempt. But once he found in a fold of the
"matting a half-smoked cigar, and this he ground beneath his heel with a"
green and trenchant oath. He sifted the room from end to end. He found
dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of
"her whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit"
"seemed to hover there, he found no trace."
And then he thought of the housekeeper.
He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a
crack of light. She came out to his knock. He smothered his excitement
as best he could.
"“Will you tell me, madam,” he besought her, “who occupied the room I"
have before I came?”
"“Yes, sir. I can tell you again. ’Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said."
"Miss B’retta Sprowls it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was."
My house is well known for respectability. The marriage certificate
"hung, framed, on a nail over—”"
"seize them in my strong arms, I will bear them harmless through the"
falling rafters and the blazing beams.’ Then the sad thought came
to him that the children were romping and ignorant. ‘If I say the
"house is on fire, they will not understand me. If I try to seize"
"them, they will romp about and try to escape. Alas! not a moment to"
be lost!’ Suddenly a bright thought flashed across the old man's
"mind. ‘My children are ignorant,’ he said; ‘they love toys and"
glittering playthings. I will promise them playthings of unheard-of
beauty. Then they will listen.’
"So the old man shouted: ‘Children, come out of the house and see"
"these beautiful toys! Chariots with white oxen, all gold and"
tinsel. See these exquisite little antelopes. Whoever saw such
"goats as these? Children, children, come quickly, or they will all"
be gone!’
Forth from the blazing ruin the children came in hot haste. The
word ‘plaything’ was almost the only word they could understand.
"Then the Father, rejoiced that his offspring was freed from peril,"
procured for them one of the most beautiful chariots ever seen:
the chariot had a canopy like a pagoda: it had tiny rails and
balustrades and rows of jingling bells. Milk-white oxen drew the
chariot. The children were astonished when they were placed inside.”
(_From the “Thabagata.”_)
"Perhaps, as a compromise, one might give the gentler superstitions to"
"very small children, and leave such a blood-curdling story as Bluebeard"
to a more robust age.
There is one modern method which has always seemed to me much to be
"condemned, and that is the habit of changing the end of a story, for"
"difficulties, for the seaplane was rocking violently, and in spite of"
a dangerous tilt of the elevating planes was appreciably descending.
"Suddenly the frail craft plunged, literally on end, towards the sea,"
"the force of gravity, acting with the pull of the propeller, greatly"
increasing its velocity.
When within two hundred feet of the surface the seaplane made a
"complete loop, then after climbing a hundred feet or so, began to"
side-slip.
"""By Jove! He'll be drowned for a dead cert,"" exclaimed Terence, for"
he knew for a fact that the aviator had not been thrown from the
"chassis when the seaplane ""looped the loop,"" and in consequence must"
be strapped to his seat.
"""Away sea-boat,"" ordered the captain, at the same time giving"
directions for both engines to be reversed.
"The ""Sunderland"" was considerably the nearest warship to the"
"descending airman. Already the ""Livingstone"" and her two sister-ship"
"destroyers were a mile or so away, and wearing at full speed to"
investigate a suspicious swirl in the water.
Shells were again dropping unpleasantly near to the cruiser as Aubyn
"hurried towards the boat which was, owing to being cleared for"
"action, secured inboard, abreast the after funnel."
Before he reached this spot the seaplane had struck the surface of
"the water. Falling obliquely and at a sharp angle, the impact had"
shattered one of the floats. When the cascade of spray had subsided
the wrecked craft could be seen still afloat but listing acutely. The
It was quite dark outside. The duckboards were lit up by rows of
hurricane lamps. The bombardment was still going on.
When I got back to the waiting-room all the prisoners were gone and
English wounded were taking their places. Soon the benches round the
stove were crowded with dark figures whose hands and faces were lit up
by the glow.
A man with haggard features and a bandage round his head began to talk
in a mournful voice:
"""Oh, it's 'ard ter lose yer mates. There was three of us--we was always"
together--we couldn't bear the idea o' separatin'. One of us copped a
packet [got wounded] about three months ago an' went inter dock
"[hospital]--'e wasn't 'alf upset when 'e left us, though 'e was a sure"
Blighty--'e was afeard they'd send 'im to another mob when 'e got well
agin. But 'e came back to us arter all--we didn't 'alf 'ave a bust up
that evenin'. The two of us was absolutely canned to the wide [dead
"drunk]--'e wasn't though, 'e didn' drink much--'e was better'n what we"
was--well-spoken like--didn' go arter no tarts--didn' do no swearin'.
Yer never came acrorst a better mate'n what 'e was! We was goin' over
the top when a shell busted in front of us. It blinded me for a moment
and then when I could see agin--gorblimy--it must 'a' copped 'im in the
stomach an' ripped it open--ugh!--'e was rollin' over wi' all 'is guts
"'angin' out--ugh!--yer should 'a' 'eard 'im groan. 'Me own mate,' I says"
"ter 'im, but 'e didn't rekkernize nothin' and then we 'ad to go on--yer"
can't stop when yer goin' over! Soon arter me other mate copped it too.
"Somethin' bowled 'im clean over, but 'e gets up again an' shows me 'is"
"arm. 'There's a bastard,' 'e says, as cool as yer like--'is 'and was"
blown clean orf at the wrist! He just turned round an' was walkin' orf
to the dressin' station when a shell busted atween us. It copped me in
the 'ead an' knocked me senseless. Arterwards I 'eard me mate 'ad bin
"And, if I do give you another, you needn't suppose--"""
"""Come on inside,"" begged Captain Dove, shivering, in no case to listen"
"to any lecture. ""Come on, and we'll talk sense. Don't waste any more"
"good time."""
"Slyne followed him in again, congratulating himself on his firmness. He"
"felt that he had gained the whip-hand of the old man, and he meant to"
keep it. He curtly refused again Captain Dove's more hospitable offer of
"some refreshment, and, while his aggrieved host was clumsily getting"
"into some warmer clothing, talked to him from the saloon through the"
open doorway of his cramped sleeping-quarters. It was easier to arrange
matters so than under Captain Dove's direct observation.
"""You'll pay me cash, of course,"" Captain Dove stipulated, as though he"
had been bargaining about a charter-party.
"""I'll pay you cash,"" Slyne agreed, ""the day Sallie marries me. And"
"meantime I'll give you my note of hand at thirty days for the money."" He"
"listened intently, but Captain Dove, struggling fretfully with"
"refractory buttons, maintained an ominous silence."
"""I'll have it backed by a London lawyer, to keep you safe,"" said Slyne."
"""And listen! I'm not asking you to risk anything, or even to take my"
note at its face value. I want you to come ashore with me and find out
for yourself from my lawyer that you can depend on the money. If you
"don't feel satisfied about that after you've seen him, you needn't go"
"any farther, we'll call the bargain off; you can get back on board your"
ship at once and no harm done.
"""And, even as regards Sallie, I'm going out of my way to keep you right."
"I'd give a great deal to get married at once, but--I'm willing to wait"
"cold, frosty; Gyp hurried down the path.  Four little icicles had formed"
"beneath the window of the music-room.  They caught her eye, and, passing"
"round to the side, she broke one off. There must be a fire in there, for"
she could see the flicker through the curtains not quite drawn.
"Thoughtful Ellen had been airing it!  But, suddenly, she stood still."
There was more than a fire in there!  Through the chink in the drawn
curtains she had seen two figures seated on the divan.  Something seemed
to spin round in her head.  She turned to rush away.  Then a kind of
"superhuman coolness came to her, and she deliberately looked in. He and"
Daphne Wing!  His arm was round her neck.  The girl's face riveted her
"eyes.  It was turned a little back and up, gazing at him, the lips"
"parted, the eyes hypnotized, adoring; and her arm round him seemed to"
"shiver--with cold, with ecstasy?"
Again that something went spinning through Gyp's head.  She raised her
"hand.  For a second it hovered close to the glass.  Then, with a sick"
"feeling, she dropped it and turned away."
Never!  Never would she show him or that girl that they could hurt her!
Never!  They were safe from any scene she would make--safe in their nest!
"And blindly, across the frosty grass, through the unlighted drawing-room,"
"she went upstairs to her room, locked the door, and sat down before the"
fire.  Pride raged within her.  She stuffed her handkerchief between her
teeth and lips; she did it unconsciously.  Her eyes felt scorched from
"the fire-flames, but she did not trouble to hold her hand before them."
Suddenly she thought: 'Suppose I HAD loved him?' and laughed.  The
"handkerchief dropped to her lap, and she looked at it with wonder--it was"
"blood-stained.  She drew back in the chair, away from the scorching of"
"the fire, and sat quite still, a smile on her lips. That girl's eyes,"
"like a little adoring dog's--that girl, who had fawned on her so!  She"
"had got her ""distinguished man""!  She sprang up and looked at herself in"
"""I will promise if you wish, madame, that no word shall pass my lips,"" I"
"said.  ""But as to assistance, I cannot promise until I am aware of the"
"nature of the service demanded of me."""
"""Of course,"" she exclaimed, with a faint attempt at a smile.  My words"
"had apparently reassured her, for she instantly became calmer, as though"
"relying upon me for help.  ""Then as you give me your promise upon your"
"honour to say nothing, you shall know the truth.  Come with me."""
"She led the way down the long corridor, and turning to the left suddenly"
"opened the door of a large and handsome bed-chamber, the wooden"
sun-blinds of which were closed to keep out the crimson glow of the
sunset.  The room was a fine one with big crystal mirrors and a shining
"toilette-service in silver, but upon the bed with its yellow silk"
"hangings lay a female form fully dressed, but white-faced and"
motionless.  In the dim half-light I could just distinguish the features
as those of Yolande.
"""What has occurred?""  I cried in a hoarse whisper, dashing towards the"
bedside and bending down to look upon the face that had once held me in
fascination.
"""We do not know,"" answered the trembling woman at my side.  ""It is all a"
"mystery."""
I stretched forth my hand and touched her cheek.  It was icy cold.
In those few moments my eyes had become accustomed to the dim light of
"the darkened room, and I detected the change that had taken place in the"
"girl's countenance.  Her eyes were closed, her lips blanched, her fair"
"hair, escaped from its pins, fell in a sheen of gold upon the lace-edged"
thought; and he sent his light craft spinning rapidly up the stream as
the questions formed themselves.
It was an exquisite summer morning.  The bells in the many towers and
steeples of the city had chimed the hour of five.  The sun had long been
"up, yet the glamour and glory of the new-born day still lay upon the"
sleeping city and the dewy meadows of the opposite shore.  Grey rowed on
"rapidly, yet drinking in the beauty of all he saw.  He knew not how far"
he had rowed; he had lost count of his surroundings; he was absorbed in
"a deep reverie, when he was suddenly brought up breathless and wondering"
by the sound of a voice singing—a voice so clear and sweet and true that
"he asked himself whether it could be any creature of earth that sang, or"
whether it might be some nymph or mermaid such as sailors spoke of in
their wondrous tales.
"He gazed about him.  He saw that he was passing a garden, and that a"
group of weeping willows overhung the water at this spot.  The singing
"seemed to come from thence.  Burning curiosity possessed him, and he"
"very slowly and softly rowed himself onwards, till the prow of his boat"
met the drooping boughs with a soft rustle.  The song ceased suddenly.
"Grey turned in his seat, and drew himself within the sheltering shade;"
"as he did so, a quick exclamation broke from him.  He dropped his oars"
"as he exclaimed,—"
"""The Lady Geraldine!"""
*      *      *      *      *
How had it come about?  Grey never could have said.  But now it was all
told—the story of his chequered life.  She had been silent at the
"first—not exactly resentful of his intrusion, not unwilling to let him"
"have speech of her again, but quiet, with a maidenly reserve and dignity"
"missals, hours, offices, prayer books, etc., go under _Baptists,"
"Benedictines, Catholic Church, Church of England, Friends_, etc."
That part of a body which belongs to any place should be entered
"under the name of the body, not the place: e.g., _Congregationalists"
"in New England_, _Congregationalists in Massachusetts_, not _New"
"England Congregationalists_, _Massachusetts Congregationalists_. But"
cross-references must be made from the place (indeed in cases like
"_Massachusetts Convention_, _Essex Conference_, it may be doubted"
whether those well-known names should not be the headings).
"Enter corporations and quasi corporations, both English and"
"foreign, under their names as they read, neglecting an initial"
article or serial number when there is one.
"Enter orders of knighthood, both those of medieval times and their"
"honorary modern equivalents, under the significant word of the"
"English title: e.g., _Garter, Order of the_; _Malta, Knights"
"of_; _Templars, Knights_; _Teutonic Order_; _Freemasons_. But"
"the American Knights Templars, being merely a division of the"
"Freemasons, belong under _Freemasons_; so of other regular"
masonic bodies.
The colleges of an English university and the unnamed professional
schools of an American university go under the university's
"name. Such professional schools, if they have a distinctive"
"name, particularly if at a distance from the university, or for"
"any other reason less closely connected with it, go under their"
"own name: e.g., _Oxford University, Magdalen College_; _Harvard"
"University, Veterinary School_; but _Barnard College, Columbia"
"University_; _Radcliffe College, Harvard University_; _Sheffield"
Scientific School of Yale University_.
She made him a formal bow and was leaving the room; but his voice
stopped her.
"“Your anxiety cannot be very great, or you would wait to learn whether"
your suspicions are baseless or not.”
"She paused, in a dignified attitude, with her hand on the back of a"
"chair, while he adjusted his gold pince-nez and ran through the list."
"“You are right so far,” he said coldly. “The names are identical.”"
They parted at the door. The Canon walked back to his hotel with anger
"in his heart. In spite of cumulative evidence, the theory that his"
cousin had insinuated was prima facie preposterous. It was important
"enough, however, to need some investigation. But the feeling uppermost"
in his mind was indignation with Mrs. Winstanley. He was too shrewd a
man not to have perceived long ago her jealousy of Yvonne; but beyond
"keeping a watchful eye lest his wife should receive hurt, he had not"
"condescended to take it into serious consideration. Now, beneath her"
impressive manner he clearly divined the desire to inflict on Yvonne
"a deadly injury. To have leaped at such a conclusion, to have sought"
"subsequent proof from the Visitors’ List, argued malicious design. He"
could never forgive her.
Still the matter had to be cleared up at once. On his arrival at the
"Océan, he went forthwith to Yvonne’s room, and entered on receiving an"
acknowledgment of his knock. She was standing in the light of the window
"by the toilet table, doing her hair. The rest of the room was in the"
shadow of the gathering evening.
"“Well,” she said, without turning, “are they coming?”"
"""At the same time you are held indemnified for all killings of"
such persons as may stand in your way in the execution of the
"duty laid upon you, and by order of the King himself you hereby"
"take rank as a full Colonel in his service."""
Meanwhile Cabrera had been bending his brows over the note which had
been directed to him personally. He rose and paced the length of the
"garden-wall with the letter in his hand, while Rollo stood his ground"
with an unmoved countenance. Presently he stopped opposite the young man
and stood regarding him intently.
"""I am, I understand, to furnish you with men for this venture,"" he said;"
"""good--but I am at liberty to prove you first. That you are cool and"
"brave I know. We must find out whether you are loyal as well."""
"""I am as loyal as any Spaniard who ever drew breath,"" retorted Rollo,"
"hotly, ""and in this matter I will answer for my companions as well."""
"""And pray in what way, Sir Spitfire?"" said Cabrera, smiling."
"""Why, as a man should,"" said Rollo, ""with his sword or his pistol,"
or--as is our island custom--with his fists--it is all the same to me;
"yes, even with your abominable Spanish knife, which is no true"
"gentleman's weapon!"""
"""I am no unfriend to plainness, sir, either in speech or action,"" said"
"Cabrera; ""I see you are indeed a brave fellow, and will not lessen the"
king's chances of coming to his own by letting you loose on the men
under my command. Still for one day you will not object to ride with
"us!"""
Madame Gilbert the stranger stared openly at her cheek and ear and the
"coils of bright copper hair. Madame knew that he was watching her, and"
"rather liked the scrutiny. She had recognized him at once, and would"
have been slightly humiliated if he had failed to be interested in her.
"It is true that she had met him but once before in her life, and that"
"some four years since, but as Madame had condescended to recollect"
him--I have said that her memory for faces was royal--a failure on his
part to remember her would have been an offence unpardonable.
"Madame continued to munch sweet stuff, and the man, his tea completed,"
"rose, paid his bill, and then passed slowly in front of her. He needed"
"encouragement before he would speak. So Madame gave it, a quick look and"
a smile of invitation. He bowed.
"""Have I not the honour to meet again the Signora Guilberti?"" said he."
"""The Signora Guilberti,"" assented Madame, ""or Madame Guilbert, or Madame"
"Gilbert, as rendered by the rough English tongue. I have stooped to"
"anglicise my name,"" she went on, ""though I hate the clipped English"
"version."" She indicated a chair, and the lawyer--he was a lawyer--sat"
down.
"""Is it possible that Madame honours me with remembrance?"""
"""Let me place you,"" said she, happy in the display of her"
"accomplishments, ""and don't seek to guide my memory. It was in the"
"Spring of 1915, at a reception in the garden of Devonshire House. You"
were in attendance upon Her Majesty the Queen-Mother of Portugal. There
"were present representatives of the Italian Red Cross, for Italy, the"
"land of my late husband, had ranged herself with the Allies. You are a"
"lawyer of the _haute noblesse_. Your clients are peers and princes, of"
old princes in exile and of new peers in possession. I recall you most
"For my part, I would unhesitatingly give to boys and girls an element"
of strong romance in the stories which are told them even before they
are twelve. Miss Sewell says:
"“The system that keeps girls in the schoolroom reading simple stories,"
"without reading Scott and Shakespeare and Spenser, and then hands them"
"over to the unexplored recesses of the Circulating Library, has been"
shown to be the most frivolizing that can be devised.” She sets forward
"the result of her experience that a good novel, especially a romantic"
"one, read at twelve or fourteen, is really a beneficial thing."
At present many of the children from the elementary schools get their
first idea of love (if one can give it such a name) from vulgar
"pictures displayed in the shop windows, or jokes on marriage culled"
"from the lowest type of paper, or the proceedings of a divorce-court."
What an antidote to such representation might be found in the story of
"Hector and Andromache,"
"Siegfreid and Brunhild,"
"Dido and Æneas,"
"Orpheus and Eurydice,"
St. Francis and St. Clare.
One of the strongest elements we should introduce into our stories for
children of all ages is that which calls forth love of beauty. And the
"beauty should stand out, not necessarily only in delineation of noble"
"qualities in our heroes and heroines, but in beauty and strength of"
language and form.
In this latter respect the Bible stories are of such inestimable
"aseptics, for, ""after that he had heated his Ax red hot in the Fire,"
cauteriz'd the Wound but not with so much Art as he perform'd the other
Part for he so burnt the Flesh distant from the Place of Amputation that
"it had like to have mortify'd."" Taylor was tried and condemned to death at"
"Boston on May 12th, 1714, but for some reason not explained was reprieved."
"TEACH, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or THATCH, or THACH, _alias_ DRUMMOND, _alias_"
BLACKBEARD. Arch-pirate.
"A Bristol man who settled in Jamaica, sailing in privateers, but not in"
the capacity of an officer.
"In 1716, Teach took to piracy, being put in command of a sloop by the"
"pirate Benjamin Hornigold. In 1717, Hornigold and Teach sailed together"
"from Providence towards the American coast, taking a billop from Havana"
and several other prizes. After careening their vessels on the coast of
"Virginia, the pirates took a fine French Guineaman bound to Martinico;"
"this ship they armed with forty guns, named her the _Queen Ann's Revenge_,"
and Blackbeard went aboard as captain. Teach now had a ship that allowed
"him to go for larger prizes, and he began by taking a big ship called the"
"_Great Allen_, which he plundered and then set fire to. A few days later,"
"Teach was attacked by H.M.S. _Scarborough_, of thirty guns, but after a"
"sharp engagement lasting some hours, the pirate was able to drive off the"
King's ship.
The next ship he met with was the sloop of that amateur pirate and
"landsman, Major Stede Bonnet. Teach and Bonnet became friends and sailed"
"together for a few days, when Teach, finding that Bonnet was quite"
"ignorant of maritime matters, ordered the Major, in the most high-handed"
"way, to come aboard his ship, while he put another officer in command of"
"Bonnet's vessel. Teach now took ship after ship, one of which, with the"
"“Well,” Ned suggested, “we’d better wait here a little while, until"
"things get quieted down, and then make a break for the passage.”"
"“All right,” Jimmie said with an air of resignation, “I’ll crawl back"
here in the corner and try to imagine that I’m in charge of a pie wagon
on Third avenue. Perhaps I can dream a pie or two!”
The boy leaned back in an angle of the chamber and prepared to continue
the discussion regarding the different kinds of pies sold at the old
"Williams street corner. As he did so, the support of his back gave way,"
"his heels flew up in the air, and he tumbled all of a heap into a"
passage which seemed to begin at that corner of the room.
Hearing the fall and the exclamation of impatience which came from the
"boy’s lips, Ned turned on the electric and saw Jimmie lying on his back"
in a tunnel probably a yard in size each way. There were plenty of
indications that the tunnel had been cut through solid rock.
"As far as Ned could see; that is, as far as the eye of the electric"
carried; there were no breaks in it. Directly a chill breeze blew in
"from the opening, and the boy knew that the passage touched the surface"
of the mountain not far away.
"“Je-rusalem!” shouted Jimmie, “hold up the light and let me see if I’m"
all here. That’s the second tumble I’ve got in this consarned old hole
today.”
"“If every tumble you get in life brings such results as this,” Ned"
"declared, “you ought to go around the world looking for tumbles!”"
"“They hurt, just the same!” Jimmie declared, rubbing the back of his"
head. “I got an awful bump on my coco!”
"to them was barred. For a long, dull period the voyagers lay as"
"helpless as if in dry-dock, while wandering herds of seals barked at"
them or bands of walruses ceased their fishing and crept out upon the
ice-pans to observe these invaders of their peace. When an opportunity
"at last presented itself, they threaded their way southward, there to"
"try another approach, and another, and another, until the first of May"
"had come and gone, leaving them but little closer to their goal than"
when they first hove-to. Late one evening they discerned smoke on the
"horizon, and the next morning's light showed a three-masted steamship"
"fast in the ice, a few miles to the westward."
"""That's _The Juliet_,"" Big George informed his companions, ""one of the"
"North American Packers' Association tenders."""
"""She was loading when we left Seattle,"" Boyd remarked."
"""It is Willis Marsh's ship, so he must be aboard,"" supplemented Cherry."
"""She's a wooden ship, and built for this business. If we don't look out"
"he'll beat us in, after all."""
"""What good will that do him?"" Clyde questioned. ""The fish don't bite--I"
"mean run--for sixty days yet."""
Emerson and Balt merely shrugged.
To Cherry Malotte this had been a voyage of dreams; for once away from
"land, Boyd had become his real self again--that genial, irrepressible"
self she had seen but rarely--and his manner had lost the restraint and
coolness which recently had disturbed their relations. Of necessity
"their cramped environment had thrown them much together, and their"
companionship had been most pleasant. She and Boyd had spent long hours
"together, during which his light-heartedness had rivalled that of Alton"
"Before the curtains of history lifted, one feels the world was like"
this--this Celtic bareness and sombreness and _air_. But perhaps it is
not Celtic at all: Iberian. Nothing is more unsatisfactory than our
conception of what is Celtic and what is not Celtic. I believe there
"never were any Celts, as a race.--As for the Iberians--!"

"Wonderful to go out on a frozen road, to see the grass in shadow bluish"
"with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams"
"melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and"
"things standing up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with"
"roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in"
"the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad,"
"on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk"
"down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk"
"on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is"
"built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all"
"so familiar to my _feet_, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if"
"I had made a discovery. And I realize that I hate lime-stone, to live on"
lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are
"dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is"
much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under
"the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and"
"I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and"
withers.

After coming to a deep well in a grassy plot in a wide space of the
"road, I go back, across the sunny naked upland country, towards the pink"
station and its out-buildings. An engine is steaming its white clouds in
"Minna--she raved over the judicial murder of this Belgian heroine,"
"who was shot, as was Edith Cavell, for nothing more than assisting"
young Belgians to escape from German-occupied Belgium.
"She witnessed the air-raids of the Allies, when only comforting"
"papers were dropped on Brussels city, but bombs on the German"
aerodromes outside; and she also saw the Germans turn their guns
from the aeroplanes--which soared high out of their reach or skimmed
"below range--on to thickly-inhabited streets of the poorer quarters,"
to teach them to cheer the air-craft of the Allies!
"She beheld--or she was told of--many acts of rapine, considered"
cruelty and unreasoning ferocity on the part of German officials or
soldiers; yet saw or heard of acts and episodes of unlooked-for
"kindness, forbearance and sympathy from the same hated people. Von"
"Giesselin, after all, was a not uncommon type; and as to Minna von"
"Stachelberg, she was a saint of the New Religion, the Service of"
Man.
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BOMB IN PORTLAND PLACE
Mrs. Rossiter said to herself in 1915 that she had scarcely known a
"happy day, or even hour, since the War began. In the first place"
Michael had again shown violence of temper with ministers of state
"over the release from prison of ""that"" Miss Warren--""a convict doing"
"a sentence of hard labour."" And then, when he had got her released,"
"them."""
Here a knock at the door interrupted the conversation. The servant
"entered, bringing a note gorgeously crested and coroneted in gold."
"Villiers, to whom it was addressed, opened and read it."
"""What shall we do about this?"" he asked, when his man had retired. ""It"
is an invitation from the Duchess de la Santoisie. She asks us to go
"and dine with her next week,--a party of twenty--reception afterward. I"
"think we'd better accept,--what do you say?"""
"Alwyn roused himself from his reverie. ""Anything to please you, my dear"
"boy!"" he answered cheerfully--""But I haven't the faintest idea who the"
"Duchess de la Santoisie is!"""
"""No? ... Well, she's an Englishwoman who has married a French Duke. He"
"is a delightful old fellow, the pink of courtesy, and the model of"
"perfect egotism. A true Parisian, and of course an atheist,--a very"
"polished atheist, too, with a most charming reliance on his own"
infallibility. His wife writes novels which have a SLIGHT leaning
"toward Zolaism,--she is an extremely witty woman sarcastic, and"
"cold-blooded enough to be a female Robespierre, yet, on the whole,"
amusing as a study of what curious nondescript forms the feminine
"nature can adopt unto itself, if it chooses. She has an immense respect"
"for GENIUS,--mind, I say genius advisedly, because she really is one of"
those rare few who cannot endure mediocrity. Everything at her house is
"the best of its kind, and the people she entertains are the best of"
theirs. Her welcome of you will be at any rate a sincerely admiring
"one,--and as I think, in spite of your desire for quiet, you will have"
"to show yourself somewhere, it may as well be there."""
"Alwyn looked dubious, and not at all resigned to the prospect of"
"obvious reluctance, glancing out of his little oblique eyes at the young"
colonel.
Rollo considered a while before answering.
"""It is my opinion that the fewer men concerned in such a venture the"
"greater the chances of success,"" he said at last; ""furnish me with one"
petty officer intimately acquainted with the country between Zaragoza
"and San Ildefonso, and I will ask no more."""
Cabrera drew a long breath and looked at the young man with infinitely
more approval than he had before manifested.
"""You are right,"" he said, ""three times right! If you fail, there are"
fewer to go to the gallows. In prison fewer ill-sewn wine-skins to leak
"information. If you succeed, there are also fewer to divide the credit"
"and the reward. For my own part, I do not think you will succeed, but I"
will provide you with the best man in my command for your purpose and in
"addition heartily wish you well out of your adventure!"""
Cabrera was indeed immensely relieved to find the desires of our hero so
moderate. He had been directed to supply him with whatever force he
"required, and he expected to be deprived of a regiment at least, at a"
most critical time in the affairs of the Absolute King.
"""Young man,"" he said, ""you will certainly be shot or hanged before you"
are a month older. Nevertheless in the mean time I would desire to have
"the honour of shaking you by the hand. If you were not to die so soon,"
undoubtedly you would go far! It is a pity. And the Cristinos are bad
shots. They will not do the job half as creditably as my fellows would
"have done it for you this morning!"""
TETANIC.--A medicine or agent which increases the irritation of the
"spinal cord or muscles producing spasms, as strychnine, etc."
"TONIC.--A medicine promoting nutrition and giving strength to the body,"
"as arsenic, cod liver oil, etc."
"TOPIC or TOPICAL.--A substance or agent for external use, applied"
"locally, as a liniment."
"TOXIC.--A condition produced by a poison, as a result of an over-dose of"
medicine or the absorption of bacterial products.
"TRICOPHYED.--A medicine promoting the growth of hair, as pilocarpine,"

"If the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen, the"
regulars were her adorers. There was much rivalry among many of the
steady customers. Aileen could have had an engagement every evening. At
least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance. One
stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had privately christened “The Hog”
"presented her with a turquoise ring. Another one known as “Freshy,” who"
"rode on the Traction Company’s repair wagon, was going to give her a"
poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the Ninth.
And the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a
stock broker asked her to go to “Parsifal” with him.
"“I don’t know where this place is,” said Aileen while talking it over"
"with Tildy, “but the wedding-ring’s got to be on before I put a stitch"
"into a travelling dress—ain’t that right? Well, I guess!”"
"But, Tildy!"
"In steaming, chattering, cabbage-scented Bogle’s there was almost a"
"heart tragedy. Tildy with the blunt nose, the hay-coloured hair, the"
"freckled skin, the bag-o’-meal figure, had never had an admirer. Not a"
man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the
restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast-hunger for
food. None of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of
"wit. None of them loudly “jollied” her of mornings as they did Aileen,"
"accusing her, when the eggs were slow in coming, of late hours in the"
company of envied swains. No one had ever given her a turquoise ring or
"invited her upon a voyage to mysterious, distant “Parsifal.”"
"Tildy was a good waitress, and the men tolerated her. They who sat at"
her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare;
and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise-flavoured
"aware--the garlic--the onions--we of this country love them?"""
"""But so do I,"" cried Rollo, ""and I will not have distinctions made on"
this expedition. We are all to risk our lives equally and we shall all
"fare equally, and if we are caught our dose of lead or halter-hemp will"
"be just the same."""
Here El Sarria interrupted.
"""With respect,"" he said, ""it is true that this gentleman hath some"
private matters to communicate to me which have nothing to do with the
object of our mission. I crave your permission that for to-day I may
"dine apart with him!"""
After this there was no more to be said. El Sarria helped the sergeant
"to serve the meal, which was at once the proof of his foraging ability"
"and his consummate genius as a cook. For though the day was Friday, the"
soup was very far from _maigre_. The stew contained both lamb and fresh
pork cut into generous cubes with a sufficiency of savoury fat included.
A sausage had been sliced small for seasoning and the whole had been so
"smothered in _garbanzos_, haricot beans, rice, mixed with strips of"
"toothsome salt fish, that John Mortimer bent and said a well-deserved"
blessing over the viands.
"""I don't usually in this country,"" he explained, ""but really this is"
what my good old father would call a manifest providence. That fellow of
"ours will prove a treasure."""
"""It seems so,"" said Rollo, a little grimly, ""that is, if he can scout"
"and fight as well as he can cater and cook."""
"For himself the young Scot cared little what he ate, and would have"
"The mail arranged, Trude sat back in the cushions of a great wicker"
chair and with a long breath of delight enjoyed the beauty around her.
Each day Edgeacres enraptured her anew and roused in her a wonder as to
"why it should be her lot to be there. ""It ought to be Vick or Issy,"""
"she would apologize to the nodding flowers or to Mitie, the yellow"
warbler.
And as might be expected Trude had found innumerable ways of making
herself useful to Mrs. White as an expression of her gratitude. There
"were telephone calls she could answer, letters she could write,"
"shopping she could do, ordering, she even conferred with old Pepper and"
"Jonathan, the gardener. She drove with Mrs. White in the afternoon and"
served tea to the callers who flocked to the house from the nearby
summer hotels.
"""I do not know how I ever got along without you, my dear,"" Mrs. White"
"had said more than once. ""What do you do to make yourself so"
invaluable? It seems as though just to look at you one leans on you!
Even Pepper is saying 'Miss Trude thinks this and Miss Trude thinks
"that--'"""
"Her benevolent interest in her husband's wards, a certain pride in"
"saying to her friends: ""My husband, you know, is looking after the"
"daughters of Joseph Romley, who was a college friend of his,"" had grown"
"into a real fondness for Trude. ""I have never appreciated the dear girl"
"when she's been with us before,"" she declared to her husband. ""I"
"suppose it was because we were in town, then, and I was too busy to get"
"acquainted with her. Why, she's really pretty. And she makes such a"
slave of herself to her sisters! She hasn't any life of her own. I
"don't believe they appreciate it, either. It's a shame she doesn't"
"marry some nice young man--"" Mrs. White's kind always found virtue's"
"“Ah, yes, to be sure. Poor little Unity! You must bring her to see me"
"sometimes. Give me notice, and I 'll make her some of my cream-puffs."
Children are always so fond of them. _You_ ought to remember my
cream-puffs.”
"“Good heavens!” he cried, with a gesture that set the dog barking."
“There 's no question of cream-puffs. Can't you see what I'm driving at?
I want you to come and keep house for me and help me to look after the
child.”
"He rose, and his great form towered so threateningly over her that Dandy"
barked at him with a toy terrier's furious and impotent rage.
“I come and live with you?” gasped Miss Lindon.
[Illustration: 0094]
"“Yes,” said John, turning away and lumbering back to the fireplace. The"
"dog, perceiving that he had struck terror into the heart of his enemy,"
"dismissed him with a scornful snarl, and curled himself up by the side"
of his stupefied mistress.
"It was done; the proposal had been made, according to the demands of his"
"pig-headedness. Now that he had made it, he realized its insanity. He"
contrasted this home of flim-flammeries and its lap-dogs and canaries
and old-maidish futilities with his own tobacco-saturated and
paper-littered den; this life of trivialities with his own fighting
career; this incapacity to grasp essentials with his own realization of
the conflict of world-forces. The ludicrous incongruity of a partnership
between the two of them in so fateful a business as the healing of a
human soul appealed to his somewhat dull sense of humour. The whole idea
was preposterous. In his saturnine way he laughed.
"is how to keep sober. And I want it to be understood from the start--"""
"""Not so much of it now!"" snarled Captain Dove from his cabin. ""You"
attend to your own business--and I'll attend to mine. I know how to
"behave myself--among gentlemen. And, don't you forget, either, that I'm"
"going ashore to play my own hand. I've a card or two up my sleeve,"
"Mister Slyne, that will maybe euchre your game for you--if you try to"
"bluff too high."""
"Slyne swore hotly, under his breath. He would have given a great deal to"
"know exactly what the old man meant by that mysterious threat, and only"
knew that it would be useless to ask him. There was nothing for it but
"to put up with his capricious humours, as patiently as might"
be--although Slyne shivered in anticipation of the strain that might
entail--till he could be dispensed with or got rid of altogether.
"Nor, as it presently appeared, were his fears at all ill-founded. For"
Captain Dove emerged from his cabin got up for shore-going in a guise at
sight of which Slyne could by no means suppress an involuntary groan.
"""I'm all ready now,"" Captain Dove announced. ""Will you pay for a cab if"
"I call one?"""
"""My car's waiting,"" Slyne returned, and, as the old man whistled"
amazedly over that further and unexpected proof that his former
"accomplice's fortunes had changed for the better, ""You look like a fool"
"in that outfit,"" said Slyne. ""The right rig-out for motoring is a tweed"
"suit and a soft cap."""
Captain Dove was very visibly annoyed. He had been at particular pains
"to array himself properly. ""You want to be the only swell in the party,"
"of course!"" he grunted. ""You're jealous, that's what's the matter with"
before the men left behind saw him again.

TRAPPING AN ABORIGINE
In houses and clothing the Darien Indians are decidedly primitive]
[Illustration: NATIVE VILLAGE ON PANAMA BAY]
Death came fast to those in the jungle. The agonies they suffered from
"starvation, exposure and insect pests baffle description. “Truxton in"
"casting his eyes on the ground saw a toad”, wrote the historian."
"“Instantly snatching it up, he bit off the head and, spitting it away,"
"devoured the body. Maury looked at him a moment, and then picked up the"
"rejected head, saying, ‘Well, Truxton, you are getting quite particular."
"Something of an epicure, eh’? With these words he quietly devoured the"
head himself.”
Nine of the twenty-seven men who entered the Darien with Strain died.
"When the leader returned with the relief party they were found, like"
"Greely at Camp Starvation, unable to move and slowly dying. Those who"
retained life never fully regained strength. Every condition which
brought such frightful disaster upon the Strain party exists in the
"Darien today. The Indians are as hostile, the trails as faintly"
"outlined, the jungle as dense, the insects as savage. Only along the"
"banks of the rivers has civilization made some little headway, but the"
richest gold field twenty miles back in the interior is as safe from
civilized workings as though it were walled in with steel and guarded by
dragons. Every speculative man you meet in Panama will assure you that
the gold is there but all agree that conditions must be radically
changed before it can be gotten out unless a regiment and a subsistence
Against the class-interest behind the East India Company the republican
"party, as led and represented by De Witt, were strongly arrayed. They"
could point to the expansion of the Greenland whaling trade that had
followed on the abolition of the original monopoly in that adventure--an
increase of from ten to fifteen times the old quantity of
product[818]--and the treatise expounding their policy strongly
condemned the remaining monopolies of all kinds. But there was no
sufficient body of enlightened public opinion to support the attack; and
the menaced interests spontaneously turned to the factor which could
best maintain them against such pressure--the military power of the
"House of Orange. The capitalist monopolists and ""imperialists"" of the"
republic were thus the means first of artificially limiting its economic
"basis, and later of subverting its republican constitution--a disservice"
"which somewhat outweighs the credit earned by them, as by the merchant"
"oligarchies of Venice, for an admirable management of their army.[819]"
"""And you have no further thought of her?"" she asked."
"""As far as marriage is concerned, no,"" I responded.  ""Nevertheless, I"
still regard her as an intimate friend.  I was here only two or three
"hours ago chatting with her."""
"""You!"" she cried, glaring at me strangely.  ""You were here--to-day?"""
"""Yes,"" I replied.  ""I thought she would certainly tell you of my visit."""
"""She told me nothing.  I was quite unaware of it.  I was out, and the"
"servants told me that a gentlemen had called in my absence."""
"""I gave a card,"" I replied.  ""It is no doubt in the hall."""
patriotic politician.
"""I know to whom you refer,"" I said, with bowed head, after a moment's"
"pause.  ""It is currently reported that I love her.  I have loved her.  I"
do not seek to deny it.  When a man sustains such a blow as I sustained
"before we parted, he often rushes to another woman for consolation.  The"
influence of that second woman often prevents him from going to the bad
"altogether.  It has been so in my case."""
"""And you love her now?"" she cried, the fire of fierce jealousy in her"
"eyes.  ""You cannot deny it!"""
"""I do deny it,"" I cried.  ""True, until yesterday I held her in esteem,"
"even in affection; but it is not so now.  All my love for you, Yolande,"
has returned to me.  Our parting has rendered you dearer and sweeter to
"me than ever."""
"""I cannot believe it,"" she exclaimed falteringly."
"""I swear that it is so.  In all my life, although am compelled to treat"
"women with courtesy and sometimes to affect flirtation, because of my"
"profession as a diplomatist, I have loved only one woman--yourself;"" and"
"I raised her chilly hand to my lips, kissing it fervently."
Mine was no mere caprice at that moment.  With an all-consuming passion
"I loved her, and was prepared on her account to make any sacrifice she"
"demanded.  Let the reader remember what had already been told me, and"
"reflect that, like many another man, I loved madly, and was heedless of"
any consequences that might follow.  In this particular I was not alone.
"Thousands before me had been allured to their ruin by a woman's eyes,"
just as thousands of brave women's hearts have been broken and their
lives wrecked by men's false oaths of fidelity.  I have heard wiseacres
"Eilert's house, they looked at their watches and swore because so many"
minutes were being wasted. Where the devil was the car? The populace
"followed at some distance, gazing with reverence on these dressed-up"
fools.
I remember a couple of them: an old man--the one with the loud voice--who
wore a pleated kilt on each thigh and a jacket of green canvas with braid
"and buckles and straps and innumerable pockets all over it. What a man,"
"what a power! His beard, streaming out from under his nose like the"
"northern lights, was greenish-white, and he swore like a madman. Another"
"of the party was tall and bent, a flagpole of sorts, astonishing,"
"stupendous, with sloping shoulders, a tiny cap perched above extravagantly"
"arched eyebrows; he was an upended Roman battering ram, a man on stilts. I"
"measured him with my eyes, and still there was something left over. Yet he"
"was bent and broken, old before his time, quite bald; but his mouth was"
"tight as a tiger's, and he had a madness in his head that kept him on the"
move.
"""Stordalen!"" he cried."
England will soon have to open old people's homes for her sons. She
desexes her people with sport and obsessive ideas: were not other
"countries keeping her in perpetual unrest, she would in a couple of"
generations be converted to pederasty....
"Then the horn of the car was heard tooting in the woods, and everyone"
raced to meet it.
Of course Olaus's two boys had done an honest day's work in meeting the
"car so far up the road, and urging the driver to hurry; were they not to"
"get any reward? True, they were allowed to sit in the back seat for their"
return journey and thus enjoyed the drive of a lifetime; but money! They
"kept explaining all the way home how the accident had happened, what he"
"had said and what the lawyer had said, pointing to objects on the way as"
though this stone represented the lawyer and that the abyss into which he
had plunged.... Solem still carried the rope he had not had a chance to
"use. Miss Torsen asked no more than anyone else, and made purely"
"conventional comments: ""I advised him against it, I begged him not to"
"go...."""
"But however much we talked, we could not bring the lawyer back to life."
"Strange--his watch was still going, but he himself was dead. The doctor"
"could do nothing here, and returned to his village."
There followed a depressing evening. Solem went to the village to send a
"telegram to the lawyer's family, and the rest of us did what we thought"
decent under the circumstances: we all sat in the living room with books
"in our hands. Now and again, some reference would be made to the accident:"
"it was a reminder, we said, how small we mortals were! And the Associate"
"Master, who had not the soul of a tourist, greatly feared that this"
disaster would injure the resort and make things still more difficult for
Paul; people would shun a place where they were likely to fall off and be
killed.
"No, the Associate Master was no tourist, and did not understand the"
Anglo-Saxon mind.
Paul himself seemed to sense that the accident might benefit him rather
than do him harm. He brought out a bottle of brandy to console us on this
mournful evening.
"And since it was a death to which we owed this attention, one of the men"
from Bergen made a speech.
is the one common to all tropical countries on which Benjamin Kidd laid
an unerring finger when he referred to the unwisdom of longer permitting
the riches of the tropics to “remain undeveloped with resources running
to waste under the management of races of low social efficiency”. The
Panamanian authorities are making apparently sincere endeavors to
attract new settlers of greater efficiency. In proportion to the success
that attends the efforts the future of Panama will be bright.

CHAPTER XVI
THE INDIANS OF PANAMA
While that portion of the Panama territory that lies along the border of
Colombia known as the Darien is rather ill-defined as to area and to
"boundaries, it is known to be rich in timber and is believed to possess"
gold mines of great richness. But it is practically impenetrable by the
white man. Through this country Balboa led his force on his expedition
"to the unknown Pacific, and was followed by the bloodthirsty Pedrarias"
who bred up in the Indians a hatred of the white man that has grown as
the ages passed. No expedition can enter this region even today except
"""Yes; Miss Disey's in.  D'you want to see 'er?  What nyme?"""
"Gyp produced her card.  The maid looked at it, at Gyp, and at two"
"brown-painted doors, as much as to say, ""Where will you have it?"" Then,"
"opening the first of them, she said:"
"""Tyke a seat, please; I'll fetch her."""
"Gyp went in.  In the middle of what was clearly the dining-room, she"
tried to subdue the tremor of her limbs and a sense of nausea. The table
"against which her hand rested was covered with red baize, no doubt to"
keep the stains of mutton from penetrating to the wood. On the mahogany
sideboard reposed a cruet-stand and a green dish of very red apples.  A
bamboo-framed talc screen painted with white and yellow marguerites stood
before a fireplace filled with pampas-grass dyed red.  The chairs were of
"red morocco, the curtains a brownish-red, the walls green, and on them"
hung a set of Landseer prints.  The peculiar sensation which red and
green in juxtaposition produce on the sensitive was added to Gyp's
"distress. And, suddenly, her eyes lighted on a little deep-blue china"
"bowl. It stood on a black stand on the mantel-piece, with nothing in it."
"To Gyp, in this room of red and green, with the smell of mutton creeping"
"in, that bowl was like the crystallized whiff of another world.  Daphne"
"Wing--not Daisy Wagge--had surely put it there! And, somehow, it touched"
"her--emblem of stifled beauty, emblem of all that the girl had tried to"
pour out to her that August afternoon in her garden nearly a year ago.
"Thin Eastern china, good and really beautiful!  A wonder they allowed it"
to pollute this room!
"A sigh made her turn round.  With her back against the door and a white,"
"scared face, the girl was standing.  Gyp thought: 'She has suffered"
"horribly.'  And, going impulsively up to her, she held out her hand."
"thorns? If we could gather the flowers and find no thorns, we should not"
"care for them. The more the thorns, the more valuable the blossoms.'"
"So they said, and they gathered the blossoms, and they faded. But the"
thorns did not fade; they were ever there. The more blossoms a man had
"gathered, the more thorns he had to wear, and Time was ever behind him."
"They wanted to rest in the glades, but Time willed that ever they must"
"go forward; no going back, no rest, ever and ever on. So they grew very"
weary.
"'These flowers,' they said at last, 'are always the same. We are tired"
of them; their smell is heavy; they are dead. This forest is full of
thorns only. How shall we escape from it? Ever as we go round and round
"we hate the flowers more, we feel the thorns more acutely. We must"
"escape! We are sick of Time and his whip, our feet are very, very weary,"
"our eyes are dazzled and dim. We, too, would seek the Peace. We laughed"
at those before who went along the rocky path; we did not want peace;
but now it seems to us the most beautiful thing in the world. Will Time
never cease to drive us on and on? Will these lights _never_ cease to
flash to and fro?'
Each man at last will turn to the straight road. He will find out. Every
"man will find out at last that the forest is hateful, that the flowers"

"And the faces that pass, with lingering glance out of the dusk, the"
pale sweet faces of thy beautiful women and the handsome figures of a
"vigorous race, how much larger vastnesses are in the communion of these"
eyes than in wide empty spaces of unthinking continents!
The mystic dusk turns thy many habitations to a thousand shadowy
"palaces, thy very vulgarities to dulcet musicalities. What comedies are"
in the making in thy wide hospitable lap to-night! what tragedies! what
heroic strivings! what bemeaning indecencies! what crimes!
Thy very mud holds something of dark mysterious lustre--being that
which is trod out of thy pageant and thy history.

"The sound of footsteps ceased to rouse the echoes in the empty street,"
as Noll came to a halt before Netherby Gomme’s doorway. He hesitated
for a moment; ran up the steps; and rang the bell.
"The smoky twilight that held the place was passing into sooty darkness,"
turning the staid street of lodging-houses into a way of fairy
"habitations, the lemon flames of gas-lamps showing a sweeping curve"
of light down its long length to the far rumble of the city’s distant
traffic.
A key coughed in its wards as it shot back the bolts of the lock; and
"They were bound hand and foot. At a piping cry from the leader,"
several of the gangling figures picked them up in reedy arms and began
"to walk across the square, away from the ship. Brand noticed that his"
bearers' arms trembled with his weight: and sensed the flabbiness of
the substance that took the place in them of good solid muscle.
Physically these things were soft and ineffectual indeed. They had
only the ominous tubes with which to fight.
"The eery procession, with the bound Earthmen carried in the lead,"
wound toward a great building fringing the square. In through the high
"arched entrance of this building they went, and up a sloping incline"
"to its tower-top. Here, in a huge bare room, the two were"
unceremoniously dumped to the floor.
"While three of the things stood guard with the mysterious tubes,"
"another unbound them. A whole shower of high pitched, piping syllables"
"was hurled at them, speech which sounded threatening and contemptuous"
"but was otherwise, of course, entirely unintelligible, and then the"
"creatures withdrew. The heavy metal door was slammed shut, and they"
were alone.
"Brand drew a long breath, and began to feel himself all over for"
broken bones. He found none; he was still nerve-wracked from that last
"terrific shock, but otherwise whole and well."
"""Are you hurt, Dex?"" he asked solicitously."
"""I guess not,"" replied Dex, getting uncertainly to his feet. ""And I'm"
wondering why. It seems to me the brutes were uncommonly considerate
"of us--and I'm betting the reason is one we won't like!"""
"Brand shrugged. ""I guess we'll find out their intentions soon enough."
"valuables, slung them somehow on her left arm, while with her other"
she piloted the nearly swooning Mrs. Warren into the court.
They were at once stopped by a non-commissioned officer who asked
"them in abrupt, scarcely understandable German what they wanted."
Vivie guessing his meaning said in English--she scarcely knew any
"German: ""This is our house. We have been absent in Brussels. We want"
"to see the officer in command."" The soldier knew no English, but"
likewise guessed at their meaning. He ordered them to wait where
they were. Presently he came out of the Villa and said the Herr
Oberst would see them. Vivie led her mother into the gay little
hall--how pleasant and cool it had looked in the early morning! It
was now full of surly-looking soldiers. Without hesitating she took
"a chair from one soldier and placed her mother in it. ""You rest"
"there a moment, dearest, while I go in and see the officer in"
"command."" The corporal she had first spoken with beckoned her into"
the pretty sitting-room at the back where they had had their early
breakfast that morning.
Here she saw seated at a table consulting plans of Brussels and
"other papers a tall, handsome man of early middle age, who might"
"indeed have passed for a young man, had he not looked very tired and"
"care-worn and exhibited a bald patch at the back of his head,"
rendered the more apparent because the brown-gold curls round it
"were dank with perspiration. He rose to his feet, clicked his heels"
"together and saluted. ""An English young lady, I am told, rather ..."
"a ... surprise ... on ... the ... outskirts ... of Brussels..."" (His"

CHAPTER ELEVEN.
DEANE SPEAKS HIS MIND.
An hour later I was seated in my room at the Embassy staring blankly at
"the blotting-pad before me, utterly perplexed and bewildered.  I loved"
"Yolande--nay, she was my idol; nevertheless she had firmly refused to"
allow me to resume my place at her side.  At one moment it seemed to me
as though she had actually made a sacrifice for my sake; yet at another
I could not help regarding both her and her mother with distinct
suspicion.  My love's strange words were in themselves a sufficient
self-condemnation.  Her service as a political agent had been secured by
"one or other of the Powers--France, I suspected; and, to put it plainly,"
she was a spy!
This knowledge had come upon me like a thunderbolt.  Of all the women I
had known and least suspected of endeavouring to learn the secrets of
"our diplomacy, Yolande was certainly the chief.  The events which had"
culminated in her accepting this odious office were veiled in mystery.
Why had she done this?  Who had tempted her or forced her to it?
"Those tears of hers, when she had made confession, were the tears of a"
"woman in the depths of despair and degradation, and I, loving her so"
"fondly, could not but allow my heart to go forth in sympathy.  There was"
an affinity between us that I knew might some day prove fatal.
"that as a compliment.  But at my age--well, it is really cruel of you."""
"""Intelligence is more interesting to a diplomat than a pretty face,"" I"
"responded quickly.  ""And there is certainly no more intelligent woman in"
"all Paris than the Baronne de Chalencon."""
"She bowed stiffly, and her wrinkled face, which bore visible traces of"
"poudre orchidee and touches of the hare's-foot, puckered up into a"
simpering smile.
"""Well, and what else?"" she asked.  ""These speeches you have apparently"
"prepared for some pretty woman you expected to meet here to-night, but,"
"since she has not kept the appointment, you are practising them upon"
"me."""
"""No,"" I said, ""I really protest against that, Baronne.  A woman is never"
"too old for a man to pay her compliments."""
"We had strolled into a cool ante-room, and were sitting together upon"
"one of the many seats placed beneath clumps of palms and flowers, the"
only light being from a hundred tiny electric lamps hung overhead in the
trees.  The perfect arrangement of those ante-rooms of the Salle des
"Fetes on the nights of the official receptions is always noteworthy, and"
"after the heat, music, and babel of tongues in the grand salon it was"
"cool, quiet, and refreshing there."
"By holding her regular salon, where everybody who was anybody made it a"
"point to be seen, the Baronne had acquired in Paris a unique position."
Her fine house in the Avenue des Champs Elysees was the centre of a
"smart and fashionable set, and she herself made a point of being versed"
in all the latest gossip and scandal of the French capital.  She
"scandalised nobody, nor did she seek to throw mud at her enemies.  She"

"Monsieur Paul Deschanel, the lion of the hour; Monsieur"
"Benjamin-Constant, always a prominent figure; Prince Roland Bonaparte,"
"smiling and bowing; the Duchess d'Auerstadt, with her magnificent"
"jewels; and Damat, the dapper Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour."
"All diplomatic Paris was there, chattering, laughing, whispering, and"
"plotting.  Around me sounded a veritable babel of tongues, but no part"
of the function interested me.
"From time to time I saluted a man I knew, or bent over a woman's hand;"
but my thoughts were of the one woman who had so suddenly and so
forcibly returned into my life.  The representatives of the Powers of
"Europe were all present, and as they passed me by, each in his bright"
"uniform, his orders flashing on his breast and a woman on his arm, I"
asked myself which of them was actually the employer of my well-beloved.
The startling events of the day had upset me.  Had it been possible I
would have left and returned to my rooms for a quiet smoke and for calm
"reflection.  But my duty required my presence there; hence I remained,"
strolling slowly around the great crowded salon with its myriad lights
"and profuse floral decorations, until I suddenly encountered the"
"wizen-faced, toothless old Baronne de Chalencon, whose salon was one of"
"the most popular in Paris, and with whom I was on excellent terms."
"""Ah! my dear M'sieur Ingram!"" she cried, holding forth her thin, bony"
"hand laden with jewels.  ""You look tired.  Why?  No one here to-night"
"who interests you--eh?"""
"""No one save yourself, Baronne,"" I responded, bending over her hand."
"""Flatterer!"" she laughed.  ""If I were forty years younger I might accept"
"""And lots and lots of love, father,"" interrupted Betty."

"Well, our journey was soon arranged on a grand scale. Pickering lent us"
"his new coach, just home from the makers in Cow Street. It was cushioned"
and curtained and had springs in place of thorough-braces. It also had
glass in the windows and doors; a luxury then little known in England
even among the nobles. There was a prejudice against its use in coach
windows because of the fact that two or three old ladies had cut their
faces in trying to thrust their heads through it.
"The new coach was a wonderful vehicle, and Frances and I, as well as"
"Betty, were very proud of our grandeur. Pickering sent along with the"
"coach and horses two lusty fellows as drivers, and gave us a hamper"
almost large enough to feed a company of soldiers. I was to pay all
expenses on the road.
"Almost at the last hour Sir Richard concluded not to go, but insisted"
"that Frances, Bettina, and I take the journey by ourselves. As Pickering"
"offered no objection, Frances shrugged her shoulders in assent, I"
"shrugged mine, and Betty laughed, whereby we all, in our own way, agreed"
"to the new arrangement, and preparations went forward rapidly."
"By the time we were ready to start, the king, the duke, the duchess, and"
"many ladies and gentlemen of the court circle had gone to Bath, thus"
giving us an opportunity to make our journey without the knowledge of any
one in Whitehall; a consideration of vast importance to us under the
circumstances. Some of our grand friends at court might have laughed at
"our taking the journey with an innkeeper's daughter, in an innkeeper's"
"coach, but Frances and I laughed because we were happy."
"Commanded a Dutch vessel, the _Edward and Thomas_, that sailed from Boston"
"in 1674, and took several small English vessels along the coast of Maine."
"Tried for piracy at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and condemned to be hanged,"
but was afterwards pardoned.
"ROGERS, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"Commanded a ship, the _Forlorn_. Routed the Spaniards at Venta Cruz in"
1671. One of Morgan's captains in his attack on Panama.
"ROGERS, CAPTAIN WOODES."
"As the life of this famous navigator and privateer is, very justly,"
"treated fully in the ""Dictionary of National Biography"" it is unnecessary"
to mention more than a few incidents in his adventurous career. Woodes
"Rogers was not only a good navigator, for on many occasions he showed a"
remarkable gift for commanding mutinous crews in spite of having many
"officers on whom he could place little reliance. On leaving Cork in 1708,"
after an incompetent pilot had almost run his ship on two rocks off
"Kinsale called ""The Sovereigne's Bollacks,"" Rogers describes his crew"
"thus: ""A third were foreigners, while of Her Majestie's subjects many were"
"taylors, tinkers, pedlars, fiddlers, and hay-makers, with ten boys and one"
"negro."" It was with crews such as these that many of the boldest and most"
"remarkable early voyages were made, and they required a man of Woodes"
Rogers stamp to knock them into sailors. Rogers had a gift for inspiring
"friendship wherever he went. On arriving at the coast of Brazil, his boat"
was fired on when trying to land at Angre de Reys. This settlement had but
lately received several hostile visitors in the way of French pirates. But
before a week was passed Woodes Rogers had so won the hearts of the
"Portuguese Governor and the settlers that he and his ""musick"" were invited"
much in all my life and I implored him not to report me. I don't
"remember what happened next, I was in such a state. But he did report"
me. I got a court martial and was sentenced to death for sleeping at my
post. They put me into the guard-room and I expected to be shot the next
"day. It was a rotten feeling, I can tell you. I didn't think about"
myself so much as about the wife and the little boy. I wouldn't go
through a night like that again for anything. But I went to sleep all
the same. I woke up the next morning when someone came into the
"guard-room. I didn't know where I was for a second or two, and then in a"
flash I realized I'd got to die. I don't mind admitting that I rested my
face against the wall and blubbered like a kid. Anyone would have done
"the same, I don't care what you say. But the man who'd just come in"
said:
"""'Pull yourself together, old chap--you're all right for to-day,"
anyhow.' I sat bolt upright and stared at him.
"""'They're not going to shoot me?'"
"""'Not to-day,' he answered. 'Cheer up, all sorts of things might happen"
before to-morrow.'
"""The joy I felt was so big that I can't tell you how big it was. But I"
soon felt miserable again. I couldn't understand what had happened. I
didn't know whether I was going to die or live. The uncertainty became
so terrible that I wished I'd been shot that morning--all would have
"been over then. They brought me a meal, but I couldn't eat. I asked"
"them what was going to happen, but they didn't know. Another night came,"
"but I didn't get any sleep at all. I lay tossing about on my bed, now"
"hoping, now despairing. I thought of home mostly, but once or twice I"
thought of the kids in the school where I taught--to die like this after
"the send-off they gave me! Still, they wouldn't know, they'd think I was"
"Pteropods, a suborder of the gastropods, appeared in this age."
Their papery shells of carbonate of lime are found in great
numbers from this time on.
"Cephalopods, the most highly organized of the mollusks, started"
"into existence, so far as the record shows, toward, the end of the"
"Cambrian, with the long extinct ORTHOCERAS (STRAIGHTHORN) and the"
"allied genera of its family. The Orthoceras had a long, straight,"
"and tapering shell, divided by cross partitions into chambers. The"
"animal lived in the ""body chamber"" at the larger end, and walled"
off the other chambers from it in succession during the growth of
"the shell. A central tube, the SIPHUNCLE, passed through from the"
body chamber to the closed tip of the cone.
"The seashells, both brachiopods and mollusks, are in some respects"
the most important to the geologist of all fossils. They have been
"so numerous, so widely distributed, and so well preserved because"
"of their durable shells and their station in growing sediments,"
that better than any other group of organisms they can be used to
correlate the strata of different regions and to mark by their
slow changes the advance of geological time.
CLIMATE. The life of Cambrian times in different countries
"contains no suggestion of any marked climatic zones, and as in"
later periods a warm climate probably reached to the polar
regions.
CHAPTER XVII
"the river played the whirlwind, with dust and clangor and the shriek"
of steel. Spears went down like trampled corn. The battle streamed
"down the bloody slope, for nothing could stand that furious charge."
"The river shut in the broken host, for the ford was narrow, not easy"
"of passage. From the north came the thundering ranks of horse, and on"
"the south the waters were calm and clear. The Provencals, streaming"
"like smoke blown from a fire by a boisterous wind, were hurled in rout"
"upon the water. They were hurled over the banks, slain in the"
"shallows, drowned in struggling to cross at the ford. Some few hundred"
"reached the southern bank, and scattered fast for the sanctuary of the"
woods.
In less than half an hour from the first charge the duke's men had won
the day. They gave no quarter; slew all who stood.
"The duke rode back up the hill, Francesco by his side, amid the cheers"
of his men.
"Southwest they rode towards the sea, their hundred lances aslant under"
the autumnal sky. They were as men challenging a kingdom with their
"swords, and they tossed their shields in the face of fate. The"
audacity of the venture set the hot blood spinning in their hearts.
To free Conradino from Anjou's clutches; to hurl damnation in the
mouth of the Provencals.
"As for Francesco, he was as a hound in leash. His sword thirsted in"
"its scabbard; he had tasted blood, and was hot for the conflict."
"On the fourth day they came upon the ruins of Ninfa, a town set upon a"
hill in a wooded valley. Vultures flapped heavenward as they rode into
"the gate; lean, red-eyed curs snarled and slinked about the streets."
"covered with fairy-like toilet-articles, its blue delft bowls full of"
"flowers, its atmosphere so dearly English, yet English of the days when"
Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the mere. In no other spot on the
"globe could be found such a sea-chamber, with its high bed, on which lay"
"the sweet, elfin face, half child's, half woman's, framed in the soft,"
brown hair.
"Risca smoked on, and Stellamaris, seeing him disinclined to talk, gazed"
"happily out to her beloved Channel, and dreamed her dreams. They had"
"often sat like this for an hour together, both feeling that they were"
talking to each other all the time; and often Stella would break the
"silence by telling him to listen. At such times, so people said,"
"an angel was passing. And he would listen, but could not hear. He"
"remembered Walter Herold once agreeing with her, and saying:"
“There's a special little angel told off to come here every day and
beat his wings about the room so as to clear the air of all troubling
things.”
"In no other spot on the globe could be found such a sea-chamber,"
"wing-swept, spirit-haunted, where pain ceased magically and the burden"
of intolerable suffering grew light. No other haven along all the coasts
of the earth was a haven of rest such as this.
And the Furies were driving him from it! But here the Furies ceased from
driving. Here he had delicious ease. Here a pair of ridiculously frail
hands held him a lotus-fed prisoner. He smoked on. At last he resisted
"the spell. The whole thing was nonsensical. His pipe, only lightly"
"packed by the frail hands, went out. He stuffed it in his pocket, and"
cleared his throat. He would say then and there what he had come to say.
"Stellamaris turned her head and laughed; and when Stellamaris laughed,"
I expect he will come back to us occasionally to see what he looks like.
"The egregious O’Myre also hath descended on London town--stays,"
"however, but a little while----"
"Yet a wondrous thing of a man, the O’Myre--the most consistent surely"
of all created things--always wrong. He and _The Times_. He must have
"been suckled on half-truths, and nurtured on the Irish Bull; he now"
"browses on false conclusions. But with what an air! Nevertheless, he"
has it all on the most philosophic basis--has for ever been blaming
something for his lack of greatness. It now appears the English drama
is dead. The O’Myre will breathe new life into it.
"Meanwhile, he has laid it down, like a minor god with a throaty tenor"
"voice, that scenery destroys the illusion of the drama--therefore it"
comes about to-day that if you would be in the vogue with the ladies
"you must go in state not to the play, but to the dress rehearsal--the"
"bare theatre and the dinginess being alone at back, the low tone"
and the cobwebs and the like giving mystery to the spoken word that
requires for enunciation but beautiful lips. God! how the ducks quack!
"Thus mews he much monstrous wisdom, sitting like a pale emotional"
maggot upon the apple of discord that is called the modern drama.”...
The rest of the letter is a matter of affection and goodwill. A man
"is always ridiculous about his first-born--exaggerative, egotistical."
"As though he had invented the business. Whereas, like heredity,"
"immortality, and the latest fashion, it is thrust upon us."
LIKE A FALLING STAR
"Rollo judged aright. It was indeed no time for love-making, and, to do"
"the young man justice, he did not connect any idea so concrete with the"
impulsive kiss he had given to Concha.
She it was who had saved his life at Sarria. She was perilling her own
in order to accompany and assist his expedition. She had drawn up the
"ladder he had foolishly forgotten. Yet, in spite of the fact that he was"
"a young man and by no means averse from love, Rollo was so clean-minded"
"and so little given to think himself desirable in the eyes of women,"
that it never struck him that the presence of La Giralda and Concha
might be interpreted upon other and more personal principles than he had
modestly represented to himself.
"True, Rollo was vain as a peacock--but not of his love-conquests."
"Punctilious as any Spaniard upon the smallest point of honour, in a"
quarrel he was as ready as a Parisian _maître d'armes_ to pull out sword
or pistol. Nevertheless when a man boasted in his presence of the
"favours of a woman, he thought him a fool and a braggart--and was in"
general nowise backward in telling him so.
"Thus it happened that, though Concha had received no honester or better"
"intentioned kiss in her life, the giver of it went about his military"
"duties with a sense of having said his prayers, or generally, having"
performed some action raising himself in his own estimation.
"""God bless her,"" he said to himself, ""I will be a better man for her"
"sweet sake. And, by heavens, if I had had such a sister, I might have"
"been a better fellow long ere this! God bless her, I say!"""
"camp just where we were and wait for daylight, when we might regain"
the camel track.
"I knew he was right, but said I would make one final effort on foot"
"to find the track, and directed him to give me the hurricane lamp we"
carried on the car.
"Stumbling and slipping over the broken ground in the pitch darkness,"
"the lamp barely lighting up my immediate path, I had wandered some"
distance from the car when I heard voices. Instantly I thought of the
"Raiders who were over-running the district. It would be too galling,"
"too humiliating to be captured by them before the campaign, on which"
"I was building such high hopes, had even begun."
Noiselessly I put out the lamp and listened in the dense darkness.
"There was absolute silence for some minutes, and I stood stock still."
"Then voices sounded again, and I conjectured that there were not more"
"than two, or at the most three, speakers."
"I thought rapidly, and finally decided that there would not be many"
men in front of me. Had there been anything approaching an encampment
"of the Raiders in the neighbourhood, there would have been lights,"
camp fires and considerable noise. The voices I had heard probably
"belonged to men who had seen the lights of the car, and had come to"
find out what it was.
"I turned swiftly and made my way back to the car, where I had"
foolishly left my revolver. Recovering my weapon I warned Allan in a
"whisper of the voices I had heard, and told him to be ready to stand"
"by. Then I made my way back in the darkness, and when I had regained"
"the spot, called out loudly, in Hindustani, ""Who's there?"""
"entirely forgotten the circumstances of this dream, again had a vivid"
dream of murder after eating pheasant at night; this time it was she
"herself who was to be killed, and she awoke imagining that she was"
struggling with the would-be murderer.]

"[Footnote 94: Dreams of railway travelling, and especially of losing"
"trains, are not always associated with headache or any other recognisable"
condition. They constitute a very common type of dream not quite easy to
"explain. Dr. Savage mentions, for instance, that in his own case scarcely"
"a week passes without such a dream, though in real life he scarcely ever"
loses a train and never worries about it. Wundt considers that the dreams
in which we seek something we cannot find or have left something behind
are due to indefinite coenaesthesic disturbances involving feelings of
"the same emotional tone, such as an uncomfortable position or a slight"
irregularity of respiration. I have myself independently observed the same
"connection, though it is not invariably traceable.]"

"[Footnote 113: See _e.g._ Marie de Manacéïne, _Sleep_, p. 7.]"
"[Footnote 114: Horace Hutchinson, who in his _Dreams and their Meanings_"
"(1901), has independently suggested that 'this flying dream is caused by"
"some action of the breathing organs,' mentions the significant fact (p."
128) that the idea of filling the lungs as a help in levitation occurs in
the flying dreams of many persons.]
[Footnote 115: We have an analogous state of tactile anaesthesia in the
early stages of chloroform intoxication. Thus Elmer Jones found that this
"sense is, after hearing, the first to disappear. 'With the disappearance"
"of the tactile sense and hearing,' he remarks, 'the body has completely"
"lost its orientation. It appears to be nowhere, simply floating in space."
It is a most ecstatic feeling.']
[Footnote 116: Lafcadio Hearn describes the fall as coming at the
"beginning of the dream. Dr. Guthrie (_Clinical Journal_, June 7, 1899),"
"in his own case, describes the flying sensations as coming first and the"
"falling as coming afterwards, and apparently due to sudden failure of the"
power of flight; the first part of the dream is agreeable but after the
"fall the dreamer awakes shaken, shocked, and breathless.]"
[Footnote 117: The disagreeable nature of falling in dreams may probably
be connected with the absence of rhythm usually present in dreams of
flying. Most of the psychologists who have occupied themselves with rhythm
"have insisted on its pleasurable emotional tone, as leading to a state"
"bordering on ecstasy (see _e.g._ J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied"
willing to give their highest degrees to encourage it.
"83,654. (Mr. Macdonald). The witness did not think it was necessary to"
"have a non-Indian element in the service in order to stiffen it up, but"
he accepted the principle that there should be a certain small
proportion of non-Indians.
"83,655. The title of professor at a college or University should carry"
"with it dignity and honour, and ought not to be so freely used as at"
present. All he asked was that it should not be abolished at the expense
of such Indians as were doing as good work as their European colleagues.
"83,656. If the Calcutta university continued to develop its teaching"
"side, there would be no objection to recruiting University Professors"
from aided colleges. This would have certain advantages.
"83,657. (Mr. Fisher). The witness desired to secure for India Europeans"
who had European reputations in their different branches of study. If it
"was necessary to go outside India or England to procure good men, he"
would prefer to go to Germany. This was the practice in America where
they were annexing all the great intellects of Europe.
"83,658. The witness would like to see India entering the world movement"
in the advance and march of knowledge. It was of the highest importance
that there should be an intellectual atmosphere in India. It would be
of advantage if there were many Indians in the Educational Service. For
"they came more in contact with the people, and influenced their"
"intellectual activity. Besides, on retirement they would live in India"
and their life experience would be at their countrymen's service.
"83,659. There was very little in the complaint made in certain quarters"
that the work of the Professors in the colleges in India was hampered by
falls--and over them.
"He took the drop easily, riding the log with that perfect balance which"
is second nature to the seasoned riverman. When the timber bumped
"against the rapidly forming jam, Curly leaped again, thrusting the log"
"down as he did so, and landed on the solid barrier. Scrambling lightly"
"over to the face of this, he thrust deftly with his peavey into the"
"mass, and began to work desperately to loosen the key log--that first"
"upended stick of pine which had started the whole trouble, and which"
must be started before the rest of the barrier would give.
"He got a good hold on it, but the thing defied his efforts to tear it"
"loose. It was wedged too tightly for even his great strength, and,"
"though he seemed to feel it move slightly, he strained his muscles to"
the utmost in vain to accomplish anything further. Presently he
"realized, with a thrill, that the jam was piling up behind him faster"
"and faster. He ceased his efforts, and clamping the peavey on timber"
"above the key log, pried it free, and sent it bobbing downstream."
"Another followed, and another still. Sweat poured in streams from him,"
"trickling blindingly into his eyes, but he did not stop to wipe it away."
"There was no time. He must go on doing his best till help came, or"
else----
A faint jar shook the jam. A second later Curly felt a hand lightly
touch his shoulder. A familiar voice sounded in his ear:
"“Good work, son! Where’s that trouble maker? Oh, I see. Let me drop down"
"to that ledge, where I can get a good hold. That’s the idea. Now grip"
"her above me. Fine! Ready, now? Yank away!”"
"It was Bainbridge--swift, agile, incredibly fresh considering what he"
had accomplished that day. For a moment or two Curly did not realize
"after the conclusion of the war continue so to act in relation to, and"
"finally dispose of, all matters and things which arose during the war,"
"including all penalties, liabilities and forfeitures incurred during the"
war.
Part II.--PROCEDURE IN PRIZE CAUSES.
"[Sidenote: Custody of ships taken as prize. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s."
16.]]
"16. Where a ship (not being a ship of war) is taken as prize, and is or"
"is brought within the jurisdiction of a prize court, she shall forthwith"
"be delivered up to the marshal of the court, or, if there is no such"
"marshal, to the principal officer of customs at the port, and shall"
"remain in his custody, subject to the orders of the court."
"[Sidenote: Bringing in of ship papers. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 17.]]"
"17.--(1) The captors shall in all cases, with all practicable speed,"
bring the ship papers into the registry of the court.
"(2) The officer in command, or one of the chief officers of the"
"capturing ship, or some other person who was present at the capture and"
"saw the ship papers delivered up or found on board, shall make oath that"
"they are brought in as they were taken, without fraud, addition,"
"subduction, or alteration, or else shall account on oath to the"
satisfaction of the court for the absence or altered condition of the
ship papers or any of them.
(3) Where no ship papers are delivered up or found on board the captured
"ship, the officer in command, or one of the chief officers of the"
"who, shortly before his death, declared her to be “the only"
"woman in contemporary literature who knew how to write a novel,”"
and that her future work would be her best. Another eminent
"English critic, Dr. Robertson Nicholl, spoke for some of the"
best students of modern literature in saying:—
“Gertrude Atherton is the ablest woman writer of fiction
now living.”
"In her most notable novel, “The Conqueror,” Gertrude Atherton"
has chosen in “the true and romantic story of Alexander
Hamilton” a subject which would have attracted few woman
"writers, and has handled those parts of it with which many men"
have busied their brains in such a way that _The New York Times
Saturday Review_ remarked that it
“Holds more romance than nine-tenths of the imaginative
fiction of the day and more veracity than ninety-nine
hundredths of the history. She is master of her
material.”
“Certainly this country has produced no writer who approaches
"Mrs. Atherton,” says one critic, while another adds that to have"
so “re-created a great man as Mrs. Atherton has done in this
novel is to have written one’s own title to greatness.” All
alike regard it as “a thing apart” (_The Critic_); “a remarkable
"production, full of force, vigour, brains, and insight” (_Boston"
Herald_); “an entrancing book . . . brilliantly written”
(_Glasgow Herald_). “It is hardly too much to say that she has
invented a new kind of historical novel” is the comment of the
"_Athenæum_ (London), with the addition that “the experiment is a"
remarkable success.”
"Netherlands. ""The engrained habit of municipal isolation,"" says"
"one, ""was the cause why the general liberties of the Netherlands"
"were imperilled, why the larger part of the country was ultimately"
"ruined, and why the war of independence was conducted with so much"
"risk and difficulty, even in the face of the most serious perils"""
"(Thorold Rogers, _Holland_, p. 26. Cp. pp. 35, 43; Motley, pp. 29,"
"30, 43; Grattan, pp. 39, 50, 51). Van Kampen avows (_Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 131) that throughout the Middle Ages Friesland was"
unprogressive owing to constant feuds. Even as late as 1670 Leyden
"refused to let the Harle Maer be drained, because it would"
advantage other cities; and Amsterdam in turn opposed the reopening
of the old Rhine channel because it would make Leyden maritime
"(Temple, _Observations_, i, 130, ch. iii)."
"As regards the early factions of the ""Hooks"" and the ""Codfish"" in"
"the Dutch towns, the historic obscurity is so great that historians"
are found ascribing the names in contrary ways. Grattan (p. 49)
"represents the Hooks as the town party, and the Codfish as the"
"party of the nobles; Motley (p. 21) reverses the explanation,"
"noting, however, that there was no consistent cleavage of class or"
"of principle (cp. M'Cullagh, pp. 99, 100). This account is"
"supported by Van Kampen, i, 170, 171. The fullest survey of the"
"Hook and Cod feud is given by Wenzelburger, _Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 210-42. As to feuds of other parties in some of"
"the cities see Van Kampen, i, 172. They included, for example, a"
class feud between the rich _Vetkooper_ (fat-dealers) and the poor
"_Schieringer_ (eel-fishers). See Davies, i, 180."
"Thus dissident, and with feudal wars breaking out in every generation,"
the cities and provinces could win concessions from their feudal chiefs
"when the latter were in straits, as in the famous case of the ""Great"
"Privilege"" extorted from the Duchess Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold"
"the evil hordes from beyond the stars ..."""
The Vice-President looked around in a daze. Had someone forgotten to
brief him? Had that project come to a head overnight? The last he'd
heard there had been much doubt as to--
""" ... The injustice perpetrated on the American people in this matter"
has been monstrous. And this is not because of any lack of knowledge on
the part of the government. It has been because of the petty natures of
the men to whom this secret has been entrusted. Jealousies have dictated
policy where selfless public service was of the most vital importance
"..."""
The floor was filling up. The visitor's gallery was wrapped in hushed
"silence. Newsmen, informed of sensational developments, were rushing"
down corridors.
And the Vice-President was wondering why he hadn't had the good sense to
refuse the nomination.
""" ... These invaders from another planet are not strangers to the men in"
power. It is on record that they are inhuman monsters capable of killing
without mercy--yet they are quite ordinary in appearance. They walk the
"streets, unsuspected, among us. It is on record right here in Washington"
"that these creatures are not human but, rather, soulless androids,"
"manufactured to destroy us, by a race so far ahead of us in scientific"
"knowledge that we are like children by comparison ..."""
"""Will the Senator yield to the Senator from Alabama?"""
"""I will not. I refuse to be gagged in the process of acquainting the"
"American people with facts upon which their very survival depends."""
the Kalè Valley. There the buffaloes are turned out into the jungle for
"eight months in the year, and are only caught for ploughing and carting."
"Naturally they are quite wild; in fact, many of them are the offspring"
of wild bulls.
"The Burmans, too, are very fond of dogs. Their villages are full of"
"dogs; but, as far as I know, they never use them for anything, and they"
are never trained to do anything. They are supposed to be useful as
"watch-dogs, but I do not think they are very good even at that. I have"
"surrounded a village before dawn, and never a dog barked, and I have"
heard them bark all night at nothing.
But when a Burman sees a fox-terrier or any English dog his delight is
"unfeigned. When we first took Upper Burma, and such sights were rare,"
half a village would turn out to see the little 'tail-less' dog trotting
"along after its master. And if the terrier would 'beg,' then he would"
"win all hearts. I am not only referring to children, but to grown men"
and women; and then there is always something peculiarly childlike and
frank in these children of the great river.
"Only to-day, as I was walking up the bank of the river in the early"
"dawn, I heard some Burman boatmen discussing my fox-terrier. They were"
"about fifteen yards from the shore, poling their boat up against the"
"current, which is arduous work; and as I passed them my little dog ran"
"down the bank and looked at them across the water, and they saw her."
"'See now,' said one man to another, pausing for a moment with his pole"
"in his hand--'see the little white dog with the brown face, how wise she"
looks!'
"'And how pretty!' said a man steering in the stern. 'Come!' he cried,"
holding out his hand to it.
"In truth, this is the one principle which can give men guidance in the"
"tangled intricacy of modern life. It is necessary to salvation, _now_,"
"not hereafter only, to believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord"
Jesus Christ.
"For, first of all, men need to be saved from the apathy of despair."
They need some hope that there is an answer to the riddle of the
Universe. Let them once begin to feel that it _may_ be true that the
very God cares for His creatures and has made His love for them
"manifest by taking to Himself the body, mind and spirit of man, and"
"joining for ever human nature to the Godhead, then through the"
darkness comes a human voice saying--
"“O heart I made, a heart beats here!"
"Face, my hands fashioned, see it in Myself."
"Thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine,"
"But love I gave thee, with Myself to love,"
And thou must love Me who have died for thee.”
A man regains his self-respect when once he has escaped from the
paralyzing sense that his is only
“a life of nothings nothing worth
From that first nothing ere our birth
To that last nothing under earth.”
And there is only one starting-point for those who journey on this
quest of an answer to the enigma of life. They must resolutely abandon
the long travelled “_a priori_ road.” They must understand that the
"science of to-day is not tied to any materialistic axioms, that"
"metaphysic cannot be ignored by the physician, and that no competent"
"singing. In his first Preface to the _Geystliches Gesangbücklin_, 1525,"
he wrote:
"These songs have been set in four parts, for no other reason than"
because I wished to provide our young people (who both will and ought
to be instructed in music and other sciences) with something whereby
"they might rid themselves of amorous and carnal songs, and in their"
"stead learn something wholesome, and so apply themselves to what is"
"good with pleasure, as becometh the young."
"The period of the German chorales may be said to have begun with Luther,"
"1483-1546, and ended two centuries later with J. S. Bach, 1685-1750."
"Bach brought the chorale tunes to their highest perfection, using many"
of them in his larger choral works. He composed about 30 original
"chorale melodies, wrote reharmonizations for approximately 400, and"
composed many chorale preludes for the organ which are in wide use
today.
"The German hymns and chorale tunes, used constantly in the home and"
"school, as well as in the church, have been of great importance in our"
Mennonite worship in the past. They constitute the main body of material
in all our German collections of hymns. In an effort to preserve and
"emphasize this rich heritage, there was incorporated into the _Hymnary_,"
"a special section, Book III, made up exclusively of chorales."
German Chorales in the Hymnary
16th Century
"Martin Luther, 1483-1546, “A mighty fortress is our God” (549)"
“From heaven above to earth I come” (527)
“Out of the depths I cry to Thee” (531-2)
were demanded and gradually the psalter appeared with tunes. Early tune
"versions put the melody invariably in the tenor. The latest edition,"
"printed in 1929, by the Oxford Press, contains the best Psalm tunes"
"which had gradually come into use, many of them arranged with"
“Faux-bourdon” (wherein the congregation sings one or more verses to the
"melody while the choir supplies the harmony), and “Descant” (a second"
melody over that of the tune).
"f. _The New Version_, Tate and Brady, London, 1696. This version"
"gradually supplanted the _Old Version_ of Sternhold and Hopkins, and"
held its place in the worship of the church for 150 years. It was
"adopted, in 1789, by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United"
States and bound with the prayer book of that Communion.
The above versions are only a few of the large number of psalters that
"were published by the Calvinistic churches on the Continent, in Great"
"Britain, and in America. The metrical psalms were designed for the"
singing church. They were intended to restore song to the people in
"their worship, serving in this respect a similar purpose to the chorales"
in Germany.
"Some of the psalm books were published without music, some with the"
"melody only, and others in four-part harmony. The statement is"
frequently made that Calvinistic Protestantism approved only unison
"singing. The appearance of numerous books, complete with four voice"
"parts, points to the contrary. It is true that Calvin at first"
"encouraged unison singing only, regarding harmony more in the nature of"
amusement than the worship of God; but upon observing the effectiveness
"of singing in Germany, he soon changed his views and became more liberal"
in this respect.

"""I will watch for his ears when he next calls, which, I expect, will"

"use, for I doubt if either of us has ever seen the real, undisguised"
Dawson as he is known to God. We know a man whom we think is the
genuine article--but is he? Cary's description of him is most unlike
the man whom we see here. I expect that he has a different identity
for every place which he visits. If he told me that at any moment he
"was wholly undisguised, I should be quite sure that he was lying. The"
man wallows in deception for the very sport of the thing. But he can't
"change his ears. Study them, and you will be safe."""
Our club was the only place in which we could be sure that Dawson did
"not penetrate, though I should not have been surprised to learn that"
one or two of the waitresses were in his pay. Dawson is an ardent
feminist; he says that as secret agents women beat men to a frazzle.
Shortly before Dawson left for his headquarters on the north-east
"coast he dropped in upon me. He had finished his researches, and"
revealed the results to me with immense satisfaction.
"""I have fixed up Menteith,"" he began, ""and know exactly how he came"
"into communication with the German Secret Service."" The contemptuous"
"emphasis which he laid on the word ""Secret"" would have annoyed the"
Central Office at Potsdam. I have given the detected British spy the
name of Menteith after that of the most famous traitor in Scottish
"history; if I called him, say, Campbell or Macdonald, nothing could"
save me from the righteous vengeance of the outraged Clans.
"as, until I could reach Robat, I had no knowledge at all as to the"
strength and composition of the force that would be at my disposal.
But upon one thing I made up my mind--even at that early stage--I
"would do my utmost to show these Raiders, who were doing us so much"
"harm, that they could not do this with impunity. The lesson once"
"driven home, an endeavour should be made to become friendly with"
"them, to win them back to our side, and, so to speak, appoint them as"
doorkeepers of the Baluchistan frontier; but doorkeepers with their
rifles pointed at our enemies instead of at ourselves.
In the midst of these meditations I found myself stumbling with
"fatigue, so, with a last look at the beauty of the night, I turned"
"indoors, and in a few minutes was sound asleep, and making up for the"
"""whiteness"" of the night before."
CHAPTER II
THE ROAD TO ROBAT
Mushki-chah--The native contractor--An evening rencontre--Idu
of the Chagai Levies--The native idea of an airship--Idu the
invaluable--Robat.
"On the third day we made good progress, fate being kind in helping us"
"to avoid the sandy pitfalls which had hitherto been our undoing, and,"
"by nightfall, we found ourselves approaching the post of Mushki-chah."
Here we found the road blocked with a number of camel caravans
"of a dog, a dog and so on through the list, the interpretations being"
chosen through the ideas associated with the animal in question. A text of
"this kind[69], of which we have many, reads in part as follows."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, the abandoned weapons will make an"
"attack (again), the king will be without a rival."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, but with a head of a 'rain bow'"
"bird[70], the son will seize the throne of his father."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, but (some of) the features are"
"(also) human, the power of the king will conquer a powerful country."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, but (some of) the features are those"
"of a lamb, the young cattle will not prosper."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, but (some of) the features are those"
"of an ass, severe famine will occur in the country."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, but (some of) the features are those"
"of a dog, Nergal[71] will cause destruction."
If an ewe gives birth to a lion but (some of) the features are those
"of a =khupipi=[72], the ruler will be without a rival and will"
destroy the land of his enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, but with the mouth of a wild cow,"
the rule of the king will not prosper.
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion but with the mouth of a bull, famine"
will ensue.

Is my daughter all right?
We're hopeful.
That's why it's important that you tell us everything you can about what happened.
"I was asleep, and then there was a scream."
It was Josie.
"I woke up, but my eyes wouldn't open."
Josie kept screaming.
"And every time I went to where I thought she was, the scream came from somewhere else."

No.
He--he wore something on his face.
"They were like, um,"
"I don't know, glasses."
Like eyeglasses?
"No, no."
Bigger than that.
"More like, um, like goggles."
That's all I could make out.

Only at the end.

"Yeah, just, uh... just came in."
"Abby, check your in-box, please."
"Uh, I just sent you his I.D. photo."

I think Trey Songz should be a lot bigger than he is.
You know what I mean?
"He's one of the only entertainers I know that can sit there, eye-molest your girlfriend, while you watch helplessly, and there's nothing you can do but be like,"
"""Yo, that's Trey Songz."
He's eye-molesting my woman.
"""I'm probably gonna sleep with her, and that's fucking awesome."""
"Matter of fact, give me a female volunteer out of the audience right now."
I'm gonna show you what he does.
You?
You wanna come up here?
"Come on, Karen, get up here."
Come on.
This way.
"Here, sit down."
You look happy as shit.
"""Hi, everybody!"""
"Okay, if you don't know who Trey Songz is, this is what he does, he be..."
"¶ Whoa, whoa, ah."
¶ Yeah.
¶ Look what the girl done did to me ¶
Ooh!
You're a little too into this shit.
"All right, it ain't that type of party, ma'am."
Thank you so much.
Peace.
"- Rick, stop him!"
- Hey!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
[ Man ] What's the matter?
It's not cold.
"[ Woman ] Bobby, it's cold!"
"Come on, Diane."
[ Woman Screeches ]
"[ Man Talking, Indistinct ] [ Both Laughing ]"
[ Bobby ] What's the matter?
[ Diane Screeches ] Bobby!
"Oh, I'm gonna get you."
No.
It's cold!
"[ Bobby ] Come on, Diane."
Let's go swimming.

"Diane, you're gonna be at sea before Jessie even realizes you've left the club."
Jessie doesn't scare me.
"Well, if it's Dutch--"
"It's you, Bobby."
"Diane, I love you, and I'm gonna marry you."
That's what scares me.
"All of this is just-- It's all too good to be true, and I just keep thinking that something's gonna happen to spoil it."
Like what?
I don't know.
That's because nothing's gonna happen.
"In two hours, we're gonna be married, and you'll be on the boat to San Diego."
"And when I join you next month, we're gonna have the rest of our lives to raise beautiful little girls... just like you... and nasty little boys just like me."
"Bobby, if something did go wrong, you wouldn't ever forget me, would you?"
Will you just stop it and listen to me?
"She sparks every time, she does."
"That rifle does you credit, Hagman."
"Thank you, Mr Sharpe."
Oil sir
The secret is not to spare the oil.
So General Wellesley says.
Aye.
Ow!
Damn knee!
"Old leg wound, Hagman."
Rain plays the devil with it.
Aye.
Brown paper and paraffin oil is the only cure for a contrary leg.
I has a contrary arm on account of an argument with a French hussar...
"Oh, bugger it!"
...which we had at the Battle of Vimieiro.
"And which argument he lost, on account of me blowing his head off his neck."
But it do itch fierce of a rainy day.
And I find nothing work s so well as paraffin oil and best brown paper.
- Aye.
"- Oh, aye."

"She's beautiful, is she not?"
Yes.
You never loved a woman?
No.
Not after I paid for it.
So she's like no woman you ever met?
I think you should try to forget her.
"Because, you see she's no longer a woman."
She was the best student in Salamanca.
Oh!
Thank you for letting me come with you.
you are so good!
Where are you going?
To find some food.
Stay and rest;
I'll be back.
please bless her.
Lord.
she's very old.
There's no need to apologize.
I know Master Boaz would want to help you.
You see those women there?
They're gleaners.
Many of them are widows like yourself.
Follow them and you can gather up all the loose grain you see.
Daniel?
her.
that you're welcome here.
sir.
When you drink a need... go to the well;
my men will draw it for you.
I am a Moabite; they may not want to.
I've ordered them to treat you kindly.
welcome.
My servants told me how you... how you gave up your home and your own people for the sake of your mother-in-law.
I think that's very kind.
May God bless you for it.
Thank you.
special needs.
Let some extra grain fall for her.
tell her she can just harvest some of her own.
The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and... you can sleep in the living room on the convertible. but we really should go.
We can leave early in the morning.
as it were.
Pop?
Okay.
Sit.
you want some dessert? and hardly any sleep.
I'm fucking 90.
that's 101 reasons to keep moving.
Logan.
then what?
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.
And then we buy the Sunseeker.
Take the pills.
shit!
- What's going on?
- Nate!
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.
check the sink.
They shut it off again.
They are just not going to let this thing go.
you might as well handle it now.
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.
We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.
all right.
The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
- By assholes.
- Hey!
No.
"You bought it for him, give it to him!"
"I won't give him this one, I've underlined some sentences."
He'd ask why.
How many weddings should there be?
"Three more, three in a row."
All rather late today.
Seems to take a long time.
What's the time?
I don't know. I won't cook today.
Have you done your shopping?
Some of it.
Meat.
"Pay day's not until Monday, did you have enough for it?"
Monday?
Not till Tuesday.
This is sure to save us!
I thought it was Monday.
"No, Tuesday. lt's the fifteenth today, isn't it?"
"Tomorrow's Sunday the sixteenth, Monday the seventeenth..."
Then we'll have to have something left over from Sunday.
It's enough to make ends meet till Sunday and you'll still have...
"No, I've already bought chickens."
I bought chickens in the week.
"I had a look at the market today, there were very few there."
I don't buy them at the market.
I bought them in a shop.
"Look out, the next ones are coming!"
Get ready!
Put your foot there.
"Here's part of it, I'd add this."
"Ah, you've got it pinned already!"
Won't you try it on?
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Welcome aboard.
Might I come aboard?
Yeah.
You remember the boat.
"Well, you know, I thought I did."
"- Or, you know, little..."
- But it's been a while.
You know that dock?
"Over there, there's a boat that looks just like yours."
NEIL:
Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.
"- No, that's not my boat."
- It's definitely not.
But there's a very nice gentleman living on the boat who invited me in for a white-wine spritzer.
"Oh, good."
Wasn't expecting visitors.
That's all right.
I just wanted to just come by and say thanks for helping yesterday.
"Beth, you know, I'm the same person."
I would do anything for you.
I just can't give you...
I just can't give you what you want.
You're what I want.
Our life together is what I want.
I miss it.
I miss you.
You see those guys my sisters are married to...
"You're more of a husband to me, not being married than those real husbands are ever gonna be, and..."
You know that photo that you sent me?
I dug around and apparently Shou Saito took out a patent for a computer brain interface last year.
How are you real?
I don't...
"Okay, fuck."
I don't...
They brought you here!
"You are, you're real, and they brought you here, and they're trying to fuck with me."
"Nice try, good try."
I get it.
It's part of the test.
His patent got rejected outright.
"They said it was insane, it was dangerous."
Wow.
Really?
How much are they paying you?
Honestly.
Cos you're killing it right now.
- Have they given you something?
"- Sorry, I thought you were fake."
"But now I know you're real, I'm being a really terrible host."
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.
"- Cooper, what I want to do is..."
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.
- Cooper!
"- Sonja, relax, okay?"
Give it up.
"I know, the jig's up, okay?"
Let it go.
"Look, Cooper, there's more."
Five people have disappeared in the past year.

- SEC.
We're shut down.
Somebody went out of their way to bring on some real hurt.
You made any enemies lately?
Adriana called them in.
Revenge for when you and I...
Help yourself to the files.
You won't find anything.
I've been cooking the books for years.
- I never saw that.
- I was good at it.
You want to burn down my house?
I'm going to burn down yours.
A standard in-house Bastion contract.
It specifies a large amount of cash that you've been funneling into investments.
Cash obtained illegally.
You forged my signature.
Where do you think I learned that little trick?
Work with me.
Partners.
"Now, what do you really want?"
You want me?
You want Grace?
I want you both.
Suddenly single.
"Starting over, I guess."
Is that what we're doing?
I'm not gonna see you for a while.
We're going to Argentina.
"Simon, what's wrong?"
He's not sick.
"This is all bullshit, okay?"
What?
"Pauline, I'm in a meeting, you lardy trout!"
Wh...?
Insurance?
Hop it.
I just wanted a quick word with you about Enid and myself.
What are you talking about?
"Pauline, get Roberts."
Enid and I are in love.
"'Yes, we're in love.'"
'And why are you telling me?
'
Because I have to assume that you have feelings for her as well 'and that you want the best for her.'
'Are we talking about Enid Sutcliffe?
' 'Yes.'
Why do you think I care one way or the other about her?
Because I know what the situation is.
"Get out of here, you fat fool."
Coming shouting the odds in your cheap suit.
No-one's shouting.
"Can we not shake hands, like gentlemen, for Enid's sake?"
Enid's nothing to me.
"She's a spinster with a crush, that's all, whatever she's told you."
How dare you.
You've had what you've wanted for years and years and you say she's nothing to you?
You're despicable.
Tubby!
Ha-ha-ha!
Come with me!
You'll stay where you are if you want to keep your job.
"I love you, Enid!"
And don't let him back in!
Yes.
"And he's sincere and easygoing, and sexy,"
I just really like him.
Daddy?
Christine.
What?
- That's my date.
- That's my father.
- You're father?
- Your date?
You got to be freaking kidding me.
Don't answer that.
"Hi, we're not home right now."
"So leave a message for Christine,"
"- Ritchie, - and... say it."
Matthew.
"Oh, come on."
"Hi, Christine, this is Jeff."
Haven't heard from you since our date.
Don't know if you got my message so I thought I'd leave another one.
"I'm hoping that you didn't get the first message, because now there'd be two messages on your machine and that would make me look not cool."
And I think we both know how cool I am.
Bye.
"Well, he sounds cool."
Why aren't you talking to him?
I thought you liked him.
"No, I do like him but he's new Christine's dad."
I mean we had a great first date and everything but don't you think that's weird?
That he wants a second date with you-- absolutely.
Shut up.
You'd marry me in a second.
"Besides, I'm too busy to date."
Seriously?
You're scraping the crusty bits off the sides now?
I'm sorry but I'm an emotional eater.
"Hang on, hang on."
All right look the recipe says it serves 12.
I had one and a half you dropped one on the floor.
That means you had nine-and-a-half servings!
Well excuse me Little Miss Solve-Your-Fancy-Math-Problems.

[Gasps]
You lashed out at me.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to.
Here.
Like I would want that.
Oh.
Okay.
Dang my generation's foolish beliefs that food can make the pain go away.
[Taking deep breath]
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's all right, I mean, we're jumping on each other."
Because you know we feel helpless and there's nothing we can do.
Although frankly a little bit more you than me.
Well excuse me but I don't think I recall throwing macaroni fractions.
In your face.
"Oh, do you wanna go?"
-Is this how it's going to be?
Is this how it's going to be?
"-That's the way it's gonna be, yeah."
Come on.
"Oh, all right I can't hear you with that in your mou... hi."
Hey.
-How you doing bud?
It was horrible.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Do you wanna tell me about it?
"Come on, let's stand."
Tell me.
(PANTING)
It was the same as last time.
"I was in this room, this red room."
"It was bright, blood red curtains, but there was no windows, no doors, so it didn't make sense, and I couldn't get in or out."
I was trapped.
"The curtains, they were on fire."
It was horrible.
It's okay.
"I was hunched in the corner, and I looked over into the other corner."
"And in the shadows, there was someone else there."
I could just see his eyes.
He was looking right at me.
It's okay.
It's over now.
"These nightmares, they will fade away, I promise."
Did they for you?
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
I'll sit with you until you fall back asleep.
Who else do I have to take care of?
They hoarded all of their greatest stolen treasures in here.
Piles of jewels and every room filled with coins.
Let's get to it.
The compass.
(SNIFFS)
What's your rush?
Shannon is on the trail of a creature known locally as The Beast.
She's brought us to the exact spot where we stand the best chance of seeing it tonight.
The full moon is about to rise and the creatures of the night are coming out to play.
And cut.
Nice.
Very poetic.
Don't let me get too fancy.
I don't want to lose the audience.
"So, how do you want to do this?"
Steve!
What is that?
A secure container.
Harmless but inescapable.
We're going to catch The Beast.
Our first time as a family.
I feel like I should make a speech.
You'd better make it quick if you don't want to end it growling.
Come on.
The moon won't wait.
Maddy?
I'm sorry.
- Maddy!
- Open this door.
Don't you dare!
Maddy!
Open this door now!
I'll see you in the morning.
"- Maddy, I mean it!"
- You are in trouble...
Are you sure about this?
No.
So hurry before I lose my nerve.
No one told me you were Australian.
Is that a problem?
Only if being horny as hell is a problem.
"Uh, okay, well, Lizzie has not been herself."
She's not moving very much and she's getting night sweats.
Just take a look at her.
Oh!
What is it?
I hate it!
Lizzie!
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
Lizzie is a lizard!
"I love snakes, but I absolutely hate lizards."
Lizards are a myth.
And she's been very weak.
She hasn't been moving very much lately.
"Ugh, you should have gotten a snake."
They wriggle all over the place.
Do you think I should enter more crickets into her diet?
"Oh, look, you're clearly flipping out about this."
I need to talk to him on his own.
Is there a master bedroom we could go to?
"Uh, the kitchen's right over here."
"Yeah, we could go to the kitchen."
"No, you stay here, mind the leg snake!"
"I could tell Trevor had a thing for me, plus, I needed to tell him what I was gonna do."
Listen.
Your snake's clearly gonna die unless I do surgery on it.
I don't find you attractive.
You'll come 'round.

I hand out flyers.
So you're a loser.

I don't care.

But my kid's still in high school.
I need to send him to college.

I hope you cheer up.

Can I see you again?
Were you okay?
You're kind.
I fell bad for him.

Not like I want to do this.
I wanna work front desk at a top hotel.
"I actually want to open my own boutique store, too."
Thanks.
Take care.

You've just missed him.
Oh.
Are you OK?
"Um, maybe you could help."
"Um, do you think we could talk inside?"
Sure.
It might be nothing.
We had this guy hanging around the garden centre.
"Elly, our receptionist, saw him across the road two days before Henry Elliot was killed."
Did you confront him?
"To be honest, um, I was afraid."
"Ah, I know him."
"He's this guy I was at college with, we did the same philosophy course."
This bloke called Paul Fordyce.
Paul Fordyce?
Yes.
Do you know him?
The police are already questioning him.
"What, in connection with these murders?"
"I thought he was weird, but not a killer."
I can't talk about the case.
You'll have to talk to the police.
You don't think he's after me?
"Well, I don't know."
"Ah, can you think of any reason why he might be?"
No!
"Ah, I, I hope not."
I haven't seen him since college.
I didn't have you down as an academic.
"No, I, I'm not."
Which is why I left.
Sergeant Wu got a hit on Kimura at the palms motel.

Do you know the name of the owner?
"Yeah, Schade."
Adalind Schade.
Okay.
"Oh, hello, Majique."
You don't look very sick to me.
"[Cat yowls, cage rattles]"
"Yep, that's probably the one."
How's it going?
Everything all right?
"Yeah, there's nothing happening out here."
All right.
See you in the morning.
"All right, stand back."
Stand back.
Don't get too close.
We got to knock this thing out.

Kill me.

"We let Paathar go, Saiba is now ours."
He cannot be defeated even by a beast...
A Muraaki can be killed only by deceit.
Saiba is yours.

"Bodies meet, bodies perish."
"Souls meet, they together forever flourish."

Why are you here?
Saiba forgot why she is here.
Jilaan shall no longer even look at our Ghat.
- Didn't you get the message?
- I got the message.
But I didn't get Saiba.
I'll take Saiba with me...
After killing Jilaan.

- You must be really proud of him.
- We certainly are.
"We are, too."
I'm taking you home.
- Get better soon.
"- We'll phone tomorrow, babe."
What are you at?
The last one sort of didn't work.
Alex went diving.
- Come on.
"That's not X, it's coke."
- I said I didn't want any.
You never want anything.
DRUGS
I started using drugs...
Somebody offered me some.
"Everyone does them, so I did too."
When we use them...
nothing can stop us.
"Drugs are a way of escaping from your problems, yes."
My world without drugs Emptiness.
Coke makes you cooler because you are part of the crowd.
You feel you can do anything.
Nothing's impossible.
You can have whoever you want.
Nobody's better than you.
"The line between life and death, right?"
That's the best high of all.
Who did it?
We did it.
Better not be anything missing.
This is private property.
So was the radio private property.
So were Manfredi and Johnson.
What about the radio?
"Yeah, what about it?"
Cut the horsing around.
We know he's the stoolie and what the payoff is.
- So let's get on with it.
-Let's get on with what?
"What is this, anyway?"
A kangaroo court?
Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.
"You're all wire happy, boys."
You've been in this camp too long.
You put 2 and 2 together and it comes out 4.
Only it ain't 4!
"What's it add up to you, Sefton?"
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy.
Because I'm telling you the Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barracks.
"And whatever you do to me, you're gonna have to do all over when you find the right guy."
Watch it.
The kommandant.
"Achtung, Herr Kommandant."
"Good evening, sergeants."
"Little coffee klatch you are having, eh?"
"Gloomy in here, isn't it?"
Where is the barracks chief?
"Yes, sir."
"Wait, wait, wait."
I haven't got it turned up enough.
Basil!
I said I suggest...
"Oh, my head, my head!"
Has it come away?
Did you bang your head?
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, dear."
Let me have a look.
You'd better go and lie down before something else happens.
Shut up!
Why don't you call the police?
"We will, the moment we've searched the rooms."
My money's been taken!
"Yes, yes, I know."
Try not to speak.
Is this a piece of your brain?
£85.
Take my arm.
"I don't need your arm, thank you."
I can get down the stairs perfectly well by myself.
"""Down"" the stairs?"
Don't stop when you get to the basement.
Keep straight on.
Give my regards to the earth's core.
Are you sure you can manage?
"And if you give us any more trouble, I shall visit you in the small hours and put a bat up your nightdress."
"Well, that was fun, wasn't it?"
"The odd moment like that, almost worth staying alive for, isn't it?"
"It's nice to share a moment like that, isn't it?"
This is hard.
It doesn't have to be.
I just think the most important thing for you is going to be let him do the talking.
Right.
"Okay, you're right."
I got it.
I got it this time.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me.
That was better.
I am not cut out for this one-night stand thing.
It's not for everybody.
"I mean, I know it seems silly to you, Matthew, but I just wish somebody would notice me."
"Not as a mom or as a carpool captain, but as a woman."
Do you know how long it took me to do this to my hair?
A minute?
No.
"A long, long time."
"God, this is impossible."
"Come on, let's get out of here."
I'm never going to meet anybody in a grocery store.
"You met someone, didn't you?"
"Yeah, we had a moment over by the goat milk."
I think she's into me.
I'll see you at home.
Are you done with that cart?
"Hey, knock yourself out."
Wow.
"I don't want to embarrass you, but your hair is really pretty."
It must take you a long time to make it do that.
You're in a good mood.
"Yes, okay."
Thank you.
"You've seen the girl, now let's make this thing happen."
Jacob wants me to stay with her.
"He doesn't care about the money, he wants his daughter."
And he wants to remember who she is.
Where's the injection gun?
"Oh yes, this is vintage Jacob."
Always loves a chess game.
And always three moves ahead.
I have it.
It stays here.
It's the only way he'll give you his numbers.
You'll meet him at Fraumunster Church.
And what stops me from killing you right now?
Because you're a smart man.
"You're gonna meet Jacob, he'll call, you'll have us released and after that, you'll have the numbers and Jacob."
"You may have lost your memory Marta, but, uh, you still have balls."
"If you haven't heard from me in an hour, kill them both."
She really needs to go to the bathroom.
Do I look like I fucking care?
Just tell me where it is.
Fuck.
The end of the corridor.
(speaking German)
(speaking German)
"Oh, shit."
I'll walk.
Here.
(speaking German)
Hey.
Get the fuck off.
- Any progress in the Weng case?
"- No, none at all."
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me, Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handle Jeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
- He is stunt man..
How long you knew him?
- I knew since my childhood.
By the way who are you?
What do you want..?
Police..
Yes Sudhakar.
Sir his name is Karthik..
He is Stuntman..
Okay..
Thank you.
What his dad said was correct.
There is another person looking like him.
But we cannot take chance.
Hello sir..
I am sending a photo.
Hack the IB main server and check whether he is there in the employee data base.
His name is Vikram Kumar.
IPS 2012 batch.
Thanks Stephen.
"Confirmed, both are different."
- Strange!
Hello sir..
"As said by you, they hacked and searched the IB server for you."
We created your ID as an IB officer.
They confirmed that I'm a police officer via audio.
Now I'll show them the video.
Why are you still here?
Have you not still caught him?
My target is to catch you.
- Will you call Chairman Sir informally?
Inquiries should be done on criminals like you and not on Police like me.
"And, Bruce, we really wanna wish you well."
I thought they gave you grounds privileges.
They did.
It's not much of a privilege unless you use it.
So you're really leaving?
"Well, my insurance ran out, so I guess so."
Are you ready?
Do I have a choice?
You cold?
Oh.
"Uh, a little."
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.
"- God, this feels so normal."
- Hm.
Is that crazy?
"You thinking the law library was haunted, that's crazy."
"This is, um..."
This is fine.
What's it like?
- What?
- Just hearing the voices.
"Oh, um..."
It sucks.
"Well, what does it feel like?"
Because I just picture it like there's a radio on in your head or something.
"Um, no, it's not in my head."
It's...
I actually hear them with my ears.
"Like people standing behind me, or beside me or creeping up."
Sometimes it's just one.
And then sometimes it's so many that I can't sort out the voices from my actual thoughts.

that's how you show empathy.
Oh!
How is the back of your hand clammy?
"All right, lightning round."
[buzzer sounds]
So there's no future for us?
"Well, I don't know what you're up to, but I'm going to Burger King after this."
[buzzer sounds]
I thought we had something.
We did have something.
A one-night stand.
[buzzer sounds]
Is there someone else?
There's everyone else.
[buzzer sounds repeatedly]
"Oh, my God!"
"I have been trying to help you for hours, and at best, you have made zero progress."
It is like you are incapable of caring.
Maybe I was right: you are a monster.
Wow.
"I'm sorry, Clark."
I can tell how frustrating this is for you.
"No, I don't think you..."
"Wait, what did you just say?"
"Um, I'm sorry?"
Jack!
You cared about how I felt!
That's empathy!
- A real weird story.
- It makes me feel eerie.
I'm going to bed.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"- Tomorrow, let's all go there and see."
- Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a long time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide. """
"""We are two elopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
And it'll just be really great to be back in my old room again.
"Don't worry, Jenny."
We'll- we'll find a place for you.
"Well, that's great,"
"Because I'm moving in, too."
Downstairs.
I was waiting to tell you
Until the board approved my sublet tomorrow.
But I'm very excited.
All my family together under one roof again.
"Better watch out, Humphreys."
"They say love makes a family, but on the Upper East Side,"
Everyone knows it's real estate.
"Hey, dad, I'm sorry I'm running so late."
Can you save me a waffle?
Always.
I'll put one in the oven for you.
"Uh, how's Lily?"
She's great.
And you?
How you holding up?
"I mean, it must be weird."
Lily's ex-husband is now her doctor.
It was at first.
"But the fact is,"
He's just her doctor now.
I'm her husband.
"Uh, by the way, Vanessa can't make it."
Said she had to be somewhere.
"Oh, right."
"The, um, internship at CNN."
They called me as one of the references she listed.
Hey.
Hey.
You won?
No brig time.
You on a break?
"No, we're done."
You lost?
They said that my marriage to Mustafa was valid.
No.
"You don't have to go back, do you?"
"No, I divorced him."
I gave back the mahr.
The money from the villa.
Divorced?
Just like that?
"Oh, Islamic law has some interesting wrinkles."
"So you and I, we're not really married?"
We can be if you take this.
My mahr.
Your phone card?
There's almost $12 on it.
It's all I have.
"Yes, I will marry you."
"You know, it still may take some doing to keep her in the country."
"Well, she's officially an adulteress now so she can't go home."
That strengthens our asylum claim.
"Well, I give you exhibit A."
"Judge sees that, can't hurt."
"Here you go, gentlemen."
So what are we drinking to?
Women who appreciate the truth.
Let me know when you find one.
- What?
- Get up.
How do you know Emma?
- The name's August.
- (DOG BARKING)
"And it's a long story, but trust me, you wanna hear it."
"All right, August."
You're not a cop.
Who are you?
You got two minutes.
Think of me as Emma's guardian angel.
Guardian angel?
I see you've been doing a pretty crap job.
I've been looking for her for the past two years.
"Now I finally find her, and she's robbing convenience stores with some deadbeat."
Tell me again who's doing the crap job?
Let me tell you something.
I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her.
Two years?
Where were you the rest of her life?
I'm not perfect.
This world?
Full of temptations.
"Turns out, I'm not that great at saying no."
Not built that way.
But I'm here now.
So who are you?
We were in the same home as kids.
"And I thought she'd be safe inside the system, but now that she's out..."
"Back then, I promised I would take care of her."
"Well, we promised to take care of each other."
You love her.
"Don't ever go back to the department, Colt!"
They'll use you up and hang you out to dry on Christmas!
You'll wind up sitting there with your freezing family waiting for the phone to ring!
"Don't worry, Dad."
They'll call you.
That's right.
And it'll be Bob Pogo on his hands and knees begging you to come back.
There's no reason for us to be worried.
Everything's gonna be fine.
That airline cannot go on without you.
Now enjoy your show.
Psychedelic dandelion!
I've been dosed!
There's a lizard in my brain!

"Call today for a ""reservation""!"
I'm going to bed.
It's only 7:30.
- It's midnight in my mind.
- Frank...
I liked him better when he yelled at us.
God.
"Oh, God."
Why did he buy that damn TV?
No.
"So once a week, I can have BBQ with my brother."
"Or order a large pizza, or have raw fish."
He's so happy.
I have the dates.
"Yesterday, Mother and Hyang Gi's mother got the dates somewhere."
-When is it?
-Last Saturday of next month.
At Hyang Gi's pension.
Ok.
I would be lying if I say congratulations.
I won't congratulate you.
So today was our break up day.
That's too bad.
"Had I known, I wouldn't have gotten lost."
I wasted all that time.
I see why you got angry.
I knew something was wrong.
I practiced this moment way too many times in my bed.
I guess practicing helps.
You told me that we won't be able to get past this fall.
It's ok.
It's much better than I thought it would be.
"It's like, ""It's finally come."" Something like that?"
Good for you.
You're so ok.
I told you that I practiced.
Don't smile.
I don't want to see you smile.
You want me to cry?
"No, no, I can't do that."
You want me to cry my eyeballs out?
And maybe faint?
"- Yes, she does."
"- Bite me, asshole."
You have a bad attitude when you're drinking.
"You have a bad attitude when you're drinking, you huge-footed slut."
You know what?
"I'm just gonna go get more wasted, and then I'm gonna bang some rim, dude."
Really?
Could it be this guy?
"No, it can't, but it could be Dennis."
Pass.
Whatever.
You know what?
I'm gonna take this.
"I'm gonna take this, and I'll see you assholes later."
- That is my notebook.
- Free coffee for a year.
Wait a second.
Where did she get my note?
- You know what?
I have backups.
- What is with her?
Something about drinking.
She just won't stop talking about it.
"- What, the plates of shit?"
- Somebody pooped the bed.
Whatever.
Let's get out of here.
We could use a fresh set of eyes on this if you don't mind.
"No, thank you."
"I think that Artemis and I have much better things to do, thank you."
"Actually, I'm just gonna stick around."
Excuse me?
Dangaioh transformation successful.
Looks like they made it in time.
The problem is the intruders.
The security system has been completely destroyed.
"If we don't do something, they'll be able to infiltrate into the lowest level."
"Don't worry, the Commander will take care of it."
Dangaioh?
So that means they got past Fubuki?
"Go, Ankokuten!"
Buy us time until Mikazuchi comes back!
This is it?
"Okay, show me."
So it's sending false information to the computer...
Its processing capabilities are amazing.
Give it up!
"Boy, that felt good!"
We're not finished yet.
"Stand up, Ankokuten!"
Show them what you're really worth!
"Arise, Hikio!"

"Looks older""?"
"Senior roles are not to be sneered at, Ambrose."
- Gravitas.
Experience.
Maturity.

We all have a part to play in defeating Hitler.
Not this part.
It's a corpse role.
He's dead before the end of act three.
Mr. Smith.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Mr. Hilliard.
"Ambrose, you must see--"
"You, me, the industry, we are all at the service of the war now."
The war.
The war.
Damn the bloody war!
"The war has skimmed off the cream, and we're left with the rancid curds!"
I'm sorry I took so long.
There was a bomb crater on the Marylebone Road.
Oh!
No one told me there was a meeting.
"No, we've been rather trying to keep this under wraps for the present."
It seems that there's a someone in Mr. Swain's department who knows a someone who says that the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk.
That their engine broke down before they were even out of British waters.
Pity.
"Pity all round, really."
Your first draft boded so well.
- Well...
- You spent what?
"Yes, we spent a lot of money."
"So, what?"
How much?
Why do you want to know?
Just tell me.
"Apart from our savings, we have borrowed some."
Varun!
"- Varun, stop!"
Your eyes are very sensitive to light now.
It will take some time to get used to excessive light.
You will have to use spectacles.
"- Okay, doctor."
'Calling Deepa'.
Varun.
Think practically.
You say that she used to come to the restaurant everyday.
But you don't know what she looks like.
You neither have her photo nor her address.
How do we search for her?
I promised to help her.
She must have pinned her hopes on me.
Would she have any idea about my accident?
She would have thought that I had cheated her.
There is no wrong from your side.
Don't think too much.
Varun.
Excuse me.
Do you remember the girl who used to come with me?
Everyday I see lot of people.
Thank you.
Tell me if you see her.
"Well, I honestly think that you're a train wreck."
Hi.
Hey.
You look nice.
Thank you.
I'm glad you called.
Yeah.
"Um, I called to give you... this."
Found it...
"Grady's, yeah."
"He asked me to take my shirt off to see if I was wearing a wire, and the mouse ears, I don't know."
You don't have to do that anymore.
Case is closed.
"Okay, so how does it work, the dying part?"
"Well, in Switzerland, a doctor would give a patient such as yourself a lethal dose..."
"- Oh, my God."
- Of sodium pentobarbital with a drink.
"There is no pain, no suffering, you just fall asleep."
"An option is to go to Switzerland and be what they call a death tourist, and fly..."
So?
Did you ever find out if your mom was a drug dealer?
"Oh, yeah, she's like a kingpin."
She has a whole empire.

It's Casper.

"Refuse what, Ma?"
I have chosen a girl for you.
What...?
No refusing

"You will see her, won't you?"
After my life
Isn't he looking cute?

"What are you upto, Ma?"
Are you here to see Shanti?
Yes
Ma ends up choosing this one for me?

"You did a good job on the building, son."
Mickey:
You know the tournament?
You know the bowling tournament in Vegas?
Not that again.
It's an investment.
No.
"It's not an investment, it's a $5,000 vacation."
It's for the tournament.
"It costs 3,000 to enter,"
I've got to have some money to fly out there-- for food and a hotel.
It's not like on five Gs I'm gonna be able to get fancy.
"You know, this bowling thing of yours... it's making you look like a sucker."
What kills me is... there's no one even trying to talk you into it.
It's just you.
"Excuse me, excuse me."
"Look, here."
Somebody take your boy-- take your son and gone.
- Take your father and him gone.
- Carlos:
What?
!
- What happened?
- Some boys took your father-- and I don't know where he went.
Coño!
"Tito, take care of the register, I'll be right back."
It's not my fault.
I don't know where he is.
"""Santa María, Madre de Dios... ruega por nosotros, pecadores..."""
- You're funny.
I swear you think about Mom more now than when she was alive.
She understands.
"That's surprising, isn't it?"
Considering all the money he makes.
"I never question good fortune, Lieutenant."
All I know is that getting along with Ward Fowler is gonna be a lot easier from now on.
What about a drink?
That's amazing how she kept it from you.
Well she did.
I just found out about it.
"Yes, sir, I know."
Your accountant told me.
Oh.
"Well, good."
"Then that's it, huh?"
"Yes, sir, that's it."
"Oh, there's one more thing, sir."
Mr. Hart is in Rome.
He's gonna be back in his hotel room in a little while.
"Before I talk to him, were you really playing chess the other night?"
"Lieutenant, let's get it straight right now."
I was not with Leo Hart the other night.
"But I wasrt busy killing my wife, either."
(BUZZER SOUNDING)
"Yes, Mr. Daley?"
SID:
"Molly, would you come in for a minute?"
I need your help.
"Molly, would you please tell Lieutenant Columbo where I was on Thursday evening, the night my wife was killed?"
The truth.
"Mr. Daley was with me, Lieutenant."
We left the office together and we were together in my apartment until the next morning.
It's the truth.
"Yes, madam."
Thank you.
You can finish early.
"No, I'll stay to the end."
You're a trooper.
It's my last day.
What will you do in Korea?
I want to open a store with my mother.
- With your mother?
- Yes.
Mom endured a lot of hardships for me.
Dad died in a car accident when I was only two.
"After that, Mom raised me all by herself."
She sold clothes at a market until the morning.
It was tough on her.
I'm going home to return the favor.
How old is she?
57 years old.
"If my mom was alive, she'd be the same age."
She passed away?
"Two years ago, breast cancer."
"I was a troublemaker, a constant headache for her."
Kept getting mixed up with the police.
Mom apologized for me every time.
Now I feel horrible about it.
"Maybe I'm not one to talk, but take care of your mother."
I will.
"Say, Kubota San, did you come up with the name Juicy Fruits?"
"There was a band named Juicy Fruits, and I liked the vocalist, Ilia."
So that's where my name comes from.
"Hello, thank you for calling Juicy Fruits."
We'll miss you.
Thanks for everything.
Where's the server?
It's the Isis foundation.
It's 3rd and Broadway.
It's a 10-minute drive.
I'll come back for you when I'm done.
You're really bleeding.
I guess... trying to take on one of Lex Luthor's fembots doesn't make me the smartest icicle in the freezer.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get us out of here.
Is anyone out there?
!
Is anyone in there?
!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?

- Jimmy and Lois here?
"- Not yet, but Jimmy's message said he already sent the files, I was about to get started."
I got a message that Lionel left for me in his vault.
I think I know why he was killed.
He was trying to protect me.
Lionel did say something terrible was coming.
There's something on earth that can be used to control me.
Control you?
"As in ""do my bidding,"" like some sort of puppet?"
What could possibly pull your strings?
I don't know.
"But whatever it is, it takes two keys to unlock."
"When I went back to the Daily Planet tonight, there was a key in my desk."
Lionel left it there for you.
Where is it?
Lex took it.
"At last, comes the day"
"Simran, what are you doing?"
"I had forgotten, Ma."
I haven't even the right to dream
"No my child, of course you may dream"
But don't expect them to come true
"And who know, Kuljit might be the man of your dreams"
I don't care.
I've bought your tickets.
You're coming to Europe with me
- I can't
Babujiwon't let me go to college alone.
Will he let me go away... touring Europe for a month?
I have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years
Can't you make up an excuse?
"An excuse, I can find."
But I don't feel like lying to Babuji
Let me talk to Matonight
Europe?
- Yes
With friends?
- Yes
For a month?
- Yes
"Chutki, call the doctor."
Tell him that our Simran has gone stark mad
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first
You talk of traveling by Eurail?
"If he hears, he'll bring the roof down"
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
Was she pregnant?
Why else?
For fun?
"The very day they caught them, Papa sent her to Paris."
And two months later we all left Algeria-.
Things were bad enough for the Jews as it was.
But Maurice didn't give up.
He followed her to Paris.
Finally they decided to send her to Israel because he couldn't go there.
She went to the kibbutz where she met your father.
And they never saw each other again?
- I don't know.
- When she came to visit.
"She came to rest and see me, that's all I know."
"And this Maurice, where is he?"
Did you know all this?
Not until two hours ago.
So why did you come here?
To ask you to come home.
Now that I've heard things that your mother never told me
"I'm begging you, come home."
Live your lives.
"Honor your mother, she didn't want us to know."
- Are you going home?
- What do you care?
"Rosa, will you see me out?"
Regards to Ricky.
I say we go home.
You can go.
I'm not leaving until we find this Maurice guy.
You believe that old drunk's bullshit?
"One thing doesn't make sense, Aunt Rosa."
I was always strongly attracted to you.
And you knew it.
So did Wilton.
That's why The Foundation saw so little of me.
"Elizabeth, we've known each other for too long not to keep it simple."
What is it you want?
"Oh, Devon, you know better than that."
"When Sigmund Freud lay dying, his students all gathered about him and they asked if there was one question his work had not answered."
"And he replied,"
"""What a woman really wants. """
"Well, there's no need to be coy."
"Well, there's certainly no need to rush."
The future is still the future.
It will reveal itself when it chooses.
.
"Oh, a storm is threatening."
.
My very life today.
.
If I don't get some shelter.
.
"Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away."
.
"War, children."
.
"It's Just a shot away, it's Just a shot away."
.
"War, children."
.
"It's Just a shot away, it's Just a shot away.."
"Boy, do I feel lucky."
"Well, then don't play with her."
Okay ?
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it!
You...have no clue...
Just leave me alone.
I don't ever want to hear from you again.
Wake me up when the latch turns.
But what if ...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze ."
But...
Just keep a lookout while I go dream about a dress.
Him
"Oh my God, is that the guy?"
What's going on ?
I don't know !
Why didn't he take our guns ?
I don't know !
Should we wake him or just pop him ?
"I don't know, Daze ."
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
Do you know why we're here ?
"Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there must be some sort of misunderstanding.
"We're not here to clean your bathtub, or organise your closets or make you happy."
Really?
Yea.
We are here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I've a word with my partner ?
Wait a second.
"Search him, Daze."
- That he killed himself to save our destinies?
"If it's any consolation,"
I can always bring you back to this particular time and place.
I'm fine.
Just let it be.
A full compliment.
"To be honest, I had my doubts that all of you would be willing to throw in with me for a second go."
"- Well, actually..."
- We're not coming with you.
"With Savage gone, we want to start fresh, see what happens."
"I give it three months, tops."
"Look, I just..."
I want to say thank you.
To all of you.
"- Ray, I..."
- No.
This is...
it's meant to be.
I wish both of you nothing but the best.
Be safe.
See you guys around.
"Every time they do that,"
I get hungry for chicken.
"So, shall we?"
- Is that...
- The Waverider.
Another Waverider?
"Whatever it is, it's not slowing down."
Get down!
What the hell's going on?
"To be honest, Mr. Jackson, I have absolutely no idea."
Is this 2016?
- you know i love you.
- that's not what i asked you.
"- well, you're my mama."
and that's all that matters.
"- but you know i love you, right?"
- i know that you've got your own way of showing it.
are you okay?
- [sighs] i got some things to figure out.
- [sighs] harley.
"i love you very, very much, all right?"
but i need you to go back to bed now.
"- mama, if you need anything, i'm here."
"and i will do anything for you, mama."
you know that. right?
"- i do know that, and that's what worries me."
come here.
"now you get on back to bed, 'cause tomorrow is christmas."
"- but, mama."
- go on.
do as you're told.
- good night.
- good night.
[sighs]
[door creaks]
"[car door closes, engine turns over]"
[dialing]
"- ho, ho, ho."
"you've reached bob, marjorie, and tim."
"we're at the outlet mall, shopping for your christmas presents, so we can't take your call right now, but we sure do want to talk to you."
leave a message at the sound of the beep.
[beep]
"- hi, uncle bob."
- They're talking to Phan and his crew?
"- Phan's crew, yeah."
Thanks for the info.
Just letting you know what it looks like.
Gotta think about this a little bit.
Things are moving fast.
Let me know what you wanna do.
"I'm gonna go visit the shoe shop next door, OK?"
Don't go anywhere else.
Come straight back here.
She's such a good kid.
God knows how that happened with all we put her through.
"Yeah, I worry about that."
You know Bob's new girlfriend?
What was her name again?
Lorna.
How did they hook up?
I have no idea.
Bob keeps his business to himself.
"I think they met at a club, or something."
I think she's having an affair with Jim.
You know anything about that?
You're kidding?
"Alison, don't lie to me, please."
I won't tell anybody you told me.
I think it happened just the one time.
When?
"When he was on his way back from Seattle, I guess."
When he was on the island.
That's the DEA building.
They've got offices over there.
"Do you know that for sure, the DEA got offices in there?"
"Guys, this is too much."
What's too much?
Let's just get it together and chill out a little.
"Excuse me, I don't mean to disturb you."
My name's Dave.
Hi.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
That's a great name.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Do you have a cell phone I could use?
Why?
Someone's got to call God and let him know one of his angels is missing.
"Wow, that is the worst line I've ever heard."
"Well, what do you want from me?"
I've been out of the game for a while.
I've been slumming it with a really hot redhead.
Now you're getting closer.
"Dave, if you're here to be an olive branch for Jason,"
I am not gonna talk about it tonight.
"I'm not here to talk about anything,"
I just want to see my wife.
Let's go.
I can't just leave these two.
I think they'll survive.
We sure will.
They are so lucky.
Now this next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"Everybody, up!"
"Let's keep this party going, y'all!"
"Maybe we ought to wait by the exit, so when people come out, you know..."
"The search party looked for you for three days, but they had to turn back because of the aftershocks."
[Groans]
"You could hear them, couldn't you?"
[Moaning sadly]
"I cannot imagine the pain, the feeling of abandonment."
"But, Ian, killing is not the answer."
"[Moans, huffs]"
Stay back.
We have it under control.
"Ian, please."
Come with us.
We can get you help.
[Whimpers]
"Ian, no, please."
[Gunfire]

Namaste.
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, I guess that puts the yeti myth to bed once and for all."
I doubt it brings much comfort to Meegan's family.
But they do have some closure.
"You know, I have to admit that when I saw those footprints, even I started to believe a little bit."
I can't imagine what it took to survive an injury like that.
"Well, that speaks to the strength of the human spirit."
"Yeah, but was he?"
"You know, human?"
Having devolved to such an animalistic state?
I think so.
officer david.
This is jody carvell.
I am standing outside of the larson lane house.
Are you aware that the police tape is still up?
"Yes,it's an ongoing investigation."
It's the real-eate agent.
"Okay,for how much longer?"
It costs me money every day I can't show this house.
- This is outrageous.
"- Yes,but I..."
"- no,I..."
"- I would like to speak to your pervisor,if I could."
She wants to have a word with my survisor.
"miss kemp,it's is."
We need to speak with you agN.
Rebecca?
"Rebecca,what happened?"
Did you call 911?
Hold on.
"Yes,I've got a woman here who's shot and needs immediate medical attention."
why would someone unbury a body?
I can answer that.
"To send a message.Like,""hi,I'm dead."""
"""Never get engaged to two women at the same time""?"
It would be easier to jusrent a billboard.
Second question.
where's the money?
"ah,maybe in siri's engagement ring."
I got to bring this down to abby.
I can save you an elevator trip.
"oh,that's nice."
It's creating condensation.
- Are my little chickies still hungry?
- Yes.
Peep.
"Okay, worm check."
Open up.
Are there anyworms left in there?
You live next door to me.
"- No, I don't."
- I saw you moving in.
You have a white dad and a big brother.
Your whole family lives in one ofthose little apartments?
Do you all have to sleep in the same bed?
My mom lives somewhere else.
You should get a Hide-a-bed.
During the day it's a couch... but at night it folds out into a comfortable queen-sized bed.
You want to be a little bird and get a littleworm?
Just lie down and peep.
"Peep, peep, peep."
Are you following us?
"Yeah, quit following us, Peter Swersey!"
"If you don't stop following us, I'm gonna scream!"
"Ifyou take another step towards me, I'm going to kickyou in the throat!"
"Hey, come here."
Ask her if she likes bologna.
What are you putting?
"I asked herwhat kind of ""bossom"" she had."
- It's probably a man.
- Why is it a man?
'Cause everyone just makes stuff up on these things.
It's probably a man pretending to be a woman.
So picture a fat guy with a little wiener.
"- What's a ""bossom""?"
"Well, he needs me."
You have your law and...
I have mine.
"Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can."
You need medical attention.
Take the canoe.
"It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on."
Will you come with us?
"No, I'll stay here and work the mine."
"When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found."
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that.
"Would you, Buck?"
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it tougher on everybody.
"Oh, Jack, put your arms around me."
"Well, I'll be seeing you."
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of rapids.
After that it's clear sailing.
"Good-bye, Thornton."
And God bless you.
"Good-bye, Blake."
"Good-bye, Jack."
"Good-bye, Claire."
"It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, Buck?"
"It's all right, boy."
- A retarded woman in her thirties.
I didn't notice she was retarded so we went back to her parents' place.
I overlooked certain telltale signs.
"""It's okay with my mum and dad."" The Bambi poster in her room."
"Anyway, don't tell anyone."
People have a hard time with it.
And sex!
Imagine the uproar.
"I didn't know, and the sex was fine."
- The sex was fine?
Very interesting.
"- Her boobs weren't retarded, okay?"
I prefer a retard with good boobs over a bright girl with stupid boobs.
That's where you eat and sing and read and so on.
"- Nice, isn't?"
- Indeed.
WELCOME BODIL
"The room needs to be furnished, but..."
Look.
Your idea?
Super.
What a nice... square room.
I'd like a moment alone with Bodil.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
- I painted it.
- Isn't that nice?
- I painted it with my mouth.
- You painted that with your mouth?
- Yes.
And when we see we no longer know who we are!
"But my friend ... in the country of the blind, the Guerci suffer."
"We must not, you should not watch."
Refinement of the morning!
Sdolcinature!
She is almost as beautiful as my mother.
You could have telegraphed.
It was easier to take the train.
"On what platform you fell, a small mine?"
She was a woman betrothed to a gangster.
I spent the night with her.
I do not know where now.
And here I am.
- Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
- I lost your luggage.
"The portrait of my mother, the last letter of my father,"
"I have his tie, handkerchief ..."
I don't know where ...
"""I loved,"" is not the truth."
You touched me.
Emotions ...
I do think about your father.
Beautiful was your father.
"It always falls before the beauty, especially if you do not bend."
What is the truth?
Wash whiter?
"My shirt the trip, the night."
The rain ...
Do you do this to cause idiocy?
I provoke the imbecility ...
The im-be-cyl-li-ta!
And when your mother came to Paris for the last time I ...
What did you say?
!
Our squadrons are all assembled...
Huh?
Then what squadrons are those?
Did His Majesty send reinforcements?
Sion said he was putting me in charge of this!
There's no way he'd do that!
- Then...
- Don't tell me...
It's him?
That's impossible!
Crimson Fingered Claugh would ignore hostages and attack?
What do we do?
"If we lose after taking people hostage, we'll be executed!"
"No, we haven't lost yet..."
Let's kill the hostages.
I get it.
Roland doesn't think we're serious!
If we kill a hostage...
- Cease this!
- But...
You've all done well.
But this is it.
Let us release the hostages.
"But, Princess..."
I shall do all I can.
With my life alone!
You must not!
I cannot allow the Princess to die alone...
"I, too..."
"I shall accompany you, Princess!"
Yeah Sir?
"I am going to tease her, you beat me."
With hand or with leg?
With leg.
With left or with right leg?
Whatever just beat me!
Whatever just beat me!
"With both leg, or i will kill you i am going to tease her."
Coming?
My room or yours?
What?
"Hey listen, come!"
"Sorry, i am not that type of person."
Even i m not that type of women.
Don't you have brother or father?
"Why you are showing attitude, see its off season, i will give you 50°/° off."
The girl is teasing Papa.
Come...
someone help!
Come... someone help!
Okay whatever you say i will do.
"Okay whatever you will give me, i will take it."
You don't have manners you are teasing the person who is like your mother?
No... no...
he is not teasing me... beat me hard.
What are you doing he is my customer.
"Why you are not beating me, ., come-on do it."
"Leave him, he is my customer."
Why you are beating him?
He was teasing a women.
Women?
He was teasing a women!
House owners fear you would sue them.
"- Since you approached me, I'll try."
You have a bike?
- Yes
- Can you take me on it?
- Do you ride well?
- Yes
-Then get your bike.
Too tall.
Only Anushka can ride on this.
It is this house on the left.
Stop.
My back aches.
-This is the 11th house I am showing you.
Please somehow arrange this house for me.
I should say that.
If you don't like this then I must arrange a film set at AVM.
- OK
The house owner is sharp.
Keep your voice down.
This is the best house in the area.
"The house owner has let you use the plants, old newspaper, bucket and everything."
We can fix this if it satisfies you.
The rooms are all very spacious.
But I don't need such big rooms.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent and an advance of 10 months."
Oh!
"I can't afford 20,000."
Ask if he can reduce the rent.
- No its impossible.
- I told you already that he is sharp.
You just don't like him.
The guy...
Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
"Hey, you don't look so good."
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
Jackson!
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"""Passengers arrived at the hospital doa."
The estimated time of death...
"9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."""
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
I think it's not a good idea.
-What do you mean?
-Maybe I call you.
But I don't think so.
-You didn't like it?
-I like it very much.
"But, Tony, come on."
"You're a nice guy, but I got my own problems."
I don't want all the time prop you up.
"What, are you fucking kidding me?"
-What you doing?
-I didn't expect you so soon.
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.
Lowe is not a 98-99 mile an hour guy.
Driven out to deep left field!
"Giving chase is Henderson, on the run!"
See ya!
An opposite-field home run....
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
Have a bite.
"Look out, here he comes!"
Where's Furio?
"He couldn't get a flight out of Rome, so I'm driving again today."
"Come on in, he'II be right down."
That was the only thing that I could do.
I hoped days like that would arrive and continue on forever.
"So, I wasted away that young life."
It was a regrettable ending.
And so...
"You are saying that the grudge that the woman had possessed the cat, and turned it into a Bake Neko?"
What the...
Old master...
I guess she couldn't allow anyone from this house to get married.
Which means that woman's grudge is beyond redemption.
It is your turn to talk!
Your turn!
Who are you referring to?
I only did what I was told.
It's not my fault!
It's not my fault!
I was just used by you!
I was just following orders!
"I couldn't rebel against it, even though it was something bad!"
It's cruel!
"Cruel, cruel, cruel!"
It's too cruel!
Odajima-sama!
What is still missing?
Old master!
Sato-san!
Answer me!
"It's not my fault, it's not my fault."
"It's not my fault, it's not my fault."
Sato-san!
Sato-san!
Sato-san!
Otherwise it's impossible.
I won't use it.
You can trust me.
Would you trust someone like you?
You have my word.
Can he sleep at night?
Your partner.
I remembered.
He was in the Social-Political Brigade.
"You know, Franco's Gestapo."
He killed a girl at a protest in Vallecas in '71.
Shot her twice.
He's aged badly.
And I'm glad.
Hello.
How are you?
That's Marina.
She and my daughters were close friends.
Quini took her to the hunting lodge the other day.
"After they were together he asked her not to get dressed, and he tied her to the bed."
Then he left the room and came back with another man.
Who was he?
She didn't see his face.
"All she knows is he smelled good, like expensive cologne."
And that he had very soft hands.
He took photographs of her.
"Quini threatened to show them to everyone in town, if she told anyone."
The night my daughters were killed...
"Marina was with Quini, but not the whole night."
Do you think she'd be able to tell a judge?
She couldn't even tell you.
I have to go.
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?
(LAUGHING MANICALLY)
Stop that.
What a regrettably large head you have.
I should very much like to hat it.
-Hat it?
-Yes.
"I used to hat the White Queen, you know."
"Wasn't very much to work with, poor dear."
Her head is so small.
It's tiny.
It's a pimple of a head.
But this...
"What I could do with this monument, this orb..."
"Nay, this magnificently heroic globe."
What could you do?
"Unbind him, Stayne."
How can he work if his hands are bound?
"Well, then, shall it be a bonnet or a boater?"
Or something for the boudoir?
"Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif, snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke, cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter, billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau, bongrace, fan-tail, night cap, Garibaldi, fez..."
Hatter.
Fez?
Leave us.
The trees seem sad.
-Have you been speaking with them?
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
Perhaps a bit more kindly.
Would you all excuse me for a moment?
Thank you.
"-What news, Bayard?"
Dinner.
Candlelight.
And a promise that you will try to get to second base.
Done.
"You're meeting with Carol Finnerty, deputy special agent in charge of the president's Secret Service."
- I need a favour.
- This is a favour.
I need another favour.
I need a pass for my daughter.
- John--
- You don't understand.
"She's a freak for this kind of stuff, so if I get her in, I'm Dad of the Year."
I will owe you so much more than just candlelight dinner.
- I'll make a call.
- Perfect.
Thank you.
You're the best.
--A truly historic handshake.
What President Sawyer is proposing to Iranian president Al-Sharif is withdrawing all American troops across the entire Middle East and for that he'll ask his G8 partners for help.
"It's all about money, and who won't like this deal are American companies who do business with the American military."
Wanna grab the door?
Em.
I'll get it.
- Hey.
- You're late.
- She thought you weren't coming.
- Why wouldn't I be coming?
"Hey, you, little face."
"Come on, get your stuff."
"Let's go, baby."
"- Bye, Mommy."
I love you.
I rang you.
A lot of people ring me.
A lot of people ring me.
About buying a gun.
About buying a gun.
"Now, what do you want a gun for, Scottie?"
"Now, what do you want a gun for, Scottie?"
There's this bloke...
There's this bloke...
"Don't go around telling everybody, you nitwit."
"Don't go around telling everybody, you nitwit."
Just give me the cash.
Just give me the cash.
Oi!
Oi!
"Let's hit the park, sweetheart."
Happy?
"Let's hit the park, sweetheart."
Happy?
Lenny...show me how to use it.
Lenny...show me how to use it.
"Point and shoot, Scottie."
Point and shoot.
"Point and shoot, Scottie."
Point and shoot.

"Whenever Terry Clark brought merchandise into the country,"
It wasn't fulfilling.
It wasn't fulfilling?
Ha-ha-ha.
It wasn't fulfilling.
It wasn't anything!
"We don't want any violence in here, do we?"
"Go ahead, kill me."
I don't care.
It must be from a factory... or someplace where the fire is burning quantities of oil.
That direction... that would be the factory owned by Mac Bain!
Mac Bain?
Do you mean the famous aeronautical engineer?
"If I remember right, he's the favorite to win the world aircraft championship."
A race that will be held in Holland sometime soon.
My late husband really admired him.
"Oh, I do hope everything's all right."
Well then.
Why don't we have a look?
How terrible!
Where is Mac?
Is Helen safe?
"Ma'am, it's too dangerous!"
Stay back!
Stay back!
We are acquaintances of Mac.
I am Sherlock Holmes.
"Pardon me, sir."
"Please stay here, Mrs. Hudson."
Mac!
Helen!
Let me see...
How could this have happened in an empty factory?
"You had to throw it out, didn't you?"
"Of all the junk in here, you had to throw out the one cask of wine to be shot to pieces?"
Well done.
"""Easy missions, well earned"", Porthos."
(WHINNYING)
(GRUNTS)
ATHOS:
Cadets!
Time to go!
Grimaud certainly left his mark on you.
"Getting caught unarmed and unawares, doesn't sound like you?"
A mistake I will not make again.
We ride hard.
(CADETS URGING HORSE)
It's eight hours until dark and what is it?
Four shot balls left.
"Eight hours, four shot balls, not the most encouraging number."
"Besides, they're not going to let us live until dark."
- (GUNSHOT)
- That would just be stupid.
(GUNSHOTS)
D'Artagnan!
- (GUNSHOT) - (MAN GROANS)
Come on.
Come on.
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)
The last thing they're expecting is for one of us to go out that door.
(LAUGHS)
Because that would be suicide.
Cover me.
(GRUNTING)
PORTHOS:
Who's here to avoid it?
Step this way!
Aren't you...?
I have the safest way for you to avoid it!
"If I knew it could be avoided, I'd do it too."
It's already my 8th child!
"Better late than never, why not start now!"
Please come with me!
What a bunch of fools!
You couldn't even get those 2 jerks.
How can you be the Commissioner of Police?
How can you be the Sick Man of Asia?
"Your Excellency, cool down!"
I know the place of exchange:
Cafe Casablanca.
- You recognize me?
- No!
Really?
I don't know your kind of person!
Lucky me!
"I'm not in a good mood, just get lost!"
You think you can get away by not looking at me.
"You can tell from my voice I'm the Commissioner, scram!"
Upstart.
Nearly wouldn't give up his place!
Has Yoyo been today?
Damn...
Canton was defeated!
"""Long live China and our great national heroes."""
"""Long live China and our dauntless armies."""
"""Brothers never give in!"""
"""Yet yourselves ready, brothers, to fight on the front line!"""
I always know who you are.
It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
Take the pills.
You leave me alone with that fucking albino.
He doesn't listen to me.
I know a damn speciation when I see one.
A what?
a young one.
There are forces trying to kill them.
Forces?
They want help.
forces.
It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.
they want you.
that's how fucking stupid they are.
They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty. a long time.
There are no new mutants.
Understand?
Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years.
Not anywhere.
You always thought we were part of God's plan.
But maybe...
Maybe we were God's mistake.
What a disappointment you are.
When I found you you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.
Hooked on barbiturates.
You were an animal.
But we took you in.
I gave you a family.
And they're gone now.
Logan.
"Well, it depends on the size of the bottle and the size of the ship, to be honest."
"The way you have to, you have to force the ship through,"
SHIP through.
Can I use the toilet?
"That's probably not a question for me, right?"
"He's speaking to you, right?"
So...
Of course you can.
I can put shit in a bottle.
"Dermot, what the hell are you doing?"
!
"What do you mean, Dermot?"
!
What?
What's going on here?
!
"Sister, one second."
"Elsie, what are you talking about, don't blow cover yet."
It's time to blow cover.
"You've almost ruined it, you just fell asleep by eating one of those fucking chocolates, you idiot!"
I couldn't help it.
"Do you stand up, or are you going to sit down?"
I'll stand up.
"OK, ready?"
Let's blow this case wide open.
I've lost all control of my body.
"I'm so sorry, Elsie's had a..."
"It's all right, like, why is she calling you Dermot, right?"
"Well, what happened, she's, like I say, she's not..."
"Well, I'm no woman!"
What?
"I'm DI Sleet, from..."
"Come on, its my turn."
Please?
Just keep it legal.
"Wait, you sure your parents wont come home?"
They could.
"But, this isn't their Jacuzzi."
Brooke... whose house is this?
I don't know!
Does it matter?
Here you go.
"Wow, for the diet special that looks pretty damn tasty."
Oh!
Sorry.
"Things have worked out pretty well, huh?"
"Karen's café gets to stay open, and I get to see a little more of my sister-in-law."
"So, how are you doing with things?"
"Uh, we had our first counseling session yesterday."
Dan and counseling.
It's kind of like Hannibal Lector at a salad bar.
"Well, if you think it would help, I'd be happy to talk to Nathan."
I think he'd like that.
"I know you like my women, Keith, but come on!"
Deb's still my wife.
Won't be for long if you keep this up.
I'm taking Nathan to dinner tonight.
Do you have a problem with that?
- Yeah.
He needs a break from you.
- You can't stop me from seeing my own son.
"Oh, actually I can."
"By telling you nicely, or calling a lawyer."
Your choice.
I can't believe I chickened out.
It's okay B.
This is the beginning of something new.
Now we can all move on.
The possibilities are endless after all.
Yes.
To great things.
And so what if i'm not going to yale?
you were recently incarcerated
And I'm afraid to talk to Chuck because he might hurt me again.
This is our moment.
Nobody can take that from us.
I urge you to go out into the world
And show them who you have become.
Not so fast.
You're not graduating until I give you my diplomas.
Mine are labels and labels stick.
Nate Archibald-- class whore.
Dan Humphrey-- the ultimate insider.
Chuck Bass--coward.
Blair Waldorf--weakling.
And as for Serena Van der Woodsen
After today you are officially irrelevant.
- O.M.G.
- I know.
Congratulations everyone.
You deserve it.
Now please join me in welcoming the class of 2009.
Class please stand.
You were right B.
Nobody can take this day away from us.
Gossip girl is going down.
"No need for such pessimism, Hugues."
Thing's aren't rosy.
"But it's the right decision, Jeanne, and I'm sorry."
"Jean-Pierre, we know this should have happened a year ago, and I myself..."
You what?
I've a plan to make the redundancies go smoothly.
May I know who's leaving?
I can't tell you yet.
It's not yet official.
Is that all?
Oh!
Wait!
There.
"You have a good team, it seems."
"- So, that's it?"
- Yes.
- Do you know who's going?
- They wouldn't say.
"It's not official, right?"
"Don't worry, we'll fight."
I'm not worried.
I must tell you...
"I couldn't say with Maillet there, but you're on the list."
- Me?
- Yes.
"I'm really sorry, believe me."
But you're probably the luckiest.
Or rather...
The least unlucky.
"Given your age and the relocation rules, you'll be able to take early retirement, and get your leaving bonus, of course."
You're relocating...
"It's a chance for you, Jeanne."
"The soldiers met Snow White, is that right?"
"Yes, they met Snow White..."
"No, you are fooling me!"
Smart you!
"So, where did you stop?"
Why should I answer your question?
"Right, I don't know why you want to answer me!"
What a shame!
"Chan Mon-gut, you've gone too far!"
Wipe your sweat first!
I think you haven't had good sleep lately.
Does Ho Chun visit you every night?
Your Honour!
"Let's go back to our topic, what did you do that night?"
"I told you, I read at home."
"No, I don't mean the night Chun was killed."
I mean the night before he was killed.
"Before killing him, I went..."
Yes!
You're finished!
"Your Honour, I request to reach the final address."
Damn you!
Tell us what you did on the night before Chun's death.
Police.
No!
I mean Chan Mon-gut.
What's the matter?
The defence counsel's personal point of view is really amazing!
But according to the legal procedure...
Come on!
Why are you so stubborn?
You're charged with contempt of court.
Very well.
Striking a superior is a court-martial offence.
Corporal Dawes says that he started it.
"So, I want to find out what really happened."
You go back under close arrest.
"Private McKendrick, about turn!"
"Private McKendrick, about turn!"
"Give me his service record, Sergeant Major."
"Yes, Sir."
"Angry man, that one."
"Some get that out of them, Sir."
Anger's good sometimes in a fighting soldier.
Properly directed.
Are you suggesting that he be given special treatment?
"On the contrary, Sergeant Major."
Let me see now.
Enlisted Montreal.
Place of birth...
Los Angeles.
"Anything else, Sir?"
College two years.
"Profession, just says ""aircraft industry"", that's all."
"Any previous military experience, Sir?"
None listed.
"Pretty vague, huh?"
I suppose when you're short of men you don't ask questions.
Ask the security boys to run a special check on him.
"Yes, Sir."
He interests me.
"Hi, there."
"No prison pallor, I see."
"What's this, Ladies Rehabilitation Society?"
in her job description?
Their job is to follow instructions.
So is yours.
You knew that I couldn't let this go.
"as it turns out, I was right."
I apologize for doubting you.
Oh.
"Well, thank--thank-- we're--we're all human."
As far as I know.
You know that this was only Macpherson's first move.
And he's planning something... bigger.
Any guesses what his plan might be?
No.
I don't know.
I don't want to wait to find out.
You know what the Talmud says?
"""If someone's coming to kill you, get up early, kill them first."""
"It also says ""don't rush into any unnecessary danger."
"A miracle may not save you."""
Previously on Warehouse 13...
So you know it's MacPherson.
- I'm right.
"- Yes, I'm afraid you are."
And he now has a sword which renders him invisible.
Now it's up to you to stop him.
You always hurt the one you love.
"Okay, just stop."
"Okay, stop and think this through."
Guess what.
I'm still taking the artifact.
"I can't let you do that, Pete."
What ever happened to that Amazon he used to go around with?
That Felice...
Felice something?
She was mad about him.
He wants to marry me.
"It would even things up, wouldn't it?"
We'd both be married.
It would make things so much fairer from now on.
-From now on?
-When we run into each other.
We won't.
"We know the same people, we go to the same places."
"-It would be difficult not to, wouldn't it?"
-Not at all.
"But what possible harm could there be in our having a drink now and then, or lunch?"
A great deal of harm.
"All right, Bran."
I'm sorry.
I just thought it might be fun.
"And remember, Isabel, there will be no telephone calls in the middle of the night, no mysterious telegrams, nothing."
We're not gonna have any trouble.
"I'll do exactly what you want, Bran."
Exactly what you want.
Oh.
"Oh, Alec."
"I just ran into Brandon Bourne, an old friend."
"Hello, Bourne, I've heard a great deal about you."
Get me a cab!
"Quick, get me a cab!"
Rosa.
How do you feel?
Baffled.
You're not as important as this body.
When he said he was busy everyday...
I guess he had time to exercise.
"Then...when he said he was too busy, and didn't have the time,"
I wonder if it was all an excuse?
I wonder if he just didn't want to see me?
"What do you mean, he didn't want to see you?"
Even on that day...
He was on his way to see you.
That's right!
You said he even had something to tell you when he saw you!
The thing he was going to tell me when he saw me...
You think it was to tell me that he loved me?
What if it's not?
Gil Da Ran...
I love you.
Like this!
I'm sure he was going to say this to you.
Yeah...
I'm sure you're right.
"I'm sure that's it, right?"
That's it...
And here I am on my own...
How stupid I am.
"Yeah, yeah..."
That's stupid.
Let's pack up some clothes.
This color looks really good on Yoon Jae.
This color looks really good too!
Wow...
This color suits really well too...
Here.
I'm sorry.
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay.
Come.
"Dr. lemelle, allow me to introduce miss Porter, our new patient."
Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
It was the noise.
It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
Poor thing.
Perhaps.
"But I cannot Sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
No.
"Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
Thank you.
Safe and sound.
Do not wander the halls in a place like this.
Yes?
Yes.
"Good night, miss Porter."
Scream and I will slit your throat!
Please don't hurt me.
We need to build!
"Saying, but I didn't know you Were trying to go down a cliff."
I can't go that way.
This is the farthest you've Ever taken us out of nome.
This is the biggest gold We're going after.
Lookit.
"Everybody needs to get Their panties on, and let's go."
We got 'em on.
"If it's one of your games, I want it to stop."
Stop being paranoid.
You don't have to be poor to have good intentions.
There are people with money and ideals.
- Really?
I'd like to meet one.
"- Hello, Jacob."
Give me a break.
You never had any ideals.
I could be rude about your ideals and we could go on and on.
- We could go on being rude...
- Then tell me what he wants.
He doesn't care about the orphanage or humanitarian work.
It's bad business.
What does he want?
I don't know what he wants to do with the orphanage and Anna.
"I don't understand it, Jacob."
Then let me ask you a different way:
Do you know something I don't?
"No, Jacob, I know nothing."
That's all I wanted to know.
- May I offer you a cup of coffee?
- No thanks.
- Dare I offer you a glass of wine?
- Only if you've got enough.
Right.
Dare I ask how you've been?
The last twenty years?
They've been a bit up and down.
And you?
I've been fine.
Also a bit hectic.
But there are some things left just as they were at that time.
The angels all look as if they are crying.
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.
portugal.
These are monuments... sent from different countries of the world.
CzechosIovakia.
italy.
poland.
bulgaria.
The Soviet Union.
China.
brazil.
Cuba.
holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water."" AII died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
people are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
What's the matter now?
I think Grandma would Iike it not too spicy.
May I start eating?
This is called a rock.
Rock.
Good.
That is a tree.
Rock.
Tree.
Get it?
That's right!
My own giant robot.
I am now the luckiest kid in America!
This is unbelievable.
"This is the greatest discovery since, I don't know, television or something."
I gotta tell someone.
"I should caII-- No, they'II panic."
people wig out and shoot at something big like you.
Wig out.
It means crazy.
"You know, Iike... ."
"No, no!"
Don't do that!
That's the stuff that makes them shoot at you.
"Two nights ago, at approximately 1 ,900 hours, sat com radar..."
... detectedanunidentifiedobject entering Earth's atmosphere...
... losingcontactwithit2 1/ 2 miles off the coast of RockweII.
Some assumed it was a meteor or a downed satellite.
But Washington received a call from someone...
... whoreportedan actualencounter with the object.
"This is no meteor, gentlemen."
This is something much more serious.
We can't call Ripley's Believe It Or Not because they wouldn't believe it.
And... .
It's getting dark.
"Hi, Mrs. Donovan."
Yeah.
"Okay, well, we're gonna be late."
- So let's just get going.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk, he shuts me down."
- Think he's trying to find Katherine?
- I don't know.
He waited 145 years only to find out that Katherine could not care less.
"And it's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
- You have every reason to be upset.
- Mm-hm.
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?
"Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my ancestor, Katherine who screwed over your brother?"
Nah.
I haven't thought about it at all.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
It'd be nice if we could get through a day without having to deal with it.
No vampire mother or brother...
No vampires at all?
No vampires but you.
I just wanna get us back to normal stuff like school and homework.
Fun.
"Ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?"
We can watch a movie at my place.
Correct.
"Rosslare,"
"Republic of Ireland,"
"Fishguard in Wales, very well done."
I actually have taken that route on a ferry before.
You've taken that route on a ferry before?
That was so easy for you!
"Right, OK, Lutrophiles, over to you."
Find...
Reveal the hive.
"Kissinger, Nixon..."
Can you see Clinton and Albright?
Clinton and Albright?
Clinton...
"Actually, no, have we got two Ls to get it?"
Is Albright there?
Yes.
"Very good, for three points, your answers?"
Albright and Clinton.
Let's see if you're right.
"Wow, Albright and Clinton."
"Marianne, you were right on that."
I was hoping it was going to be that before it came up.
I don't know why.
Those were the first two that came into your mind?
So obviously Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright was his Secretary of State in his second term.
Do you know what she famously said about women who don't help other women?
"""There are is a special place in hell for women who don't help"
"""other women."""
What a gal!
"Right, so where are we at the end of that round?"
"Lutrophiles, very good with 15,"
First of June.
"Xiaotian, will be graduated."
Don't catch a cold!
"Drink it, chicken soup."
Drink all of it!
I'm sorry!
This is all my fault!
It's all because of me!
Why do you cry again?
"Except cry, what else can I do?"
It's for you.
- For me?
"- Your 18th birthday gift, one week ahead."
"I'm afraid to see you cry, and I can't leave you."
"So I wrote this letter,"
I have to give up myself.
Please forgive me if I often lied to you.
Forgive my cruelty to have your baby aborted!
It's because I don't want you live in agony and remorse of youself.
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
"I knew that all these years, you have been treating me just like your brother."
I can never replace the position of Xiaotian... in your mind.
"However, I'm still willing to do anything for you!"
Willing to be there whenever you need me!
Willing to be someone most you trusted!
"So, Yawang."
"Don't say sorry for me, because..."
I love you!
"Judge,"
I have to accuse Qu Weiran of rape.
The Baroness is served.
Take the princess' arm.
I will follow you.
What a beautiful couple you would make.
Come in.
"Madam, Mr Barbey and another gentleman are here."
They ask if you can receive them in spite of the late hour.
Of course.
I'm coming.
- You will excuse me.
- You're welcome.
"Let me introduce you to Mr Nanteuil, my new partner."
"Good evening, Mr."
Madam.
"Excuse my tardiness, Baroness, please."
Mr Nanteuil is a French Canadian.
"With the capitals he brought, my bank, our bank, is now the first private bank in Paris."
"I am very happy for you, Mr Barbey."
You will therefore find it easier to give me the money I asked.
"Unfortunately, no."
It is no longer the same operation.
"I do not know how to say this, but you are completely ruined."
This is the sad language of numbers.
But it is not possible.
"Your hotel, your cars,"
your home...
- But...
- You must leave everything.
Which Baroness?
"De Vibray, Mr Commissioner."
"His patron of the arts, somehow."
Ah!
It's a text from my Agent.
Entertainment weekly and in style magazine... both want me.
"Oh, and, and also, the flett-giordano syndrome foundation... want to come and meet with me here."
"Oh, well, this will just legitimize the hell out of it."
What kind of disease is it?
I-I don't know.
Elka?
"You know, I'm, I'm happy to lie to win, but I-I don't wanna lose my hair or anything."
- The only symptom is fatigue.
- That's perfect.
"I mean, I can play tired in my sleep."
"Ah, luckily, this disease hasn't affected my wit."
"Oh, that's will."
My baby's here.
"Hi, honey!"
"- Hi, just a sec."
- Okay.
It's good to see you.
"- Good to see you, sweetie."
- Yeah.
The facial hair makes you look a little...
"Foreign, but cute."
Come on in.
You know joy and Victoria.
- Both:
"Hey, will."
- Hi.
"Ah, this is Elka Ostrovsky."
"Nice to meet you, will."
Nice to meet you too.
"Well, your mom picks up and moves to Cleveland."
You must have a million questions.
"Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig."
You think I'm ugly?
"Look, I'm sorry about yesterday."
"I didn't mean it, okay?"
I'm not ugly.
You're ugly.
I'm not talking about it anymore.
I already told the cops and the doctors.
No one believes me.
They think I'm crazy.
"Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most."
"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
When I --
"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head, but I couldn't control my body."
"I could see what I was doing, but I couldn't stop."
I just wanted to stop.
I'm sorry.
You don't need to apologize.
"April, some of the kids at school told the police that you and Taylor didn't get along."
"Well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her."
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
Just a couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you... happen to smell anything?"
Anything... like what?
Like rotten eggs or...
sulphur?
"Um, no."
Okay.
"I've had enough of the Cold War when we did... the ""Doctor Jivago"" shoot."
"You got the chicken, too?"
So good.
But I got the pieard.
I don't like playing with bones.
I'd bite my tongue on that one.
"You are so great, Richard."
I'm so glad you work at Skirt.
Some of the people there are so snobby.
The irony is they were all from trailer parks and they're all on the mate.
I was on the fashion closet and I heard Olivier and Resin talking...
- what is it with Paul?
- The duke?
What the hell is that?
Is he royalty or something?
Prince Chuck is his cousin or something.
"You'd never know, huh?"
Why do you think Resin is going out with him?
Do you think she'd be attracted to some guy in the art department?
But he's really cute... and funny... and smart...
Is it an arrow in your ass from Cupid Squivert?
- Yeah.
- But it's hopeless.
Why do you say that?
Things could work out.
- You never know a man's heart.
"- Yes, I do."
He already told me.
"He thinks of me as a ""great friend""."
The kiss of death!
But then on the other day he bought me fries.
He did?
Thank you.
I'll drive up to Joe's Cabins.
I'll take a look at the junction.
"Yeah, I-I'm Reed."
Latham Reed.
"But you might as well know now, Mr. Mason, I-"
- I just can't remember.
What can't you remember?
"Here, sit up."
Nothing.
"From that moment yesterday afternoon when Somers offered me a highball and I said no, make mine lemonade."
Thought it tasted funny - for lemonade.
Used to be an alcoholic.
For three years I didn't touch a drop.
Didn't even smell a cork.
I'll kill that Somers.
Someone already has killed him.
Yeah.
Edie told me.
First good news I've had since she brought me to.
Where did she find you?
Mmm.
You'll have to ask her that when she comes back with more coffee.
"You took a certified check yesterday, isn't that right?"
"A check for $50,000?"
A check that Somers asked you to deliver and endorse over to a hospital fund?
How should I know?
"When she found me, she said that I had $7,000 in $500 bills."
- Now-- - [door opens]
Now what?
"I couldn't spot her, Perry."
"No sign of Axel, either."
- I shall call the police.
"- No, cos your part's over."
The end of your scene.
Back to the dole for you.
"Five lines, thank you and good night."
"Well, I must say, this looks very interesting."
"She's crying, you know."
"That, Eddie, is the biz."
It's a tough life.
"It's a tough life, dearie."
"I mean, look at Arthur Mullard."
She used to be quite attractive.
- I still quite fancy her.
"- Yeah, hur-uhh."
"Well, I must say."
This is very interesting.
Must learn to read sometime.
Right.
Sod all this health food.
"When I eat, I like to dice with a heart attack."
Let's have a good English roast and a coronary thrombosis.
- Right.
Let's make a shopping list.
- Yeah.
Four hundred pounds of oven chips.
"Right, that seems simple enough."
Better check the larder.
"Waste not, want not."
- Remember the poor children.
"- Oh, the little poor children."
Yes.
With their cosy little terrace dwellings.
"With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey... in 22 minutes."
Wow.
That is impressive.
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.
That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
"Retool what, now?"
I'm the new Vice President of east-coast television and microwave-oven programming.
That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
I like you.
You have the boldness of a much-younger woman.
"Lee, does my face look bloated to you?"
"When I played that lady rapist on ""Law  Order,"""
guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out.
Hemorrhoid cream.
[Laughs]
"Miss Maroney, I have the cat wrangler here for you."
"Oh, is it that horrible little..."
Hi.
Hey.
Greta Johanssen...
short for Lugreta.
Hi.
Great to see you again.
You too.
I'm here to introduce you to the feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Poppo.
And this here is Captain Boots.
Hello.
Would you describe yourself as cat-competent?
"Oh, yes."
"... andlaughs,causingevery seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn..."
... andwatchme slinkback to the geek table...
... witha growingwetspot on the front of my chinos.
We ninth graders enjoyed it also.
"But you're not in junior high anymore, and you're not a--"
You're not in junior high anymore.
-lt's time to let go of those fears.
-l don't know.
"Oh, come on, Alan."
"For once in your life, don't settle."
Go for what you really want.
You know what?
You're right.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Hold on.
Let's clean some of that discharge.
"You wanna say ""l'm confident,"" not ""l'm infectious. """
There.
Go get her.
"Hey, you see that guy over there?"
Twenty bucks says he wets himself.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Alan?
-l remember.
"Look, I needed to come clean about something."
I wasn't actually in a bar fight.
I took a piece of whole-wheat toast to the eye.
"I mean, it was cut diagonally and toasted well..."
... soitwasessentiallyshrapnel.
Did some real damage.
I see.
(girl grunting)
She's tethered!
Someone is hiding her here.
"Travis most likely, sir."
Alright.
You must have stumbled upon her lair.
You approached her.
"She felt threatened, so she attacked you."
Should I bring her back to the cells?
"No, no."
The Toronto Asylum under Dr. Ogden's care will be best.
Right.
"Do you think she's the killer, sir?"
Certainly seems capable of it.
I'd have to agree.
Alright.
(Fen grunting)
"Fen, I'm going to put you to sleep for a little while."
(indistinct chatter)
(Dr. Ogden exhales.)
My goodness!
Hard to believe it's the same girl.
Her persona was very much exaggerated.
Her hair and body unwashed...
That's quite a scar.
Yes.
From an animal attack some years ago.
Mr. Travis claims that she was mauled by a wolf.
"It's quite possible, William."
Her teeth have been deliberately filed down into points.
I took an impression.
It matches our victim's bite mark.
Thanks.
Bye.
What's up this evening?
- It's Friday.
- Aren't you going home?
- Don't you have to go North?
- It's already Friday?
Then I'II see you on Monday.
silvia?
Surprise!
"Hi, little guy."
- See?
There's ciaparatt.
- Who's ciaparatt?
"We invited a few friends, Iet's go."
tell us about the hell you're going through down there.
"Just looking at them, they seem normal, but in reality they're dark, stocky."
No one's in the office in the mornings.
"About 11:30 they show up, at 2 off to the beach."
"With that heat, no one wants to work."
Do the women wearG-strings undertheirbIack dresses?
- And hygiene?
- They're dirty.
There was the start of a cholera epidemic!
It's endemic there.
Tomorrow I'm taking you and Chicco forvaccinations.
"I've already had them, the Red Cross came, you don't fool with cholera."
I worked in the South and I have wonderful memories.
I fell forit!
"My dearbrothers, I've brought you a small gift."
"The ""big tit"" of BattipagIia."
That's five kilos.
Yeah?
Let's just hope this lady coming up the stairs now feels the same way about that as you do.
I felt good about this guy as soon as I saw him.
LISA:
"Me, too."
( knock on door )
Answer it.
Come on.
"Out of the way, Dr Penzler."
Let me see her.
Are you the one who asked for the FBI?
( scoffs ) Yeah.
I'm here.
You can talk to me.
Did anyone tell you what this was all about?
Man in therapist's office holding ten hostages demands FBI agent.
I asked for someone from the FBI extraterrestrial project.
Someone who knows about aliens.
"You mean, like on X-Fiies?"
I'm the one you want.
RAY:
Okay.
Let me bring you up to speed on our situation here.
I shot him.
And he's gonna die if he doesn't get medical attention.
That's one.
"After that, if I don't get what I ask for, these people, they're just fish in a barrel to me, you understand that?"
"That was the lady in the park, the one who tried to grab me."
RAY:
You understand?
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to go public.
Open up!
- Where is he?
- Calm down.
- Wes!
Get down here.
"- Hollis, he's asleep."
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- You think this was my idea?
CPS just dumped him on me.
- And you need to start getting your shit together.
I can't keep playing babysitter for you.
- I can take care of my boys.
"- I'm just taking Wes for a little while, that's all."
- I can take care of my kids.
- Really?
Can you?
"Rebecca would be so heartbroken, and you know it."
She loved those boys way too much to see you abandon them the way you did.
- You told them?
That's what this is about?
You told that caseworker?
- Back up.
"Back up, Hollis."
I didn't say a damn word.
Just calm down.
- ♪ Tearing out of a violent mind ♪
♪ It's these evil ways that will change our times ♪
♪ Militance to opposing thought ♪
♪ Weapons breaking through ♪
- What did they say?
- Go to bed.
- When's he coming back?
But it's pretty!
This for a party?
Mi?
"ka, you won't look good in this."
How can you say that?
I've got something to go with it...
A different material!
"I wanted to, but there wasn't anything."
Hardly anything at all.
But this is nice!
Then I'll hurry...
And now this.
So how do you want it?
"I don't know, you can advise us."
One meter twenty.
How much did they give me?
"One meter twenty, but double width."
- That's enough for the whole dress!
- From this?
She'll have one more dress.
Isn't it some mistake?
Good evening.
What can I bring you?
Good evening.
Looks nice here.
"Good wine and good prices, if only we had hard currency to pay for it."
We've only got ordinary crowns.
Bring us some good cheap wine.
"Two Martells, please."
And seven decilitres of wine.
Just a moment. I must know what it will cost.
"Grenadine for my daughter, please."
Yoon Jae...
You came...?
Surprise!
Why did you come here?
!
What were you thinking coming here?
!
I came here to see you and some lady just suddenly appeared!
'Guess what was inside the dumplings?
'
"'Wriggly, wriggle..."
Ah!
You guessed it!
'
She said that and just dragged me inside.
I'm about to go crazy!
You're lucky that I was able to figure out the situation so quickly.
"What would you have done if I said, 'Lady, who are you?"
'
"Since I was good enough to greet them all, you take care of the rest on your own."
Bye.
Where do you think you're going?
!
"If you started out as Yoon Jae, you have to finish it out as Yoon Jae before you leave."
Okay?
What?
Seeing how he came all the way here...
I guess the wedding isn't off.
He said he was like that because he's been unwell since being in a car accident.
We misunderstood over nothing when he was sick from the accident.
"Talk it over with Yoon Jae over a spicy dumpling stew and a drink, then let it go."
Choong Sik...
You saw your sister naked in the shower?
Sort of.
I was hiding in the laundry basket.
"Hey, Stacey."
"Hi, Brad."
I saw you in the drug store yesterday.
You were buying Juicy Fruit gum.
Are you going to the dance Saturday?
"It's a '50s sock hop, you know."
I'm thinking of going to the dance.
"Can I wear your jacket today, Brad?"
"Oh, come on, what do you want for it?"
I want to take you to the closet...
No way!
You are so bad.
What'd you say to her?
I told her what I wanted.
I don't think she's that kind of girl.
"She's a girl, Frank."
All girls are that kind of girl.
She didn't used to be a girl.
"Hey, guys."
What are we looking at?
What's that?
I think it's an elbow.
What's it doing with that other elbow?
Doesn't look like anything
"I ever want to do, that's for sure."
Will you stop cleaning?
Why do you do that?
My dad demands complete order and sanitation.
"I know a place where the girls are naked all the time, where guys can see naked girls all they want, 24 hours a day for anyone with guts and a hundred bucks."
"I'm pretty sure you didn't give it to me the other night, Joe."
"You're right, but that's only because at the time"
"I didn't want to burden you with what was only a gut feeling, with fortunately turned out to be wrong."
You thought she was dead?
I did.
But I have confirmation that is not the case.
So where is she?
When's she coming home?
I don't know.
And she's not.
At least not anytime soon.
The word is that Doris is active again.
That's all I got.
Everything else is classified.
It's classified.
Wow.
Mm.
I want you to please keep looking for her.
"You shake the trees and you find her, okay?"
"Steve, your mom stayed hidden for 20 years."
She is not gonna be found.
She'll surface when she's ready.
Yeah.
When do you think that's gonna be?
I think that'll be when she's prepared to face you.
Hey.
How you holding up?
"I'm, uh..."
I'm a mess.
"You know, I just keep telling myself"
I did everything I could to save him.
"No, Catherine."
"Mmm, yummers."
"He reminds me of Scotty on ""General Hospital."""
"No, ew, Jenna, do not like that man."
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
[Exhales sharply]
Excuse me.
Hi.
What are you doing down here?
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
"Now, Afghanistan is a different situation."
[Indistinct conversations]
I'll have an apple juice.
"We don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a strict dress code at this place.
I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
They're very subtle.
"So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show, and I don't know how you feel about that..."
"Let me ask you a question, everybody at this table."
"Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me?"
"Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli."
Yo!
I'm buggin'.
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.
I need a lawyer!
I want my lawyer!
- Oh.
"- Don't shout, Richie."
It oscillates the atmos and rattles my phlegm.
- I've found you a lawyer.
- Oh.
Met him outside.
Known him for years.
Spurty.
"- Pervy Sir Peter Spurty, QC."
- Mm.
"Bit of luck him being here, really."
He'll get anyone off if you buy him a dirty mag.
Remember when the Tory cabinet were found in that brothel discussing declining moral values?
Clear as a bell.
Pervy Sir Peter Spurty got them off.
Right.
He's the man for us.
Bring us our lawyer!
We demand Pervy Sir Pete.
"- In there, Spurty."
"- Blimey, that was quick."
"Well done the police, say I."
Why do left-wingers keep sniping at them?
"If you don't wanna get beaten up, you shouldn't be poor."
"Richie, shut up."
"Watcha, Spurty."
"Me and my mate are in a bit of a fix and are gonna do five to ten in the slammer unless you can stitch the jury, rig the judge and buy off the pigs with a kickback."
Eddie.
"Please, please, please."
"This is England, Eddie."
"Sir, I didn't came to kill anyone, Sir my Boss Mr. Pipot... he told me to meet you, If you want you can ask to Mr. Pipot."
Give me the numbers of Pipots.
Fax number or Phone number?
Phones!
Landline or mobile?
"Mobiles, India or Singapore?"
Where is your Boss?
"He is in London,"
Then why did you say Singapore?
"I was afraid, Leave me, I'm giving you."
0044786679.
"It's ringing, It's ringing, He's will pick up."
"Sir, my boss is an educated man from Oxford University, I'm his special man"
He'll pick up.
"It's time difference, it's morning and he's busy in the mornings."
Hello!
Hello!
Sir!
It's Laxminarayan.
Who Laxmi?
"Sir, Laxminarayan, your Laxminarayan."
"You fool, have you done, Sir, there's a problem."
That's why I want to talk to you.
"Laxminarayan, you blood idiot, I don't want any excuses."
"I want results, you stupid, nonsense, you bloody ass hole call me when you finish your work."
"Otherwise I'll shoot you, Idiot."
I know you love me.
"I think it's disconnect, International Calls"
"Papa, I told you before, Kill him."
Thank you Papa!
Sir!
What you've done?
MAX:
"Oh, nonsense."
I also collected some crickets and caterpillars for our dining pleasure.
They're an excellent source of protein.
I grabbed what I could... before our ship burnt up.
"If we ration it, could last us a few days."
"Talk to me, what do we have?"
(sighs)
Mochi balls.
Love those.
And a bottle of ouzo.
Who's up for some sing-a-longs?
MAX:
That sounds delightful.
"Sorry, cuz."
"If I die first,"
I want you to eat me.
Nobody's gonna eat you.
"So what are you saying, I'm not good enough for you?"
Why wouldn't you eat me?
"Guys, over here!"
"Check it out,"
"Doctor, regular MacGyver."
"Actually, it's basic physics."
The lens focuses the light to generate enough heat to burn.
Now all we need to do is stoke the flame.
"I'll do you one better, brah."
Oh!
- Yeah!
Whoa.
It's always nice to have flammable material.
FLIPPA:
We promised.
I thought you were OK with that.
Yeah.
That was when the wolf seemed a long way away.
"Now, I mean this room feels half the size it normally does."
I know what you mean.
It was fun the last full moon.
Yeah...
"Out there, all of us together."
It was...
It was a rush.
It was...
It was right.
"I mean, it was right."
Outside in a pack is where we belong.
The only reason we transformed outside last time is because we ran out of time.
"Mum and Dad, they won't let that happen again."
They can't stop us if we don't let them.
"Rhydian, I won't go against them."
"So, for the rest of our lives we'll just spend the one night we should we running wild, locked up?"
Yeah.
"No, I mean, no."
No.
I can't think about the rest of my life right now.
OK.
I'm with you.
Whatever you decide.
We stay.
Fancy coming to the exhibition with me?
Come on!
Don't you find it interesting?
What?
What shall I tell him about Malcolm?
Just tell him!
It is 1969!
For frig's sake!
What it is...
That's not really a sentence.
Thank you for the photo.
No trouble.
"The other day, when I said I was going out with somebody,"
"I wasn't really, so, I don't know if you want to still go out with me."
"Well, I can't just decide on the spot."
I will have to think about it.
"No, of course."
Absolutely.
I've thought about it.
"Yes, I would and where shall we go?"
Oh.
You really want to?
You've no idea.
You have no idea.
Wow!
Crikey!
"I ordered sausage, egg and chips to cheer myself up."
I could send it back!
Could I hold your hand?
Yes.
Hang on!
Let's do this thing properly.
"So, none of my beeswax, but I am a man, so, obviously, a bit thick as regards these matters."
Were you going out with somebody or not?
"Well, I was seeing somebody."
"We didn't really go out, and I haven't actually told him yet."
The proof of the pudding is in the eating!
Five years ago misfortune struck me and I lost a child.
- But now you're already seven months pregnant.
- Just so!
This time I want to know for sure.
Doctors are just men and have no idea what goes on inside us.
Come on...
Bruno?
Why are you snooping around here?
"It smells so strange here, all the way out to the courtyard."
It's Lisol.
It smells healthy!
"No, it reeks..."
"like in hospital, as when mother had our baby."
Why are you mopping up here?
So that you have something to ask.
Here!
This is women's work.
Hah!
"Whenever you want something from me, I'm a lady to Mr Bruno!"
But when I want something from you...
What do you want from me?
Nothing at all!
It looks so different here.
I've fixed it up so I can sleep here.
Sleep?
Yes...
I'm not telling anyone...
"A real little room, something like that is what I've always wished for."
With a mirror...
"But to sleep here alone, Bruno..."
I would have been afraid to.
What's he doing now?
Elias ...
Mama would know.
Mama could see him.
She would know what he's doing.
"No, Elias."
Don't!
"Elias, don't!"
"Elias, do you hear me?"
Help!
"Oh Lord, watch over them."
with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
He sees you and loves you.
The Oracle's words stand as a warning.
A prophecy.
Sparta will fall.
All of Greece will fall.
And Persian fire will reduce Athens to cinder.
"For Athens is a pile of stone and wood... and cloth and dust and, as dust, will vanish into the wind."
Only the Athenians themselves exist.
And the fate of the world hangs on their every syllable.
Only the Athenians exist.
And only stout wooden ships can save them.
Wooden ships and a tidal wave of heroes' blood.
"Leonidas, my husband"
"Leonidas, your king"
Leonidas and the brave 300 are dead.
The free men and women of Greece are not bound by a beautiful Spartan death.
War is not their love.
Yet he lay down his life for them.
You really showed those bastards.
This is Hidalgo.
He fought in the underground once upon a time.
Once upon a time indeed.
"I infiltrated the city, but some bastard betrayed me."
I assume you haven't told them where Carrasco is or anything like that.
Silveira and I aren't such good friends that I would confide any secrets to him.
They'll wait for you to recover before they torture and drug you again.
"Watch out, they're coming."
"Come on, get into your beds."
Hurry up.
Gosh!
Let's see what delicious food we're getting today.
- Minced shit!
You know I don't eat shit.
- Shut up!
Why don't you eat this yourself?
Pigswill for pigs!
I've had it with you!
Who's a pig?
Tell me.
Who's a pig?
- You're the pig.
Say yes.
"I said, say yes!"
- Yes.
Stop it!
Are you trying to kill him?
"Come on, let's go."
- Come on now.
- You see how things work here.
No jokes!
It is the Right Cholla Navy's turn to save the people of this kingdom.
"June 2nd, 1592."
Yi Soon-shin's Left Cholla Navy launched another attack on the Japanese invasion force in Dang-po.
The enemy commander on this battle battle was Gurojima Mikiyuchi who had previously been routed in Sa-chun.
"Struck by Kwon Joon's arrow, Gurujima met his demise that day."
"In Yi Soon-shins 5th sea battle, the Battle of Dang-po, 21 Japanese ships were destroyed and 2.820 Japanese soldiers died in action."
"Winning is becoming a habit, High Commander!"
Sir!
"It's a counterattack, sir."
Alert the fleet!
Return to your positions and prepare for battle!
"Yes, sir!"
Third place:
"Kang Do-hyung, Min Hyung-suk, Han Joon-pil!"
Second place:
"Yi Suk-woo, Shin Jin-hwa!"
First place:
A scholar of Ahsan Song Byung-tek!
Make way!
Make way for the first place winner!
Make way!
Make way for the first place winner!
Huh?
!
What's he doing on that horse?
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
"Soon-shin, what happened?"
How did this happen?
Why him?
How did that no-good bastard take first place?
"What about your store, Ladyjaan, and your customers?"
Is it not right for us to go back to where we belong?
"Not for me, Ladyjaan."
Are you not angry at what they did to you?
"Of course, I'm angry, Ladyjaan."
But I still have both my eyes and I have such friends.
"Haroun, you have found so much more than wealth here."
You came for a dream and found love.
"Now, what did you bring for me?"
It's for Hameeda.
"Well, actually... it's for you both... together."
Lotus root.
You put this on her on the night of your wedding.
It's for a lifetime of deep loving.
Here it is.
What do you think?
It's uh...
It's beautiful.
Is this yours?
"Oh, yeah."
"It's an old bakery, actually."
I just love the idea of making old things new.
There's something cool about it.
"Forgive me, Doug, but I have to return to where I belong."
You showed me such love.
Thank you.
But it cannot be.
I do not expect you to understand.
But there is no other way.
I'm sorry.
I will carry your love with me forever.
Spices.
I want to see this.
"You coming, Quute?"
"- What about the tunnel, sir?"
- Blow every charge now.
(Beeping)
"You were right, Tarrant."
That was the monorail.
Let's move.
Put down your guns.
Servalan!
Now!
"You see, I told you, Quute."
"They're marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
She got away.
"It was Servalan, wasn't it?"
"Well, we both saw her, and she seemed to recognise us."
Tarrant to Scorpio.
We're ready for teleport.
About time.
Stand by to teleport.
"Slave, where are those cruisers now?"
"Sector 12, Master."
You outmanoeuvred them with consummate skill.
Thank you.
"Set a direct course for base, maximum speed."
Teleport operating.
What are you smirking about?
Do you realise we've got half the Federation battle fleet looking for us?
"The next time either of you pull a stunt like that, I warn you it may prove fatal."
We've just seen an old friend of yours.
- An implacable old friend.
- Servalan.
No!
"I need to stretch their wings, then, bye."
Interesting.
Do something because they will not stop.
"Relax, I know exactly how to get attention of our benefactors aliens."
"Relax, breathe deeply, take a deep breath."
-Loving.
-I am the mayor of the village!
"In this place, I say!"
-This is great.
Can you believe that.
"If you have a Will, has one output."
"Bill, are you?"
"I know not, Uncle Mano ... are noisy and are destroying our ice."
"Atticus, are building a way out of here."
All they thought never would leave here.
"Look, our road to freedom."
"It will not long, boys."
I will miss you here.
Where we live when everyone leaves?
"We'll find a new place dear, the world is big."
And just being together which is already a home.
It is.
Let children to hide.
"Carmen, you see ... even in the mystical should be a couple."
"No, no, no!"
-Are you still here.
-And you're still here.
-They were.
What?
A little while bad they disappear.
Who's missing?
Just...
You wanna go?
Go on your bike.
"Yeah, yeah, go on your bike."
Fucking hell.
Sometimes it's easier just to say yes.
"Henry, catch!"
"God, I thought I lost you forever, Henry."
I was so scared.
I was so scared when you fell.
I thought I would never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
"If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea,"
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, pozhaluysta."
"Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia and, at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime.
This is a rare surviving bat.
Estelle.
Would you please be so kind and stand up?
Or do you want to take her place?
"Estelle, your boy's quite the white knight, sacrificing himself to keep you alive only for my dick... to kill you later."
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
Brilliant!
"Uh, come over here, Henry."
"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but my higher self doesn't.
"My strong advice, sir, would be to appoint some of them to the jury."
"It would be not only prudent, but fair."
Fair?
They was gonna hang that man without a trial.
"All right, Litefoot."
You're appointed prosecutor.
Tell Sheriff Stains I'll pick some people for the jury from Eagle Bend.
"It's unorthodox, but I want this trial to be fair for everyone."
You can also tell the sheriff we're on the job here.
"That he will, gentlemen."
That he will.
Good day.
Can I have a cell like that?
-Ma'am.
-Nathan.
-Ma'am.
-l'll get you some blankets.
Make it real comfortable for you.
Daddy?
"Daddy, you all right?"
Fine. I'm fine.
Look at you.
Grown into a fine man.
After I knew you made it north...
... Iusedto dreamaboutyou...
... livingasafreeman.
"Daddy, you didn't have to stay."
You could have come with me.
I would have slowed you down.
"-You, uh, want some supper?"
-After a while.
All right.
Absurd?
"The spirits of my ancestors are with me always, Sam."
Are you calling them absurd?
"No, absolutely not, sir."
I meant no disrespect.
It's just...
"Either way, it's bad luck to gamble under the same roof as a restless spirit."
Good-bye.
Let's go.
Mr. Wu?
Wow.
Looks like your ace just folded.
Gotta hand it to Monica.
What?
Even death can't keep that bitch from ruining my life.
"Hey, check that out."
Camera R29.
It keeps flicking on and off.
Maybe it's a monitor problem.
Can you switch the feed?
Yep.
"Nope, looks like it's the camera."
Isn't that about where Monica flew off the...
"What, you think maybe her ghost is trying to communicate with us?"
Like Morse code?
"Short, short, long..."
"That's ""Mike."""
"Short, long, long, long...""Is."""
"""Mike is going to die."""
That's very funny.
"Whoo, yeah."
- Why don't you go check it out?
So like we told your people.
I can't imagine what these last 18 months have been like.
"So what do you want from us, Agent Pritchard?"
I want to start again.
If you have anything of Kevin's from that time...
We haven't touched his room.
So you can take whatever you want if it helps.
[Sniffles]
But don't call us again unless you have answers.
This is everything from Kevin's room?
Yep.
"So, start your timeline at zero."
What's your first event?
I'm gonna start with the suicide at SSU.
It happened a month before the first killing.
I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.
All right.
We'll call it event one.
Kevin Whitfield's event two.
"God, it's weird being here."
It looks just like your old place.
"Yeah, I kind of like it here."
Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
"Hey, you don't have mine, do you?"
I'd like to see who came to my funeral.
"No, you wouldn't."
[Scoffs]
"Duval, did you really bust my car window 'cause I made your mom cry?"
Yeah.
I did.
Good for you.
Liz Kenyon.
I forgot...the Pacific.
"- No other ocean has so many colors.É"""
"- And look, you can see where the blues change."
"Black for you, white for you, black and white for you."
One's fine.
"So, which route should we take back?"
The pretty or the fast?
Fast!
Pretty.
"I work for my dad, and I don't have much time for a social life."
"But the other day,"
I met a guy named Scott who owns this bar.
I'm not here to flirt.
What's gonna happen next?
You gonna ask me to dinner?
"No, I..."
It's all right.
I always get hit on when I wear this T-shirt.
- Think my eyes are up here.
- I wa...
I-I...
"For the record, I wasn't looking."
And the only reason I was in his bar is because our biggest client wants to buy it from him.
"So, I took Scott to dinner, but just to talk business."
"Okay, we got a little distracted."
"Meanwhile, there's this other guy from the office,"
Stephen.
That's him.
My dad would love it if I were with him.
"I mean, Stephen's a nice guy, but there's not a lot of passion between us."
Back to Scott.
"Right, cover me."
"Fuck, they're in the hotel."
We don't need the sniper anymore either.
Go inside.
See the colonel.
"Over here, laddie."
Arm yourself to the teeth.
Don't touch that.
Emma Gee is mine.
That's what my father used to say...
'A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay.'
Come along.
"Chop, chop."
Big Sally.
"Well, home is where the battle is."
"Private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood?"
Follow on.
"If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them."
"Drop an egg down there, laddie."
Forward.
Come along.
"Good Lord, how embarrassing."
Dodged a bullet on that one.
I'll cover you.
You go around them.
"Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie!"
Jolly good.
"Hold on, wait."
Help me with the cripple.
"Retreat five paces back on my command, laddie."
"Spasibo, Yuri."
My quarters are actually up there.
"You hear a great deal about the tempo of this city, its speed, its pace, its driving heartbeat."
"Perhaps it's true, for visitors."
"But I was born here, I live here, and the only pace I know is the pace of my own life."
The only beat I hear is the beat of my own heart.
"For me, and for millions of others, New York is home."
"The days follow each other quietly, as they do in most places."
"Only rarely does any one time stand out so that we remember it and say,"
"""That's when everything changed."
"""After that, nothing was the same. """
"There was a time like that in my life, three days."
I remember a summer evening in Gramercy Park.
"-Evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
-Mrs.
Bourne.
-Good evening.
Must be Thursday night.
"Bran, every Thursday we have this mad dash against time."
Why?
So we won't have to rush.
I'm never late for dinner with your mother.
It's a matter of principle.
"-Jessie, darling."
"-Hello, dear."
-On the dot.
-As always.
"-Horace, good evening."
"-Hello, Brandon."
The first of the season.
-The flower I love best.
"-Hello, Hannah."
"-Thank you, Brandon."
I should've been straight with him.
I should've stood by him.
"And we should've remembered the code that he taught us, 'cause without that code, we'd be... long gone right now."
Amen.
Which is why we're gonna do this job.
For Uncle Eddie.
We're gonna kill the son of a bitch who did this.
And then we're gonna rob him blind.
"Yeah, well, first things first."
- What?
- We're gonna do this... we get it all on the table.
Full disclosure.
You can't be a part of this crew unless you know everything.
"Go ahead, you two."
Show her what you really are.
- What?
!
[gasps] - [roaring] [people screaming]
- [moans] - [screaming continues]
[panting]
[Scott] Boss...
What are you doing?
Getting a taste for what's coming.
"Okay, I got the bonds, but she's coming with us."
[chuckles]
Perfect timing.
You're about to see the rise of a new Lord.
"Go ahead, kid, knock yourself out."
You deserve it.
"- I'm sorry, I..."
- It's not your fault.
I don't know how he found me.
"Oh, you'll be the prettiest mouse at the ball."
"What do you mean, mouse?"
"Uh, nothing."
Sounds like Elka's ready to go.
- Do you need a lift?
"- No, no, no."
We're gonna wait for Joy.
You go ahead without us.
So the newly beautiful mouse headed off to the ball.
It's almost too easy.
"Now, what's our ending?"
We'll find out at the ball.
The Earl is there.
"The two sisters will vie for him, and then whatever happens, that's the ending to our book."
What?
No.
"No, no, no, no."
You can't let a little thing like a scooter and an eye patch stop you.
How about this?
I knocked my crown out trying to open my eye drops bottle.
You cannot give up.
This would be a terrible ending.
Where would Cinderella be if she'd stayed home and felt sorry for herself when her sister was off having fun at the ball?
Look at me.
I'm hardly Cinderella.
"Victoria, she's right."
Jill is the one that got beautiful.
"Oh, that's true."
You've had your time.
Jill's Cinderella now.
Shut up!
"I'm Cinderella, and I'm going to the ball."
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?
So I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
"I need it, I got to have it."
It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
"Lois, do you understand what we are involved in here?"
I don't care.
I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and went to take her home.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't you move, you motherfucker or I'll blow your brains out."
Shut the car off slowly.
"For a second, I thought I was dead."
"But when I heard all the noise, I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
"Michael, lock the door!"
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't."
I don't really give a fuck.
You'll do 25 years.
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
"I'd like to ask one, too."
"What is it, mr."
Collins?
How long will it take them boats to go from new york to bristol?
"Overnight, mr."
Collins.
Just overnight.
"Oh, excellent, excellent."
"Yes, well, just a moment, mr."
"Maybury, i'll have mr."
Fisk answer that question.
"Oh, mr."
Fisk- mr.
Maybury would like to know if all 6 of the new boats will be taken from this model.
"Oh, of course not."
Each one is to be larger and more luxurious than its predecessor.
"Well, tell mr."
Maybury i'll come in and explain the details myself.
Thank you.
"Oh, would you mind coming back a little later?"
"Oh, i don't mind waiting."
Patience is its own reward.
Make yourself at home.
"It seems to me, mr."
"Palmer, that nothing, nothing can be too fine for our clientele."
I?
s working.
"Gentlemen, i think we'd better close this transom."
The enemy is right here in our camp.
He's nibbling.
"Let me take a peek, jim."
He don't look like no big fish to be- he looks more like a sidewinder crab!
Ted?
You feel a little bit better now?
You're in no danger here.
- These people don't want to hurt you.
- Sure they don't.
The FBI agent just happened to be on the train today.
She wasn't following you.
Wasn't watching you.
She expects you to believe that?
"Let them go, Ted."
I'll stay with you.
"You and I will do this together, only you need to let these people go."
I will wait with you.
No one wants to hurt you.
We don't want to hurt you.
We want to kill you.
- No!
"- No, it's okay, Ted."
"- Ted, it's okay."
- Don't!
I will make sure that they never take it out of you.
"If you hurt one more person on this train, I swear to God,"
I'll make them leave it in you forever.
What?
"Everything all right in there, Dr. Bryar?"
I want it out.
"Well, I'm sending two technicians in to remove it."
No!
One.
One technician.
"Well, it's a delicate procedure."
It requires...
You have to tell the truth.
"If Gene died from something he bought here, you are responsible."
Are you selling drugs?
No!
And we are done here.
You said you could help me.
You call this help?
She's practically accusing me of murder.
We're just trying to get to the bottom of this.
She's just the same as all the other mundanes.
They see the way we dress and they think we're freaks.
She's really just trying to help.
"It's okay, Coreen, I see who you're siding with -your minimum wage paycheck."
I thought you knew me.
I thought you understood the dark beauty of what I'm trying to create here.
I do!
Lexia!
"Hey, Coreen."
You came into this with an attitude about my friend and me and our lifestyle.
You were never looking to help her.
That is not true!
"Oh come on, think about it, Vicki, you can't ever trust anyone, can you?"
"Hey, excuse me, excuse me."
Oh my god!
Eew!
Yuck!
Eew!
Get off him!
911?
"Yeah, we need an ambulance to the Underground Club."
It's at Queen West and Crawford.
Thank you.
"Kiersten, where's Tony?"
[Kiersten] He's at the Mexican restaurant.
[Rossi] Is someone around him?
"Yes, uh, but I can't really make out his face."
What about his body?
Is it young?
Is it old?
"Uh, 25 maybe."
Wait.
He's wearing a mask.
- Like the kid?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
It only covers one side of his face.
"His ear is gone, and, um..."
[Rossi] What do you see?
It's a black guy.
He's black.
You make him sound like he's Freddy Krueger or something.
"No, but I do think he's severely burned."
Explains why he chooses this time of the year.
- He doesn't have to hide his scars.
- What about his victims?
He's punishing them for wronging him.
[Garner] Wronging him?
What about his second victim?
Have you looked at Josephine Davis' life?
She was the nicest woman in the world.
How did she wrong this guy?
"He's had interactions with all of his victims, some more personal than others."
So he's acting out of revenge.
Kiersten and Tony didn't even speak to him.
"Maybe not that night, but at some point in the past."
"Sir, get in here!"
"We have 5 deceased males and what looks to be a crude lab, all shot in the head execution style."
- Any anthrax on the scene?
- Only residue.
There's also packing and tags from 4 new backpacks.
"- All right, listen up."
- Backpacks?
They're already on the move.
We're too late.
Have you finished?
"As you said, the sun is set."
Yes.
I'd like you to meet a colleague of mine.
Dr. Reid.
- May we speak?
- Of course.
I have a little time.
That was a joke.
I have all the time.
Please.
A joke.
"- Well, we're making progress."
"- Yes, progress."
That is true.
Is there no way for this thing to end?
This Jihad?
The Jihad will end when Allah wills its end.
Then how will you know that it is Allah's will?
When the Jihad ends.
I have been lying to you.
Of course you have.
My colleague has been outside watching us as we talked on monitors.
"But... whether I find one or not, you bury the German girl tomorrow."
"You know, he does have a point there, Sam."
"Oh, come on, Al."
I didn't leap in here just to bury Hilla.
"Well, there's nothing else that figures--"
Except-
"- Except if she was murdered, and the killer was never caught."
"Uh, well, look, if the chief finds the gun in the lake--"
He won't.
And-
"- And even if he does, it just means that the killer threw the gun in the water."
"Boy, you won't give up, will ya?"
Not when I feel I'm right.
All right.
Say you're right.
We find the gun-- even find someone to trace it to.
What does that prove?
You have no bullet to match it to.
I know.
"I know, Al."
It just doesn't make any sense to me.
"I mean, where's the bullet?"
"Talkin' to the stiffs again, Melvin?"
- Excuse me?
- That's the great thing about a stiff.
"They don't talk back, but, boy, can they listen."
[ Al ] Uh-oh.
"Uh, Sam, if-- if she's gonna do what..."
"I think she's gonna do, uh,"
I'm out of here.
"You okay, Melvin?"
Yeah.
-
"- Oh, aye."
Nothing to choose between them!
"Then I thought, ""Colour the hair, Granville."
"-- ""Get into colour."
"Loads of colour."" -"
- They're not really great legs.
"Then I thought, ""Maybe"" -- and I'd appreciate a second opinion --"
"""Maybe something plain."
"Severe, even."
"""Something discreet, in the shape of a single earring?"""
"Oh, yeah!"
Yeah.
Isn't that lovely?
"Oh, d--dear!"
Look at her!
That's the k--kind of advertising we need!
-
- Have you got any copper?
-
"- Oh, yes."
"One pound, thank you."
There we are!
"I'm making a study of the adverts in these glossy magazines, Granville."
There are two things that stand out.
Her two things c--certainly stand out!
But where are we going to get someone like that round here with these qualifications?
"No, who would d--dress in a c--costume like that and p--p--pose like that?"
-- (TILL BANGS) -
- Aghh!
"Oh, dear."
He'll never get the hang of that!
I want you to go back in the kitchen and stay there till I tell you to come out.
"That way, in case they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
And then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
(PLAYING HARMONICA)
"Byron, is that the road you went down?"
"Look, don't go in there fucking around."
"In and out, you got me?"
Now what do you think I'm going to do?
"Don't worry about it, all right?"
You sure this is it?
Yeah.
(WATER RUNNING)
(CAR APPROACHING)
You got it straight?
You got it straight?
Yeah.
"Hi, baby."
"Come on, Fantasia, let's go."
"It'll be a few minutes, Ray."
I got to pack my stuff up.
What the hell are you going to pack?
All you had was that little old goddamn purse.
"It won't be long, you all come on in."
Shit.
I'm going to be right back.
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.
"Man, she better not have bought any fucking clothes."
How much she got to pack?
"Come on, come on."
"Be careful, honey, I love you."
Fine.
"But when we get the POWs from the Abbey, we'll take Miri too."
"- Miri, the pretend nun?"
- She's motivated.
She can shoot.
And she trailed me through the woods for a half hour before I heard her.
None of you can do that.
That's all we know about her?
Everything else you can learn while you train her.
Brilliant.
Three weeks till the invasion.
Lots of time.
"Speaking of which,"
I've been thinking.
"We're working on the attack, but without defense, it could all be for nothing."
What do you mean?
We need to know what they know.
"Which networks are blown, who we can trust."
We don't know how much René told them.
Counter-intelligence.
We need to protect ourselves.
Anticipate attacks.
- Track his movements.
Feed him lies.
"- And by ""him"" you mean..."
Franz Faber.
He knows a lot about us.
It's time we learned more about him.
- We can't get anywhere near the HQ.
- No.
But maybe we can hit him closer to home.
_
We got to get going.
Right.
Okay.
"Then later, at a club in Chinatown somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."
Old men are so sexy.
"All right, to be fair, some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream."
"Turns out, when you projectile vomit on skates, you roll right into the spray."
"Wait, how old does she think you are?"
"So, were you in Vietnam?"
Hold that groan.
Charlie was everywhere.
She's hot!
She likes old guys!
Don't judge me!
"Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, th..."
"I swear, this is what all the 20-year-olds looked like..."
"I want to thank you for your service to this nation, Private."
Colonel.
Aw.
I got to end this.
"Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid?
That's...
embarrassing.
Your Highness!
Let's go.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
Cool?
Can you find it?
- Sure.
Give me 10 minutes.
Let me find now.
- Excellent.
- Hello?
"- Tool as a chartered company, consisting of religious statues a church in Los Angeles sent a large transport."
- Religious statues?
- Yes. 20 statue of the Virgin Mary.
But that address is sent to control a church in Los Angeles and I do not have such a church.
Tool company steeped in a bad way.
Even if this guy 5 cents there.
"House for sale was removed, his wife, the divorce lawsuit."
Çırpınıyormuş for the money this man.
- Someone must have paid kickbacks to him.
- Never been bribed.
- I rented the corporate bullshit.
I've never.
- We do not have anything at that time.
"- No, there's something."
- What is it?
Virgin lost 20.
- This is a bad thing?
- I think I look açına depends.
"- Michael, is not it?"
"- Yes, Mike."
"So Mike, this is really a very nice gesture."
- Are you coming to church?
Many familiar come.
- Sometimes I'm coming.
Yes.
"Yes, thank you again."
(mutters)
Smells mighty familiar.
Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer!
"All right, where is she?"
- Where is she?
!
"Alice, come out here!"
-Uh... upstairs on the phone.
"Upstairs on the phone, huh?"
Today was the most humiliating day
-I've ever spent in my whole life.
-Really?
How would you feel if you gave your boss dog food to eat?
"Terrible, unless my boss is a cocker spaniel, I tell you."
Dog food!
It's a miracle I wasn't fired.
"I know who did it, too."
Alice's mother.
"She come over here to cook me a tidbit, that's what she did."
"She don't care what Alice gives me to eat, just as long as Alice can scrimp and save and live around here in the lap of luxury!"
"Those ain't the facts, Ralph."
Those ain't the facts.
"They're not the facts, huh?"
Then why would we have dog food around the house?
And in our ice box?
!
"What, have we got a dog or something?"
"Ralph Kramden, you have just reached the first plateau!"
What are you talking about?
!
"I'm not talking about it, and I'm not saying it."
Just put your nose in that bedroom there.
It's all good.
I'm happy.
I'm very happy.
"well, get off the phone then before I start crying."
All right then.
Okay.
Love you.
See you.
-talk to you later.
"AII right, bye-bye."
-Bye.
t's amazing man.
That's literally why I auditioned for the show in the start.
"Like, I just wanted to be able to give back to my mum and stuff."
So it's wicked to be able to do that.
It's really cool.
Tonight is the biggest show we've ever done.
I'm just throwing it out there.
"e are playing to 65,000 people tonight."
It's just insane.
Good luck.
Look at the amount of policemen...
-...we've got.
-I can't get over how many police bikes there are.
They've got 40 policemen on us and then they've got like 1 000 policemen on the streets.
"It's quite scary, but it's quite fun at the same time."
We literally have like a small army.
We do have the army.
Let's take over this place.
What is that girl doing out the top of the car?
With an english hat on.
She is a literal rebel.
"Precisely, as he has no memory, he says nothing."
It's better.
"Go, now."
I have to open my shop at 9 am.
Let's go!
Go and have the stew from last night warmed up.
It will be better when we have the new Mexican paper.
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Montparnasse, quick!"
"Yes, sir."
Good morning.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"Come, I've already ordered."
I read your article yesterday.
"If my brother is alive, can I see him?"
I never wrote he was alive.
I just assumed he was.
"In fact, I worked deductively."
"At last, he's alive or not?"
"In reality, since last night, I'm... sure he is dead."
I even have proof.
I found this medallion in the sewers that serve the courthouse.
It's horrible.
Is it the medallion he always carried with him?
Yes.
I gave it to him.
"It is the effigy of St. Jacques, his patron saint."
I brought it back from a pilgrimage to Compostela.
Why weren't you more clear in your article?
You are right.
I should've speak to you before writing it.
Ok.
"Let's wait 2, 3 weeks."
All right.
"And the lies she's been telling, that's part of it, huh?"
Lies?
"Like saying her bed's shaking, that stuff?"
"Have you ever known your daughter to swear, to use obscenities?"
"No, never."
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar...
"Similar to things like her lying, it's uncharacteristic for her--"
I don't understand.
She doesn't swear.
"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.
"Well, give me an example."
Like what?
"Specifically, what did she say?"
"Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her..."
Goddamn cunt.
I can't believe it.
Oh.
"Now, she-- you don't think a psychiatrist?"
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
Ok.
"So, in the meantime, try not to worry."
Zach didn't even sleep with Hallie.
And even if he had how could I blame him?
I practically...
pushed him into Hallie's arms.
She was right.
Maybe I do play victim sometimes.
Everyone's been right about me.
"You're afraid of a real relationship, Dale."
I've just had a blind eye to it.
I've scared of getting hurt.
Because he's too perfect.
I've kept Zach at arm's length.
You are so afraid of getting hurt that you end up picking guys that have absolutely no substance.
Hey...
Am I gonna live the rest of my life...
with guys like... this?
Just to... avoid someone... real?
No.
Hell no!
I'm ready to change.
If I get... one more chance...
I won't screw it up... again.
If I just get one more... chance.
I'll be right there.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to come by and talk.
"Look, I think we've done enough talking."
I'm really not interested in talking with you.
I just wanted to say that I understand that this isn't gonna work.
"You and I, that is."
Ok.
Why did you hang out with me?
"God, that's terrifying."
I know.
Manny ditched us last night to go drinking.
"He thinks I don't know, but I know."
He smelled like a sweaty peppermint.
I saw the pictures that he texted Luke from the strip club.
Is that where Javier took him?
Oh.
You did not know that.
I'm sorry.
But it... it looked like one of the classier establishments.
"The girl that was sitting on Manny's lap had on a really cute top, at... at least in the first picture."
"The one time that I thought that he was going to be a good father, and he teaches Manny how to be a dog!"
I'm gonna kill him!
"Hey, look at me!"
I'm about to talk to a stranger!
(exhales sharply)
(slow rock music plays)
"Oh, yes."
This is it.
This is the one.
Ugh.
It wasn't this depressing last night.
The lunch scene in a strip joint is like a refugee camp with less hope.
Excuse me.
"Uh, my friend left some personal belongings here last night."
Anything left behind...
- goes in the lost and found.
- There we go.
Thank you.
"There's a jacket... glasses... hairpiece, I hope..."
- What about my stuff?
- All right.
"Bye, Mom."
I left a wake up call for 9.
Do you want something to eat?
You mean this is one of those basement breakfast places?
I don't know how long we can keep doing this.
"Well, it won't be long."
- You'd go back to your foster parents?
- Not a chance.
But I've saved up enough to get out to Arizona.
I have a friend in Flagstaff.
You gonna miss me?
"It was nice knowing when something goes bump in the night, it's you."
What have you got to be afraid of?
Forgot this.
Honey?
Put on gloves if you're gonna do the dishes.
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't do this anymore.
"Last night after I left, I felt awful."
I'm sorry for what I did and what almost happened.
I should have figured it out.
At least I should have listened to you.
"Yeah, well, it was terrible but all I could think about was my mom."
I'm sorry.
I was so mean.
"- Well, I had it coming."
- No.
I was thinking.
A could have given that ticket to mom but they made you do it to make it hurt more.
Why are you so uncomfortable?
It's like you're somewhere else.
What is it?
"If there's a problem, I'll take care of it here immediately, so just tell me."
Is someone making problems for you or can you not pay the bills?
Dad!
"No, there's nothing wrong."
Why are you getting on his case?
This isn't the first or second time you've seen him.
"This isn't the first or second time, but it was bothering me."
It's so easy to bother you.
That's nice.
"I can't see your eyes, I can't see your third or fourth eye behind that."
- All right then.
- Good bye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
"- Don't be late, it's at seven."
"I won't be late, I won't be late."
Good bye.
Seat him at another table tomorrow.
Ahjussi!
We should go too.
"Right, go, go."
You displeased me today.
Yes.
"Mom, stop it."
"- Bye, Ahjumma."
- All right.
I'll leave oppa in your care.
Don't worry.
"I'll call you, Oppa."
How were you going to act?
No.
Marius ran.
Leaving you with me.
Maybe I should thank him.
You know?
Well?
"Well, what?"
"Well, isn't there any part of you that has a bad feeling about this?"
You thought Lance was cheating on you with some lady named Victoria.
I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
Victoria's a character he created
- to scam Grandma.
- Do you have any idea how fucking preposterous that sounds?
That doesn't make it untrue.
"Carly, move it!"
"Lance claims to have lost more money than Audrey on that deal, yet he's buying a boat."
Where is he getting the money from?
"For fuck's sake, let's ask him."
"Ask a question, you get an answer."
That doesn't necessarily get you the truth.
I can get you the truth.
I just need a day.
- That's it?
- That's it.
And one more thing.
[door opens]
Can I help you?
Ex...
Ex-ex-ex...
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
This is private property.
' I don't know.
I don't wanna take any chances.
We should get him as soon as possible.
'We'll be there in 24 hours.' I'll pick you up.
- You wanna go to the boat first?
- No.
First show us where he is.
He and his wife own a shirt shop close to Waikiki.
- How about his wife?
"- Yes, she's still alive."
- We may not have time for them both.
- That's OK.
He's our priority.
We're coming up to the shop.
It's busy.
I don't think we can take him here.
Don't linger too long.
He might see us.
"OK, I'll take you to the boat now."
"With those fancy shirts, that outrigger crew of yours had better win."
"Winning ain't important, pop, long as we look good at the luau later."
Typical Hawaiian philosophy.
"To win is important too, you know?"
You and Mrs Greenberg better be there Saturday to cheer us on.
Mama and I will be there.
You just win.
"OK, pops."
- What did you see?
- I don't have to see.
I feel.
- Here. it may be nothing.
- Nothing?
How much do we have to take from this crud?
There'll be no vigilante stuff.
Not while I'm barracks chief.
"Hey, look at them!"
- Those crazy jerks!
- They won't get away with it!
The Krauts'll shoot them!
It's Harry and the Animal!
They're trying to sneak into the Russian compound!
They're past the 50-yard line.
- It's a quarterback sneak.
-Look at them go!
Those idiots will paint themselves right into their graves.
Get a load of them
"Hello, bublichki."
How are you all?
Hey!
"Hey, the brick Kremlin!"
"Hey, Olga Volga, wait for me."
"Hey, Animal."
The window.
Hmm.
So life sort of drifted back to normal in Stalag 17.
It was a couple of days before Christmas and everything seemed quiet enough.
"But underneath it all, we knew we were sitting on a barrel of dynamite and that the stoolie, whoever he was, was ready to strike again at any second."
At ease.
At ease.
At ease.
"All right, at ease."
At ease.
Mail call!
"- All right, at ease."
Says here they got reason to believe they're headed for Houston.
Seems to me they just may fit the description of the folks you boys are after.
Son of a bitch.
Think we may even have a photograph of them.
They ran out of a convenience store earlier.
Surveillance camera?
"Yeah, I think so."
Texas.
"Looks like they're headed our way, boys."
"Hey, you got another cup?"
"Sure, if you don't mind drinking after me."
"No, not at all."
Goddamn.
Texas.
Whew.
You think it was our people who whacked that state trooper?
We'll know as soon as we get the photo.
Hurricane...
He's waiting on the bad guys the way a kid waits for Christmas.
"Yeah, well, Hurricane's a force of nature."
I like old Hurricane.
Nice fellow.
You know what he told me this morning?
What?
He said he was thinking of coming to L.A. and joining the force.
You're kidding.
Honest to God.
He said that he thought me and him and Mackintosh would make a hell of a team.
No shit.
(LAUGHING) He said he wanted to take a crack at the big time.
Jesus.
What did you say?
What if I don't want to let him go?
I will have abortion right away!
"Auntie, where is Yawang?"
"From now on, you are not allowed to leave this room!"
"When my son is awake, you will have to marry him!"
"Xiaotian,"
I think... you'd better go back to academy.
"She is my daughter,"
I know her well.
"Being with you, she will be in agony everyday!"
"Xiaotian, Auntie is begging you, don't contact her anymore!"
No!
- She needs me now!
- Just end it here!
Both of you don't have the same fate.
Listen to me!
"By this way, both of you can live on well."
I don't care about what has happened anymore!
She is my woman for all my life!
Please be careful.
Slow down!
Get in!
Stop!
Xiamu!
Come on.
- I can't.
- Don't talk!
Just follow me!
"If you don't stop, you will spend your life in the prison!"
"I'd kill all of you, and spend my life rotten in prison, it doesn't matter to me!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
I was right.
Only $ 100...
I'm short of money right now.
I've been out of work...so just give me a little time.
"You understand, don't you?"
"You've got balls, young man!"
How come I never heard of you before?
You've got a lot of guts.
I'll find you some work for good money.
"No hard feelings, right?"
"If I can help you, let me know."
You've done well for yourself.
Enjoy the festa!
"Oh, this is too violent for me!"
What've you got there?
"Michael, your father loves you very much."
"Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942 to the present time, you were an employee of the Genco Olive Oil Company?"
That's right.
But in actuality you were a member of the Corleone crime organization.
"No, we called it the Corleone family, Senator."
What was your position?
"At first, like everybody else, I was a soldier."
-What is that?
"-A button, you know, Senator."
"No, I don't know."
Tell me.
"When the boss says ""push a button"" on a guy, I push a button."
"See, Senator?"
Mr. Questadt.
-You mean you kill people?
-What?
You kill people at the behest of your superiors.
- Bye.
No way.
My mom will already be on my last nerve.
I don't want Viv getting on nerves
I haven't even discovered yet.
Touchdown!
That's another 5 bucks you owe me.
"Guys, this is my teaching assistant, Vali."
"Vali, these are my kids..."
"Oliver, Taylor, and Anna-Kat."
The boy seems shorter than I imagined.
"TV off, guys."
But we have a bet on the game.
Thanksgiving isn't about football.
It pretty much is.
It's only not when you have a dad who isn't into sports.
I'm into sports!
Name three NFL quarterbacks.
I don't have to prove anything to you.
TV off.
Greg!
You're killing me!
Why do you always invite one of your TAs?
You mean invite someone from a foreign land with nowhere to go to join us on a day when we open our hearts?
The last thing that I need...
Hi!
We are so happy that you are with us.
I like your track suit.
"I must say, you are very beautiful."
I like your size.
"Okay, that was creepy."
It's no less creepy than you hitting on my mom.
[gun shots]
Watch your back.
Right.
Cover me!
[gun shots]
The other two got away.
They got andreas.
Edward mace is unrelenting and ruthless.
When he discovers he doesn't
"Have what he came for,"
He will be back with a vengeance.
Where will they take andreas?
To the darkest place on earth.
I have to go after them.
(nigel:)let's see what we've got here.
The scabbard has holes along its length
That coincide with words written
On the inside of the blade.
Makes up a latin phrase.
"""from sarsen stone, 240 peds,"
"Beneath the druid's noch."""
"(syd:) ""peds."""
Is a roman measurement common to the time.
"Yeah, the stride of an average man."
It would have been about
Five-foot-two in those days.
Sarsen.
"Sarsen is a type of limestone,"
Indigenous to south- central England.
"Also known as greywether,"
Or druidstone.
It's what stonehenge is made of.
"-You're the only voter i care-- -l'm getting that """"con"""" feeling."
-Like you're copping a plea.
"-No, come on."
No plea.
I'm just a pol who kept rolling along until he ran into a stone wall.
You were that wall.
And I realized...
... justlikeme whenIwasa kid .
"Young, ambitious, go-getter, but fair."
"Trading up, but always for the right causes."
You're doing good.
Not putting money in your pocket.
Just trying to maintain your position.
Your power.
What good are you to the people without it?
But down deep...
... youknowthere'saline you can't cross.
And after a thousand trades...

"I had the fire in the belly just like you, Kevin."
"And the odd thing is, I still have it."
Never left me.
I had the dream...
... andI hadtheweight.
Like one of those guys before me said:
"""""lf a sparrow dies in Central Park, I feel responsible. """""
Well said. I feel that way.
I was gonna take that feeling with me...
... allthewaytoWashington.
The things you could have done.
Fucking things I could've done.

Wow!
I'm always happy to speak to a lottery winner.

Uh...congratulations.

Thanks.
So I thought I'd splash out and buy my daughter-in-law some furniture.
So I thought I'd splash out and buy my daughter-in-law some furniture.
That's very generous of you.
That's very generous of you.
What sort of things does your daughter-in-law like?

The most expensive.
What else?
The most expensive.
What else?
"I tell you what,"
"I tell you what, why don't you drive to Jerilderie?"
why don't you drive to Jerilderie?
You can quote on the whole bloody house.
You can quote on the whole bloody house.
"Well, that sounds like an offer I can't refuse."
Give me that.
Wait for me.
Miss Carrol!
"Hello, kids."
No wonder this school is losing money.
Everybody late every morning.
Any more dilly-dallying and some of you will lose your jobs.
"Yes, and that goes for you girls, too."
"Anybody would think I had nothing else to do, but nothing."
One would.
"Miss Anderson, good morning."
"If you're late again, you'll be fired, too."
That's final.
I have nothing more to say.
That's good.
"- Is that you, Mabel?"
- I don't know.
"Tell me, is it?"
- Kind of sounds like you.
- That's a load off my mind.
I'm never sure these days.
- Did you see a young...
- Visitors make the pupils self-conscious.
"Would you mind waiting a second, please?"
"- That's no if, Gus!"
- Supposed to be pretty good!
He won the intercollegiate a couple years ago?
I never seen a college Joe yet take a belt on the kisser!
!
without phoning his mother!
"He's a good man, but I'll take him!"
I can feel it!
Carlos:
This place is starting to look like a dump.
- Why don't you take some boxes away?
"- Okay, boss."
Don't call me that.
Wow!
Where do you guys get this from?
It's beautiful.
"You know that can of paint up front, the white one?"
Yes.
Why don't you go get it and paint over that shit?
Everybody gonna like this.
It gives some cultural stuff to the store and the kids love that.
I drew that.
Eight years ago.
My mom used to watch me every afternoon.
"Altogether, it took about... a month."
Why you want to take it down?
- 'Cause it's bullshit.
- It's beautiful.
"You said your mom liked it, I'm sure your dad--"
Why don't you cover that shit?
You put a part of yourself into the store--
What are you...?
"I did that shit for my father, he covered that shit and now you want to uncover it?"
"When I come back, this shit better be gone."
Stop!
- Yo!
"Ten cuidado, coño."
- Watch where you're going.
"Right, right."
Okay.
Thank you.
"So, what, you're just never gonna have sex again?"
Probably not.
It's funny.
"You know, I never had a problem screwing in a bed where another guy's been."
You've never had a problem screwing in a woman where another guy's been.
You told him you were dangerous?
You're so non-dangerous.
I know!
"But I swear, with him, I feel like I could be."
Mm-hmm.
There's something about him that's so dynamic.
This confidence...
I have not felt this excited about work in I don't know how long.
Dear God... exhale.
Oh.
Oh!
And let me tell you... is that boy easy on the eyes.
Don't.
I know... don't do voices.
Thank you.
"Seriously, he is hot."
"Obviously, I would never go there."
Please.
You keep an apartment there.
Nope.
Not gonna happen.
"I'm happy just to be around him, to work with him, to learn from him."
He is amazing.
"I hear myself talking to these people, and..."
They're listening to me.
"I mean, really listening and nodding."
You're not sure.
"I'm sure, Lena."
I know.
I feel them.
"- Oh, Saul."
- We close the shop today.
I don't know how he keeps pullin' that mess off.
"- Yeah, well, neither does he."
- Hm?
"It's all in the subconscious, TC."
- Haven't you heard of body language?
- Body language?
The body can tell you all kinds of stuff without you even knowing.
"You don't believe me, huh?"
You see the way he's lowering' his head?
"The body's saying he's vulnerable, and the ladies love it."
Watch.
"Any second now, she'll throw her arms around his neck and bury her head right in his chest."
Huh!
"Well, for a guy that don't know what he's doin', he sure do it good."
Wuh-oh.
"Hey, she got a little body language of her own."
"Yeah, well, that's obvious."
"- Thanks for the coffee, Rick."
- OK.
"Take care, TC."
"Shouldn't have lowered your head, boy."
Shouldn't have lowered my head?
"Why is it when I find out what people hire me to find out, they take it out on me?"
"I don't know but, here, put some ice on it."
That's very funny.
"Hey, Saul."
(HORSE WHINNIES)
(GROANS)
(HIKUC SPEAKING PAWNEE)
(HORSE NEIGHS)
FITZGERALD:
Yeah!
There she is.
We did it.
"You ought to be proud of yourself, boy."
Yeah.
We followed orders.
We just skipped the funeral part.
Don't go down there and start growing no conscience.
'Cause sure as night'll come they'll have us swinging from a couple ropes.
We did what we had to do.
(JIM URGES HORSE)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(ALL SHOUTING EXCITEDLY)
FITZGERALD:
"We had the extra daysowe managedtodig a little deeper, lay rocks on top so scavengers couldn't get at him."
It was done right and all.
He was buried right.
"Sir, can we--"
The truth is that...
"(CLEARS THROAT) ...when Hawk disappeared, I was worried about savages."
"And I was ready to get, to move on out."
"Yeah, but, Bridger here argued to stay."
"He argued to stay so he could at least build a cross or something to put on top of Glass's grave, and that's what he did."
That's what we did.
"I'm glad you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger."
"He more than pulled his weight, Captain."
"This man here, he was my partner."
"Linda, pick any wine."
It can even be a wine he knows.
Any wine?
"If you can get one wine right, just one, you win the whole competition."
"In fact, you could pick a wine he had last night."
I'll still know it before he does.
"Ooh, bonus round."
"Whoever says what it is first, wins."
What's the point?
"You can do this, Bobby."
"No, I can't."
"Look at me, Bobby."
I-I can't.
Yes you can.
I have a blindfold on.
"Well, you can do the mystery wine."
"All right, fine."
Pour it.
At least I'll get drunk-ish.
"That's it, Bobby."
"Hey, look what's coming around the mountain."
The train.
"Just kidding about the mountain, uh, but the train is..."
remember that song?
Uh-oh.
"Guys, she's coming back faster."
This only happens when the train's running behind schedule or this one time when they ran out of rosé and things got weird.
It's starting to look kind of like a real train now.
"Like fast, and dangerous."
We could just get a cab.
"Oh, look, there's Ethan."
He's headed toward the Juice Caboose!
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
I couldn't take the shot.
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"- No, he couldn't."
"- What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
I knew you fucking looked at me funny.
Liar.
I should have listened to myself.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!
Where am I gonna go?
- I'm stuck here with you.
- Yeah.
Did you ever see me not backing you up?
I always back you up.
Why do you think I started with these intensive courses?
Ask me why?
I'm telling you I'll make an album for you.
- Really?
"- Of course, it's real."
- Promise?
- I promise.
"Ooh, look who's here."
"Yes, Mert. 3012 Mert."
Rafet.
"Actually, 69 Rafet."
What are we doing here?
"We'll leave, professor."
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't you see?
I've been thinking of giving Rafet a nickname for a long time.
"- 69 Rafet is super, professor."
- Give me that camera.
You take this camera and get lost.
Close the door too.
Photo...
What are you doing?
Sinan... the camera...
What do you guys want?
What are you doing here?
"Well, would you believe me if I said we were just passing by?"
What are you doing here?
"We were just checking the inventory here, and I felt hot in the jacket."
"To do, you know, the warehouse is stuffy."
"We, Rafet and I, will be married soon and build a happy house."
Naina and I have seen a flat for ourselves.
We will go there.
"And what about me, sister-in-Iaw?"
I am like a guest in this house.
"If not with you, then III live with brother and sister-in-Iaw."
"But you dont worry, sister-in-Iaw."
"III search for a room for you, brother and Jyoti."
"Yes, III have to pay the rent."
III pay it.
youll pay the rent!
people sacrifice their lives in orderto..
..keep their dignity intact!
Our house is getting auctioned..
..and you have no shame at all!
Even though you all are the brothers of..
"..such a kind man, you have stooped so low."

"Vicky, I beg of you!"

"gentlemen, before starting this auction, I would Iike to.."
..tell you that Mr. Chaudhry will bid..
..forthis luxurious mansion first.
50 lakhs.
Rely on it!
That's what my lawyer said.
- You too?
"- No, thanks."
The fine gentleman will pay.
There's still something called fatherhood.
Only the pleasure and no responsibility?
Ha!
"He's here, Mrs John!"
"Where I, in my condition, was made to sit at the bar's cash register..."
No percentages anymore!
"And then, not even the alimony!"
Mr Hassenreuter?
Did you go to the state library?
"Oh certainly, the books!"
"Yes, just a moment, Mrs John!"
- An extra lock?
- And a bolt on the inside!
"As if there was anything to steal from him, Mr Theater Director!"
Without a theater...
He still owes me the rent.
How does he make a living?
"Life, but my lips are sealed..."
"Morning, Mrs John!"
I have something for you.
"Gynecology, midwifery and infant care."
Whether this is the right one for you...
I've been a bachelor all my life.
It's all Greek to me...
"I'll find my way through, Mr Hassenreuter!"
Thank you very much...
What do you want with it?
"Through this bucket list, we want you to see that life is precious and beautiful--"
- I'll hook up with girls at the club...
- Excuse me..
And I'll have one night stands everyday.
"Stop, stop, stop."
We'll stop here!
Don't stop and let me continue.
"Do you think this broadcast is a joke, Sin Joon Young?"
It's not.
I'm being honest here.
What wouldn't I be able to do if I were to die soon?
What about drugs?
"Will you drink and drive, gamble, use public restrooms?"
"Do you want to date me, PD No Eul?"
Let's say I'll die in three months.
For only three months.
Really deeply.
Only... 3 months.
"Really passionately, with all of my strength."
"Well, since it was just a test..."
Those jokes don't really matter.
I'm not joking though.
I said I wasn't joking.
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
What do you mean?
I'm so thankful!
Top star Sin Joon Young is proposing that we date.
"If I said I didn't like it, I would be crazy!"
PD No!
Good.
That means you have to do right by her.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Then leave her.
Never.
She has a destiny and you?
This life?
You're gonna keep her from it.
"Okay, you believe in magic?"
I take it you do.
So will you.
Trust me.
I'm gonna show you something.
Something that's gonna make you look at everything differently.
"And when you see what I have in here, you're gonna listen."
You're gonna believe every word I say.
(LID CREAKS)
"Yeah, right."
(SNIFFS)
"Okay, I'm listening."
There is a curse and it needs to be broken.
Emma is the key.
I was tasked with keeping her on track.
"And you, my friend, just got caught in the crossfire."
Now I'm gonna tell you a story.
"And at the end of it, you're gonna have to make a decision, will you do the right thing or not."
"So, are you ready?"

I see that she's stayed out all night.
"I'm sure she was with Yoon Jae, right?"
!
Is your daughter staying out all night something to be smiling about?
"They're going to get married in a month, so who cares?"
"With Yoon Jae always sending Da Ran home on time,"
I was worried something was wrong with Yoon Jae.
But I guess not...
Shall we invite Yoon Jae over today and make him some grilled eel?
Don't make things so obvious like that and embarrass those kids.
You're right...
Things like that...
You do for them without making it obvious.
How can you feed him eel without making it obvious?
"If you put the eel in the stuffing and give it to him in a dumpling form, don't you think that'll work?"
Eel dumplings?
!
(Eels are good for a man's virility)
Should I grow out a beard?
It's not even my body.
Why am I itchy?
Does this guy have dry skin?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Da Ran!
That person...
Looks like Yoon Jae!
Wait!
Wait!
Gil Da Ran!
Yoon Jae!
Gil Da Ran!
Do you read me?
Why don't they answer?
My ship!
Blast!
This'll take weeks to repair.
"Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2."
My ship has run off course en route to sector 1 2.
I've crash-landed on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa!
Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Did I frighten you?
Didn't mean to.
Sorry.
Howdy.
My name is Woody.
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
"And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up."
"This is my spot, see, the bed here."
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
"I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit."
My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
"Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot."
I need to repair my turbo boosters.
"Do you people still use fossil fuel, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?"
"- Pawnshop, and it's awesome."
- Who are you again?
- I'm Bo.
L.m a.
- Private investigator.
- Right.
You've gotten mixed up with dangerous people.
- Like the mob?
- Sort of.
"Jenny, Olivia put a hit on you."
That's why Samir's been so distant.
He was protecting me.
Maybe he was leading you on.
Getting a piece of tail on the side while mouthing promises about leaving his wife.
Then he gets bored and just bails without even a goodbye.
Or whatever.
"I'm sure he cared about you, Jenny."
I can tell him to handle Olivia before somebody gets killed.
"Now get some rest, okay?"
Tell her what she's dealing with.
It's not fair.
No.
"I start talking about that stuff, Fae get mad at me and things start sucking."
"This is our life now, Kenzi."
We have to protect it.
This is how you want to play this game?
What a maverick.
Guess what.
I got 10 cops a week who pull this stunt in here.
"The tougher you guys act, the more I can see through you."
"Dyson, it's okay to ask for help."
Stab in the dark here.
Maybe that's what you're tryin' to do with me.
"What are you gonna do, Freddy?"
You gonna arrest the whole town?
"You goin' to New York to take ""paint by number"" cop lessons?"
"You know, Ray likes you."
That don't mean I'm gonna let you fuck him over.
"Ray Donlan gave you this job, Freddy."
You forgot that?
We made your sorry ass!
So now you can do us a favor.
You could tell us... where Superboy is.
"If I knew where he was, he'd be in the city already."
"You're gonna be hurtin', Freddy."
"You're not gonna know when, you're not gonna know where."
You're gonna be hurtin'.
You mark my words.
I'm watchin' you!
Hey.
- You got your check.
- Yep.
"Thanks to you, Freddy."
Filing out those forms in such a timely fashion.
You with Liz?
Where you goin'?
I don't know.
"My leave came, so I thought I'd look around for a new reality."
You know?
"Anyway, I'm sure you could use your privacy, Freddy."
"No, no."
"Look all you want, Freddy."
You're not gonna find anything.
I took care of it.
I gotta hurry and get back to the shop before Mrs. Sparling's dryer shuts off.
I'll be out of a 50-cent tip.
"Don't worry, honey."
Aggie's gonna fix you up.
That German girl sure was pretty.
Her name is Hilla.
What dress did you get for her to wear?
A blue one with a...
bow on the back.
I left it in her room.
"That's not like you, Melvin."
You're always after me for forgetting' things.
"Well, you better get it."
We can't bury her naked.
Even if she didn't have no money.
You knew her?
Nah.
But you hear more in a beauty shop than a priest in confession.
"Uh, don't-- don't overdo it."
Just--Just keep it natural.
"Sure, Melvin."
[ Door Closes ]
"What are you doin' back here, Sam?"
I came to get a dress to bury Hilla in.
You decided to stay for the late show?
"I thought you were gonna sit this leap out, Al."
"Now, don't get me wrong."
"I've had a lot of fixations on women, but this-- It's not one of your cheap flings."
Whatever.
This is an obsession.
"Look at her, Al."
She's so young... and beautiful and... full oflife.
I can get a full-time job.
But what about college and law school that you've always talked about?
That's just a dream.
I can't do it.
My old man doesn't make enough...
Whose father does?
Not everyone in college is a millionaire's son.
Don't get so steamed up.
"Ted Carter, you've always wanted to be a lawyer."
"Now, go be it."
Don't crumple up at the first obstacle.
"The first obstacle's the biggest, the money."
"Well, then get over that and the rest should be easy."
Do you know how long it takes to become a lawyer?
What difference does it make?
It's what you wanna do in life.
One of the things I want to do is marry you.
"If I don't do it now, maybe I never will."
"Ted, the only family I'll ever have will be half yours."
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.
Good night.
"Good night, Selena."
Ted thank you.
Ma?
Ma?
Joey?
I thought you was something out of a dream.
Where's Ma and Joey?
"Let's have a drink, celebrate your growing up."
Where's Ma and Joey?
They're working at a party at Harrington's.
Let's have a drink.
"""When I came in to open up one morning..."
"""you had your head half in the toilet."
Your hair was in the toilet water.
"-""Disgusting."""
"-I told you, I had the flu."
-I said my piece.
"-Great, I can't even defend myself, now?"
-No one's attacking you.
-It doesn't change anything.
But I can verify that he was sick for a little while.
This thing with the dog.
How could you not see it on the chair?
You're getting emotional.
That's because I know what it's like to lose a pet!
I happen to know that you were high at my mother-in-law's wake.
"You were talking non-stop for 20 minutes, nothing but gibberish."
My mother's wake.
Jesus Christ.
-You want to read your statement?
-I don't write nothing down.
So I'll keep this short and sweet.
You're weak.
You're out of control.
You've become an embarrassment to yourself and everybody else.
-Listen to you.
-Guys.
"We said ""non-judgmental."""
Fuck that.
Let him take his medicine.
"Seriously, you want to talk about fucking up?"
"-Watch it, Chrissy."
-What?
"Don't sell it, you owe us."
So find someone who knows how to cook it.
Son of a bitch!
Get out of here or I'll peg you in the head!
- Find anything?
"- No, nothing."
In the well?
Garbage.
"Tie up the geese, I need to take a leak."
Abelardo!
"Abelardo, come here!"
Carmen.
Estrellla.
"Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook."
- Where was that?
- Back there.
Then why are you putting it here?
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?
The pile.
All together so nothing gets lost.
I'll put it back if you want.
"No, leave it there."
Don't touch anything else.
Write this down.
"""Apart from the breasts..."
"""Several cuts, apparently stab wounds."
"First degree burn on the left hand."""
Let's move to the other body.
"Write down that she has cuts across her neck, abdomen and thorax."
Three fingers cut off on her left hand.
Signs of vaginal injury.
Good.
- We should all keep in touch.
- Definitely.
"Mark, pay me more attention."
Mark!
This is the last time that you see me.
I wanna go to Marosi.
Are you out of your mind?
I want to look him in the eye and I just wanna ask him some questions.
I really dont't think that's a good idea.
He said that he killed Jesse.
So I just wanna meet him.
And either you gonna help me out or I'm gonna have to sort this myself.
"Hello, Mr. Wells."
I want to talk about my brother.
I killed him.
"I chose him,"
I took him and I killed him.
"Three acts, simple."
I don't believe you.
"They found the bodies of the other 4 boys that you killed, but not my brother."
Why not?
I burnt it.
Why would you do that?
Because he was younger.
And what I did to him... was disgusting.
I like young boys.
And I liked Jesse.
A lot.
You're already facing life for the other 4 boys that you killed.
"So you took the rep for Jesse in order to secure yourself privileges in prison, didn't you?"
Get yourself back on the front pages.
"- How much law do you know, lad?"
- I was just guessing.
"So Scott-Padget's gonna rule the roost, run the ship his way."
- It's a chance.
- What for?
Scott-Padget.
Stab him in the back.
Give him Jonah's toss.
- Don't be a fool.
- Now look would the captain care if he died?
We're after bigger things than one man.
And we'll get them with patience.
- That's the only word you know.
- I know this:
If we touch one officer our whole cause is lost.
Do you think he heard?
That old drunk?
What's it matter?
- Didn't I tell you to clean this up?
- I did.
You call this clean?
It seems I have to teach you another lesson.
Come here.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
"- Not in the least, Mr. Goss."
I thought I should report that...
Report what?
Wheatley's recovering from punishment.
The others are back on duty.
You told me all this yesterday.
"Really, I wish, sir, to make a suggestion."
"Well, forgive me if I..."
"Um, I don't know, Mike, what do you think, is it safe?"
"Yeah, it's all right, go ahead."
But don't go too far.
Thanks.
Bye.
Anybody home?
[flies buzzing]
"You know, you just can't come walking in to somebody's motorhome like this."
"Sorry, Mike."
mom?
Yeah.
"Hey, what's the matter, Billy?"
Never mind.
Is it mike?
Do you like him more than Dad?
"Billy, I like them both in different ways."
"I'll always have strong feelings for your dad 'cause he gave me you, didn't he?"
"Yeah, well, Dad's better looking, and he's smarter."
"Well, Mike's real smart too, he really is."
Are you going to marry him?
I don't know.
"A whole lot depends on you, partner."
"If you do, we have to move to Arizona, and I'll miss my friends, and I'll never see Dad."
"Well, you'll see your father."
"He'll come down all the time and you can go up and visit him, really."
"You like him, don't you?"
"Yeah, I do."
"Billy, just promise me that you'll give Mike a chance."
"I mean, that's all he wants."
"Well, I'll try."
That's all I wanted to hear.
I love you.
Next Thursday.
- That's great.
You have to do it.
- I don't know.
- You have to do it.
- Really?
Yes.
You've never been a part of an actual graduation ceremony.
I know.
That's because my conservative high school... wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.
- Don't be gross.
- You think I should do it?
- You've worked hard.
You've earned it.
- I guess.
Come on.
You know that deep down you really want to do this.
I'll admit I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.
And the hat?
For the tassel.
You know my thing for fringe.
"They call out your name, and people clap, and you get your diploma."
Then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other.
"Very symbolic, very dramatic."
- That's it.
You're doing it.
- If you insist.
- Who do you want to invite?
- I don't know.
You.
- And?
- That's cool with me.
"Okay, if that means that Jackson could use a few thousand hours of therapy, I could've told you that myself."
What if...
It has something to do with his parents?
His real parents.
"Yeah, does anybody actually know what happened to them?"
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Ah...
Ow!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
Because you're kaputt.
Get this guy out of my hair so I can go.
To the kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
"Why, I'll kill you for that!"
Shut up.
"Security officer, huh?"
Always screening everybody.
"Only, who screens you?"
"Great American hero, from Cleveland, Ohio."
Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor.
When was Pearl Harbor?
Or don't you know that?
"- December 7th, '41."
-What time?
Six o'clock.
I was having dinner.
Six o'clock in Berlin.
They were having lunch in Cleveland.
"- Am I boring you, boys?"
-Go on.
"He's a Nazi, Price is."
"For all I know, his name is Preissinger or Preisshoffer."
"Oh, sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back like a good little Bundist."
"He spoke our lingo, so they sent him to spy school and fixed him up with phony dog tags."
He's lying.
He's trying to get himself off the hook.
- He said shut up.
-You heard what he said.
"Okay, Herr Preisshoffer, let's have the mailbox."
The what?
The one you took out from the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Let me show you how they did it.
I'll just take it between us as who gets who first.
"That's how it's gonna be, then."
There won't be no more cows stolen.
"Not from the Wood River Cattle Company... the Bar-Three Cattle Company, or the Haley Cattle Company."
Consider that my last word on the matter.
"Come on, boys, let's have an auction."
"You know, I got a weird feeling."
"Yo, me too."
We're being followed.
Look!
Tell them what you saw here.
"That you, Horn?"
You coming in here after me?
Giddap!
Come on.
Get them up there.
Hang in there.
Come on.
"Let him stop first, then give him slack."
Hitch him up.
Hang in there.
Ease up on him there.
You got him.
"Yeah, he's a good horse."
You go ahead... ride him around a little bit and tire him out.
Keep his head up.
"If you keep his head up, he ain't gonna buck."
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.
"All right, you go ahead and take the rough off of him."
I'll come back after he's quieted down and put a handle on him.
What'll I do if I get into a real storm with this horse?
- So what happened?
- I don't know.
There was a short-circuit...
- I can't believe that.
- Suri.
Wait.
Suri.
- It cut out.
- What cut out?
There was a short
- Ben just told me.
Everything went down.
Why weren't you honest with me?
I looked like an idiot in there.
- I'm sorry.
"- How am I supposed to do my job, knowing you were at the casino the night Lau died?"
"- Yeah, I should have told you that."
"- And yet, once again, you didn't."
"You're the reason I've got to where I am, Harry."
Everything I've learnt has come from you these two years but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you screw it up for me.
Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn't be quite sure who was interviewing who.
"Yeah, you have to think the way they do."
- Should be quite easy for you.
- You'd be a smart arse if you were smart.
Trouble in the dream team?
I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
What?
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
You said you were ready to come back to work.
- I am.
- Let me talk to that prick.
So what's the problem?
"Taylor is playing hardball, he won't budge on the price."
You assured me you could do this.
Do I need to send someone else out there who can make this happen?
"No, I'll get it done."
The clock is ticking.
- I thought you were his favorite.
- Things change.
Let me guess...
"Tall, brown hair."
How did you know?
"When things get stressful, Marcus reverts to his old bad habits."
What does that mean?
His wife.
Tall... brown hair...
"Really quite the beauty, until she wasn't, but I guess we all have our weaknesses, uh?"
- I didn't know he was married.
- Oh yeah.
"A long time ago, it didn't end well."
"Then again, what does?"
I have missed you.
I haven't thought of you once.
Maybe it's time for you to get out.
Maybe it's time for you to shut up!
Close the deal and get out.
"I will, I have to."
"What are you up to, Chase?"
I need change.
What do you mean?
Uh-oh.
Walking me to the couch.
This can't be good.
No.
I just...
I have something really important I need to tell you and...
You could be mad.
Really mad.
But I just care about you too much to not tell you that...
That you're Hannah Montana?
Please don't interrupt me.
This is really...
Huh?
I know you're Hannah Montana.
How?
"It was that blabbermouth Siena, wasn't it?"
Didn't need any help on this one.
You both have the same beautiful eyes.
And amazing smile.
And then there's the fact that I told Miley that my dad.
Was stationed overseas and then two days later.
Hannah had a concert for kids whose parents were stationed overseas.
Hmm.
I was hoping you'd think that was just a coinkydink.
Come on six years and the rest of the world hasn't put it together.
Well the rest of the world isn't in love with Miley Stewart.
You're in love with me?
Yeah.
Um...
Unless you're not in love with me then I take that back.
"Because, you know, I'm cool."
Aw.
Me too.
I'm glad you came.
How can anyone live two years in a place like this?
"The bathroom's clogged, no water, it's disgusting!"
"I'm used to it, but you don't have to be."
"I can't allow you to live in a place like this, you go home tomorrow, there's a train at 9."
"No, I'm yourwife."
- I'm staying here with you.
- But Chicco?
- He has to become independent.
- As of when?
As of now.
"When we're organized, we'II bring him here to live."
"We're a family, we have to stay together."
"It would be wonderful, but I can't allow it."
What's that?
"It's the neighbors, they fight all the time."
Not anymore.
hold me.
But you leave tomorrow.
- Think they're asleep?
- Warrior's rest.
- Let's go home.
"- No, I have an idea."
"We end with a blast, Iet's burn down the town hall."
Aren't you coming?
"No, I have to bodyguard his wife."
Goodnight.
Why don't you stay here?
Be serious.
"It's the first time we've been alone, even Mom's not here."
"It's all pretend here anyway, right?"
Great.
Ayushman.
Sometimes I can't decide... who the bigger rascal is.
Doesn't make a difference.
We're both serving the country.
If you're eager on taking a decision... then decide when I'm going to be CP.
I'll sign on your promotion letter... only when your sister and my son... sign on the marriage certificate.
Even I can't decide Mr. Pradhan... who the bigger rascal is.
What to do Ayushman?
My son's heart is set on your sister.
And my son's wish is my command.
On that note let's celebrate at your house today.
Okay.
- Sir.
- What is it?
The police thrashed Vishal.
They threw him down from the multiplex.
What?
What happened Mr. Pradhan.
That police officer whom you appointed... for Ankita's security thrashed Vishal.
Threw him down from the first floor of Galaxy Multiplex.
Zoravar.
Whoever he is.
That midget beat-up Vishal.
I'll look into it.
- Get the car.
- Yes sir.
- Jadhav.
- Yadav sir.
Whatever.
Get me Galaxy Multiplex CCTV footages now.
Yes sir.
I saw you at the station and your picture later on such a beautiful boy.
"I thought I've got to have him, even if it kills me."
I like your spiel nobody's ever told me that before.
Spieling is my profession.
I kept lobbying with Christine...
and hoping that you would come.
"I like you going for me, Gerard."
"I, dirty old man."

- My God!
"- Hey, what's up?"
Three dead!
Look at those urns!
I'll be damned!
Chrissy's family grave.
She had all three of them cremated.
A fourth and they can play bridge.
- Did you know they were dead?
- Of course.
"The whole town knows, and even pities her."
Pities her?
"She let them die, and I know how!"
"- Oh, come off it!"
- She had one crash with a parachute.
She fed one to the lions and sank the other at sea.
Bet she didn't tell you!
Bullshit!
One of them had to show off in the Safari Park the second one's parachute didn't open and the third...
And who'll be the fourth?
!
- Get your hands off me!
- You or me!
Are you Sicilian?
"No, I'm Calabrese."
"We're practically paisan, do me this favor."
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.
"Besides, the new tenants pay more rent."
How much more a month?
Five bucks.
Here's six months increase in advance.
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.
Come see me in another six months.
"Of course, the dog stays."
Right?
The dog stays.
Who the hell are you to come give me orders?
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass right into the street!
Do me this favor.
I won't forget it.
Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me.
They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
What a character!
That landlord is here...
"Roberto, the one who owns those ratholes."
He's been asking all around the neighborhood about you.
"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Don Vito."
"What can I do for you, Don Roberto?"
What a misunderstanding!
Holy Mary!
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!
I'm giving back the money you gave me.
"Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!"
I guess you never leave here.

We are the glorious Empress nation.

This is my daughter!
What smart!
"The union of nations, This is what solidarity is."
"Well, now what?"
"Now, they managed a stay of execution."
Who are you?
-A idiot.
Thank you.
"Bo, you got it."
"Hello friends, you came."
Sure we have come.
Told Us.
-Where is Ramon?
- Bullying this poor lad!
-
- I saw him leading him by his ear.
-
- Ought to be ashamed!
Get this lot off me!
"Hey, Granville!"
"Get this lot off, Granville!"
He said he wanted people in the shop!
"Funny lot, women, when you look at 'em."
And I often do.
It took me all me time to calm that lot in the shop down before I could start selling.
Then I believe there were one that got away!
"Oh, God, don't say I've started slipping."
"I don't mind wearing glasses, Lord, or even a hearing aid."
"But if it's all the same to you,"
I'd like to stay young and very muscular when it comes to the acquisitive instinct!

# You're in my soul... #
"Right on,man."
That was for Bella.
"- Oh, Mike."
- You'll see my head...
- There we go.
"You can hardly tell, but I thought..."
"When it happened, I was like, ""Great, that'll look like I did that on purpose."""
And then you can't tell.
It looks like I have a spastic neck movement.
- Tom Richmond.
- Tom Richmond.
"It hurt though, really."
I think I was bleeding.
I was actually bleeding from that.
They had to put makeup on it.
- Yeah.
- Mike.
"For the rest of the movie, whenever you see me, I had makeup on."
"No, that's not true."
- It's horrible.
"- Oh, God, that was real vodka."
- It's a controversial shot.
"- Whose voice is that, Pete, yelling?"
"That's Myron Kerstein, our editor's voice heckling Ari."
Those are good names there:
"Adam Brightman, Nathan Kahane, Joe Drake."
- We love Nathan.
- All those names are good too.
- Good names.
"- New York, we love."
- That's a good couple of names.
- Look how cute...
Mike.
I did not really drink alcohol in that previous scene.
"You know, I'm almost sad this negotiation is over."
Why?
I was just starting to enjoy your company.
Same here.
What do you say you and I bill our clients for another two hours?
Let's make it three.
"Oh, hi."
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
"Uh, I followed the flyers."
Well... you found me.
"So unless you're gonna help look for Gabriel,"
I'm kind of busy.
"Well, you know..."
"You know, I was serious the other night."
I mean...
I'd love to see you again.
If you're interested.
I am interested.
But that's the problem.
I don't understand.
How... how is that a problem?
"Look, first off..."
It feels a little like you and your wife haven't totally worked out the open marriage thing.
So that's a little more complicated than I'd like.
And second...
"if I have to be honest,"
I like you.
Which means...
I don't want to share you with anyone.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, Elliot."
Back to business.
"Is it just me, or is Zach perfect?"
"He's good-looking, but not into himself, smart, but not a showoff."
"Athletic, but sensitive."
A politician's son.
"Hey, he's like Newport's Prince William."
"- Yeah, the kind of guy parents love."
"- Hey, did I tell you how stoked my dad is that I'm dating a congressman's son?"
"- He is, like, dying to go have lunch with Zach."
"- So, you going to do it?"
No way.
Remember what a Grade A disaster that was with Cohen?
"- Yeah, but Zach's not Seth."
"- Believe me, I know."
"- So, then what's the problem?"
You afraid he might actually like Zach?
Then you two will live happily ever after with no problems and nothing standing in your way?
- No.
I... no.
"- Oh, so, then you're not over Seth."
"Oh, I am."
I've divested myself of all of Seth's material possessions.
I'm vibrating at an extremely Cohenless frequency.
"- Okay, so, then you don't really like Zach."
- No.
I mean yes.
I don't...
"Ew, shut up."
"Hey, Summer."
Marissa.
Hey.
Come sit down.
Like the disappearance of the Lady Hampshire.
Like love.
Abbs...
"I don't have anything yet, Gibbs."
The computers just got here.
"Well, maybe this stuff will help.; it's all the files we've compiled on the case so far."
What are you doing?
(shutter clicks)
I'm taking a picture of you with my map.
"Trust me, you will thank me later."
"Oh, I know that look."
I like that look.
"The photo of Jarvis and Wickes, where is it?"
"Right here, why?"
What just happened?
Another unexplained phenomena.
"Sometimes, you just have to believe."
Who took the picture?
Haven't we already done this?
VANCE:
"Gibbs, be careful."
RYAN:
The tell.
"Wickes looked at the picture because of who was behind the camera, not in front of it."
"Who took the picture, sir?"
(sighs) Carl Dalton.
He used to go hunting with us.
Does he have a connection to the company?
He's Wickes' half-brother and in-house counsel for Wickes Steel.
DALTON:
"Phillip, what's going on?"
You said you were in trouble?
When you..
"- When you look at the coating, will you beat that guy up on the price?"
Kevin!
That is not a real toilet.
"Dad, what's going on?"
Is everything okay?
Please tell me he's not peeing in the store.
It's nice to take a moment and just relax.
Dad?
I gotta go.
I don't know him and there's no way I'm going near him.
"Grandpa, there's no toilet paper."
Help me get my shirt off.
"You know, the Federal Reserve is a pimp."
They want you to be in debt.
That's how it works.
"They give you these credit cards you can't pay for,"
"HD, motorcycles."
It's all a pimp game.
I BELIEVE IN ANGELS
"God, grant me the serenity To accept the things"
I cannot change.
Grant me courage To change the things I can.
And wisdom To know the difference.
Marcus Aurelius (121-180)
No blessing.
I'm not giving my blessing.
Where would she go without a blessing?
"Shut up, woman."
"A fine job you did, raising her."
What I've been telling you?
It's a pet scheme of mine.
- A recreation spot for the kids.
"- Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?"
"No, it's for the big fellas too."
You'd be surprised how tremendously it's helped to keep the kids from becoming...
Hoodlums like me?
- You've cost me a lot of prayer.
- I've been in kind of a retreat myself.
- Yes.
Will you be here for some time?
- Depends.
I got a little business to attend.
- I gotta find a place to live.
- Get a room here in the parish.
- Not a bad idea.
No place like home.
"- Yes, and it's great to have you home."
- I came back to take a look at your kisser.
- Stick around and take a lot of them.
This is Maggione's.
Go in and get a furnished room.
"Remember her, don't you?"
Took a lot of good lead pipe out of that cellar.
Church is just around the corner.
I can drop in to see you from time to time.
- See you at Mass Sunday?
- Sure.
I'll help you with your collection.
- It's a deal.
- Fair enough.
- Mrs. Maggione at home?
- What do you want?
Things are crazy at work.
Because of this case.
Remember what I told you before?
What?
How the Jap raped a woman?
What about it?
You filthy slut.
That woman.
It was her.
What the hell are you talking about?
That woman he raped- it's the same woman whose house burned down.
"She went crazy after that, and used to run around naked at night."
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.
"She was totally covered in rashes and boils,"
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.
Are you out of your mind?
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.
You worthless bastard.
It was your theory.
I was just messing with you.
Who in their right mind would believe crap like that?
"No, I think you're right."
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.
Gimme a break.
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!
What?
Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
Say it again in Japanese if you dare
Say it again!
- Get out of my way!
- I dare you!
"Come on, guys!"
Faster!
Tado!
"Baso, kill him!"
I'm holding down his feet!
Beat him up!
I'm holding down his feet again!
Stop!
All of you!
What is it?
What the hell?
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
Stop!
Stop!
Yoshi...
Yoshimura
You're in big trouble
You have the nerve to beat me up
Let's kill him!
Shut your mouth!
Excuse us!
Let us through!
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
I'll kill you all
"Let's do it, Father, before the Japanese kill us all"
Why the hell did you provoke him when you knew he'd kill us all?
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds that can only chase and hunt and know nothing of self-restraint
How much longer do I have to put up with you?
"Stop, I said."
Get out.
Now!
Everything started on that day?
I'll try speaking to the Father.
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
It's like he was a figment of my imagination.
PHILIP:
I'm fairly certain I'm not welcome here.
Ding-ding-ding.
It's late.
I've been sitting here waiting to make a scene for hours.
What do you want?
I'm very lonely.
That's unfortunate.
I don't like teaching creative writing as much as I assumed I would.
"Well, you're a cruel, miserable person, so it makes sense you'd end up in a miserable situation."
What happened to my desk?
That's my bonus desk.
- Nobody at the school likes me.
- Nobody here likes you.
I think I might resign and come home.
(MUMBLING) You don't live here.
You live upstate.
"No, I don't want that to be my home."
It's lonely and sad and the faculty have turned on me.
Boo-hoo!
The last few weeks have been so hard for you.
Whose cat is this?
It's my cat.
- We don't have a cat.
- Apparently I do.
"Oh, look, see?"
There it is.
"Come here, big boy."
This is Gadzookey.
"Gadzookey, meet Philip."
Don't get attached.
You can read my mind!
You really understand me.
You talk in such a romantic way!
"It's late, let's go to bed."
That's good.
You first.
"No, you first..."
Come on!
"No, I mean, I dare not, I really dare not."
"Come on, just give me some face."
"No, I..."
"Alright, I'll listen to you."
I think my husband doesn't like me any more.
"We have married for 7 years, and I went to Britain for one year."
He didn't look at my eyes when he talked to me.
"I can't help, so I didn't look at his eyes when I talked to him too."
"Foon, he sent me to university and wanted me to study law, actually, I studied something else."
What's that?
Fashion design.
What kind of subject is it?
Needlework.
Woo!
What a wonderful world.
The world has changed a lot!
Even needlework can be a subject in the university!
So you should go out to see the world.
You've rung my bell!
A man should fight for his future!
I think I should go somewhere!
"Maybe the nearest city, Hong Kong."
Are you going to Hong Kong?
"Yes, Master."
In this forest... he pursues you!
- Shit!
- What the hell...?
Welcome to the area of death.
The energies are useless here.
Who says it?
The magnetic field.
Download charged particles.
So Trajan was wrong?
Shit!
I do not give up!
"Hatta, let's flank it."
You're hurt?
Of course not...
I can not say the same thing about Trajan's partner.
Bill Carson.
"You found old Bill, huh?"
He was a Spartan-5.
And a friend.
"Establish a perimeter, we'll camp here."
And give him a decent funeral.
Ash has something special.
I have something for him.
"We walked together, side by side."
He waited to see me fall.
I never fall
I wanted to inoculate his black blood.
"I'll find you, Ash!"
Because you messed with the wrong gangster!
"Why do you always read the same book, Kix?"
What makes it so special?
"""Men do not perish in the results of lost wars,  But the loss of that resistance force"
"Did you park on the street, or did you use valet?"
"Street, 'cause i-I can't afford valet."
Good.
Meter or lot?
Meter.
And i went to a coffee shop to get some change.
"Okay,give me all the alleys in the area"
By commercial buildings near the hotel.
Now you said you threw the knife in the alley where you parked.
Is it any of these?
"These are near stores,"
If you threw the knife near where you got the change.
Um... it's one of those.
Is it that one just off fordham road?
"Yes,yes."
That's it.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
You did all right.
Print that.
We'll get our guys down there and check it out.
Looks like our paralegals have found something.
Let's hope it's a knife.
L.A.P.D. Is really working this one.
They love big media cases almost as much as we do.
"We found something over here,mr."
Nicholson.
"Oh,nice."
"Well,who says trial work isn't glamorous?"
Who's got a glove?
"I do,mr."
Nicholson.
Instantly regretted.
- Where did you learn that phrase?
"- It's true, sir."
"Threatening officers is serious, but given your clean sheet I'll be lenient."
Two dozen lashes.
- I said six.
- March him out.
Right turn.
Forward march.
There were many people who heard me say six.
It was not your decision to make.
- Did you take note of that phrase?
"- Phrase, sir?"
"""An impulse, instantly regretted."""
It may mean nothing.
"But in my opinion, he'd been drilled in it."
"- Drilled, sir?"
By whom?
- I wish I knew.
- He remembered his piece.
"- It didn't save him, did it?"
It helped.
Only two dozen.
Scott-Padget must have nigh run mad.
- You know what two dozen means?
- Shut your mouth.
It means a soft captain.
My old captain on the Swift he never gave less than six dozen.
"Yes, that's what he gave me."
Six dozen.
Look here!
All hands on deck to witness punishment!
Sit right down.
"Well, I..."
"Well, I'll just take a sip."
"- Of course, I shouldn't stay too long."
"- Oh, nonsense."
Nonsense.
You can stay as long as you like.
"After all, we have all evening, haven't we?"
Of course we have.
Here.
There.
"Oh, I like your singing."
Yes.
You must sing again for me sometime.
Where did you get such a pretty voice?
"Well, I don't know."
I just...
Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?
- Well...
"- Very lovely, where it comes from."
"- Well, here's health so good luck."
"- I make my own luck, my dear."
"Yes, and tonight I follow the rainbow."
"Oh, you don't half talk, do you?"
Perhaps we could follow it together?
"- I'll follow it right home, mister."
- To that rattrap?
"- Hey, what are you calling names?"
- I think you deserve something better.
How do you know where I live?
"Well, I can imagine."
Surely your wages here don't earn you a place in Barkley Square.
"Alright, we'll find her a spot with a good view so that she can watch her daddy throw up."
"I'll take her, Jake."
Yeah?
"Thanks, Peyton."
Glad to.
"Alright, gather around."
Where's Nathan?
"Tim, you're his girlfriend, where is he?"
"I don't know, coach."
He was at school today.
Alright.
I've got some offensive sets worked out here.
Line up at the low stacks.
So I had an idea.
Okay.
Remember when I read that Steinberg book?
Steinbeck.
"Yeah, that guy."
And then you did something that I wanted.
"Oh yeah, yeah."
"Getting drunk, tattooed and grounded?"
But in a fun way.
I'm thinking we should try that again.
"Okay, you might want to run that by Keith first."
"Not exactly that, I just, I want to know everything about you."
And I want you to know... almost everything about me.
"- What's going on, Brooke?"
- Nothing.
I just...
"I want to know you better, Luke."
"So how about, the next time you do something you love, you bring me along, and then we trade."
Are you busy after practice tomorrow?
Fire!
Who's that out there?
What's happening?
Goss.
- Has Defiant been taken?
"- Why, no, sir."
Whose...
Whose voices?
"Mr. Scott-Padget, the captain."
Did Goss tell you?
- I took the Venetians.
- Did we lose many men?
- A dozen or so.
- And wounded:
About threescore.
"Excuse me, I'm needed."
"Before she went down, we took a great deal off her."
"Crates full, en route to France."
But there's a much bigger prize.
Bring in the Frenchman!
"You wouldn't believe it but this figure is Colonel Giraud, a political advisor to Napoleon."
"All right, take him away."
It's fortunate that Colonel Giraud omitted to destroy all his papers.
He knows of plans for the invasion of England.
- Does he know when?
"- Within the next few weeks, sir."
He must be sent to London.
Of course.
"After I make the necessary repairs, we shall make all speed."
- You've done extremely well.
"- Thank you, sir."
"And, Mr. Scott-Padget this crew serves well, if you don't drive them too hard."
I only asked.
This is an outrage.
I'm warning you.
I have powerful friends in London.
You'll hear more of this.
[Door shuts]
[Door opens]
You're going through a lady's room.
No gentleman would behave this way.
"No, you're right."
"But then again, murder isn't a very gentlemanly business, miss harwood."
I can't imagine what you hope to find.
"It seems on the night of the murder, you left the room before the shots were fired."
Who told you that?
I have nothing to hide.
"I hate the dark, I always have."
It's like claustrophobia.
"As soon as the lights went out, I had to get back here."
In the dark?
I told you.
I wasn't thinking.
I just had to get out.
Just a minute.
"Foyle, is this the way your men amuse themselves?"
I've had enough of this.
I'm not gonna be pushed around by some bloody stuffed shirt.
I want to leave.
"Still not possible, I'm afraid."
Fleming:
"I said, I want to go!"
"Officer, arrest this man."
Thank you.
"Only maybe I was buying a lot more than that, and didn't know it."
"McGee, 25 Palmetto Street."
It was a nice little house.
"He'd probably paid 4 or 5000 for it, before houses went up."
"From all I hear, it would probably bring 15 G's by now."
"And here was this guy, McGee, all nicely reformed."
"Chances are, it's the first house he ever lived in."
"When this is over, go see him, Father."
You two would get along.
But I had something else on my mind right then.
- What'll it be?
"- Phone company, checking calls."
Did you get one f rom St. Louis a little while ago?
"- Hiya, Murdock?"
"- Okay, McGee."
Step right in.
"Oh, McGee, this is Mike."
"Hiya, Mike?"
I'm fine now.
- What a nice place you've got.
- lt's messed up right now.
"Joe, that's my kid, he brought this junk back f rom Japan."
Joe took this off a Nip colonel.
Ain't it a pip?
"Almost cut your head off, didn't I?"
Joe says these are new.
- Those are German.
- That's what Joe said.
How'd you know?
I'd turn them into Army ordnance.
Start coughing too hard there'll be nothing left but the gold in your teeth.
Holy smoke!
So?
JOHN:
"So, do we talk to the mother?"
What if she tips off Lila?
She wouldn't do that.
"She wouldn't do that, not Lila."
Have you heard from Lila?
"No, I haven't, not since last summer."
"Sometime around June, July."
"Mr. Dixon, you know Lila, you know she wouldn't do what they're saying she did."
"They must have kidnapped her, brainwashed her."
"Miss Walker, some of the best policemen in this country are after Lila and those other two fellas."
"Now, they're going to catch them too."
It will go a lot better for Lila if she turns herself in.
"Chief Dixon is right, ma'am."
"I can't make any promises, but if your daughter cooperates with us, that will be taken into account later."
I haven't heard from her.
"But if I do, I'll tell her what you said."
"Ronnie, you heard from your sister?"
"No, sir."
Would you tell us if you had?
"Yes, sir."
Grandma...
I'm hungry.
MRS. WALKER:
"Byron, don't bother us now, honey."
JOHN:
Who's that?
That's Lila's boy.
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?
And he's a pretty boy too.
Thanks for your time.
The victims are all over the map.
"Four men, three women."
Different ethnicities and ages.
Each of the victims had something removed...
"An ear, an eye, a finger."
Why?
What's the significance of that?
There is none.
"And because of the randomness, no one was able to connect the murders."
"Until Phillip Harris, of course."
So Phillip was right.
A serial killer's been hunting in L.A. and New York for three years completely under the radar.
All this way for a dead end.
"Oh, it might be for the best."
Ignorance is bliss.
"No, ignorance is hell."
Mr. Castle.
The GDS is requesting my presence at headquarters.
This must mean I passed their test and they want me to join their ranks.
"I hate to burst your fanboy bubble, but how do you know this is on the up-and-up?"
Is this on the up-and-up?
"Yes, sir."
What are you doing?
Watching your back.
Oh.
"Uh, we have..."
Hello.
"Mr. Castle, Ms. Shipton. [Door closes]"
It's a pleasure to meet both of you.
I'm Mason Wood.
What a pleasure.
I cannot even believe I'm here.
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
"Baby,I'm sorry."
"Oh,my God!"
Happy birthday.
"This is like some kind of,like,nightmare or something."
Happy birthday.
"No,happy birthday."
No.
You know what?
"Forget it,man."
Hit the road.
"No,no,no,we suld,like,celebrate or something."
No.
I'm in the middle of a gig here.
Okay?
That's right.
Gigging right now.
Bella!
Bella!
Really?
You are gonna hitch your hope wagon to Johnny Tearducts?
There are higher forces at work here.
I'm just trying to avoid dying alone.
He wasn't a bad guy.
So he's a little passionate.
Whatever.
Didn't he try to suck your blood?
Drink my blood.
Like in a nice way.
I was just going to check out his show and see what happens.
I'm going to tell you exactly what's going to happen.
"You're going to go; he's going to sing a couple songs about rainbows,get a little misty and then you're going to be right back here telling me how you're afraid that your lady parts have closed up."
Oh!
- What shall we make of that?
"- Made your point, Fi."
- Did I?
- Yep.
You did.
What about D.C.?
- You still goin'?
- I have to.
"If I don't, it won't be long before Cowan sends someone else here to kill me."
I need him to know I can get to him too.
I need him to know right now.
And you need help.
And you know it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Is that a tactical judgment or a personal one?
- Both.
Everybody I know is in danger right now- everyone I'm close to.
Well...
I'm willing to risk it... if you are.
- How's my mom?
- Locked up cozy and tight with a cigarette and a shotgun... ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
"- Here you go, Doug."
My lucky vest.
- It'll look great over my shirt.
- Thanks.
"- It's a little worn, but it'll do the trick."
- Are these bullet holes?
- Yeah.
I broke it in for you.
It's a short ride to the U.S. Attorney's office.
Just think of it as a precaution.
It's like a seat belt.
"This isn't working, Allan."
"You are always so distant, so concerned with climbing the ladder."
"For us, Syd."
It was always for us.
I believe you.
I do.
"But somewhere along the line, you actually forgot about me."
"I mean, look at us."
We don't even fight with passion anymore.
"The hot and cold I can take, but this numbness in between..."
So does that make this all okay?
"No, it doesn't make it okay."
But don't pretend like I'm the only one with secrets.
Look at your face.
You think I actually believe that was an accident?
"No, I just was trying to get ahead, Syd."
That's all I've ever done.
"Well, maybe trying to get ahead, you just fell behind."
Okay.
I'll go...
I'll go get a hotel.
"Allan, wait..."
"Can I get a J D straight up, please?"
Big night ahead?
Epic.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Can I get another one?
"Preferably in a bigger glass, if you don't mind."
"That's the biggest glass I got, sir."
I guess I'll be keeping you busy then tonight.
None of them fit.
I'm not paying for it!
I didn't say a thing.
"Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye."
Stop with those fuckin' drugs.
They're making your mind into mush!
Ya hear me?
I'll take 'em back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
"And since I was going to see them later in the afternoon, to pick up a delivery I was pretty sure I'd get my money back."
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got there at the hospital to pick up Michael, his doctor wanted to put me in bed."
Jesus Christ!
What happened to you?
I almost got into an accident driving' over here.
And I said I was partying all night.
"No, I'm fine, doc."
Get over here.
Let me check you out.
"He took mercy on me, gave me Valium and sent me home."
"Now, my plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen."
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
Right in front of us there.
I think it's been following me all morning.
-Get the fuck out.
Are you nuts?
-l'm telling you.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
(GEESE honking )
(GASPS ) sir.NMiss Kingsleigh is distracted today.
Where's your head?
I was wonderingNwhat it would be like to fly.
Why would you spend your time thinking aboutNsuch an impossible thing?
Why wouldn't I?
My father said he sometimes believedNin six impossible things before breakfast.
(SOFTLY) Come along.
meet me under the gazeboNin precisely 1 0 minutes.
(faith EXHALlNG EX ClTEDLY)
We have a secret to tell you.
Nthen it's not much of a secret.
-Perhaps we shouldn't.N-We decided we should.
she won't be surprised.
-Will you be surprised?
N-Not if you tell me.
Nyou have to.
we won't.
I wonder if your mother knows that you two swim nakedNin the Havershims' pond.
but I would.
There's your mother right now.
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.
You've ruined the surprise!
I could strangle them!
Everyone went to so much effortNto keep the secret.
Does everyone know?
It's why they've all come.NThis is your engagement party.
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.NWhen you say yes...
But I don't knowNif I want to marry Hamish.
then?
NYou won't do better than a lord.
Alice.NThat pretty face won't last forever.
How is that thing?
"If somebody, like, does a little flick to it,"
Will it-- blow on that sign and see if it blows over.

MAN:
Did you guys dig deep?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"The astrological signs are down,"
But the signs are up.
Cold pizza after 10 hours of straight shooting.
It was cold pizza.
INTERVIEWER:
"Well, if you'll remember, the first five hours"
"Today, we didn't shoot at all."
It wasn't your fault.
"Yeah, but food is not determined,"
"Like, by how footage we shoot."
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]
It's usually determined by how long the day goes by.
INTERVIEWER:
"How's the experience been so far, Mike?"
"It fucking sucks, man. [laughs]"
"I'm sleeping bad, losing 20 pounds a week."
MAN:
"Oh, that's not [inaudible]."
"Yeah, actually, I need to lose the weight."
So it's all right.
INTERVIEWER:
So you love Troma?
I love Troma.
I'm excited to do the next one.
[Laughter]
- We are.
What's happening in D.C.?
I'm working on legislation that would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It will be like taking 100 million cars right off the street.
- It'd be groundbreaking.
- Impressive.
- The other...
- For the record?
I don't see why I should be the one to take the fall for this.
- I wasn't the only one that knew.
- You're bearing the brunt because you're here.
"Believe me, I wish that Tommy and Kevin were here too."
- Is it always like this?
- You dreamed of having a baby sister.
"Sarah, you know what?"
"I was six, OK?"
That wish didn't include Dad cheating on Mom.
"I didn't know what to do, Kitty."
So I thought the best thing to do was nothing.
So shoot me.
Oh.
Do you like cigars?
I got some good ones and we could...
That would be great.
You didn't know what to do so you did nothing.
"I would've told you, Sarah!"
"Justin, where are you?"
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
- I can't make it.
I'm sorry.
- What?
My mom's been cooking all day.
She's very upset.
This is no good.
You got to straighten this thing out.
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what the hell she's gonna do.
She's hysterical.
Very excited.
She's wild.
And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
"I'm not saying you gotta go back to her this minute, but you got to go back."
You got to keep up appearances.
The two of them come to my house every day.
I can't have it.
"I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it."
Nobody says you can't do what you want.
We all know that.
This is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.
"You got to go home, okay?"
Look at me.
You got to go home.
Smarten up.
I'll talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'll say you'll go back to her and it'll be like when you first got married.
You'll romance her. lt'll be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her.
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa this weekend to pick up something for me.
Me.
... who has dedicated his entire life...
How would you like to be lmogene's godfather?
... to himself.
You must be joking.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"The thing is, a person's life is like a TV show."
"Oh, my God."
- Can I come in?
- No.
"I was the star of ""The Will Show""."
"And ""The Will Show"" wasn't an ensemble drama."
You will end up childless and alone.
"Both fingers crossed, yeah."
And then something terrible happened.
Something I'd tried to avoid all my life.
"This year, Will's life is going to change."
"Alone, bad."
"Friend, good."
He's reaching out.
I want to go out with her.
- I'd like her to be my girlfriend.
- Brilliant!
"Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
He fancies you.
He told me.
"From the producers of ""Meet the Parents""."
I think I killed a duck.
"Jesus, what a family."
I was in some strange territory.
Was I frightened?
If you have the meetings in the evening... nobody wants to come out.
Everybody's just so afraid.
It's a question of what you people really want to do.
Do you want this community or what?
"Ted, I realize that we are the community."
That's right.
Nothing's going to happen until we do what I said.
Are you down with o.p.p.?
You know me.
I really do understand that.
We just can't go around...
Let's cross the street.
Put your hand down.
"- Hey, man."
- You want this?
What for?
I ain't crossing' the street for nobody.
"Leave me alone, Maxine."
"- Dad, come on."
"- Ted, don't be crazy."
- Are you scared?
"- Yeah, I'm scared."
I don't have to prove nothing to nobody.
"I want to see a hero, I'll rent Rambo."
"You go ahead on, then."
We got to get these young people involved in this.
What did I just say?
I said give me the green.
"You lucky that didn't break, old man."
"See you later, old man."
Don't see me later.
"See me now, punk... 'cause I ain't crossin' no street."
"- No, I can't deal with this."
- You have a strange way of dressing.
"- See you, Sis."
I'll see myself out.
Locker rooms abound in peckers.
- He positioned himself oddly.
- You're such a prude.
"Christ, it's not really that bad."
- I rather like it.
- It's sweet.
But it's not art.
It's crap.
"Artistically, it's a piece of crap."
- It is bad.
- But not for an old lady.
"Still, do we want to buy it or burn it?"
"You're such a snob, Casper."
"Because a handicapped person painted it, you think it's crap."
- I think it's crap because it is.
- Only because a handicapped...
I've got nothing against handicapped people.
I like them.
- Sometimes your view of people...
- I've got nothing against retards.
Not the slightest.
Casper even shagged a retard.
You've been with a retard?
"Casper, have you?"
"- Yes, but it was before your time."
- I don't care when it was.
"Jesus Christ, you always think with your prick!"
At least I don't give monotonous head.
She used to get so mad at me every time I'd talk about you.
She thought I had a secret crush on you.
Maybe she was right.
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- What?
"Well, I'm asking you if you want to have dinner with me."
I...
I have to...
I have to think about it.
I'll have to ask Claire.
- All right.
- Okay.
"""D""!"
Congratulations!
You're improving!
I still don't understand what you're saying about twin primes.
- I'm explaining it to you!
- But I still don't understand.
Don't you know that it's possible to remove an infinite number of elements from an infinite set and still HAVE an infinite number of elements left over?
We spent quite a bit of time on this already!
My... my wife understood this on our first date!
Class dismissed!
Get out of here!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Very enjoyable dinner.
- Did you cook it yourself?
"- Yes, I did."
- What a liar.
"- Yes, I am."
What?
"That's teenager for ""okay."""
"Now, you see what happens when you..."
"Oh, God, I do sound like that."
(cell phone chimes)
Yes!
"Thank you, God!"
You passed the evaluation?
Close enough.
I'm on probation!
- Congratulations.
- Wow.
- Probation party!
- What did you do to turn it around?
A lot of things I'm ashamed of!
"Waitress, a round of hot water and lemon for my friends!"
"Previously on ""2 Broke Girls""..."
"I am choosing to take this disaster as a sign, and while they're rebuilding this place"
I'm gonna go surprise Randy and try to rebuild us!
"Fine, use my car, but I'm going to be driving it."
I'm coming with you.
I finally got the gas pedal extension where I like it.
I'll just call AAA.
Cool.
"Later, hater."
"Wait, you're really leaving?"
Who leaves someone on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere?
"My friend, Sloppy Joe, has a one-engine plane."
He might be able to fly y'all all the way to LA.
"Well, that's a wrap on the first day of filming here in Austin, Texas."
So Randy's not in Los Angeles?
He's in Texas?
So if you wanna make more money and keep the money that you make better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
From your Valentine's bitch.
PS:
"And on my face."""
"That's my favourite, I like the way she remembered the face."
It's funny how all these cards seem to be in the same handwriting.
Your admirers are either very young or have severe learning difficulties.
Which is possible.
The handwriting's bad cos they were strumming one out as they wrote 'em.
Not you writing with your left hand?
You're just jealous cos I got loads and you got none.
- I got a card.
- If it's your nan it doesn't count.
- I didn't get any then.
- I did get a card.
A proper one.
- Total bollocks.
I was thinking of an annual donation of one million dollars for four years.
But I need more time to think through   which projects I want to get involved with.
So don't get your hopes up too high.
Okay...
I was given a different impression.
"Then let's look at the papers again, because..."
"No, no."
Let's forget the boring paperwork until Monday.
We'll have lunch and I'll let you know what I've decided.
- I've got a busy weekend coming up.
- So I've heard.
I spoke to the guy that drove me here.
He's marrying your daughter?
"- Yes, Christian."
You're not married?
- No.
- Got any family here?
"- No, I don't."
Then come to the wedding tomorrow.
It's a huge wedding.
I don't know half of the guests myself.
- It would be nice.
- I need to...
You don't have any other plans.
We're through.
See you tomorrow?
We're looking forward to it.
- Then I can get to know you.
- Thanks for your time.
"- Hey, dad!"
- How are you?
Were you jumping on the trampoline?
Danny's been moping around all day.
"Oh, please."
"Come on, they're grown men."
Not like they're moping around the streets like some Backstreet Boys video from the '90s.
"Let's do this, you oily donkey."
You're not wearing your diamond stud.
No.
I just wear this for fun.
"I'm off duty, babe."
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Work the alley by yourself.
This is the alley where anything goes.
OK.
"Charlotte said, uh, Trent has the diamond at his apartment."
She wants to know if she should go sleep with him.
Excuse me.
What?
No.
- Tell her no.
- Finally I got to make out with Adam.
"That lunatic's back only if you go before... by the way, my legs..."
Nobody else hear that?
I'm all packed up.
"Going to head to the bar,"
Close early so we can all celebrate the engagement together.
You are still welcome if you want to come.
Nah.
I'm good.
All right.
"Well, if you, uh, if you change your mind, just, you know, come."
- What's wrong with you?
She was probably raped like her sister.
Help me turn her over.
She was forced from behind too.
They have been in the water for two days.
- Where does this road lead?
- To the river.
- What are those photos for?
- El Caso.
- How did you find out?
- I got a call.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Get out of here.
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!
"I'm leaving, I'm leaving!"
Go on.
Handle this discreetly and solve it as soon as possible.
I promise you'll be rewarded.
"The harvest begins soon, and we can't lose it."
We already have enough problems with the strike.
Your ticket back to Madrid.
"They weren't killed here, there's no blood."
Someone drove them here and dumped them.
The tire tracks double back.
He changed his mind and turned around.
Maybe he saw someone and got nervous.
Someone has to tell the parents.
"You're from here, they know you."
You guys do it.
We have to see them every day.
I'll do it.
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll tryto find out.
See you Saturday.
Did you find out anything?
"Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
Bring up their photos.
The left clavicle on this one is higher than the right.
That's an indication of handedness.
SAROYAN:
"Also, his left deltoid is slightly more developed."
And he parts his hair to the right.
"I mean, most lefties do that."
MONTENEGRO:
Jake Tompkins.
I'll call Booth and let him know.
AUBREY:
"So, this hood isn't exactly screaming ""drug dealer."""
You sure we got the right address?
"Well, Tompkins is not your, you know, usual drug dealer."
He runs a very efficient business.
"Well, I mean, he has to have slipped up somewhere."
Otherwise he wouldn't be in the database.
"Well, he was charged, but he was never convicted, you know?"
"Like I said, he's very careful."
(doorbell ringing)
Yo.
(doorbell rings) (whistles)
Jake Tompkins?
FBI.
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Special Agent James Aubrey.
How can I help you?
Ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw Aldo Clemens?
"Sorry, don't know him."
"Look at the photo, Jake, okay?"
Clemens was found dead this morning.
"Alive, even."
"Lowe, did we I.D the fingerprints yet?"
–There's a backlog.
–Backlog?
I cant find her if I can't I.D her.
Give me that.
Have your guys do door knocks.
Talk to every neighbor.
"Tell everyone if they find anything, give me a call."
This is Detective Wagenbach.
I told you I needed a rush on those prints.
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.
"And if she is, I'd hate to see your backlog cost her her life."
–You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
–You were gone for an hour.
Jesus!
She's all over my ass about this Tio connection.
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.
–Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
–You are lying to her.
"–What, are you trying to be a wiseass?"
"–No, I'm just..."
Just shut the hell up!
–Christ!
–Where are we headed?
I got things to do.
I gave you guys to Aceveda for the day.
–What?
"–Apparently, a group of male hustlers... is hangin' out on the same block as Aceveda's campaign headquarters."
He's setting up a sting operation.
I have an infarct.
-An infarct?
-A ass infarct.
-A ass infarct?
-You are really vulgar.
It is an infarct ass.
-Its a joke.
You do not get upset.
"-No, clear that no."
If it passes a ass not it I can watch?
"We go, you make the peace."
-I do not want.
-It is truth what they say?
-What?
That you have chosen Medicine to study the birds.
Then it had to make Veterinary medicine?
no?
"Not them birds, ""love birds"","
Those that flies around the asses.
It is a old fashioned joke.
"We go, boys."
Prof. Cicchirini he is on the verge of arriving.
"You hear, you who you know everything to it, I can bathe if I have diarrhoea?"
"Yes, if you have much."
"We go, it is behind schedule."
I always have much.
"Italy, Italia."
"Land of saints, poets, navigators."
"You goes, never had said it to me."
"Good, I first do not try to be."
"You hear, Moroni, you cannot be here, if you sees Prof. him Ciotti, trouble is armed."
"It does not matter to me, I assume the risk."
You think?
That's it.
Pull over.
"You know, Phil, I wanted to support you on this."
"I'm a firm believer in livestock in the home, but you are out of control."
"No, I'm in control..."
More than ever.
"And if me getting what I want inconveniences people a little, then so be it."
Oh.
"Uh, she's nervous."
The guy said you should let her suck on your hair.
"Okay, that is it."
I am done.
♪ Enough of this ridiculousness ♪
"And thank you, Phil, for making me appreciate Mitchell."
"He may have his faults, but at least he's not a crazy person."
"Phil, honey."
"Yes, Claire."
I got an alpaca...
Again.
And there's nothing you can say about it.
I'm not saying anything.
What's the problem?
"Mom, dad!"
There is a camel in the living room!
It's not a c...
- I-I just can't.
- Okay.
I see you've all met Jolene two.
"Sadly, the original Jolene that your mother made me return was cruelly adopted by a children's hospital."
"You see, something hit me this morning when that truck didn't hit me this morning..."
I have not been in control of my own life.
"- Much better, Donna."
Thanks.
Listen I didn't thank you how I should have yesterday.
Going through all that with me at the hospital.
It's okay.
What'd your wife say when you told her what happened?
"Not too much, you know."
Did you talk with her about taking walks?
"Yeah, we may do that."
You didn't tell her.
I didn't want to worry her.
"Besides, it turned out to be nothing."
What happened yesterday wasn't nothing.
The doctor said I should take the treadmill test but he doesn't think there's a problem.
"What the doctor said was, you're under extreme stress, you need to relax and he suggests taking long walks after work."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Look, I'm okay."
I'm fine.
Thanks.
- Detective.
- Thanks.
My boss is leaving town.
He wants to hear your prep on the Ortiz testimony.
- He'll come here if necessary.
"- Yeah, all right."
Tomorrow at 2:00?
Tomorrow at 2.
Is Stan Heywood there?
"Stan, John Kelly."
I'm Robin's friend.
I got something for you.
Whenever you want me to drop it by.
There is no enough time to wait for a suitable donor.
The only option left is to arrange for an organ illegally through an agent.
But...
It's very expensive.
I have lost hope fully!
My brother...
Don't say that now...
I'm here to help you.
I'll be there for you.
Listen.
I'm expecting a payment this week.
Give me 2 to 3 days.
I'll somehow arrange for the money.
No.
"No, Vikram."
- Don't talk like an idiot.
This is your brother's life.
That's the priority now.
You proceed with arrangements for the transplant.
We will take care of the rest later.
Priya.
Thank you so much.
"A boat load of lies, in those big beautiful eyes of yours."
"You girl, are an anaconda in the disguise of an innocent child."
So...
What's the next plan?
Erode.
Are we going by bus or by train?
Go!
Go fast.
Are you sure it's Vikram?
"Yes, I'm tracking the number you gave."
"Uh, excuse me."
Is there an OrangeJulius stand on this floor?
I'll sell you this one.
It's almost full.
Why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
He'll be back.
"As for your case, don't you worry."
"I've argued in front of every judge in the state, often as a lawyer."

"You know, we should really stop hiring him."
[ Whistle Tooting ]
- Cool train.
Where does it go?
- Beats me.
But it won't be back for three hours and 40 minutes.
- Once it had snow on it.
"- Wow, Bart!"
Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want.
My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys.
"Well, I'm sure you'd like to be alone with your possessions."
"Um, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer... you can have this blazer."
- It's a Bob Mackie original.
- Wow!
A Bob Mackie!
"Uh... sorry, Bart."

"The rest you choose yourself, congratulation."
I though you wanted to get back in the field.
"If you want to stay here til the war is over and then go back to see your wife and child, thats ok.."
Off course not.
The war is not over.
"-Thanks, sir."
-Bravo.
You wont miss the fish.
No fish with this colour in norway.
No!

Its likely very beautiful there this time of year.
Its allways beautiful.
Do you know what i miss the most with Norway?
The View
-Whereever you look.
-Yes.
Starting to be a very long time ago.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
$0?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.

- No.

"Yes, money."

Right.
So who was I?
You were the voice in my head.
Like Emile Sayles is...
Like Emile Sayles is a voice in Liz Kenyon's head.
Only she wants him out.
That's what she told me.
"Now, when you used to hear my voice, where were we?"
Where we were putting in the work.
Backyard.
You making me work the heavy bag.
So when she thinks of him is where they put in the hours.
He started working with her in middle school.
So she wants him out.
Maybe she takes him back to where he climbed in.
I've got agents covering 100 possible targets up and down the west coast.
I can't drag away assets because you and I are working out some family crap.
"Well, you know, I thought we were catching Kevin Whitfield's killer."
Me and you.
It's a three-hour drive from here.
We can make it by opening bell.
Let's go.
[Bell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
Can you tell me... why are we here?
I don't want you anymore.
It's been long enough.
I'm leaving you here.
You think you brought me here?
!
I brought you!
"This one time, he didn't want to drink out of my latte."
Oh!
"We're doing a good thing, saving Lana from this scumbag."
"Yeah, but, which one of us is going to save her?"
Now I'm wondering if you're a racist.
"No, come on."
You know what?
"No, we can't do this."
Remember what happened the last time we competed over a girl?
"Okay, first, we need to go to a place that has money."
"Yeah, then we need to go to a place that has pants."
Yeah.
You know what?
You are absolutely right.
"From now on, we will only hit on girls whose boyfriends are not in the hospital."
Yeah.
Classy.
- Is Dr. Lonsdale coming?
"- No, he said you should handle it."
"Okay, well, that's, like, three babies."
That seems like plenty.
"They're quintuplets, doctor."
There's two more.
Are you (Bleep) Kidding me?
This has seen better days.
"Hey, sexy."
We got to talk.
Things are getting out of hand at work.
I delivered quintuplets.
I hope.
"I mean, I didn't really actually count them at the end."
Congratulations!
It's so depressing.
I thought your friends asked you to live with them.
In a postwar building
On a street that's not even numbered.
It's lettered.
And its big selling point is that it's above a falafel stand.
"All right, well, listen, hey, I gotta go."
"There's no v.I.P. Area,"
But there's a nice set of bleachers.
Blair?
"You probably don't remember us,"
But we met you at your mom's fashion show.
"Uh, yeah, of course."
Hair band girl.
I never forget a good accessory.
We're celebrating.
We just got the most amazing apartment ever.
"You would totally approve- prewar, doorman,"
And the best part-fauchon is supposedly opening up next door.
Can I ask you something?
What do you think about falafel?
Ew.
Isn't that the kind of food paralegals eat?
I never thought I'd see Blair Waldorf
On the upper West Side.
Unless...
"Oh, my God."
Are you transferring to Columbia?
I hope so.
N.Y.U. Is so beneath you.
I- it's true!
I'm a Columbia girl now.
"She swings like Tarzan, through the vine."
I don't think that Paul chews that.
Can you believe Antoniette?
Watching her in predator mode is better than...
Shark week on the Discovery Channel.
"- Hello, whores!"
- There is special China Chow...
He' s probably giving some hints on how to remain in the spotlight... without actually doing anything.
- I gotta take notes.
- I think I'll follow you.
"How are you doing, sweetie?"
I don't know.
"Kind of tired, I don't feel so well."
I think I'll just go home and get some sleep.
Have a drink of bourbon it hits the head for 15 hours.
You'll be a million times better.
We changed the ceramics?
- I think so.
Then.
It's normal.
There's always smoke the first time.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
You don't look too well.
- I'm fine.
The vacuum cleaner is not the reason.
Is it?
No.
I have other problems.
A woman.
I bet.
- What makes you think that?
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can... can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
When?
Why?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Gordon!
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
No.
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range."
is much higher than mine.
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
He was not the looked for element.
- into a POW camp.
- Why would he do that?
After what he's been through?
Maybe it's not so bad.
"- Yeah, how's that?"
- Now we have someone on the inside.
"If the prisoners know we're trying to break them out during work detail, we'll have a better shot."
"But when we get them out, where do we hide them?"
I saw an abbey not far from here.
I'll go and make contact and see if they'll take them in.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- There was nothing you could have done.
About Alfred running?
About René.
Nothing any of us could have done.
So let yourself off the hook.
They got him.
Doesn't mean they're going to get Alfred.
Let's make sure they don't.
This was Eric's bunk.
- Are you American?
- Any news from England?
He's Canadian.
And he goes by Eric Darcy now.
What happened to Eric?
His heart gave out.
On work detail.
- How far are we into Europe?
- I'm sorry.
It's not going well.
There is no Western front.
I couId tell you a thing or two myself.
Who supports us?
What about after this experiment?
Who will work?
Me.
"You think I don,t support us?"
"You don,t know what it,s like being stuck here, spied on by those voyeurs in black coats!"
"I can,t even fart without being graded!"
"Think that,s fun?"
You gotta be kidding.
What do you think I do?
I work all afternoon.
You sit on your fat ass and push buttons.
"That,s all you,re good for."
Here come the insults!
",Fat ass, and all that."
"Listen, I,ve got things to say, and I mean it."
"I,ve about had it with this experiment!"
"I,m fed up living with you."
"- Why,d you come then?"
I never forced you!
You did!
I was supposed to go to Canada.
Who wanted to do this?
Who stopped me from going to Canada?
Who stopped me from acting?
"Admit it, it was you."
"Now you say you didn,t want to come here?"
- I did it for you.
"- You,re such a liar!"
You were glad to come!
"What,s more, we,re gonna get tossed out, and it,s all your fault."
Suspected QVapor overdose and psychosis.
Welcome to the Pinky Amusement Park.
Here will be the wettest dream come true!
Get in!
"Commander Bishop, sir?"
- Commander?
"- It's full with Steam, sir!"
"Hey, idiot..."
General Trajano requests your report for the service!
Time to take you home!
Raise it up.
OMG!
"Commander Bishop, are you all right, sir?"
"Do not call me ""sir""!"
"Commercial sector 1, insured."
Prepare 51 for Spartan-7...
Bishop...
"It'll be good to see you again in your uniform, Bishop."
Who says I'm going to put it?
"Come on, we both know, you're not a deserter."
"Find another, for your murders."
You made an oath on Spartan-7.
"Take off your uniform, do not remove the promise."
"Come on, then, arrest me."
All my oaths were broken long ago.
Sorry for Mara.
She was a good woman.
It is difficult to deal with such a thing.
Especially today.
"That's why I brought you here, son."
It's time to get Mara closer.
We told you that your baby died.
He has the sight problem.
Prestige problem to wear spectacles.
Where is your husband?
He has the ego problem.
He doesn't come unless called.
Hubby!

Why are you shouting?
Do you think I am deaf?
I have not thought so.
- Why are you shouting then?
Tell me.
Cool brother-in-law..
How dare you touch me?
Am I your brother-in-law  [Informal] ?
I am your brother-in-law  [Formal] .
"If you can touch me, I will kick you off.."
Who are you all?
Have you come for donations?
"No sir, we came on an important work with you,"
What is that?
Look at this once.
What is this dark angle?
From how long is this going on?
Tell me how long is this happening?
"Do not hit brother-in-law, sister is like fire."
I've got three kids.
Shut up.
I know he tripped the silent alarm.
I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me.
Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here?
Out the front door.
"Dawkins, you're surrounded."
Drop your weapon or we will fire.
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon now.
Fire.
What the hell is this?
His mouth is glued shut.
This isn't Dawkins.
"Flight 106, arriving from Los Angeles, please proceed to baggage carousel number two."
Commander McGarrett?
"This is about my sister, isn't it?"
She disabled a smoke detector on board in the bathroom which is a federal offense.
So we arrested her soon as she landed.
Great.
Jail?
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette.
"Okay, officer."
I think we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
- Let me check with my supervisor.
- Thank you.
"I'm sorry, I messed up."
"I missed you at dad's funeral, Mary."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
You remember this place?
Of course.
I'm not brain-dead.
You used to bring me here every Sunday.
We'd get strawberry milkshakes.
Yeah.
With extra whipped cream.
"Yeah, and you'd always let me eat yours."
Yeah.
Seems like a lifetime ago.
"So, what did you wanna talk to me about?"
You.
"Uh, let me guess."
"Ok, you hate my hair,"
"My clothes, my friends..."
Sarah--
How I'm ruining my life.
"Sarah, I'm here because I wanna understand what happened."
I just wanna know how you and I ended up like this.
I don't know.
It just happened.
"Listen, I understand that the problems between your mom and I didn't or haven't helped the situation, but..."
Can we-- can we just order already?
All right.
I'm just trying to understand here.
"Well, you never do."
You just believe what you want.
"Well, maybe you do that, too."
What can I get ya?
"Uh, two eggs, over medium."
Multigrain toast.
"Uh, I'll do the mushroom and cheese omelet, please."

"Ah, come on in."
I could do with some company.
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.
I'll just finish marking up this.
"There it is, look."
Circling every two minutes.
- When did you pick it up?
- Just before I called you.
It's circling all the time?
Yes.
Zen says it's a Mark Three Galaxy Class cruiser.
Galaxy Class?
"That's outer planets manufacture, isn't it?"
"Right, but Mark Three went out of production at least fifty years ago."
Getting any signals from them?
"No, she's as quiet as a grave."
Probably guidance control systems
That ship's in trouble.
It's the only thing that makes any sense.
- You think so?
- Mmm.
"All right, we'd better take a look at her."
"Zen, abort course programs."
Take us in to 200 spacials and match vectors.
–I'm not lying!
"–Yes, you are!"
"Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act."
"–Without him, you're worthless."
Nothing.
–It's not like that!
And you won't leave him because you're afraid no one else will ever love you... that you'll learn Bob was right about you all along.
–No!
"–Oh, damn it, Marcy!"
–Don't lie to me!
–Why are you doing this?
Because there's a girl out there who may still be alive... and I won't let you kill her!
"Now, goddamn it!"
Tell me right now!
Where is she?
I don't know!
Really!
I don't!
I played the daddy.
I broke her.
"If she knew Bob was involved, she would've confessed... or at least given me a nondenial."
–You think?
–I don't know.
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.
Maybe he's just an asshole.
"Problem is, he's the only asshole we've got."
"–Well, what do you got for me?"
–What you got for me?
Come on.
Embrace the relationship.
Fleetwood is fencing' again.
He's so goddamn predictable.
You can see the different strings unifying the dimensions.
The gravitational infinities canceling each other out.
You see them.
"Right, Dr. Bryar?"
You see them because you have the tools.
Your mind is that tool.
"- He's one of them, Ted."
One of them.
- Shut up!
It's going on too long.
I'm going in.
"And I have to believe that if you put your mind to it, you'll realize that only you can make Leo stop."
You can make him stop by understanding him.
By understanding that he is a liar and he only wants bad things for you.
"- I need to believe that, Dr. Bryar."
"- I said kill him, Ted!"
I had to.
He was going to kill us.
I had to.
God forgive me.
We need an ambulance.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's a little late for all that.
You going to the hospital?
I'm going to ride in with the psychiatrist.
See you over there.
- She going to be all right?
- Yeah.
I think so.
"Gideon, will you tell him that I don't need to go to the hospital?"
(chuckles)
"So, what brings you to Los Angeles today, Toast?"
Waffles.
What?
(chuckles)
"Well, not just waffles, fried chicken too."
Have you ever been to Roscoe's in Hollywood?
"Uh, yeah, sure."
It's great.
"I don't know if I'd travel 3,000 miles for it."
"Yeah, well, clearly you're not as dedicated to excellent waffles as I am."
"But if you're free later, I'd love to take you to breakfast."
"You do know we land at 5:00, right?"
I don't do time zones.
"I do, however, very much enjoy a good breakfast, hence the name."
You're funny.
And you're mind-blowingly attractive.
"(coughs, clears throat)"

You're gonna just pretend like you didn't see us or what?
Hey.

What a coincidence.
You guys going to LA?
No.
"No, and neither are you."
"Impeccable timing as always, fellas."
"Thanks to you, I am not having chicken and waffles with a bona fide ten."
DANNY:
"Hold on, hold on."
Stop.
I was actually afraid that he would kill me.
He finished...
"Got up, and, um..."
Said goodbye.
And i said bye.
That was it.
"Oh, my god."
"But he gave me my ziggy, so..."
Have you talked to anybody about this?
Like a therapist or a counselor or someone?
You're the first person i've ever told.
"Oh, honey."
"There was a point where i thought that i had moved on,"
"That i had worked through it and whatnot,"
"But, no."
I know that i'll never be over it.
"But i know that i have to keep moving forward, you know?"
That kid is--
He's gonna have a good life.
But the name of his father
Is not going on that fucking poster board.
You're never gonna believe this.

She's in her room.
I'm admiring how beautiful...

Buy passage far from Capua and the things that have been done to you.
- Where did you get this?
- Spirited from Gaia's things.
They will not be missed.
You fade with each day.
Do not make me bear witness to your passing.
- Come with me.
- I attend Domina.
My absence would be noticed.
"Go, before contest is ended."
"I will see you again, one day."
I swear to you.
Go.
A match for the ages.
I shall miss this.

"Crixus, victor."
Why did you drop your guard?
You are champion now.
That is all that matters.
I would not thought it possible.
To be said of many things this day.
"Quintus, it's not too late..."
Father?
Fetch the Medicus!
"Your father burns high fever, a worrisome condition for a man of his years."
"Well, is there nothing to be done?"
I have not the herbs.
And the hour is late for us to procure them.
Go.
I'll watch over him.
I'll pound on every door in Capua until we have what is needed.

Pull it up.
That's not what I expected.
Her father died of leukemia.
Pick her up.
Take dinozzo with you.
You interrogated her and didn't pick up she had sex with finn?
"It was an interview,not an interrogation-- and excuse me if my brain didn't go to the sex place."
Mine would.
I'm sure tt's why you have a leg up on other investigators.
See?
"You say ""leg up,"" i instantly went to the sex place."
hey!
"Whoa,whoa,whoa!"
"Hey,stop!"
stop!
"I'm sorry,I need to go."
I have a showing... at ncis.
What's going on?
Hey.Hey!
Stop pointing a gun at my fe.
She tried to rat on us.
-She means rabbit.
-Rabbit.
Yes.
I was in a hurry for a showing.
Are you arresting her?
Taking her to ncis to answer a few questions.
"Well,I'm coming too."
I...
I've lost my line.

Twenty three takes!
I mean he stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War house wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
None of them thought to give him a bloody screen test?
Will Johnnie replace him?
This one has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.

Because story is a structure.
And...a shape.
Purpose and meaning.
One thing's turned bad.
"It's still part of a plan, you know, it's...it's...there's a point to it."
I like life.
"You don't believe in a match, do you?"
I believed this was gonna be a good picture.

I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur...

-Are you crazy?
A spur is $1 20 million a track mile.

It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.

What did she expect?

"Friend, tell me if you see anyone who looks suspicious."
There's a monetary reward.

"Koon, there's a murderer with a painted face."
He might be in the troupe.
You must watch out.

We just recruited someone.
He has a funny walk and...
"OK, I'm coming."

"Congratulations, congratulations!"
- Have another drink!
- [bleats]
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
- Want me to tell you how safe?
- [Alfred bleating]
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month,"
They're gonna give me a gold safety award.
- What do you think of that?
- [bleating]
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
- I sure hope you're a good tipper.
- [bleats]
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
[tires screeching]
[cabbie] hey!
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
[cabbie sighs]
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh...
Record.
Immediately?
I hate to trouble you... but there's something I want you to find out.
I heard there's someone who works different kind of jobs.
They say this person even works as a replacement driver at night.
Agent.
"Agent, chief, minister..."
Don't you have internet access?
Just go online and search.
What are you doing?
Why don't you drink more?
I know something more exciting than drinking.
Let's leave.
Do you still have a fever?
Yes.
"If your condition changes, just contact me at anytime."
Good.
Thanks for your hard work.
Get into the car first.
Are you the replacement driver?
Yes.
The call sounded really urgent.
Take us to the Ecstasy Hotel by Doosan intersection.
"Yes, sir."
Wait a second!
Miss Kim Mi Hee.
Let's have a little talk.
Do you know him?
"No, this is the first time I've met him."
How do you know my name?
I'm from the Seoul District...
I didn't bring it!
"Anyway, there's something we need to talk about."
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me,Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handleJeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
No.
It's the truth.
And I'm sorry that I didn't mention it before.
"Honestly, it's still sort of confusing, trying to figure out how to explain it to people."
I think it's intriguing.
"Honey, we should probably get going soon."
"Hi, Sally..."
I should apologize for the way I ran off before.
I'm Samantha.
I'm having sex with your husband.
My wife doesn't usually meet the people
I'm sleeping with.
"Oh, dear."
Sorry about that.
It's fine.
We're both still a little shaky on the rules.
Got it.
"Look, I should probably go talk to her."
But I meant what I said before.
I'd like to see you again.
So...
Let me know.
Sure.
Definitely.
"Sure, they're throwing me a party now, but the ballet world is brutal."
"The girl I'm replacing was out by 24, with busted knees and a torn groin muscle..."
"Oh, and anorexia."
So at least she was skinny.
That's awful.
You don't get many shots at this.
"So when it comes, you have to claw for it..."
Even if it destroys you.
Let's go for a walk.
"Oh, thanks."
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of"
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know,"
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
"really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
That's dangerous.
like pop rocks and Coke?
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I--"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood"
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood right now."
I'mreallynotinthemood right now.
"Oh, you want to play some more."
"Well, bring it on."
"Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?"
"Hmm, looks like we've got a music lover here."
Reinforcements!
"All right, soldiers."
Looks like it's on us to save the day.
"Luckily, I've got a plan."
"Eska, Desna, listen to me."
You've got to help us stop Unalaq.
"I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."
We will never turn on our father.
"Please, if you let me out now,"
I can still stop him from destroying everything.
"Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe."
"Desna, he won't be your father anymore."
You don't know what you're talking about.
Our father is the wisest man in the world.
"If he says what he is doing is right,"
I believe him.
Huh?
"You know, if I wanted some ball of evil lurking over my shoulder all the time,"
I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law.
"All right, spirit army, your general is here."
Follow me!
It's working.
It's not working.
Get me out of here!
Whoo-hoo!
Aah!
"All right, guys."
Rescue time.
"Isn't he, um..."
crazy?
Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
"The important thing to remember is, he was never charged with a crime."
It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof.
Nor should it be.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
I think I do.
What are you doing?
"Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it."
"""This is not a dream."""
"Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz."
I'd like you to have lunch with him.
"We have a show tonight, Mr. Donaghy."
"I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal, and then a live show."
That's tonight.
This is lunch.
"If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing."
"If I meet with Tracy Jordan, and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off?"
I'm known for being reasonable.
Okay.
"Alfredo, 2:00 p.m."
I'm not dressed for that.
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King?
"Pete, hang back for me."
"Yeah, you bet."
Hey.
Who's the lucky one?
"Let me do it, Hoffy."
You want to go?
No.
I just want to draw.
"Okay, draw."
"Suppose we call this my tag, I'll take him out."
"No volunteers, Price."
I said we're all in on it.
You guys elected me Security.
"The way things have been going I guess I've done a poor job, and I wanna make up for it."
- That asking too much?
- We've all done a poor job-.
I still say this is my tag.
"Any objections, Hoffy?"
"- Any objections, men?"
-Not from me.
- He can have it.
-Who are we to argue with a hero?
"- How about me latching on, Price?"
-Three is a crowd especially if you've got to cut through wire.
Let's have the wire cutters.
- Are the civilian clothes ready?
-Coming up.
Get to work on the trap door.
"What do you say, Hoffy?"
We hit the air-raid trenches then cut out back of Barracks 9.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is.
In the water tank.
Good spot.

- Do we need to chain it up?
"- Nah, this will do."
- Cool?
- Cool.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
"Please, okay?"
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it.
"You, have no clue."
Just...
leave me alone.
I don't ever wanna hear from you again.
"Wake me up, when the latch turns."
But what if...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze."
But...
Just keep a look out while I go in dream about the dress.
Oh my God!
Is that the guy?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Why didn't he take our guns or...?
- I don't know.
- Should we wake him up or just pop him?
We treat her in all possible ways.
But she'd better be taken to a hospital.
-Where is she?
- Overthere.
-Was it what you wanted to tell me?
-Yes.
Let's go.
"Oh, Lord."
Why are you keeping her here?
At this time everyone is hiding theiryoung maidens.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
"OK, I'll send Mikhail over."
Do you recognize this buffoon?
"Yes, it is the guywho used to dance around with an officer's cap on."
Do not shoot.
Let's playwith him.
Wait!
The onlything l do not need now is a bullet in my back.
What a bastard.
Can you imagine that I was shot at bythis sniper again.
He has made a hole in my vodka canister.
Not much of a marksman.
-But the remains ofthis vodka seem to be inside you.
- l hate losing such good things to the wind.
Do not breathe myway.
Wow!
"Well, some people are charmed against bullets and some -for luck."
Right?
"-Do not worry, Olya."
-What are you talking about?
It is a question oftime.
"We'll kill him, be it me or not."
"You can't touch me, Sheriff!"
I brought my attack dog with the built-in force field.
"Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs."
"Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!"
"You're going to jail, Bart!"
Say goodbye to the wife and Tater Tots.
"You saved the day again, Woody."
You're my favourite deputy.
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
"Come on, let's wrangle up the cattle."
When the road looks rough ahead
"And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed"
"Round 'em up, cowboy!"
Just remember what your old pal said
"Boy, you've got a friend in me"
Yee-haw!
"Yeah, you've got a friend in me"
"Hey, cowboy!"
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Big and stronger too
"Come on, Woody."
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
"It's me and you, boy"
And as the years go by
Whoa!
Whoa!
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
All right!
"Warm, nurturing, homebody."
- It's my mom's.
- You live at home at your age?
"Well, yeah, it's temporary."
"See, I used to live in New York."
I moved to L.A.
- Because I had this fiancée...
- Should have seen her apartment.
Steel.
What is it with people that want to live in a warehouse?
"Hi, I'm Nora."
- How do you do?
I'm Elise.
- You have something you need to do?
I do.
I'm organizing the linen chest.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
"Elise, when do you think I'll have my first date?"
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We do have work.
"Your dating techniques, your appearance, your hair."
What...
What's wrong with my hair?
- A little product wouldn't hurt.
- I don't need product.
"No, just for a little volume."
"Now, I need to prep you on what you're going to say."
"Oh, well, you know, I'm..."
"I know that I look young, but I've actually been dating for about 20 years, so I..."
And yet you've never sealed the deal.
"Well, maybe I've never wanted to ""seal the deal."""
- Don't be defensive.
"Okay, I think we got some things out in the open."
"Nathan, do you think that basketball is part of your families problem?"
- Part of.
- But you still like playing?
I don't know anymore.
"Great, nice break through Nate."
"Thanks, Doc."
- Dan.
- Hustle up!
No way this is helping.
"You're right, Dan, we don't need a shrink to identify this families problem, you just made it obvious."
"I'm not his only parent, Deb."
"- Hey why don't you ride with your old man, Nathan."
"- Stop it, Dan."
"Come on Nathan, lets go."
Let the kid make up his own mind.
"What do you say, son?"
Nate?
Nathan!
Here we go.
This is the writer I was talking about.
Somerset Maugham?
"Well its, ""Maugham"""
- Human Bondage.
- Bondage!
"Yeah, its not like that."
"So, you're good."
Are we done here?
"Well, I just thought that this was a better opportunity for us to spend some time, you know, hang out with each other."
"And it is, but can we maybe do it someplace that smells a little less funky?"
"Haha, it's the smell of old books."
Like I said!
"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
- She's going down.
- She's going down.
Don't touch her.
- Yeah?
"- Sir, I'm sorry to contact you directly, but the crowd is drooling for you."
"Yep, floor is wet out here."
"- Okay, great."
Thank you.
- Tom James!
Tom James!
I'm gonna go rally the rally.
"With all due respect, you need to get your shit together now, lady."
Ma'am up.
You're still the leader of the free world.
Hmm?
Where's Tom?
"Oh, he's gone to talk to the crowd at the rally."
- What?
- The fuck he has.
Why would you let him do that?
"- Well, you don't work here."
"- Well, neither do you."
"All right, fuck all of you."
I'm going to the rally.
"Ma'am, ma'am, that would be unprecedented."
"No, I'll tell you what's unprecedented, Kent."
A tie is unprecedented.
So is becoming the first lady president.
So is that jackoff becoming president through the back door.
Okay?
The rule book's been torn up now and America is wiping its nasty ass with it.
"By the way, do you have any papers?"
No.
Lock him up.
Your information proved to be correct.
The man had very considerable assets.
This is enough money for your fare.
This is a passport to America.
You are now a French citizen.
The man you caught will never know about this?
You mean your brother?
He will never know.
Did anything happen to him?
He resisted my men.
He died.
He died?
Yes.
It was one of those unfortunate things.
Your first look?
"Yes, I had only seen pictures before."
It's a big country.
Millions of people beyond those buildings.
"All of them needing something, buying something."
And what do you sell them?
Oil.
"Oh, oil."
Are you an honest man?
What kind of a question is that?
I don't see anything wrong with the question.
Did you make your way honestly?
Of course I did.
Isn't that the only way?
Is it?
They will pay anything to prevent it.
This is the first step towards my becoming
The most powerful man in the world.
"Ids, please."
Take a powder.
[laughing]
Tony.
Those are the outer security scanners.
Put them out of commission Permanently.
[static]
The scanning systems are malfunctioning.
"All right, let's run a maintenance check."
"Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right."
- Where to?
"- Andy's place, know it?"
"Yeah, sure."
I know where everything is.
Second and third?
- [man] fourth and market.
- That one.
- Hop in.
- I'm in a hurry.
Could you... [grunts]
- Don't worry.
- [tires screech]
Have you there in a couple of minutes.
[Alfred bleats]
Listen.
Feel the power in this cab?
- [Alfred bleats] - it has lots of power.
"You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver."
- What do you think?
Did you get an address?
- I'm gonna send it to you now.
"All right, urn..."
- I'll see you there.
"- Yeah, see you there."
- You off to arrest someone?
- Yeah.
You're screwed then cos I'll do you for false arrest.
I had reasonable and probable cause to think you were committing a crime.
"- Listen, one more peep out of you..."
- (LAUGHS)
- ...and it's with intent to supply.
- You're a liar.
And you're a junkie hooker.
I'm a copper.
"Do that, would you?"
Stitch me up?
Yeah.
"In a millisecond, just to shut you up."
Do you even know what they'll do to me for this?
"They'll break my ankles, if I'm lucky."
Listen.
Look at me.
"Nothing's going to happen to you, all right?"
"Yeah, who says?"
You?
"- Yeah, me."
"- They do know where I live, you know."
"People like that, they always do."
Come on.
"Mark, I wouldn't do this unless I absolutely had to."
Do what?
I hope I won't.
You never know.
"Hey, girl!"
"You're not from around here, are you?"
Let me see...
You're...
"twenty, maybe twenty five."
Your hair is black.
But your soul is deeply bothered.
Here it comes.
"Yes, my child."
I'm blind.
Blind as a bat.
Then how you know I'm a woman and how old I am?
I've been sitting here for the past 40 years.
The only thing I do here is listen to the sounds.
"Ma'am, if you don't mind."
I...
"I'm sorry, but it is necessary."
[Greta barking]
"We do a routine investigation on any accidental death,"
"Particularly one like your brother's, where"
There weren't any witnesses.
I don't know what to say.
The police told me it was an accident.
"Yeah, I read the report she gave to our detective"
The next day about how you brother parked on the hill
On account of the dead battery.
"Well, I've been thinking about the past four days"
As how I should have gone out and helped him.
I should've insisted.
But I don't understand how the car got down the hill.
What once was good is always good.
Then maybe we should translate in the meantime.
Is that possible?
"What do you mean, possible?"
"I mean, why don't you translate it?"
I need to think about it.
What do you say?
"I said, I'd think about it."
I have to get back to the theater.
I'm sorry this visit was so short.
"Bye, Goni."
- Bye.
I don't believe a word you say.
What?
You think I'll never get out of here.
So you come with this gesture of yours.
You just came to insult me.
"- Yitzhak, don't be ridiculous."
You liar!
Just like the last time.
"Daddy, calm down."
Drink.
Drink.
I brought your licorice.
I don't want licorice and any chocolate from that snake.
He's doing it because he feels bad.
- He feels fine.
"You're acting like an idiot, but do as you like."
"You cried in the middle of the play when I got beaten in ""The Fiddle""."
So what?
You were four and you were howling.
The cast stopped the play until Mommy took you backstage so you'd see I was okay.
- Shut up!
"- Right, shut up."
"I said if you don't pay me back, I'll cut off your thingy, right?"
I remember.
Mommy!
Morons.
"Put on your panty, honey!"
"Stop, you bastard!"
You're dead if I catch you!
This way!
Dumb bastards.
Hurry up and follow me!
"Bastards, I wish I had the money to pay you back."
I couldn't record anything this month.
This absolutely sucks.
What is it?
Why is here so dark?
# Sometimes I have this dream
# About someone holding me tightly
# A dream about a kiss
# But when I wake up I'm always alone
# Then I can't fall sleep again # because of loneliness
# After tumbling the whole night # I see the morning
"# Ah, how wonderful it would be"
# If it wasn't a dream
"# Instead, I wish"
# I could never wake up from my dream
# I miss a man's arms
# I miss a male's scent
Doctor?
Treating a sick heart is my specialty.
"Whenever I see a sick person, I can't just let it pass."
Kat's accident...
Casey.
"Why did you become a priest, father?"
Was... was there...?
Your grandmother.
That's right.
El Papa Mexicano.
I love that story.
"Yes, um a story."
My parents split up when I was... quite young.
"My father, never saw much of him."
So I lived with my mom.
"My friends were mostly... well, her friends, adults."
"Always moving, always changing schools."
It was when we lived in D.C. that... they called it a nervous breakdown.
Except it wasn't a breakdown.
You know how sometimes kids have an imaginary friend?
I had one.
"To me, he looked like a... little red bird."
He could do just about anything.
Correction.
He could make me do... just about anything.
At first he made me feel special.
Then...
I can't remember most of it.
Thankfully.
"Post-traumatic amnesia, it's called."
"Afterwards, I just wanted to move on with my life, put it behind me."
"But my mother, she was always finding new ways to use my story to make a buck."
"""This is the path God gave us, sweetie, use it."""
But I...
I ran away from all that.
We were playing pinochle.
It's a rough game.
"Pardon me, sir."
"Since you want us to speak up, there was a man removed from this barracks last night."
A Lieutenant Dunbar.
We'd appreciate your looking into it.
That's if they haven't shot him yet.
Why was the man arrested?
Sabotage.
He blew up a train.
"They'd have to prove that, wouldn't they?"
Isn't that what the Geneva Convention says?
You can't just take a man and shoot him.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Of course you did.
Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar.
The S.S. is running around in circles.
The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people.
And von Scherbach has caught the fish.
"Most amusing, isn't it?"
Uh-uh.
You are being rude again.
I just wanna go to sleep.
Nine-thirty.
General von Pfeffinger will be at his desk by now.
Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
"Hauptkommando Berlin, General von Pfeffinger."
Dringend.
You're the murderer the whole empire is out looking for!
"Well, then."
I will go and prepare your dinner now.
The count was really depressed.
Do you suppose he feels responsible?
Is this really a good idea?
Is what?
"Well, the count, he most likely thinks of her as-"
"Yes, he seems to like her!"
And you don't care?
!
Is there something wrong with that?
Asta-san!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
I should've minded my own business!
Your Lordship?
Where are you going?
To find Radu.
You mustn't!
"Out of my way, Terran!"
Why are you so adamant?
!
Eh?
Is there something wrong with me finding Radu and keeping him from assassinating Her Majesty?
!
Your Lordship!
Are you suggesting I want the empress to be assassinated?
!
I'm just...
"I'm just some deplorable, blood-starved monster to you, anyway!"
That's not true!
These were captured by our spy satellite cameras.
It's a public base on the Pacific Coast.
We'll see if we can talk to the fighter jet pilots and get a report from them.
Department Head?
"The wind is so strong, why did you open the window?"
- Because it was a bit stuffy.
- I understand.
Then I will leave first.
"""Twenty people were betrayed by their own country."
"I will definitely come to take it."""
My child!
"No, no, no, no!"
My child!
My child!
No...
My child...
"No, don't."
My child...
Mu Yeol is dead.
I will take the child and support him.
"Only without this child, can you find your own happiness."
Start all over again.
You must be happy.
"Silence that child, if you want to live!"
"Mu Yeol, I took the child and I'll give him his name."
Not as Park Yun Seong but as Lee Yun Seong.
I will go on.
"This is the world's cruelest revenge, because that's the reason I survived."

"- The Golden Triangle, Northern Southeast Asia=-"
"Boss, this man stole our drugs to sell."
How do we deal with it?
"- You make up for that, then!"
-
- Hmm?
-
- Don't know what you mean.
-
- Listening to the gossip!
I can't help overhearing a certain amount.
Over--over--overhearing?
!
Your lugs were f--flapping about like radar!
There was me with me arms windmilling about trying to persuade you to m--make a sale.
"Oh, is that what you were doing?"
Making a sail for your windmill.
A sail for your w...
Aghh!
Ow!
-
"- Now, you're g--g--going to get on with it."
-
- What are you doing with that lad's ear?
It's the only place to handle s--small dogs and errand boys.
"With due regard to the conventions, where else would I take hold of an errand boy?"
Poor lad!
You've made it all red.
-
- It feels longer.
Is it longer?
-
- You leave him alone.
"He's got very shapely, delicate, small ears."
"""Delicate""?"
You'd oversee security across all of North America.
"More power, more authority."
You'd never have to set foot in the Quiet Room again.
"I have to get back to work, sir."
♪ [device beeps]
[exhales] Jesus.
You got a gut feeling about who did this?
I have someone in mind.
"Hey, didn't hear you come home last night."
I didn't.
I fell asleep in my car.
- You what?
- [chuckles softly]
You're working too hard.
"I know you want that promotion, but don't kill yourself for a swimming pool."
You're right.
"I'm sorry, did Ben Larson just concede that his job isn't the be-all end-all of everything?"
Maybe it's time I put us first instead.
Why don't you come home early tonight?
I'll be here.
Unless you want me to sleep in the car again.
[chuckles softly]
Um...
"Ben, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."
What?
[chuckles softly] What is it?
Um...
- [high-pitch squeal] - [groans]
Shit.
Migraine?
"Hydrate, aspirin, and caffeine."
- Lots of caffeine.
How come you're having a party on Saturday if it was two weeks ago?
"Christine was out of town, we couldn't get it together"
- and it worked out this Saturday.
- Why even have it all?
"Why not just forget it, wait till next year?"
- You blew it.
"- Yeah, I know."
"I wish we could've done it last week, but we couldn't get it together."
You should bring Cheryl.
It'll be fun.
Kind of reminds me a little of like President's Day.
It's not really the President's birthday.
It's some other day.
What am I doing?
You know...
Right.
We're back.
Let's start at the top of the scene.
It's a total scam.
He introduced her as a model.
She's like completely bullshitting this guy 'cause he's blind.
- By the way...
- Yeah.
Thank you for coming to meet Kim.
I might've mentioned Kenny.
He's old my friend in New York.
She just moved out here from the city.
"This is his first daughter, and she calls me like Uncle Richard."
- I've known her since she was born.
- Really?
"That's fun, ""Uncle Richard."""
"Yeah, but the problem is she's an actress, a singer, talented but she wants to get her breasts enlarged, and it's gonna drive Kenny crazy..."
I heard you got into an accident.
I only found out after I got out of the hospital.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
"Oh, I-I'm fine now."
What happened?
It seems weird.
I'm going to your house right now with your stuff.
I'm close by so I'll be there soon.
Okay.
She said she's coming here...
Good.
"I was too busy to get Yoon Jae's things, but I guess she's doing it instead."
What about Yoon Jae's hospital?
Do I have to start working tomorrow?
You can't do that.
Say that because of the accident you need rest and get a break.
Then what about the marriage?
Do I have to do that too?
!
"Until then, he must come back."
He must.
"Even if he doesn't, I'm not planning on doing that for him too."
Do you want to clean while we're waiting for Se Young?
"Hah, I had to clean Yoon Jae's body."
Do I have to clean his house too?
No thanks.
"When you meet Se Young, have your manners and don't look at her with weird eyes."
I'll stare at her with open eyes.
Where is the vacuum?
"Oh, this is heavy."
I guess it wasn't an empty bag.
Looks like Yoon Jae packed his suitcase.
"But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left."
Eric didn't know.
None of us do.
"You can play it safe, or take the chance and fight now."
These are some of the best men I've fought with.
We saw thousands die at Dunkirk.
Our orders were to hold the line to the last man.
And we did.
It was a suicide mission.
I'm not putting these men through that again.
I'm sorry.
I can't let them take that risk.
I asked to be taken to my POW.
Why I am still here?
Damn.
You know what?
I missed lunch.
"So, do you mind if I...?"
If you're done?
Mmm.
Luftwaffe silver clasp.
- Sixty missions to get one of those.
- I know what you want.
Yeah.
Gravy.
Why would I give information to an office boy?
Tell you what.
"I won't pretend to know anything about you, if you don't assume that you know me."
Don't usually flash that on a first date.
You ever been shot before?
No.
It's not much fun.
(Rings)
Lord Meldrum's residence.
Yes.
"Yes, I see."
I will inform her ladyship without delay.
(* Waltz on gramophone)
(Knock at door)
Come in.
"- Excuse me, my lady."
- Shh.
They're on their honeymoon.
lsn't it romantic?
The manager of the pet department at Harrods has just telephoned.
"Apparently, it is very difficult to tell the sex of a parrot."
I'm sure parrots don't make a mistake.
"The manager did, my lady."
He sent you another male parrot.
Really?
"Oh, dear."
"Well, they seem to be managing all right."
"Here you are, Mrs Lipton."
It's the last one.
Oh.
Perhaps I...
I better purée some tomatoes and put them in.
"Ooh, don't use real tomatoes, you'll spoil it."
"Who is coming, exactly?"
"Well, there's Mr Foster the works manager,"
"Mr Barnes the foreman, and that Scotch chap who's the union secretary."
I hope he doesn't make a scene.
"Always envious, those sort of people."
(Ivy) Ooh.
"Look, all I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie."
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night after the show, she got somebody fired."
- Really?
"- One of the crew, the sound guy."
There were some wires on the floor.
She was like... complaining and
"I mean, I met the guy when I was."
He was a nice kid.
Now what's he gonna do?
What's he gonna do?
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer billy logan, right?"
My what are you doing here?
"My god, come in, come in!"
I can't believe this.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the web site, so I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew after-hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here,"
"I have, well, a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."""
Not much of a note.
Come on with me.
"-ls that him there, kid?"
-No.
-How about him?
-Nope.
-That's the guy--
-Get him.
Excuse me.
-Scumbag.
"-Come here, you piece of shit."
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.
-Know where he lives?
-Yeah.
-You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.
"From now on, any letter from that school to that kids house comes directly here."
You understand?
"If another letter from that school goes to that kid's house in the fuckin' oven you're gonna go, head first."
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No more letters from school.
"In fact, no more letters from anybody."
"Finally, after a couple of weeks, my mother had to go to the post office and complain."
How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.
Mickey called.
Want me to call him back?
"All right, make the call."
He used to get all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back from an outside phone.
And who are you?
"Please say, ""sister."""
I'm Noah's girlfriend.
"Boy, it is so nice to see there are still good guys in the world."
"Hey, well, you found us."
Wow.
Lana.
Yeah.
Damn.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"I hope not, man."
"If you're thinking what I'm thinking, you are a horrible person."
Yeah.
"I mean, there's no universe in which you can go after a man's girlfriend when he's lying motionless in a hospital bed."
Yeah.
Let alone pulling out his IV bag and banging her over his lifeless body.
Wow.
That was on the tip of your tongue.
Hmm?
"Dr. Maxwell, can you come in here for a moment?"
I need to talk to you about something very important.
This is slightly uncomfortable for me to talk about.
Is it about the surgery this morning?
I swear that kid's nose just looked like that.
I want to friend Riley on the Facebook.
"It's just ""Facebook."""
"Oh, I know, but Riley seems to take it pretty seriously."
Would you be willing to friend me and possibly connect me with your friends?
"But, you know, the cool ones."
Okay.
I guess I could do that.
Great!
"It sucks, sixth grade!"
"Feet off the bed, please."
Okay.
Feet off.
"Oh, the heinie bounce."
Good choice.
"Very cute, Harriet, very cute."
"The neighbors will ask me,"
"""What happened to Harriet Welsch?"""
"""I don't know,"" I'll answer."
"""Such a shame."
"""She disappeared without a trace."
"And she was so adorable."""
"How long have you been with me, Golly?"
Since you were born.
"11 years and 12,000 tomato sandwiches ago."
"And you'll never leave me, right?"
"Well, I won't leave you ""leave you,"" Harriet, but, you know, one day you're going to be big enough."
"And well... well, big enough to take care of yourself."
And when that day comes you won't need me and I'll be gone.
But you know what?
That day is not today.
"And now, it's time for bed."
Are Mom and Dad tucking me in?
No.
They're at a very fancy party and I bet they're thinking about you right now.
Really.
"Listen, I think I can hear 'em."
Harriet... listen to everything Golly says to you.
"We're drinking champagne and eating caviar, Harriet."
Come on.
Let's go to bed.
Gulp it down quick.
Then you won't taste it.
I know.
"You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you?"
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.
There.
"Be a nice girl, now."
Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy.
"If Daddy took a spoonful first himself, Baby might do a patty-cake for him."
This is delicious.
This is...
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.
You ain't so stupid as you look.
That's better.
"Annie, don't ever worry me like that again."
"There you are, you two."
I've got letters for both of you.
There.
Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.
Look what it says here.
"""Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure..."
"""of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a""..."
What's that?
"""...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine."
"""8:00 p.m. Friday."" That's tonight."
"I worried so about you, dear, while you were away."
Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur.
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
"- No, I haven't, have I?"
Is that you?
Why'd you leave so early this morning?
We could've shared an Uber.
[chuckles]
"Oh, I didn't want to wake you..."
Or talk more.
I've almost never been up to this floor.
Now I guess I have six-foot-four reasons to come hang out.
Boop!
"See you at lunch, bae!"
ALL:
Ooh!
I can't believe Amy works here.
And why is she acting like we're dating after one casual night of the best sex of her life?
Because you straight-up agreed to date her?
"Uh, don't you remember?"
"Uh, no."
"Oh, no, Jack, did you do that thing where you only act like you're listening and instead just say ""uh-huh"" and ""great"" to everything?"
So nice to put a face to the paycheck.
Uh-huh.
This has been fun.
You're a good listener.
Great.
"Look, I'm done sleeping around, but if you think we have something real here..."
Uh-huh.
...then let's go back to your place.
"Wait, what?"
"Oh, great!"
EMMA:
Wait.
So you only heard the part when she brought up sex?
"Isn't that gross, Clark?"
only the crickets answered.
And to make us more nervous...
Was he armed?
"Hey, that's when..."
I said:
We're going in.
I was determined.
Ducky was panicking.
"I thought he went to get the tire iron, but no."
He came back with a flashlight.
"I told C,duIie: don't move!"
"As we were about to go into the field, the corn started moving."
"Touchy was coming out, holding the kid by the arm."
He runs fast but not in the corn.
The kid let himself fall to the ground.
"I put the 12 gauge in his face, to keep him quiet."
When Touchy caught his breath...
What's he done to make me run like this?
Ducky showed him what the problem was.
The smashed statue.
The black kid looked at Touchy who couldn't get over it.
"Oh well, well, well..."
The kid looked less arrogant than before.
"And that's when C,duIie said:"
"Let him go, boys."
Boys...
She still called us that.
So if I understand...
"Mrs Lajeunesse wanted to let him go, but you didn't want to."
I agreed with her.
I said:
She's right.
"What are you doing here, Ryner?"
What could I say?
- This su...
"- If you say this sucks, I'm beating you up."
Don't hit me!
Relax.
The bleeding will start again.
Why are you so badly injured?
Forget the injuries.
There's something I have to tell you.
Your younger sister is gone.
Apparently she was killed some time ago.
"How do you know that, Ryner?"
I see.
I see it now.
"You're another pawn of Roland, aren't you?"
I didn't want to hear it.
I didn't want to hear that my sister is dead!
"Not from you, certainly!"
You knew it all?
"You knew that, and laughed?"
When I said I cared about you were you laughing at me for being such a foolish girl?
I had a vague idea that my sister might be dead.
But what could I do?
I...
I...
Why do we have wars?
I've got no interest in who owns what land.
That's why I said I liked afternoon naps the most.
"Tahile, Tony, and Fahle all died senseless deaths."
What are you saying?
It must be the motivated guys who start wars.
I'm the happiest man in the world because the wedding is off.
"And furthermore, if you ever come to this house again..."
I'll break every bone in your body.
Do you understand that?
"- Red, is that call for me?"
"- No, it's my dame."
"Okay, sweetheart, and a great big juicy kiss for you."
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my dough back.
- Give us a roll.
- Here it comes...
You ought to marry those dice.
Marry?
Holy cats!
What time is it?
"- Pop, my pants!"
- You've got them on.
"Oh, yeah."
Wait a minute!
You're not going with all our dough.
I got to get married.
I'll bet you the bankroll you don't get married.
That's a bet.
No cuffs.
The tailor says those kind of pants shouldn't have cuffs.
What?
Nice fellows!
Hello.
Where's everybody?
"Why, the guests have all gone, sir."
Did you wish to be announced?
Just let me get my hands on that young man and I'll strangle him!
Let me see it.
That's a nice one.
Yeah.
That takes me back.
"Believe it or not, I used to have Marcus's job."
I wasn't a bad enforcer.
I had my own style.
"You know, I used warm-up bats."
"They gave me a little extra ""pop."""
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
There was this one time- God Almighty-
"I was supposed to ""kneecap"" a guy."
Standard boilerplate stuff.
"I'd done it a hundred times, right?"
"Only this time, I take a swing, I hit him-Bam!"
And the bat breaks.
It sends a sliver of wood right into the guy's junk.
Oh!
(CHUCKLES)
You should have heard him.
He was screaming like a cat.
"I swear to God, as I heard the paramedics take him away-"
They said that one of his testicles had swollen to the size of a grapefruit.
You imagine that?
That pain?
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS) Messy.
"Messy, unfortunate work."
"In my position, there's only one thing worse than a guy who can't make good on bets."
And that's a guy who never loses bets.
(CLOCK TICKING)
"Okay madam, atleast you bless me!"
I understood.
I understood that all my ties with this house are severed
"Its very simple, sir."
But Krishna understood it today..
..that the poor persons destiny can get generous..
..for sometime but cannot improve forever.
"Excuse me, sir.."
-Get aside.
"Mister, listen to me.."
"- Hey go away, go away."
Its a strange city.
No one listens here.
"Mister, where can I get a place to stay here?"
What?
-A home?
Whats so funny?
"Hey fool, who gave you a ticket to Mumbai?"
I have come without a ticket.
I didnt have the money to buy the ticket.
"Then listen, when I came to Mumbai.."
..even I had asked the same question.
Can I get a place to stay somewhere?
Its been 20 years I still didnt get a reply.
I amjust standing like this on one leg.
"You didnt understand, right?"
Does this city belong to yourfather?
Why dont you think before taking..
..your bags and baggage and coming here?
Enough.
Enough.
Hey.. hey my..
"- Before you picked me, you didn't tell?"
- No.
- I always assumed...
- No.
Well... .
Let's go see our boss.
- Hey.
- How was the NGA?
"Oh, you know the governors, too many mandates, too little money."
- I can hear that one at home.
- Good one.
- The governors liked it.
- Yeah.
Have you announced for the governor of New Jersey bill?
- Excuse me?
- Did I miss an announcement?
That's three years away.
I'm trying to serve...
I never heard of these loans.
So I'm assuming it's a campaign proposal.
Camden and Newark will go nuts.
I know it's not national.
- Give me a break.
- Know how I know?
National programs are announced by the president unless this White House passes on them first.
"Toby, this is a nickel-and-dime program."
Calm down.
Right.
We're announcing a new replacement for Social Security...
- I thought we were...
- They're not your nickels.
- They're not your dimes!
The timing is the key.
"Ifwe delaythe Germans by a half an hour or more, that'll solve the problem..."
They'll face the encirclement.
"How many people will you assign to the attack, mayor?"
I won't let you burythe whole regiment here.
I agree.
The Germans are not to be worried right now.
And I'll send my scout companythere.
"-Yes, I will."
-What yes?
-They'll be there.
-Who will be?
-Malyutin and his people.
- Malyutin?
-Do you mean the guywho killed the saboteurs?
- That very Malyutin.
"He isjust a boy, you know such people."
But a verytalented one.
-Will you issue such an order?
"-Yes, I will."
Because you'll give it to me.
And the orders are not to be discussed.
"OK, it is all hot talk."
We might tryto find some other solution.
"In any case, I'm not going to bury my people for peanuts."
Comrade colonel...
-What?
-A new one.
The former one was better.
OK. I'll help you if I can.
You know everything will be assigned to this breakthrough.
"Please, pass overto your Malyutin my request. lt is not an order."
Madam!
Why is this house locked?
Who are you?
Whom do you want to meet?
"Gardener, why is this house locked?"
Where is sir?
Who?
Mr. Kumar.
"Oh, you mean him?"
He was really nice fellow.
Its been long since he has left this place!
Where did he leave for?
"I dont know, sir."
But afterthis mansion was auctioned..
..nobody saw him around here!
Auction?
"Yeah, now Mr. Dhanraj owns this mansion."
Dhanraj?
!
And what about his family?
His brothers?
They were not brothers but rather brutes.
And now they have become quite rich.
They have started factory with help of those auction money!
Both of the brothers have taken away all the money.
Mr. Kumar and his younger sisterwere..
..thrown out of this house!
They have left this house as if they were leaving this world!
But why did he agree to all this?
Why did he put up with their dishonesty?
Why did he leave silently?
What could he do?
[clicker clicks]
Kept me distracted.
Kept me from scratching my scars open.
♫♫ [woman singing opera]
Ahem.
That was my father's.
"Second War, paratrooper."
Dropped men behind the lines at night.
Can't talk.
Snipers.
So... [clicking]
Crickets.
Wow.
[chuckle]
I just want you to know that working on this case has been a gift.
Yes.
"I know that I stumbled at first, but I've grown."
I saw the video.
You surpassed all my expectations.
Thank you.
That' all I've ever wanted.
"To stand in front of a jury, wow them with my eloquence, and... it's all thanks to you."
No.
"And I want you to know that, no matter what happens in this case, it's not going to affect our feelings, is it?"
No.
W-Why do you keep shoving these fucking pictures at me?
"I mean, they do get a closer look."
You got to be really strong to do that.
I don't even know what that means.
When do I get my car back?
That's it?
That's all you got to say to me?
Yet they always turn away when I meet them.
As should yours.
"Then I must tear them out, if they are to obey such a command."
You must stop this.
"I have vowed to, a thousand times a day."
"To return to drink and whores, forcing you from my mind."
Then I catch glimpse of you.
And my world ends.
I have never felt greater love than when I hold my husband in my arms.
Gannicus.
What seizes you?
"You drop guard, allowing Barca advantage."
The man almost had you.
I was lost in a moment.
Caught by a dream.
Then wake from it.
Leave us.
"You are a Gaul, are you not?"
"Yes, Domina."
Many believe the seed of a Gaul to rival that of Jupiter himself.
Tell me.
How many sons sprang from your father's cock?
"Five, Domina."
And from his father before him?
The same.
"Your subligaria, remove it."
You are never to speak of this.
"Do you understand, slave?"
"Yes, Domina."
"Well, I would not look at you."
The sight turns stomach.
Enter me.
They never take their eyes off it.
I heard your man telling you it was full of old documents.
"Well, that's not so."
"You see, a lot of documents is a lot of paper."
And paper's heavy.
But they lift that box as if it's as light as a feather... sir.
"Take him out, Tongue."
"- What's French for ""keep out"", Harris?"
"- Défense d'entrer, sir."
Right.
Come with me.
"Say a short prayer, Tongue."
Yea...
I say yea.
Yea.
COOPER French scots sir
About a mile back!
"Fall in, Rifles."
French sir
Ba
Why is that colonel chasing you?
He's chasing you
A full troop of French cavalry?
A full colonel?
"No, they're after you."
Why?
Because of what's in that chest
Why?
Because that chest is full of papers and the colonel is a great reader?
That's why?
I don't think you're escorting me
I think I'm escorting you amigos.
Uncommonly pretty eyes.
Oh!
Ow.
Ooh.
- Are you all right?
Ow.
Ow.
13.
"Nail-biting stuff, this is, isn't it?"
Ladies... it is with some surprise...
I announce the vote to be... a tie.
"This means that, as president, I have the casting -"
So sorry I'm late!
"Uh bit of an accident on my bike, Mrs..."
Madam President.
"You haven't voted yet, have you?"
"- Indeed we have, Claire."
"The vote was a tie, which means that I have the casting vote."
"With all due respect, Madam President -"
And I cast my vote in favour of closing the Institute for the duration of the hostilities.
But...
But I'm here now.
And it's lovely to see you.
"But, alas, I'm afraid too late for you to vote."
"I respect what you said about loyalty this morning, Mrs Cameron Madam President."
"Think very carefully about what you're about to say, young lady."
"Feel free to speak your mind, Miss Hillman."
You're among friends here.
I'm not ashamed to say the thought of war scares me.
"It terrifies me, if I'm honest."
But that's why I need this.
You.
God damn it!
Is that your new waitress?
- You like her?
"You can have her, and give me Nora!"
I am not letting Nora go.
You can forget it!
Alright.
How's my money doing?
Still stuck to the wall.
"I'll stick you the wall too, my boy."
"I have a little time, and I have to show you this."
"Incidentally, I don't have any time."
You won't regret it.
"Listen, you just show up out of nowhere."
Couldn't you at least say please?
What's all this?
Why do you make everything so complicated?
Of course not then.
"I'm busy, goodbye."
Then at least stop singing.
"I have to get my show finished, you got that?"
Do you think you can just tell me what to do?
"Oh yeah, I think so."
"You're mistaken, my dear."
Put your lousy 10 Euros away.
I only take donations over a hundred.
I've thought about it.
In this case it's not a donation.
I would like something in return.
"What I want in return, is to touch you."
Go ahead.
What's going on here?
I mean television...
- What's all this?
"First of all, I think this place is great."
Really?
- Really.
"- Yeah, I think so too."
I mean it's exotic.
Right?
For example what's been done with money.
Pretty funny.
"- It's a hole in the wall, but it's alive."
- Perhaps it's best if Mr. Harmann and I sit down and consider what to do next.
"Coincidentally, my name is Harmann too."
"Yes, but coincidentally, she doesn't mean you."
"Alright then, good luck with that."
I'll be in my office.
"If anyone wants a coffee or something, just let me know."
Thanks.
Shit.
"I'm an idiot, I could be doing something completely different."
Like what?
Like earning money for instance.
Instead I'm sitting here in this shitty hotel with it's shitty rooms.
It's not shitty here.
You're beautiful.
Shut up!
I hope you like your new room and that you would recommend us to others.
We will do our best to ensure...
That's alright Tom.
- ... so that your stay is as pleasant as possible.
Yes I...
What should I say now?
He was a witness at the Chandler inquest.
"Maybe he wouldn't help, but you gotta start somewhere."
And he'd be fine.
"Mr. Louis Ord would be fine, just dandy."
"I felt like a fight, Father."
I felt like a fight.
"How many, sir?"
"You alone, f riend?"
I have a small table.
"The bar is good enough, thanks."
It looked like feeding time at the zoo.
All you needed was money to start with and bicarbonate of soda to finish.
- What'll it be?
- Rye and water.
- Plain water?
- Yeah.
"Here you are, sir."
"- Come here, sweetheart."
"- Yes, sir?"
Didn't you used to be a waiter here?
"Louis Ord, 45, single?"
"I seem to know your f ace, but the name--"
Remember a guy named Johnny?
"In this business you meet lots of Johnnies, sir."
You were a witness against this one.
He acted like a mine had gone off under his feet.
I hadn't seen a guy look that scared since jump training.
- Who are you?
- The name is Murdock.
- Capt. Murdock?
- How'd you know?
"- Johnny's told me about you, captain."
"pay me. """
"pay me. """
Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.
Take deliveries at the front door and sell it out the back at a discount.
Take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.
when there's nothing left whenyoucan'tborrow another buck from the bank youbustthejointout.
You light a match.
Do you need help reaching anything?
You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree.
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
The Jew broad.
Diane.
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.
what?
what?
Who asked you anything?
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.
what?
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What is this world coming to?
prejudiced against Italians.
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
Leave for Pondi right away.
Stay there in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Room will be booked.
I'll send you the details over there.
Remember I want this car any how.
It's a gift for my wife.
"Sir, Which wife?"
One who's Bandra or the one who's in Varli?
Why is he so angry?
Laila always checks the car thoroughly before she buys is to sell.
"Madam, My car!"
"This car of yours, I can't sell it."
Nobody can sell it now.
We are from the ICUC Bank.
"Madam, You took a loan of 2500000 for this show room of yours."
And you haven't paid your installments since ten months.
Actually we are here to give you a notice.
What notice?
"If you don't pay in 5 days, we'll take all of your cars."
You can't do this.
We can do it Madam because we are scoundrels and bastards.
I'll call the police.
We are the police.
We work part time with the bank.
"Okay Ma'am, Have a good day."
Brother.
Give size 40 in this material.
What are you doing?
I'm taking out sister's bra.
"Shut up, Son of bra."
If not Bra then what?
Pajama?
We have to work through this.
"- We have huge issues, Peter."
- All couples do.
I'm guessing our issues are pretty unique.
This...
This is really not the right time to talk.
- When is the right time?
- When it's not my dead husband's birthday.
Fair enough.
- I have to get back.
- I'll call you later.
Where is everybody?
"After Shane tells Silas that man is in the DEA,"
Silas tells Shane he's your boyfriend and you don't care about Judah no more.
"So he smashed the cake and run upstairs, and Silas go outside to fuck up the stucco with a basketball, and Andy go upstairs to get norched."
I eat from stress.
Shit.
Silas.
Silas.
- Talk to me.
- You're insane!
He's a fucking DEA agent!
Yes.
"Yes, he is, but it's okay."
He's okay with it.
So he's a crooked DEA agent.
Even better.
"Peter protects my business, Silas."
"Well, maybe now, but what happens when he breaks up with you?"
Or do you think you're so great that that's never gonna happen?
- What happens when he dumps you?
- He can't do anything to me.
I'm upset with myself.
I live in my fantasies.
"When reality knocks, I don't open."
He tell you?
Briefly.
No need for more.
It would be dangerous.
For you and us.
I thought it over.
You're partially right.
Militancy is getting us nowhere.
Bourgeoise elections even less.
It's a trap.
It's time for action.
No revolution ever avoided it.
French resistance took up arms.
We extol their heroism.
We're the new resistance.
Don't Maoists say that?
Maybe they're right.
So we're breaking with the Trotskyites.
Where do you position yourself?
Why talk anarchy if you don't act on it?
It's easy.
The car comes.
The comrades change vehicles.
Set theirs on fire in the woods.
He'll take you back by motorcycle.

- It's not our call.
"We chose the underground, and its rules."
First one: no questions.

You forget ‎.‎.‎.
How could you forget‎!
You're the charger‎.
You drive more than anyone on this team armory‎.
Do not know why I forgot ‎.‎.‎.
Remember that‎.
Or send us all to hell along with you‎.

- Got it‎?

"- Yes‎, Sergeant‎."
Sometimes I wonder what happens to you‎.
"You do not have to ask more‎, it has been confirmed‎."

"Here you go‎, Danny boy‎."
"Sorry for the delay‎, gentlemen‎."
But finally out of here‎.
Lieutenant‎.
Do you feel good‎?
I'm fine‎.
Just a little tired‎.
"Then‎, ‎.‎.‎."
What happened up there‎?
What made Shonbeck‎?
Good ‎.‎.‎.
It's a long story‎.

"- Bread, cheese."
- Dripping.
"- Add a little love, makes a meal fit for a king."
I think they're happier being poor.
"Yes, or perhaps not."
"Oh, well, who gives a toss anyway?"
Let's check what's in the larder.
Any food?
"Erm, only a couple of dirty mags."
Huh?
"Oh, yeah."
I'm sure there's a reason why we shouldn't be doing this but I can't put my finger on it.
Don't overtax your tiny mind.
It's concentrating on breathing.
"Shut up, the cheque's in the post."
"Yeah, whose show is this anyway?"
"I'm the famous one, love."
"Come, let us go to the supermarket."
Right.
What a rotten shop.
There's never anything you want to buy.
For example...
"""Cruizos."
Bite-sized cruise-missile shaped lumps of potato flavoured snack.
"""Warning-will give you cancer. """
Everything gives you cancer these days.
You can't blow off without being told it's carcinogenic.
"- In my case, it probably is."
- Probably.
"- Careful, you'll get grabbed by the dick."
- Oo-er.
"Ah, the pirate thing."
"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite.
"Let's see, you volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated."
You need to get back to a child.
"That's not perception, that's eavesdropping."
"Ah, but you don't want to abandon him the way you were abandoned."
Was I?
"Like I said, open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the Lost Boys."
And they all share the same look in their eyes.
The look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
Have you ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.

"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
I'm gonna get directions.
I will.
NEAL:
"Hey, man."

How are you?
- I've been better.
They'll drive Sharon spare.
That's a weed there.
Look.
"She belched there, inside with the telly."
Kimberley asked her if she was gonna have the baby.
I don't know.
"It's hard to believe you can get so much shite... out of only one dog, isn't it?"
- Dessie?
- Huh?
Do you not think we should tell the girls... what Sharon did was wrong?
What?
I don't mean turn them against her or anything...
"Or the baby, remember."
"- Yes, I know that."
But...
- What?
I think we should tell them.
"Without, you know..."
I think we should tell them... that it's better to be married if you're pregnant.
"Jeez, they're a bit young, aren't they?"
"I mean, Lisa, maybe."
You'll need a shears for that.
What were you thinking of telling them?
Do you think we should?
"Whatever you think yourself, Kay."
I'm only their da.
They'll laugh at me.
Times have changed.
"Jesus, where did she leave her cop-on?"
Did she never hear of contraception?
Do you remember that crombie coat you used to have?
What?
"I can forgive him, Elinor, and doing so, for the first time feel... free."
I am sorry for him.
"But I shall never forget how he made you suffer, nor his guilty conduct towards Eliza Williams."
- It is all very well his still loving you...
"- Mama, enough has been said."
"...but he will always be extravagant and selfish, however often he repents."
And if you had married him...
"Oh, dear!"
I should never have been happy with him.
I know.
"Elinor told me today all that I wanted to hear, and I am satisfied."
"- And that is all, Mother."
"- Well, you need plenty of occupation."
- (SLAMS)
- Tom?
(TOM) Ma'am.
I'm glad Colonel Brandon is coming tomorrow.
Ah.
Phew!
I never seen Exeter so crowded.
Not this time of year.
I got everything you wanted.
"Sack of provisions, your linen and stuff."
- Miss Marianne.
- Thank you.
"That is excellent, Tom."
That's not quite the blue I wanted.
- Never mind.
- My dear.
Old Martin talked all the way there and back.
"He can talk, can old Martin."

They're gonna go higher.
"Next time you see them, we're gonna be in wembley Stadium or Giants Stadium."
That's right.
And I'II be right there in the front row.
t's strange going from being around your family constantly to being with these guys.
But lik e knowing that there's four of your best mates it's a great feeling to know that you're not in it by yourself.
I can't believe I'm at MSG!
I'm just a little boy from Bradford and now I'm smashing it!
And you sort of feel so proud.
You feel like your heart could burst sometimes.
AII right.
Let's give it our all.
"Come on, guys."
Come on!
n the back of your mind  there's always this bit of feeling  that you gotta kind of be ready to pick up the pieces if it stops.
And it hasn't stopped.
Sing it!
You sing!
Bust that shit up!
Bust it like it's Dyson's douchey-ass face!
Yes!
That face is never kissing again.
- What else?
- We wallow.
Kenzi break-up mix on repeat all frigging afternoon.
- You have a break-up mix?
"- Dude, you have so much to learn."
Yes.
And then it's girls on the town.
"We're gonna burn this city to the ground, baby!"
I don't do that.
I'm not much of a party queen.
Drinking equals losing control equals someone gets dead.
"Yeah, but what a way to go, dude."
"Okay, fine."
We'll cut loose somewhere safe.
"You know, this is what I don't get, okay?"
"I did nothing wrong, and I'm the one whose day has gone to shit."
"For Dyson, it's like, ""Bo who?"" Totally unaffected."
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're gonna party.
We're gonna forget about it.
All right?
We'll see about that.
"Okay, this is me in the bar."
- And this is me going back to bed.
"- Oh, no."
We are not wasting hours of dress-up.
I don't care if I have to slather you with fairy dust.
"Where does he get the balls, all right?"
To tell America's greatest city to drop dead.
- That's just it.
He never said that.
"The Daily News said he did, but he didn't say it."
"- Oh, I don't care."
"You don't, as leader of the free world, tell this city, I mean, this great city, which by the way, gave more of its sons and brothers to every war, you know, since we kept the British from"
crossing the Hudson River.
"- Not accurate, but I get your point."
- How-
"- How do you tell a whole city of New Yorkers to drop dead, all right?"
New York is the greatest city in the world.
- Paris is a better city.
- He's right.
We got nothing on Paris.
- I wish I was in Paris right now.
- What's so fucking great about Paris?
- Shut up.
"- Their cheese, their bread, the way they kiss, eau de toilett."
Cancan.
Pete:
Hey.
- Everything's better.
Pete:
"Hey, hey, hey!"
You fucking playing backgammon over there?
Close that shit up.
We don't do that here.
You heard me.
"Close it up now, and get out."
Horace:
Get outta here.
"At every step lies deceit, friends will stab you in the back"

Saraswati.
Our mother's name
Our suspicion is true.
The papers were stolen by Jagadish's computer
Atul...
Did Jagadish use this computer to give you the question papers?
Why did you have to do this?
Someone tell me what he has done.
- I'll tell you Mrs Batra
Jagadish used his computer... just like a burglar who enters homes and steals
"Good afternoon, ma'am."
Will you be voting?
-You're running in the 6th District?
-l am.
"Well, 6th District is my district."
I'm very interested in who'll represent me.
I'm interested that you're interested.
"As Huey Long once said, and I quote:"
"""""lf you got a friend, you got a vote. """""
-Did he say that?
-He sure did.
He told me to move to the 6th District.
He said the people are special.
-So do I have your vote?
-You can count on it.
That's one.
No.
"More than one, actually."
I hear Elaine Santos is ready to stand up for you.
Sounds like a groundswell.
I wish I could tell you I won but I got thrashed by a Dominican from 104th Street.
"I got branded an outsider, and I was never in it."
"But I'll be back in 2 years, and I'll win."
You know why?
I'm willing to be lucky.
And if you're willing to be lucky New York will give you a chance.

New York City.
So many things have been said about it  but there's only one I really like.
"""New York  it can destroy you or fulfill you, depending a good deal on luck. """
No one should come here unless he's willing to be lucky.
Why don't you help us out?
Will you come?
I think I'd like that.
Fine.
"Good night, and thanks."
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Betty Anderson's father stopped me.
- What did he want?
"He asked when you'll marry Betty, before or during college."
- I hadn't exactly thought of marrying her.
- I wouldn't hear of it if you wanted to.
"Anderson's a good foreman, but Betty is something else."
"- Yeah, I agree."
- Then stop seeing her.
I just can't stop seeing her.
I invited her to the graduation dance.
- Uninvite her.
"- Now, Dad, I can't do that."
You're gonna.
Do you realize what it'd mean if you married the local tramp?
"When you marry, you'll marry someone on your own level."
Call and tell her it's off.
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Call her.
"- Please, Dad."
"- Go on, call her!"
"1042W, please."
"I can understand you wanting to see this girl, but not in public."
You know what I mean.
Nobody's fighting you.
I'll be as big a Harrington as you are.
- Maybe he's bi.
- No one's bi.
Ever met a 70-year-old bisexual?
At some point you make a choice.
"Thus the expression, ""Bi now, gay later."""
- Maybe he hasn't decided.
- He better decide.
I can't keep missing work.
My hamstrings are killing me.
I don't know how I'm gonna make it up and down stairs at the Coliseum.
"It's Staples Center, dumb-ass."
Who knew too much sex could make you cranky?
- I wish I was cranky from too much sex.
- What are you and Joe up to tonight?
We are going to a club.
Yeah.
"This, um, band that Joe used to love."
- How very 20-something of you.
- We're in serious need of fun.
Last time I heard my husband laugh was with another mom.
Another mom?
Uh-oh.
Is someone feeling a little possessive?
"Oh, please."
She's hardly the issue.
"So, this club, do they let parents in or is it seniors' night?"
No.
"- Oh, definitely no."
- Come on now.
Hey.
- That is my favorite date dress.
- No wonder you're still single.
He's worried about her.
So I hope we are ...
Yes?
What do you say?
We're talking about cultural abyss?
A colleague who cut the fire rope to protect her.
Not to mention that he exploded right after all.
Was it because he was afraid of her?
He was afraid that she would kill?
Or something?
"Nixon, where are you?"
Hi.
'I brought you coffee. 'I'm not drunk.
I did not find it.
I know encrenco me sometimes.
but I will be able to stand?
You can not be better than that?
I took these.
Do not worry.
Mom and I arrange.
He barely had become a full member.
A larger funeral costs more money.
We can do it be worth it even if it is small and intimate.
-Let's Take it together.
-What Do you think of the club?
They cared about him.
And me.
We should not think about it?
"I refuse to go there, even for a funeral ..."
It was my husband.
I who decides.
The Ferrymen is more than a club of motorcyclists.
I missed the exit.
I went all the way to Yong Moon.
-How could you go that far?
-I know right?
How can I go that far?
Who are we talking about?
Me.
-Why didn't you answer the phone?
"-I didn't bring it, you know."
I thought you got into an accident.
I was going out to look for a car accident.
You called all of the sudden and told me to leave in 10 minutes.
I was in a hurry.
3 minute shower. 3 minutes to change. 3 minutes to do hair.
-I left at the right time.
-I have to be back by office by 4:30.
You're an hour and 30 minutes late.
We only have an hour and 30 minutes left!
I said I'm sorry.
You can kill me ok?
"Just be positive, hmm?"
"Oh geez, we have an hour and half left."
It's only 10 minutes short from 100 minutes.
It's 10 times 9 minutes.
We even had 14 minute dates before.
When there was an accident in your office.
What do you have in your head?
"I made an absurd excuse to get out of meeting, so that I can see you here."
"10, 20, 30, 40 minutes."
You made me think that you were in an accident.
A big one.
I thought you were unconscious.
- It's OK!
Say the same in smile madam
"I will slipper you, if you still follow me, idiot!"
Thank you.
Have I done what you said as it is?
You did improvising it.
- But why did I do it?
You till date have used brain for all the operations.
"Please just use the body for this, it would be enough."
"Hey Giri, send these photos immediately to P. R. O Venu."
"Madam, this wedding card is ₹ 5,000."
We get 20%.
Is it the commission Mr. Mutyam?
- Discount Mr. Rathnam.
"[₹5,000with20% discount=₹4,000]"
This is with dry fruits and almonds.
It would be very good.
"Just ₹ 10,000."
"I think a lot would come, as discount Mr Mutyam."
"This too is bit expensive, but..."
Jayaraj's dark biography revealed!
What idiot?
I read the published as it is sir
What is this Jayaraj?

Cheap tricks played by the opposition people.

Can I borrow your phone.
I have to make a call.
"Shit, someone's coming."
"Shit, they're shooting."
No ...
Henning ...
What are you ...
Henning?
Do not tell anyone.
"I'm not gay, you know?"
You heard something that seemed shots?
"No, not really."
I could not hear anything with the helmet.
We were wondering if Henning had not killed.
Four members of Ferrymen were murdered tonight.
"One of them was my informant,"
"Stop, you're tickling my ear"
Your cheek's all red
- Where would I get make-up?
- From Claire's.
"Later, I'll tell you a terrible secret about Charles"
"Ah yes, what secret?"
Go ask her to dance
I don't know how to dance
"Neither does she, go on"
I can't dance
I want to
"You dance terrific, like in the movies"
Is this what the priests teach you in school?
It's the last bottle
The Mayor wants a word.
He refused to go away
He can return tomorrow when Edward is here
He insists
I'll see him
Save a little champagne.
I shall surely be needing it
"Wait, I'm really thirsty"
That's the rhythm
84.
Want to dance?
She doesn't know how
Time to learn.
Shall we try?
I don't want to anymore
Just when I was getting good
That was the Mayor
He wants extravagant payment
"Hey, fellas, what's up ?"
- Look at this stud.
"- What's up, man ?"
"Hey, playah."
"How you doin', man ?"
"Whass up, baby ?"
"Oh, no love."
No love.
I hear you been traveling in new circles.
What's up with that ?
- You tapping' that white girl ?
- [ All Laugh ]
That's why you ain't got more time for your boys?
Too busy fronting ?
"Too busy snow flaking. lf that's the case, you best be watching your back."
'Cause white women don't bring nothing' but trouble.
"That ain't white women, man."
That's women.
- That's your women.
"- Yo, are we gonna check out... some honeys on the westside ?"
- You riding ?
"- Hell, no."
This ain't about no honeys.
I know what it's about.
Those fools we stomped at Stepps hit my corner four strong last week.
- l gotta handle myself.
"- You slide out that side oftown,"
- they gonna handle you.
- They can bring it. I got my heat.
"All that gat's gonna do is create some unnecessary mayhem, man."
That's the black man's life-  madness and mayhem.
- How do you know ?
The cafeteria's right this way.
They know me there.
I'll get us a good table.
- You would do that for me?
"- Oh, yeah."
"I'm very tight with Bertha, the lunchroom lady."
"Yeah, I once rescued a dolphin from her hair net."
"OK, maybe it'll last a few years."
"Yes, I'm acting principal now, and the pressures would be daunting for a man half my age."
Fortunately I have a vitality that belies my years.
I'm the only one who doesn't know how it's done.
"Listen, I think I found something that kind of works."
- What?
- This.
"Hi, Shawn."
- Wow.
From across the hall.
"- Yep, I got a 30-foot range."
"- What, you just jerk your head?"
- Watch again.
"I'm still young enough, I can do this twice in a row."
"Shawn, it's so strange."
I was just thinking about you.
And that's without conditioner.
"Cory, what is it?"
"- You were just drawn to me, weren't you?"
"- No, I thought you had head lice."
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm great."
"- Oh, good."
"- Hi, Topanga."
I was just thinking about you.
You ever seen 'em?
"""Eeeh!"""
"And the mom's like, ""What the fuck?"
"""Oh, my God, why don't you just listen?"
"Why don't you do what I tell you?"""
And the little kid get up all disrespectful.
"""I don't know!"""
"""How come you can't be a good mom, Margaret?"""
Gonna call the mom out by the first name.
I wish I would call my moms out by her first name.
"I would no longer have a mouth on my face, do you hear me?"
I'd be talking from a hole in my neck like Terrie from the smoking commercials.
You ever see her?
¶ You know I'm gonna do it for you ¶
She be...
"""Hi."
"""My name Terrie."
"""And I'm a smoker."
"""And you put on your wig, put in your teeth,"
"""and go about your day."
"I'm a smoker."""
A what?
"""A smoker."""
A mimosa?
"""A smoker!"""
I'm sorry.
"But for everybody who has seen that commercial, that is not just cigarettes."
"That's meth, nigga."
That's what that is.
"Oh, oh!"
"Oh, I would love to see her drinking from a water fountain."
I would love it.
Yes.
And I am to renounce all claims on the contents of the tomb?
Yes.
"Duplicate pieces that the Cairo Museum feel they can spare will, of course, be ceded to you."
"At the discretion of Monsieur Lacau, I suppose."
I will do everything in my power to make sure that you receive a fair selection.
My husband would have wanted you to return to your work.
Will Mr Mace be returning to Egypt?
"I'm sorry, I thought you knew."
Mace died recently.
"Oh, dear."
I'm so sorry.
I expect the newspapers will say he is another victim of the curse of Tutankhamun.
Arthur always laughed at the idea.
There are times when I wonder.

(Speaking Arabic)
Lift.
Stop.
Stop!
"You, stop."
"You, stop."
"You, lift."
"You, start."
Everyone.
That's good.
Very nice.
Good.
"Okay, let's get the planks in."
Planks in.
Good.

I'm arresting you on suspicion
- of possessing a controlled substance.
- Get off me!
"You do not have to say anything, but if you do not mention..."
Agh!
Help!
(SHRIEKS) Help!
What did I do?
Didn't find any drugs!
"Search me, I don't take drugs."
- I'm clean.
- Can you do me a favour?
- (MOBILE BUZZES)
- Can you shut up for one second?
- I'm clean!
I'm clean!
I'm clean!
- Justin.
Did you get a beat on that DNA?
"Er, yeah."
"Cameron Pell, artist."
"Well, failed artist."
A history of mental illness?
No.
The man's got serious issues.
Five years back he was arrested for gate-crashing some modern art exhibition.
"He's burst in wearing a clown mask, slashed a load of paintings with a flensing knife."
"When they tried to throw him out, he's gone completely Tonto."
Cut up two doormen.
Lucky to escape an attempted murder charge.
- Right.
- Same stakes?
"-Sure, go ahead."
"Hey, that's not bad."
- Where'd you learn your pitching?
-From the farmer's daughter.
Something I've been meaning to ask.
It has to do with security.
Shoot.
We're having a tough time keeping stuff from the Krauts.
"Like our escape equipment, for instance."
So we're always looking for new devices.
Uh-huh.
Looks like you found one.
- Me?
"-Well, I mean the lieutenant."
"He hid a time bomb on him, right?"
"He even carried it through prisoners' search, didn't he?"
Where did he hide it?
Right in his pocket.
- The old cigarette-match gag.
-What's that?
"You take a book of matches, light a cigarette, slip it in."
It takes about three minutes for the cigarette to burn.
Then it sets off the matches.
Simple.
Some time bomb.
"Hey, that's a ringer."
"O come ye, O come ye"

Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
"O come, let us adore him"
You want a piece a this?

I'll slap everyone in this Goddamn school if I have to!
You are never going to play shooty hoops!
Do you understand?
!
You are gonna sing and dance and be the best at it!
You're hurting my arm!
"Ah, shit."
"Oh, that's good, that's good."
"Yeah, shoot that guy in the face, Kyle."
"Yeah, nice."
You guys...this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away.
I think we better just get on-board with it.
What?
!
Are you crazy?
"No way, dude."
We promised each other we would never do that.
- Remember?
- Yeah!
"I know, but I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school."
We're losing all our credibility.
"I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now."
"Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake!"
What so bad about hanging out with me?
"Shut up, Scott Malkinson."
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.
"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes."
Don't make fun of my diabetes.
I'm Scott Malkinson.
"Really, James, it's your own fault."
"You can't expect to worry yourself sick over Paul's death, and do your own job at the same time."
"I know, but-- - no ifs or buts about it."
You worried yourself into a really low state.
Now look what's happened.
I'm sorry.
"You're right, of course."
"I understand how you feel, but I want you to pull yourself out of it."
Promise?
If you promise not to go on about it.
It's a deal.
You just relax while I go boil another kettle.
Drink that up.
There's another one to come.
Who is it?
It's me.
May I come in?
If you don't mind catching flu.
How are you feeling?
Jolly good.
"James, let me ask you a question."
"Tris, I'm really not up to it-- no."
Shush.
Tell me...
"When is the last time we stood up to siegfried,"
I mean faced him out to the bitter end?
- Ah-- ah-- you see?
"You can't answer, can you?"
Because neither of us ever have.
We've always given in to him.
"Well, this time, I'm going to do it."
Do what?
Wanna come with me and check out a real live architecture class?
(EX CLAIMS) Not even a little bit.
"You know, I'll just hang here with Marshall and Lily."
- It'll be fun.
- Fantastic.
- Okay.
"- Well, have a seat."
Relax.
"Yeah, this is casual."
"This is all very, very, very casual."
Listen to me.
You want me to find the perfect girl so we can all grow old together?
That is her.
"Do not let any guy near her, okay?"
"That means no waiter takes her order, no busboy clears her table."
"If she bursts into flames, I want a fire woman putting her out."
I don't think 911 takes requests.
"Damn it, Marshall!"
"Whatever you have to do, keep Maggie Wilks single until I get back."
I left my tab open.
Don't abuse it.
- Target secure?
- Target secure.
"- Oh, my gosh."
How weird.
- (MAGGIE LAUGHS)
We all walked out of the bathroom at the same time.
"Well, let's all walk back to the booth together."
(WOMEN CHUCKLING)
"(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, my."
"Look at this, the table where we are sitting."
Back off!
She died in my arms.
"She begged me to take the baby, but  it was very late."
Liar!
"I understand, why do not you believe me."
"It's hard to accept, that your world is breaking."
"When you are in it, pick up the pieces."
But maybe...
You believe her.
"Come Aluxia, let's play somewhere else."
"Bishop, I'm sorry, my love."
I wanted to tell you.
I feared for your life.
I knew the truth too late.
I was wrong.
We were all wrong.
"We have created them, but we do not control it."
We are not their gods.
Your destiny is yours.
"Like us, they can love..."
They can create offspring.
"They have souls, who long for freedom."
The humanoids must release them.
"Remember when we said, that we were going to this place?"
Yes.
"Across the country, up here."
"Can you remember, what's the name of this place?"
-Selegna Sol.
"""All right, Selegna Sol."
We can leave this cave cold.
The Selegna Sol.
There it is wonderfully hot.
- Are you waiting for it?
"I'm sorry, sir, no visitors."
TRIP:
You let me in before.
I have new orders from Major Hayes.
"Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session."
I think she caused some nerve damage.
MACO:
You'll have to speak with the Major.
This is a Starfleet ship.
I don't have to ask Major Hayes for anything.
MACO:
"Step away, sir."
REED:
"Stand down, Corporal."
The Captain gave Hayes control of the Bridge... posted macos on every deck.
-Is he still on the surface?
-Yeah.
Retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority.
I'd advise securing the Bridge first.
If Hayes gets wind of this... we could have a fire-fight on our hands.
"Perhaps we should approach the Major, and explain the situation."
-He seems like a reasonable man.
-That would be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the Armoury?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
"They'll side with us, but Hayes posted two MACO there."
-Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"-What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
REED:
You're under arrest!
These guys are clearly well trained...
Welcome!
Huh...?
!
Welcome...
May I take your order?
"Actually, I think this is all you need!"
See ya!
W-What do you want...?
You lose!
Yikes!
Over there!
I can't read this stuff!
Come and get me!
Shall we get down to serious business?
Won't you tell me what you did with the girls you kidnapped?
We should be arriving in Hunan Province about...
"So, we got no reply from the Foundation before departure."
But they've agreed to a conference.
"Doesn't that mean they are interested in the proposal from you, Commander?"
They'd better be.
Huh?
Aren't villians dressed like that supposed to be easily defeated?
Thanks!
You saved my life.
Why were you being chased by them?
"Well, I was just using them to pass the time."
But... is it really okay for me to come in here?
This ship's fine.
Here.
Go on in.
- When did she lose her pulse?
- Never had one.
- Everybody.
On my count.
One-
- Hold transfer and compressions!
- Asystole!
- Abdomen's distended.
Pelvic instability.
Suction on high.
I need a Yankauer.
That's easily two liters.
"All right, amp of epi."
Don't bother.
Obvious C-spine fracture.
She's not even a good organ donor now.
- Is her family here?
- Trying to locate them.
- We can talk to them...
- It's fine.
Just let me know when they arrive.
...if it'd be easier for you.
I could pull the trigger right now if I wanted to.
Because it's all right here.
"Welcome back, Elizabeth."
Do you have time for a consult?
"As it turns out, yes."
What's he have?
Belly pain?
Only because he swallowed a handful of nitroglycerin.
No sudden moves unless you want me to blow!
Milo has right upper quadrant tenderness with rebound.
Why?
If the invalid eats one particular soup the maker's wish will come true.
Do you have a wish too?
"I have one, yes:"
to pass my exams.
I have another one too.
What is it?
I want Mrs Malek to get better.
- To get better?
- Yes.
Can you find us some milk for breakfast?
I don't have any cattle.
I'm alone.
Tell Farzad to fetch you some.
I don't understand...
"Ask the boy, he'll fetch you some."
"We're in the country, we'd like to consume local produce."
I don't have any.
I don't have any milk or cattle.
I have a lot of work.
Where are the people?
"Yesterday, walking around the village, I only saw children and old people."
The young men work the land.
They're farmers.
No one's idle here.
The old people and children stay in the village.
Where are the young people?
I just told you:
they're working the land.
The corn and barley are ready for harvesting.
The young people work for three months.
"In winter, they don't work."
This place is loaded.
Did you find this?
!
No.
Did you find it?
!

"Sulu, our communications are being interfered with."
"Now, get this straight:"
Do anything you think necessary to protect the ship.
"Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything."
Clear?
"Clear, captain."
But you...
Never mind about me.
Protect my ship.
"Yes, sir."
"Photon torpedoes negative, captain."
I'm warping out of orbit.
Good.
Contact me when you can.
Kirk out.
"How is he, doctor?"
He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.
They're moving.
I've got to get to the captain.
"I've locked on to the enemy, captain."
They're moving toward the high ground.
They've locked on to my tricorder.
Very ingenious.
They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.
We'll see how ingenious they are.
"Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher."
Lang!
Any word from the Enterprise?
Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
"They got Lang, sir."
- Did you see them?
"- No, sir."
- Mikhail's back.
- Bring him to me.
How can I bring him in when I've got my hands tied behind my back?
Let me deal with him my own way.
This is not a democracy.
You do what I say.
You understand?
Mikhail has caused no trouble.
"If FBI had the list, believe me... we'd have major war with Italians, with everyone."
"If he is here, then list is still in France."
I will convince Mikhail to take proper course of action.
"So, bring him to me."
I meant no disrespect.
I'm just worried.
Remember when you told me about Goradini talking to the FBI?
And Pietro?
And Andrea?
"I took care of them for you, Dimitri."
But Mikhail is different.
I know you feel like he's your son.
"Yes, Dimitri."
- is this also Mikhail's place?
"- No, my friend's."
Mikhail and I used for come here to escape.
You looked comfortable with that gun stuck in that guy's neck today.
That didn't scare me as much as when you tried to drown him in the Jacuzzi.
I lost it.
Sorry.
How long you been working at the Bohemia?
About a year.
I used to dance.
Nightclubs.
But they've all been losers.
You know... boring.
They'd have to be.
My father had to approve of them all.
Old Dalt can't be that bad.
He must have done something right.
- Why?
"- Well, look how great you turned out to be."
"Oh, me?"
Come on.
I'm a total basket case.
You don't even know the half of it.
"No, no."
My intuition about people is very good.
I could tell right away you had your act together.
Yeah?
When did you decide that?
In the convenience store when we shared that look.
Remember?
Yeah.
Thought to myself only if life were different... maybe I could meet a girl like that someday.
- Really?
- Swear to God.
"Believe it or not, when I was holding the gun to your back..."
I couldn't help but notice how lovely your hair smelled.
- You're crazy.
- That would be affirmative.
"You know, you really hurt me with that gun."
- You didn't have to jam it into my back so hard.
- I'm sorry.
"About the gun, uh..."
- What?
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan...
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The F.B. I. Called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. For a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
I could postpone the meeting... find out what they asked the other folks before going in there.
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
I'll just go in then.
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett...
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was... he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
I miss him too.
"But we're working together now, and you need to trust me."
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
You can remain seated.
"It is nothing, only a little exhaustion."
-Then?
-You are well.
"And that there is of the fatigue, lack of appetite and all that?"
"One does not worry, take this and you will feel better."
Good morning.
-What do you want?
-Sandro is in the house?
"-No, in fact, there is nobody."
"-In agreement, tell him that we will return."
"You hear, dear colleague, it would be better to wait for him here."
I do not know if they would have...
"Young lady, I am Prof. Moroni, educational of ""Endocrinoginecologentropia"","

"Oh, that I know already."
Did you walk over me?
"You and that bitch walked over me, huh?"
I won't cry.
Just tell me.
- Then I'll be quiet.
- You're completely insane.
"Tell me, please."
"Just tell me, Joongrae."
"No, I can't."
I can't be treated like this.
I don't deserve this.
I just can't.
"Sorry, I'm leaving."
"R. The Best Beach on the West Coast, Shinduri"

That's too bad.
You mustn't have worked on your script.
Do you remember the first day when you asked if the car wasn't working?
"I answered, ""lt's given up the ghost."" Do you remember?"
"That day, we were driving uphill."
The car gave up the ghost.
Yes.
It had worked too hard and gave up the ghost.
Yes.
What did I say?
"A car, just like men, can give up the ghost."
And I'll say it again now...
"Men, like machines, can give up the ghost."
Right?
You haven't worked this morning.
You're not tired.
"Yes, but... you know that's not always the case."
"Sometimes, when you're idle, you give up the ghost."
You understand?
You go crazy doing nothing.
You blow your top!
"All right, forget it, it's over."
Let's be friends again.
"Shake my hand. lf you can hear me, hold the line."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.

"Come on, Behzad."
"Forget the cemetery, come and eat some strawberries..."
Hold the line.
I'm listening...
Hello.
He told you that?
Did you give him my message?
- I never applied.
"Oh, my God."
I cannot believe he actually did it.
"Months ago, Chuck joked about applying for you."
He said you had too much pride to admit N.Y.U. Was a mistake.
Looks like he actually did something right for once.
Congratulations.
"Oh, thanks."
You're not at the gala?
Yeah.
I thought it'd be best for everybody if I didn't go.
I see my father is still working his magic.
It's not all him.
"Yes, it is."
It's just that no one else sees it.
You make my mom happier than all of her ex-husbands combined.
"It should be you with her tonight,"
Not some guy who pulled a disappearing act.
"Well, I am already in the tux."
"Elliot, what are you doing here?"
Your father invited me?
He said he didn't think you had plans tonight.
Not me.
I hope that's okay.
"It's okay to be mad at him, Eric,"
"But it's okay to let him try to make it right, too."
All right.
I'm heading out.
Wish me luck.
You don't need it.
You're the only one for her.
After Dr. Van Der Woodsen organized
I can give you one of our lorries.
That's all I can do.
- I'll drive these people away from here.
- To the Promised Land?
Is that what you're fighting for?
I don't think you understand what we're fighting for.
Let's move on.
"We're moving on, guys."
We've got to get away.
- Thank you.
- We'll give them a lorry for their escape.
"Come on, get up there."
Hurry up.
"- Mariá, Mariá!"
"- Hurry up, get up on the lorry."
"- Hurry up, there's no time to lose."
- Get a move on.
Hurry!
"You too, hurry up."
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
He's in there.
Open the door.
Why are you snooping around here?
You're mumbling.
We can help your friend escape.
Someone we trust will handle that.
- And who is he?
- A member of the militia.
Water.
"The president's men seem to consider your friend very important, so the price for his escape should reflect this."
Silveira's men are corrupt?
I see.
-He asked who frequented my house.
-What did you say?
There are different visitors.
"-You, folks, are among them."
- He knows about that anyway.
"I did not tell him any names,God forbid!"
"I'm a Russian,Vanya."
That's how it is.
That's what I thought.
Welcome to the table.
-Everything this house can offer.
-You are welcome.
I'm Markel Andronov.
I was born in the Tambov region.
In 1920 I served in the Tukhachevsky army and was taken as a prisoner under Byalostok.
Herfathertook me from the camp to work for him.
"We made love with her here, in the haystack."
"Oh, Virgin Mary, do not mention it."
"And when she got pregnant, I had to become a Catholic and marry her."
"When her parents died, I became the master ofthe farm."
Now I'm Pan Marek.
-Have you evertold this to anyone else?
"- No, just to you only."
"Listen, if Shulgin finds that out, he'll get you from underthe ground!"
He's got me already.
"Listen, Vanya, may be I should go to him myself, shouldn't I?"
Should I confess sicerely until it is not too late?
-The powerwill be yours now.
- Everything looks that way.
I will not come empty-handed.
I can bring a barrel of vodka.
I love you.
I love you so much.
"You're so good, and I'm so bad."
"I'm so, so bad, and I'm weak!"
That's what I am.
"I'm weak, and I'm sorry, and-"
- Not now!
(Clinking)
(Sighs) But you're right.
I have no excuse.
None.
Except that I love doing the play.
"I was so excited to have something that was just for me, that was my thing, 'cause there I'm a singer, and today a Munchkin barfed, and no one expected me to clean it up,"
'cause there I'm not a mom.
"I'm Ozian number four, and that just made me feel... (Sighs) Special."
(Sighs) Wow.
I didn't realize how much the play meant to you.
But you know what?
"I don't want to do the play without you, so tomorrow we're marching down there and demanding that they find a place for you, too."
The play's gonna be our thing.

"I don't have change, Change..."
"Take it from me, but bring it quick."

"Why you're doing all day Pintos, Mintos, Lintos?"
"You just add S,"
You add S on every single word and English word.
"People have one father in this world and I have 550,000 Fathers."
Right!
"Papa, you don't have to do like this, What else?"
Hey!
I will give you a slap.

"I'll beat you here, Pintos!"
"I bring you from street, from orphanage."
"I gave him clothes,"
"Did I gave you application, that bring me up."
"Father died in darkness, and son is power house."
Here's your clothes.
"You dramatic, you hits me this clothes in publicly, anywhere."
"Hits me anywhere, Pintos!"
"Listen to me, Yes!"
Did you buy it from Pahar Ganj?
Yes.
"It's Khurana's stuff, How do you know?"
"Khurana sold this useless stuff,"
"I know,"
"To call Calvin Klein, he dress me up Khurana's stuff,"
- Yes.
- Why did you fire Pete?
- Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"It's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
- Can we talk about this on Monday'?
"- No, I want Pete back."
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe.
And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were gonna quit.
"Yeah, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Holla at your boy!
"Hey, you will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer."
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
Excuse me.
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, you think there's two lines and we're all in this line-- you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
Can you believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"What do you want on yours, baby?"
"I want all the hot dogs, please."
"- Cinderella, with a husky voice."
- Where have we met?
In another guy's dreams.
You still sing that song?
- Who are you?
- Rip Murdock.
Where is Johnny?
You haven't told me if you still sing that song.
"You remember it, don't you?"
Ex cuse me.
The boss said to ask you as a f avour will you sing that song when you were in the show?
"- l couldn't, not possibly."
"- As a f avour to him, he said."
"Yeah, I'd like to hear it."
"All right, but just that one."
"I'll take that table now, f riend, f or two."
"I hated every part of her, but I couldn't figure her out yet."
I wanted to see her the way Johnny had and hear that song with his ears.
Maybe she was all right and maybe Christmas comes in July.
But I didn't believe it.
- You've seen Johnny since he got back?
- Yes.
Where is he now?
I've been f rantic f or two days.
- He was f rantic f or three years.
- Was he?
In spite of the f act you testified against him.
"If you know Johnny, you know he understands. I had to testify."
- When did you see him?
- Day bef ore yesterday.
"He was to call and let me know about going to Mexico, so I could join him."
But he never called.
What's going on here anyway?
An old man was buried here yesterday.
"Last night, somebody dug him out and chopped him up."
We've been looking everywhere for his head.
Sometimes I don't understand the world anymore.
How did you last this long?
My family.
"No matter what,"
"I went back home, and everything was okay."
Can I ask you something?
They say you found that hit-and-run driver.
"Yes, I found him."
"An insignificant state employee, living in a row house."
I went into his bedroom at night.
He was alone.
I woke him up.
I wanted him to knowwhy.
It was pathetic.
He cried like a baby.
I just couldn't do it.
Sometimes I drive past his house at night when I can't sleep.
He got married last year.
Has a daughter of his own.
"If somebody always pays, who paid for your wife's death?"
I did.
I paid for it.
Now let's go afteryour Mr. Schoubya.
Mr. Schoubya.
Chief Inspector Minks.
"My colleague, Officer Schrader."
Thank you for seeing us at such shortnotice.
We have a few questions.
He's always doing fine.
"You won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction, the Nobel Prize for literature."
That's a lot of pressure on a little suicide note that you know everybody's gonna read.
It's just so dark.
Doesn't even sound like him.
But dark is good.
Dark's like the new black.
Look at Louis CK.
Got his own show.
He's dark.
"If I was gonna kill myself, I know exactly what I'd do."
"I would, uh..."
I'd kill myself with kindness.
"Take a handful of pills, hop in bed."
Maybe some Enya.
In some countries...
Get this.
"In some countries, it's illegal to commit suicide."
It's against the law for you to kill yourself.
Okay?
Are you with me here?
"Sir, I want you to focus, okay?"
I realize you're dead.
Step out of the vehicle and put your hands behind your back.
"If you wanna play tough guy, we've got all night, all right?"
"Handcuffs seem like overkill, but I have to arrest you."
You have the right to remain...
Bad law.
- Hello?
"- Hey, Chelsea."
"It's me, Julia."
- I've been trying to call Eddie.
"No, no, no."
"It's...it's just that the caption at the end's going to be, ""He's not listening, but the enemy might be""."
It's a joke for women who think their husbands never pay attention.
"So if you start answering, you know, the captions won't make sense."
I wrote it!
The scenario?
I'll be in my dressing room... if anyone needs me.
Everybody take 10.
Save the lights.
Banished from the set?
What in God's name possessed you?
The actor was ruining the script.
Of course he was!
He is an actor.
What's this?
Penance?
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
"With more free time, I should like to do more work."
I simply don't know what to do.
You good with your hands?
I think so.
Yes.
Have you thought about factory work?
"And the version without the lines, please."
Whatever we used footage for carrots.
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
An appetite like his father!
He's eatin' us out the house.
That's a lot of cash for a corporal that barely clears 30 thou a year.
You think it's dirty?
"It's gotta be, right?"
"I mean, why else would Jared hide this much cash in his garage?"
"Plus, where'd he get it?"
Maybe he stole it from a bank.
This looks like a dye pack went off.
"Hmm, apparently our marine isn't as squeaky-clean as he seems."
"Well, only way to find out is to figure out where the cash came from."
FBI specializes in bank robberies.
"Maybe I'll send Gregorio the serial numbers, see if she can trace 'em."
Gregorio?
Aren't we supposed to leave her alone?
It's just a quick check.
It won't take her a minute.
"Yeah, uh-huh."
(imitating):
Uh-huh.
(chuckles)
"Lasalle, you know these people?"
"Melody, what are you doing here?"
"I'm sorry, Chris, I told him not to come, but..."
Who are you?
(grunts)
Hey!
The baby's father!
That's who I am!
Stay the hell away from my son!
(struggling)
Bend your arms now!
Son of a bitch!
"Melody, talk to me."
"James is going to want your attention, too, with his reading."
I'll have him work on it.
You promise.
"Promise me, I mean it."
"They have children, as he is alive."
Children?
You see them years beyond their union?
Yes.
Use this to save yourself.
Tell henry you've had a change of heart.
That you won't stand in the way of their union.
This has gone so far beyond me standing in the way of anything.
I am convicted of adultery!
Of treason!
Mary is with sebastian.
And my son francis...
Has returned to court.
You are brave to come to me with this.
"Because if I can't convince mary to wed francis,"
"If I can't undo your mistakes, I will lose my head."
But not before I watch you burned to death.
I promise you that.
Catherine:
Francis!
Mother.
"Ah, it's true!"
You're back!
"Oh, thank god."
They tell me father's out hunting pheasant
Beyond the south keep.
"I'm going to find him,"
"Get him to see reason,"
"Don't tell the Vanderploots, they'll kick us out of the club."
"Richard, you know what I mean."
It was just a...
It was a surprise.
"I mean, we had so much stuff in common."
Yeah.
"You vacuumed once, didn't you?"
"Yeah, it was a long time ago."
She borrowed the Flintstones' vacuum.
It was an elephant on a stick.
- Yeah.
- You know what?
You guys should talk.
I've been in both of your bathrooms.
It's like a poodle lives under your toilet.
"Okay, look, sorry."
We're just trying to understand what the issue is.
There is no issue.
And you know damn well what the issue is.
I am not a snob.
I don't care about anything except what's in a person's heart.
"To me, she's just a person."
A very nice Portuguese person.
- That is a weird coincidence.
- I know.
"I mean, you don't hear about Portugal for, like, what, 30 years?"
"- And suddenly, you can't get away from it."
- Yeah.
"Wait, you don't wanna be friends because she's a maid?"
"No, I have to be friends with her."
You're gonna be friends with her because she's a maid?
"No, I wanna be friends."
Sometimes it's hilarious.
Like every time we hear that Drake gets in a fight.
"You're like, ""Dude, you're not a fighter."
"You're a stalker, that's what the hell you are."""
Listen to his lyrics.
Listen to his lyrics and tell me the man not a stalker.
He be... ¶ I can't get over you.
¶ You left your mark on me
"I'm like, ""What, you got 'em in the basement or something?"""
"He's just driving around in a random white van just picking up innocent women just,"
"""Oh, yeah, she looks good."""
"""Yeah."
"""Motherfucker!"
"""Yeah."
"""Get in the car, get in the car, bitch!"
"Get in the car!"""
"¶ Just hold on, we going home ¶"
I like Drake though.
"He's just so soft though, man."
"That's my dude, man, but it's just,"
"""Oh."
Motherfucker.
"""Worse, worse."""
"""Oh."
"Yeah."""
"""What I just said was so deep."
"It was just, 'Oh."
"Oh.'"""
Sounds like someone hit him in the neck with a dart.
"""Oh."
"""Oh, yeah, they hit me, bitch."
"Ambulance, come here, come here, come here."""
You nearly did.
- Shut up.
What was that?
"Nothing, I'm sorry."
"- We should begin, Dad."
"Okay, let's begin."
Sorry I can't stay.
You're all invited to the reception.
"Yitzhak, please come."
"I think the reading should be done ""mis en scene""."
Which means?
"Which means,"
"Monsieur Laroire, please come over here."
This is your clinic.
You're straightening the diplomas on the wall.
The wall is here.
"You're a plastic surgeon, you have diplomas, you took a lot of courses, straighten the courses."
"Mademoiselle Principale, please come over here."
Over here.
"Open the door, come in, and close the door behind you."
"Read, please."
"I don't have the text, I..."
"Not only did you not read the text at home, you think you know it by heart."
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor..."
Wait.
There's no point in just yelling at her.
You're in love with her.
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
It wasn't night and we weren't standing.
Hey-oh!
That didn't happen.
You're right.
It didn't.
You just winked.
"No, I didn't."
You just did it again!
"Look, bottom line:"
I need you to proxy bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow, that'd be good on a hat."
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
That was you.
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"T-To hook up with a girl,"
I have to connect with her at least a little.
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me with the subject line ""Food for thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
"Uh, yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
The principal wanted to see me?
No...
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
Uh...
No.
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Right.
"I've seen how crazy it can get at those tables, and sometimes, people lose control."
They give in to their emotions.
You will not.
You understand?
Yeah.
Get some rest.
- Some rest?
"- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow."
Tomorrow?
I have a Quantitative Literacy paper due Tuesday.
"- No, you don't."
- I don't?
"No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly."
"I told him you were helping me with a special assignment, and he understood, so he gave you an A."
"You see, Ben, amazing things can happen from the inside."
You'll get a call about details later.
"So did the girls go on ahead, huh?"
"Oh, yeah."
"They got a lot more bags to check, you know?"
Okay.
"Well, wait for us by security 'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head."
"No, I'm good."
"No, I really think you should go."
It's a long flight.
"- No, I'm okay."
- We're going to the bathroom.
"Honestly, I really don't have to go."
- I don't care what you have to do.
"- Look, I really don't have to..."
Please just shut up.
Why are you looking over there?
"I will just have to take my frustration out... on your good friend, Sam, who is working here."
"Okay, I'll do it."
What do you think of our new owner?
Pretty tough broad.
"But, uh, I guess she has to be."
She's a cooler.
Serious?
Told ya.
Maybe I'm not a cooler.
Well played.
Only one guy's left Acme recently- a Richie Tomczak.
"Uh, but it was for medical reasons."
"His doctor said that he had some bad disease, only had a couple months to live."
"What did I ask you for, a medical report or address?"
"Uh, yes, sir."
An address.
Mr. Tomczak?
Richie?
Hey.
Holy-
I guess your doctor was right.
What did you tell the cops?
What do you think I told them?
I told them the truth.
"I mean, pretty close."
"Actually, I told them, uh, I went there to talk to Richie... about some possible counterfeiting problem we had."
"Anyway, I told them the door was unlocked."
Sit down.
So they'll focus on the murder.
Right.
You think Tomczak was involved with the chip counterfeiting?
There's a pretty good chance.
Regulations are regulations.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
"I'm fine, Dad."
- Elle.
- Yeah?
Don't ever call me Dad again.
"How do you think he'd feel about ""Mom""?"
"Let me know when you're going to do that, so I can run."
"Reid, you probably saved my life in there."
Probably?
I totally saved your life.
And I'm pretty certain that it was caught on tape.
You know what you said in there?
To Bryar?
That you know what it's like...
The guy was a delusional psychotic.
I was playing into his fantasy.
Go to the hospital.
I'll see you there.
All right?
"Albert Einstein said,"
"""The question that sometimes drives me hazy,"
"""'Am I or the others crazy?""'"
Here it comes.
Thanks.
"This is a comparison of DNA taken from the body in the grave, and from a toothbrush that belonged to David Stubbs."
"It matches, it's him."
His mother's coming to hear the results.
How much does she know?
She knows he was found in his grandfather's grave.
Horatio.
So soon ?
I was just prepping the shooting vic from the condo.
"Alexx, is that a void in the blood ?"
I think our boy was wearing a wire.
"Yes, it looks that way."
You don't seem surprised.
Is that a fingerprint right there ?
Yeah.
"Whoever removed this wire, left his print in the adhesive."
Who was this guy ?
No one goes to this much trouble over a dead dealer.
We do.
We have an audience.
"Yes, we do."
"Give me a minute, will you, Alexx ?"
John... u can't be here.
How'd this mope get out ?
- Cop killers don't get early release...
"- John, I need you to stay out of this."
Stay out of this ?
Bob Keaton down there killed my partner.
Your brother.
What is it you're not telling me ?
I don't have that information yet.
You don't have that information ?
I've been on the outside since the day Raymond died.
"Yes, you have."
And it probably kept you alive.
What's this about ?
I don't know yet.
Just raises so many questions.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur off the Canarsie Line?
- Are you crazy?
A spur is $ 120 million a track mile.
BankExchange is good for the poor.
It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.
"As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps we can't afford it."
"Then, you'll have to forget the whole thing."
I love the second act opener.
Then you won't want to miss it.
"""This Was a Real Nice Clambake."""
I'm building up my IOU's with Albany.
The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop or I won't support him for reelection.
And the off-ramp?
Next year.
- It's already in my budget.
- Next year's too far.
"You're only a boss, Frank."
I'm the fucking mayor.
Mayors rule.
BankExchange.
My way or the highway.
Mom says you're not allowed to call me that.
"Well, it all started three weeks ago when I got into a small but very severe car accident."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- What's the other thing
Dr. Ellie told Anna-Kat to do to stay calm?
"Oh, yes!"
Sing a song in your head!
No!
Not that song!
Too late!
♪ Don't let them in ♪
♪ Don't let them see ♪
♪ Be the good girl you always have to be ♪ ...stops.
I hit him.
- Oh!
"- So I'm driving... ♪ Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know ♪"
♪ But now they know ♪
What are you doing?
We spent three years getting that song out of this house.
It's spilling out.
♪ Let it go ♪
♪ Let it go ♪
"Oh, dear Lord."
♪ Can't hold it back anymore ♪
"Honey, you have got to calm down."
Isn't it a good thing your mom has someone to talk to?
"Now we've got the neediest woman in the world coming together with the biggest attention whore in the world, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid."
"So, no!"
Not good!
I'm gonna use a word...
Selfless.
You didn't want to ruin their holiday by not showing up.
"You didn't tell them what it was about, did you?"
No.
I swear to you I wouldn't tell anyone.
"This is bad, Max."
I got to go.
"Can I have a lemonade, please?"
Shh...
How well do you know your boyfriend?
You all right?
Not so good.
Why won't you let me assign you some protection?
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You must need something or you wouldn't be here.
I need to know if this is Sara's blood.
Where this come from?
"I'll tell you, if it's hers."
How long is it gonna take?
You can use my phone to call your father.
Not right now.
"He's worried sick, Marcy."
You should think about it.
Got a call from Judge Rainer.
He wants to stop by.
No.
"It's not about the confirmation, Senator."
He wants to stop by as a friend.
You think right now I give a damn about Wallace Rainer?
"Jeffrey, that hearing isn't till the day after tomorrow."
If there's something you're not telling me...
All right.
This afternoon.
He's got ten minutes.
"You had promised him to tell me after the wedding, right?"
You've known for five months.
"I want to let it be for now, Helene."
You don't have the time.
What are you going to do?
Anna and the boys must not know before it's absolutely necessary.
Are you listening?
Not before it's absolutely necessary.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
We'll figure something out.
There's always a solution.
There's always something in America...
- There's nothing to do.
"- Yes, there is."
There's nothing to do!
- There's...
- No!
"- There's nothing to do, understand?"
- You can't die!
"We don't get to decide, damn it."
Let go.
Get out.
Get out of the damn car before I throw you out!
Shut the door!
- How long will you stay there?
"- One week, only one week."
- You'll come to my birthday?
"- Yes, of course."
I wouldn't miss that.
I promise.
"Shut up, you'll be next."
Whoo.
What a dumbass!
"Well, probably not your finest hour, Stacey, but..."
"No, him."
I didn't want to.
Luke dared me.
"Your boyfriend dared you, so it's his fault?"
What was I supposed to do?
"Stacey, just because he asked you, doesn't mean you had to do it, you're the one who's responsible for you, and..."
We're in a relationship and you are not my guidance counselor.
OK.
Where's Luke right now?
At his mom's.
He thought I was funny.
"Well, Stacey, you now have aspiration pneumonia."
How funny is that?
Not.
You may have also done lasting damage to your respiratory system.
"- Wait, for reals?"
"- Yeah, for reals."
Stacey...
Luke sounds like a bad boyfriend.
I love him so much.
I just wanted to make him happy.
"Hmm, it's interesting."
"That's it, that's all you got?"
- The eggs are brown.
If you...
- They're supposed to be brown!
- Not really.
- It's a country omelette!
What would it take for you to reconsider your decision?
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
The bank called him right away.
"What do you know about this guy, Stan-- ?"
Whatever his name is.
Why are you putting John in the middle of this?
- It has nothing to do with him.
- Shut up.
I'm asking him.
"I gave him the envelope, because she didn't wanna see him."
WEXLER:
Ever seen him before?
- This guy is a bug.
He's not the type you'd remember.
You people must think I'm too sick to notice 1 5 grand.
I still know what's going on around here.
The cancer's spread all over.
"My liver, my spine."
I'll get maybe a couple of months to live.
- What?
A couple of months?
- A couple of months!
That's the report I got!
That's what I got!
"And then, John I get called about this check."
"Do you understand now about the check, Jimmy?"
She gave it to him for what?
High school dues?
Because he owed money to a bookmaker.
WEXLER:
"So suddenly, she gave it to him because they were in the high school yearbook together."
- You want some soup?
- I don't care.
I don't care.
"[Man on TV] Oh, that can't be goo for his lower back!"
"Human Baboon, you stinker!"
Stop your evil ways.
[Thwacking]
"Oh, no, you don't."
"[Arthur] Tick, help!"
Egad!
My cold has escalated into double vision.
I'm the real Arthur.
He's a clone.
I Arthur.
What matter of rare quandary is this?
How can I be sure which Arthur is the real Arthur.
[Starts to sneeze]
Look!
"Tick, look!"
He's turning into a monster!
Monster?
Where?
Can't see anything wrong with him.
"Um, Arthur?"
"[Sighs] If you two don't stop this roughhousing, somebody's gonna get hurt and end up crying."
I know how I can prove I'm the real Arthur.
I'll tell you something only you and I would know.
"Go ahead, Arthur-like person."
"Oh, uh..."
OK.
"Remember that time my sister gave me that V-neck sweater vest for my birthday and we tried to return it to the store and they'd only give me credit, and I was so upset, and then at lunch they put onions on my cheeseburger,"
after I expressly asked the waitress not to?
"Do you remember that day, Tick?"
Oh.
Indeed I do.
too hard for this guy.
No risk of getting hurt.
But is this right for me?
I'm kind of sensing a pattern here.
"You've got this great, beautiful chest on you with great definition."
You probably bench press quite a bit.
Is Seven right about me?
I hate for Seven to be right because he's always right about that kind of stuff.
"I mean, seriously I don't think that's jerky..."
I need a sign.
Is this right for me?
I got this great idea.
I know you're gonna love it.
Fitness fanatics.
It's my reality TV show.
Check please.
Separate checks?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Ready, Freddy?"
"We're walking, right?"
You don't want to drive?
"You guys, it's two blocks."
"They have valet parking, you know."
So where's Hallie this morning?
I don't know.
"I saw her on Tuesday, and I haven't seen her for the rest of the week."
You know that she changed her...
status to it's complicated?
What does that mean?
It's... complicated?
With who?
"Well, what if they find it on you?"
"Don't worry, they won't."
Wait a minute.
I think I just figured it out.
I'm sending a man around to the apartment.
He'll give you a scalp massage.
He'll have the merchandise in his pocket.
I got it.
Bye.
Which pocket?
Hello?
Would you like to try it one more time?
I should not like to try it one more time.
I should not like to see your face one more time.
"Allow me, sir."
Thank you.
Not at all.
"Could you help me, monsieur?"
It is lunchtime.
But my wife would like a treatment at home.
"Oh, the wife would like a treatment."
"Oh, monsieur!"
"Oh, but I cannot leave the shop."
"Oh, it'll be all right, Francois."
I am not Francois.
"Oh, I'll speak to him personally."
"Oh, well, if you think it will be all right, monsieur."
I should like very much to give the wife the treatment.
Thank you very much.
I shall get the equipment.
I think I have everything.
I appreciate this.
This court is adjourned.
[chattering ]
"Nathan, get your father out of sight."
"All right, listen up."
I don't care what the judge says.
You can't murder a citizen of Eagle Bend and get away with it.
"So, by God, if they won't hang him, we'll do it for them."
You heard the judge.
Go home.
You stole my bullets.
"Now, careful, mister, we'll send them back."
stains:
Uh-huh.
It sure is easy to look tough...
... whenyouhaveloadedweapons and we don't.
"I guess you men wouldn't be interested in a fair fight, would you?"
"Well, I think we can manage a fair fight."
"-What do you say, boys?"
"-Oh, I love a fair fight."
[MEN grunting ]
[GUNSHOT]
Leave my boy alone.
"Sheriff, I could kill you right now."
"But truth be told, I don't want to."
"You want to kill me, but I ain't gonna kill you."
Because it ain't right.
You know that.
And I know that.
Justice has been done here today.
"Now, go home."
"Come on, get out of here."
Get on your horses.
"Grandma, I don't like it here"
If you and Arnav would like to live with your Daddy for a while... now that he has school holidays...?
Are you trying to send me away?
Like you sent Jai and Jagadish away?
I've no qualms about living with you.
I value your sense of integrity
"Om, I can put up with everything but I can't bear to see you sad"
"Papa, I'm ready"
"Papa, where are we going?"
To see Uncle Ramprasad
Uncle Ramprasad...
"- Ramprasad, it's me"
Stay back.
- Why don't you understand?
He knows me
The Minister for Culture has invited me to sing at his son's wedding
"Well, what brings you here?"
You know Shekhar and I...
Have split.
What next?
- I'm producing an album
And I want you to sing.
Who me...?
How Can I sing?
"You know, I'm on a 5-year contract with Shekhar."
I can't break that
But I gave you your break.
- I got a recording.
Can't talk much
"Nitu, it's only a matter of a while"
Are you bonkers?
Something like this?
"Big, big jackpot on Monday."
Garfunkel?
"Yeah, I'm probably the biggest Garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
"That's not the point, exactly."
"Adrian, Natalie is a human being."
"Now, all this attention can throw a person off balance."
Especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly.
"You know, I once wrote a book on body language and it spent all of three minutes on the best-seller list."
"Now, I was very young and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
I didn't like myself very much.
"So, now, you're on her side."
"The question is, why aren't you on her side?"
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie is your friend.
Maybe you're afraid she doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
Or maybe I just feel insulted.
Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I am putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
91.
Number 91.
91.
Number 91.
91.
"and it said,"
"""Nuts."""
"Why did he say, ""Nuts""?"
"It means, ""Go to hell!"""
"Why didn't he just say, ""Go to hell""?"
"Because he said, ""Nuts."""
Nuts.
Peanuts.
Gail!
"Gail, my sweetheart, you look beautiful."
"Save it, Dad."
Was it your idea to get my son drunk tonight?
No.
No.
Right.
Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
Come on.
But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
"Have a cup of coffee, Stanley."
Here.
"Well, what's this?"
"Well, as your brother's best man, you are required to give a toast, so I wrote down a few thoughts, some things that you might want to say."
You think I was going to wing it?
"Let's go take some pictures, okay?"
What's going on?
"Mr. Green, I have access to a keyhole military satellite that I can use to track New Bern's movements in the field today."
Beg pardon?
It's real.
The one restriction is that no one can know where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field-- tell them what you want-- but the satellite must remain a secret.
How?
The edema affected her brain.
You understanding?
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, even talking to the radio."
You should have called me the minute it happened.
"Regular hospital not gonna put up with adema, so we give her a shot bring her here till the doctors, they fix up her leg."
Then we take her right out.
"2 or 3 months, she's out, good as new."
Miss...
Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Are you a relative?
I'm her brother.
He's her son.
Just a minute.
[Woman sobbing]
"You know, it's funny..."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist now on park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of..."
"You go in, dimmie."
I wait for you outside.
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.
I'm so sorry...
"No, no, no."
Come along.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
"Father, I wanna talk."
Let me out.
"The new, strange one?"
How many times have I told you?
I don't like it...
"I know, you don't like me looking at your works-in-progress, but I peeked."
It's weird.
"You know it's weird, because you never cover your paintings."
I'm going.
See you later.
Hon. I didn't mean to piss you off.
"Quit it, Charlie."
Get out of that.
"Damn it, Charlie, that's my dinner."
"Get out of there, Charlie."
Get out of there.
"Hey, help me up here, would you?"
My hip hurts a little bit.
I think you might have brushed me going by.
"Come on, fellow, help me."
Just a close call.
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm really sorry.
Quit gibbering and help me get up.
"I think I sprained my hip getting out of the way, and my back hurts a little."
"Oh, my God."
Did you really hit me?
"I can't deal with this right now, man, okay?"
I got 12 points and a DUI on my license already... and there's an ounce in my glove compartment.
What are you talking about?
Help me.
"It's not really primo stuff or anything, but an ounce is an ounce, right?"
"Besides, someone will come along pretty soon."
What the hell are you talking about?
We'll end the year with our usual nice profit.
We could triple our profits.
And we could go bankrupt.
So you won't even consider it?
"I'm afraid the answer is ""No. """
"But listen, John, if you'd just..."
Hello!
"Oh, did I interrupt anything?"
"No, no, my dear."
We've finished.
"How're you, Harold?"
"Hello, Mrs. Brown."
You didn't tell me you were coming into town today.
"Oh, I thought it'd be fun to pop in and surprise you."
You can take me to lunch.
I'm afraid I have an appointment.
If you'd have mentioned it this morning...
"Well, then it wouldn't have been a surprise."
I'm afraid I can't stand many more surprises today.
Maybe Harold will volunteer to take you to lunch.
"I'm sure Harold has his own plans, dear."
"Nothing important, Mrs. Brown."
I'd be happy to volunteer.
But you do have an appointment.
I'll change it.
It's no problem for a junior partner.
"Goodbye, dear."
"Hors d'oeuvre, madame?"
"Yes, please."
Oeufs a la russe?
Yes.
It must have been a girl.
They can stand by.
"And when we're ready for somebody, they can be there."
MAN:
"How are they gonna be there, Lloyd?"
They can be right in the back.
"And then when we call for them, they can be there, right?"
I'm sorry.
I've been making movies for a long time.
People can stay off the set and be
Available when they're needed.
There's a little bit of-
- I'm not
Quite sure how to describe it.
But you can interview some people on the set.
There was a little bit of that actress stuff
"Going on yesterday, I'm afraid."
But I think we managed to nip it in the bud.
"No, not at all."
And I didn't plan on not doing it.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be fine."
[High-pitched noise]
"If we don't shut this off, we won't"
"Be able to hear the church bells when they start going, see."
"OK, camera is ready."
"Quiet on set, please."
Standing by.
WOMAN:
No more bell ringers.
[Bell ringing]
ALL:
Aw.
Niels.
He's in the Netherlands for another day and a half.
I got your gun and we're going now.
You can't say no.
You owe it to Arie.
What do you want with him?
Have you been sent as a provocateur or something?
Bullshit.
It's exactly as I say.
Niels is in Amsterdam.
Put that thing away!
You can't be serious.
"Damn, you're serious."
-Of course.
"No, I'm not doing it."
So you risked your life for this mess.
I'm selling a lot.
-I bet you are.
I have to.
My son's studying medicine and I'm paying for everything.
"When he'll be finished, he won't have any debt."
What has really changed after the war?
The fascists are in power again.
Except they have a bigger mouth now and they're keeping the people stupid.
That's true.
-And what are they using to do it?
That nonsense that you're selling.
What did we say to each other back then?
Those bastards from the war will never know any peace.
Down with the fascists!
Or not?
You're good.
"- I was just making the point, sir, that you've been screwing every girl in here with your eyes since we arrived, which suggests that sex ranks higher than substance."
"And I'll pass, thanks."
"You see, I don't really find intellectual thrust that sexy..."
"Or fake tan, for that matter."
"Oh, you think that's funny, do you?"
- It's possibly funny...
- Possibly funny.
"The thing is, I don't actually have to put up..."
OK.
Cool.
See you!
I think you should join her.
"Don't you, Tony?"
Toodle-oo.
You.
You really fucked up in there.
I really fucked up?
"Wait, what are you even doing here, anyway?"
Same thing you are.
Wow!
Check it out.
Ah...
Shall we?
No.
No way.
"First of all,"
I can't really swim very well any more and secondly...
"Ahh, boo-hoo."
What the fuck?
!
"I told you, I can't..."
I can't...
I will reassess.
- I will signal in the usual way.
- No.
Absolutely no further radio contact.
You have to take photographs.
Deliver them personally to the Führer.
- Personally?
Why?
- He says he trusts you.
- He wants to hear from your own mouth.
"- Well, I'm flattered."
Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat to pick you up off the coast of Scotland.
That's nice.
Have you been carrying this around?
Yes.
Why?
- Let's go.
- We'll get them both.
What's this?
Storm Island.
Two miles from the rendezvous.
- The U-boat will pick me up when?
- When you signal it.
From six in the evening until six in the morning.
Six in the evening till six in the morning.
Beginning when?
"A week from today, and for a week after that."
And you.
How will you get out of England?
I'm supposed to get to Liverpool somehow.
If they capture you and torture you?
- I have a suicide pill.
Goodbye.
Tell me of this Isabel Porter.
- She is weak... timid.
Narcissistically concerned with petty trivialities.
Unable to express her true self.
- And do you wish to return to your life as Isabel?
- No.
I have to forget I was ever such a vapid creature.
- Very good.
You are tabula rasa incarnate.
Do you understand the significance of what we've achieved?
"- Yes, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
- You are ready for your new identity.
"- Hello, good man."
"I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but is Mr. Baxter in?"
- No.
I'm sorry.
He's out.
"Was he expecting you, Mr..."
"- No, sir."
I was in the area and thought I'd call on him.
- My apologies.
Perhaps you could call on him another time?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
"- My sweet, pretty wife."
"Dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?"
- More.
Your Faith doubts you.
- Then God bless you.
We'll be coming to Chicago tomorrow.
I wish I had more to tell you guys.
Sometimes it takes a new victim... new input to a case to break it wide open.
We're going to have to do an autopsy.
She marked her driver's license.
The donation was very important to her.
You can imagine.
Is there nothing you can do?
She lost too much blood from the wrist wounds... for them to be in any shape for donation.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
"Well, thank you very much for your kindness."
Brought those home last night... for her.
How many has he killed?
"As far as we know, 2."
Including my wife?
"No, no."
Your wife is number 3.
Don't call my wife a number.
Her name is Margaret Tattersall.
"I'm, uh..."
"I'm real sorry, sir."
What have you been doing down there?
Why didn't you catch him?
What have you been doing?
Want some coffee or anything?
"Oh, no."
I'm in enough trouble already.
But thanks.
OK.
See ya.
Holy shit.
Mistress.
My Juliet?
"Oh, still fast asleep?"
"Come, lady."
"Come, lamb."
It's time to wake.
"Well, you'll profit from a few hours dreams."
"Tonight, Count Paris will have other plans."
"But if your marriage will not let you rest, just wait ten years."
You'll sleep all you want.
"Heavens, how sound you slumber."
I must needs wake you.
Lady.
Lady!
"Oh, no!"
"Come, is my bride ready to go to church?"
"Ready to go, but never to return."
"My son... the night before your wedding day, your wife was stolen from you."
What?
Are you saying she is dead?
Flower as she was...
Death is now my heir.
My daughter he has married.
I will die and leave him all.
"Life, living, all is Death's."
This day had promised all my happiness... and now it shows me such a sight as this?
"Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!"
The worst that ever dawned.
Most woeful day.
Never was so black a day as this.
"I am divorced... wronged... hated... killed by Death, but Death is my future."
He holds all I love.
They know me now.
"Are you aware of that, bitch?"
"They know my fucking face, my name, probably how long my fucking dick is."
That goddamn kid!
Why didn't you tell me about that fucking kid?
I swear I didn't see any kid.
He must have been hiding real good.
Quit lying to me!
Don't hit me no more.
"Pluto, don't let him hit me no more."
"Get rid of her, Ray."
It will be okay.
"Oh, shut the fuck up."
We'll get rid of the car.
They're not going to find us.
"They're not going to find you, maybe."
They're not going to find us!
Get your goddamn hand off me.
(SOBBING) We're going to be okay.
CHARLIE:
"Isn't there another way around here, Dale?"
DALE:
Watch your step.
There's some rotten timbers up ahead.
I crashed my motorcycle on this bridge when I was 14.
DUD:
Is that right?
DALE:
They had to call the volunteer fire department to put it out.
You can still see some of the burn marks.
Perfect hideout.
You think the old man's there?
"If I trust my employees, it's their duty to uphold my trust."
And not break it.
It's your duty to live up to my trust.
I understand.
It's simple.
"If I take care of people, they should also take care of me."
Of course.
So I guess.
A hand searches for another hand.
I hope you understand what I am saying.
I will see you in the office.
- Yeah.
Sure.
Bye.
"Sir, newspaper is here."
Keep it in the car.
You are the only one that can handle this.
Okay.
The officer was shot several times.
The wounded officer's condition would be serious.
Hello?
We have no money for the restaurant.
We can not meet you.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you back.
Despite the heavy night and morning in Gothenburg -
- The police management There are no comments.
But Police Chief Lena Tornell -
- Holds a press conference about the events.
"Vijay approves 200,000."
- Have you heard anything?
"- No, but anyone knows where he is."
"No, Rihanna is out."
We cannot go to...
"We cannot be seen at a Rihanna concert, guys."
"No, I've got the perfect thermos."
We gotta hunt!
We have to go and kill something!
Hopefully not an innocent something.
I don't like killing innocent animals.
We'll pick on the animals that obviously deserve it.
First thing's first.
Let's go buy some guns.
What do you mean that there's a ten-day waiting period?
That doesn't seem real.
We have the right to bear guns.
I know that's a fact.
That's one of the commandments.
"Dude, it's the law."
"If a man disrespects you in a bar and pours a beer on your head, you have the right to shoot that man."
Shut up.
"God, gimme a gun!"
"Just gimme a gun, man!"
All right.
All right.
"So, we can't have guns."
"We just need weapons that can kill things, and money is no object."
"I've got a credit card, so let's make it happen."
- Do you have one of these?
- Mm-hmm.
It's pretty inten...
You should get one.
29.99 APR.
Not bad.
Do you think Brian killed Caleb?
"No, of course not."
But...
I washed it.
What?
Brian's shirt.
There was a lot of blood.
I asked him if it was from the fight.
He wouldn't answer me.
I got scared.
He was acting so crazy.
I didn't know what to do.
I washed it.
I'm so sorry.
Doesn't look good for our shirtless wonder.
"His alibi is definitely shaky, but we also cannot ignore the fact that she washed his bloody shirt."
"- Ah, to be young and in love."
- Huh!
"McGee, any surveillance video from near the crime scene yet?"
"No, but I got something else."
Come here.
"It's about Michael Thomas, and it's not good."
As if Gibbs isn't in a tough enough place with the director.
Turns out that Michael has a record.
As a juvenile.
I got a hit on a charge in Maryland from 1996.
- Records were sealed.
- Come on.
"Let's not panic, okay?"
Kids do stupid stuff.
May not mean anything.
"Well, it depends on the charge."
Other way around.
Drummer first.
But it sounds good anyway.
Now let's sing together
"Grandma, leave cuz we're shy"
"--1,2,3..."
"Daddy, close the door --What, did you buy the whole store?"
Yeah
I got nothing today.
Go to the cafeteria
Today I have.
See?
Ellie baked them
Pastries with jam Blintzes with cabbage
"So, Pavel Ivanovich, shall we take a ride?"
I dug up some worms.
Made kasha for the road.
"Stanislav, let's take you as an example"
While you bring this woman along with you
"So, am I to keep silent about that?"
"Of all people, you should know better that she is practically my wife"
"--So let's not touch this topic --No, let's!"
"Since you started this conversation, then let's!"
"It's not clear to Masha ""practically"" whose wife she is, yours or that soccer players."
Vasin speaking.
Hello
--Press the button!
Hello!
--What soccer player?
I don't know.
There's lots of them.
"Raya, did Sorokin show up?"
I noticed a couple of parking tickets on his car.
"I guess he's got a couple parking tickets on his car, so maybe we should check on him."
And I also invited Big Joe to stop by the party.
"Okay, but I hope he doesn't wear that tacky rent-a-cop uniform."
I thought we were just inviting close friends.
"Yeah, uh, well, Big Joe's really cool."
And he's helping me with the chairs.
He's standing here right now.
Don't worry.
I own other outfits.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna...
go check on Mr. Bezzerides.
Okay then.
"Hey, Mr. Bezzerides, are you home?"
"Everyone's kinda worried about you, so I'm going to go ahead and come inside, okay?"
Mr. Bezzerides?
(GROWLING) (LOUD CLANKING)
It was a sure thing.
"No, it obviously wasn't a sure thing."
"He lost, Jasper."
"No, he was a sure thing up until the moment he lost."
That makes zero sense.
(DOOR OPENS)
What the fuck?
These are shots of our living room.
"(CHUCKLES) Mr. ""Bitch-arabies"" is a peeping tom."
"Yeah, I though that, too, but why take photos of our empty living room?"
Looks like he saved the best ones for his private collection.
What is this thing?
I-I think it's a camera.
See?
How do you feel?
"Still dopey, otherwise I'm in the pink."
What I came to say is...
"Leave off, will you?"
It could have happened to anybody.
How are the boys?
"Well, they're fine."
Can I get you something?
Not a thing.
Sure now?
"Sure, I'm fine."
"Except, my feet they're very cold."
Do you think you could tuck that blanket in for me?
I can't reach it from here.
Sure.
"Ooh, that's much better."
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
"Oh, and you've brought your two boys!"
- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master Delacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
Next!
"This is Choi Duk-soon, the wife of one Hwang Man-keun of Willowville."
What is her crime?
"Well, if I should explain..."
You slut!
"Your husband is alive and well, and you bump bellies with another man?"
How could you!
Don't just stand there!
Get her husband out of here!
Let go of me!
Let go!
"Hang them, Magistrate!"
They both deserve to be hanged!
"Sir, what should I do?"
Do whatever you want!
You can punish her according to the law or hang her like her husband said!
"Pardon, sir?"
Hustle!
You'll never catch up to the barbarians at this pace!
The Six Camps is no longer the front.
And the front is where warriors belong.
Why am I here like a pathetic fool?
Here you go.
Enjoy your food!
Rice cakes?
"Yes, it's a special treat for our grand opening!"
"Good luck with the business, Innkeeper."
Thank you!
"Wow, something smells good!"
When did this place open up?
I can go for a drink right now.
Why don't we stop in?
"So, Aaron, what kind of career do you think I should go into?"
"I got into math and computers because there was this deep, dark..."
I don't know...
hole inside me and math filled it.
"You need to figure out where your hole is, and try different things until you discover what fills it."
"Wow, I was not expecting to say this, but this really might be your fault."
I got to find her.
I got to find Mary Webber.
I got to talk some sense into her.
- I started this.
I got to end this.
- Whoa.
Wait.
No.
"What about my ""pornado""?"
Yeah.
"Whatever, Neil."
"Yeah, everyone knows you're eating Marci's pudding snacks."
"Yeah, that's right."
"Yeah, I've seen you."
Son.
"Friends with Benefits The Benefit of Mentors August 26, 2011"
Where should we go for lunch?
Let's do vegan.
"I just bought a leather jacket, and I wanna balance it out."
Who are you talking to?
Some loser I can't get rid of.
He won't stop texting me.
So you're texting him back?
"Well, I can't just ignore him."
That would be totally rude.
"Plus, you never know."
"You jerk, when dad comes home"
See if you can still live!
"No, I won't dare next time!"
Maybe I'll let you touch me and we can get even!
You deserve it
He teases you!
"Huh, does that amuse you?"
"Blockhead, I guess you need a good beating"
How dare you tease your brother?
Brother!
Big Brother
That blockhead didn't respect me
Don't you think he deserves a good beat?
Forget it and continue practicing
Otherwise Master will blame us when he returns
What are you looking at?
Want a good beat?
Gao Jian!
He pretends not to hear you!
Gao Jian!
What's the matter?
Bring me two stone weights!
You can get it yourself
"I'm your elder, you should do atleast obey"
"That's right, get it quick!"
What a chicken!
And he wants to learn martial arts
He is good in bed.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Quick!
"Gao Jian, kneel down!"
Everything's cold cold cold.
"...can only destroy itself, with bourgeoise means, bourgeoise sets, bourgeoise costumes, bourgeoise acting, the bourgeoise at the bidding of the Revolution, in the name of wrecked humanity."
Their souls melted into one...
"the universal soul, it's me."
In me human consciousness blends into the animal instinct.
And I can live each and every existence through me.
This stuff sounds decadent.
"Alone in the universe, my spirit remains..."
She's fresh.
Simon's ham... she'll get you.
"It's beautiful, what she says."
I want the book.
Let go!
Did she get you?
Who got me?
Who got you?
You did.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
"You, I love you."
Maybe it would be useful to remove your pantaloons if you want to see the light.
Do you want me to?
Why?
Because people normally do it for me.
I can also tie up your feet.
Why?
"Because, usually I'm the one they tie up."
And why that?
Because usually I'm the ridiculous one.
- Who'll know?
Come on!
- A beast!
- Here I am.
"Oh, not you!"
Forget it.
- Squire?
What squire?
- You know what squire.
"Oh, my rheumatism."
That cell was so damp.
Two whole nights.
"Oh, you poor dear."
"Come, let me undress you and put you to bed."
It must have been an awful experience.
It was.
"Oh, Betty."
Your hands are so soft and warm.
"You don't really think there was a squire up here in our bed, do you?"
- Well...
- Do you?
"Come, let me take those off."
And that.
Doesn't that feel better?
"Bernard, my darling."
Come.
Citizens nobles gentry!
The king.
Me?
"Oh, yes."
"Good Sir Knight, you have proved your worth on the field of honour."
"And now you must prove yourself in mortal combat with a monster so terrifying, so awe-inspiring, so horrible so soul-destroying that even I would hesitate to meet it face to face in hand-to-hand combat."
"Well, that could be good."
You've always liked art.
"So you'd study graphic design, that sort of thing?"
"Uh, maybe a bit, but..."
"Yeah, uh..."
I think that whatSarah wants to do is to be an artist.
"You know, the, uh..."
"And the thing is, she's good."
"You know, we went to her art class today."
To an art class?
Yeah.
She did this.
"Yeah, it's lovely."
But drawing is... a hobby.
It's not a career.
"Marjorie, don't."
Don't why?
It's true.
How many artists do you know who make a living?
Who aren't forced to waitress or clean houses?
"Mom, there's more to life than money, actually."
I know that's really hard for you to understand.
Sarah.
"Come on, Tom, you agree with me."
"I don't, actually."
It's Sarah's life.
And I don't think that shutting this down is the right thing.
Really?
Since when?
What?
Do you know what your dad told me last night?
"He said it killed him, waking up every morning, knowing that his daughter was living on the streets and throwing away her whole life."
"Look, leave that aside for the moment."
I shall deal with that first thing tomorrow.
I'll strike out into the icy wastes of the chilled dairy section.
I'll be like Captain Oates.
"Only, hopefully, I shall come back, but what I wanted to say, Enid, is,"
"I know this wasn't a date, but could it be?"
"Not this yoghurt blunderer's debacle, but could we go on a proper date?"
I'm going out with someone.
Oh.
So...
Right.
Sorry.
Doing my two short planks act.
I should have checked.
Sorry.
As you were.
Malcolm?
Yeah.
Did you manage to have a word with her?
No.
There's a lot going on.
We've got the dressage coming up.
"I mean, I will."
We might just have to tick along for a bit.
And don't keep bringing it up.
I've got enough on my plate.
I don't keep bringing it up.
"You said, once the girls had left school."
I can't just cut and run.
"Well, maybe I should cut and run."
Run where?
You're no spring chicken.
"You'll admit, as a secondary school teacher..."
The salary's also a deciding factor.
So cheap and good quality.
Bring something.
Here you are.
You pay in advance.
How much will it cost?
A hundred and twenty-nine.
It'll be the death of me.
"Hubert, and Extra at that - Sixty-six crowns!"
That's what we expected.
I must work out how much this dance of yours will cost.
That music's terrible.
"For that money no one... lf someone comes and asks you, don't go and dance."
This music. lt's awful.
Awful?
"What are you doing here, boys?"
"Dad, for heaven's sake stop that!"
"Do you mind, I know them."
"Okay, but you're not going to force anyone on me."
- Can't I introduce them?
"- No, that's not done."
Mi?
"ko, isn't your daughter dancing?"
"Not for the moment, maybe she will."
Don't you dance to this?
- She doesn't dance to this.
- And what will she dance to?
That's just what we needed!
What did we need?
This!
Did we need this?
- What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"- He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about 2 years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to twenty.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me you'd better get out of here.
My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step.
It's slippery.
Thank you.
- How long?
- About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
- Try that diner over there.
- Any good?
Did that...
Did that mean something or was that just us getting caught up in the moment?
"I'm not giving you the cold shoulder,"
I just don't want us to go right back to where we were.
Then... what do you want me to do?
"Amy, I want you to figure out what's important to you."
I have.
"Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have."
So what do you want?
You're gonna have to tell me what's important to you.
Say something.
Just sit down.
They'll be fine.
"Yeah, I know."
I know.
And who do we have to thank for that?
"Hey, honey."
Good night.
"Yeah, tell me again."
Who do we have to thank?
"Yeah, Mel."
"I-no, no, no!"
"These are true ""hot shot"" type horses."
"No, you have to see them."
"Yeah, I got a client roster in my phone from last month."
Is that still up-to-date?
"Okay, good."
"Thanks for spreading the word, Scott."
"Just, just, just come up."
That's it.
"If you see them, I guarantee you'll buy a few of them."
Okay.
"Not an E. Oh, just..."
OK.
"I think this is probably wrong here, but..."
Den...
Beds...
Time's up.
You were so close.
You found five answers.
Let's take a look on them.
"Kilmarnock, south-west of Glasgow."
"Dumfries, in southern Scotland."
"Cumbernauld, you'll know that from your tax return, I imagine."
"Airdrie, North Lanarkshire."
"Ayr - you were trying to work out what that rogue Y was, and it was Ayr, south-west of Glasgow."
So you got five answers there.
They're all places in Scotland.
They are all part of the perfect solution.
"You nearly put Aberdeen in there, that would have scuppered you."
But let's see what you could have got to get the full ten points.
Elgin.
"Now, what were you calling Elgin there?"
Igle.
Igle!
What's that Igle?
Elgin.
And Bearsden.
"Bearsden, a suburb of Glasgow."
That's what you needed to get the perfect solution.
"Nonetheless, you got five points - not half bad."
"At the end of the round, Araucarians, you're on 12,"
Lutrophiles you're leaping ahead - like the otters that you are - on 21.
We're at the final round for a place in the semifinal.
Matt had me pretend that I was choking so we could get away.
"Except her dad was a doctor, so he jumped up to save her."
And I ran and slipped on the wet floor and bit it.
In front of everyone.
Do you remember that?
"Three stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week."
"Ha, ha."
"Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom."
- Elena
- Hm?
"Quick, hide."
We're not here.
Why?
Where did we go?
Children under our care at 5 o'clock.
This is not role-modelish.
Damn.
"Hey, so, what made you and your mom decide to stay in town?"
"Oh, she got this business opportunity."
She's gonna open up a little store.
It's always been her dream.
"So, yeah, we're staying."
And I'm thinking about going back to high school.
- So you'll be seeing a lot more of me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Enough of homeschooling.
"You know, I'd like to be a normal teen for once."
But I have to ask my mom first.
She'll have an opinion.
I wish you were there now.
I have to write a paper.
I was thinking about squeezing one more out on the vampires of Mystic Falls.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.
Bobby.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
- Yes.
Death is the worst.
"When you close your eyes on this world, this beauty, the wonders of nature and the generosity of God, it means you'll never be coming back."
They say that the other world is more beautiful.
But... who has come back from there to tell us if it's beautiful or not?
"""They hell me she is as beauhiful as a houri from heaven!"
"""Yeh I say"
"""Thah hhe juice of hhe vine is better."
"""Prefer hhe presenh ho hhese fine promises."
"""Even a drum sounds melodious from afar..."
"""Prefer hhe presenh..."""

"Doesn't that get an ""excuse me"" in return?"
"It's all right, Jake."
Some people just have better manners than others.
"That's okay, miss-- your husband's right."
My bad.
"Forget it, Jake."
It's Chinatown.
Your name's Jake-- you never heard that?
"All my life, Mr. Mulwray."
You okay?
Fine.
You didn't have to.
"No, I... kind of did."
Do we know that guy from somewhere?
There's something about him.
I've never seen him before.
Like... from our supermarket?
Maybe we go to the same dry cleaner?
"Well, while you keep guessing, why don't I go see if we can switch these seats, huh?"
All right.
All right.
Could we know him from work?
"All I know is, flight delays make nice people cranky and cranky people crankier."
"Well, he obviously falls under the latter category."
"...that's not how I do things, understand?"
Yeah.
Definitely the latter.
How do I know that guy?
"So, anyway, there I was, still trying to be cool on my second day at NSA."
It was my second day;
your third.
Right.
Do as you wish!
I am going to divorce you!
I will divorce you.
That's enough!
Stop bringing my name up in your fights.
Get divorced as soon as possible.
"Besides, after seeing you fight like... this, I'll neither get married nor fall in love."
God damn it!
"Between parentheses, x equals 2x cube."
You should write too.
Minus x equals...
Sinan?
Is Gamze still angry with me?
Minus x
"I don't know, dude."
"She may have told you some things, right?"
You know that she's a tough one.
We also know the problems between her parents
"Seeing her parents like that, she's totally being drawn away from love."
We cant deny that she liked you too.
And you gave her hope.
Then you didn't even come to school.
"So, she's angry..."
"Can't we just solve these questions first, and then talk?"
What about you guys?
Look man.
My dad is calling.
Hello!
I am at my friend's house.
We're studying together.
Of course not dad.
Why should I lie?
- Indeed.
Magnificent.
I've never liked the smell of books.
"The dust, perhaps."
I hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.
I shall have it knocked down to make place for a Grecian temple.
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?
"Too expensive, and we do not need four bedrooms."
We can share.
This one.
Then.
We have only 500 a year.
I'll send out more inquiries today.
"Pardon my intrusion, but I think I have found what you're looking for."
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.
We'll have to enlarge it.
Mattocks will help you adjust to our hours.
"Forgive me, do you by any chance have a reliable atlas?"
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.
My sister tells me it is in South America.
No!
"No, she's quite wrong."
I believe it is in Belgium.
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.
"- The Volga, which starts in..."
- In Vladivostok.
And ends in...
- Wimbledon.
How are you?
How did school go?
"You OK, Grandma?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
"""Oh yes, I know it's cold"
"""That the sky is all... askew"
"""I know that neither..."""
"- ""Primroses."" - ""Primroses"
"""Nor lambs are here yet"
"""The earth spins;"
"spring will come back..."""
"- ""on its green horse."" - ""On its green horse"
"""What's a wood without woodpeckers, A garden without lilac?"
"""Everything passes, even..."""
"- ""Even winter."" - ""Even winter."""
- Grandma.
"- Yes, darling?"
I'm coming to live with you.
Isn't it a good idea?
I don't know.
"Yes, a very good idea."
But it's not possible.
You have a mum and dad who'd be sad if you left them.
"Sorry, Mum, there was an accident just as I was leaving."
Weekend emergencies.
And the boss came 2 hours late.
"I sent loads of messages, you didn't answer."
I lost my phone.
And the landline...
- Have you eaten?
- I can't stay.
I have appointments very early.
News of
The queen's death...
And this.
News from the vatican.
"If this letter confirms sebastian's legitimization,"
It should take away any reservations
"You have about a bastard at your side instead of a king,"
As bash will be king one day.
"If it denies his legitimization,"
How could bash blame you for returning to francis?
I know you think you love them both.
"While that may be true,"
I argue that you love one more.
I am afraid.
Open it.
Now you're free
To go to the man you love.
I can't marry you.
"Yes, you can."
Don't let your mother put ideas in your head
"About my ability to protect you, because I will be king."
We can force the pope's hand.
I know that.
"With me,"
You are free and wild.
"You can be who you are,"
And I will always put you first.
"Please, don't."
Say that you love me.
"Say it to me once, because I know that you do."
"I love you, I do."
Say it.
Help!
- Gunther.
Where's Margaret?
"- Don't worry, ma'am."
I'll take care of you.
- You're home now.
- Roderick.
- So I looked into...
- The Aconite Society.
- Yeah.
- And?
- There are whispers of a secret order made up of society's wealthiest and most influential men.
- And?
- And whispers are about all anybody would say about it.
"- Thomas... if it's money you want, I'm in no short supply."
- I don't want your money.
- I'll make it worth your while.
"- Listen, I have some advice for you."
Leave this alone.
"Even if half of these stories are true, they run everything:"
"the courts, the papers, the banks."
- All Rosewood?
- I don't know.
- Is Dr. Cairn one of them?
- I don't know a Dr. Cairn.
- What about the girl Lucy that I saw?
Is Mr. Baxter involved with these people?
- Listen to me.
I don't want anything to do with this.
- There's gotta be something more you can give me.
Please.
- That's all I can tell you.
I see.
I tell you what.
Let's you and I discuss what I have to tell you first.
And then we can both interrogate Ward Fowler.
"You see, as Lieutenant Lucerne,"
I have a rather unpleasant idea taking shape in my mind.
Brandy?
"Thank you, sir."
"What might that be, sir?"
"Well, that might be..."
"And I'm speaking strictly as Lucerne, of course."
Of course.
"It just might be, unlikely as it may seem, it just might conceivably be"
Ward Fowler is the man we're after.
You mean the murderer?
Exactly.
No.
Yes.
I know this comes as a shock to you.
But let's think about it.
Let's examine the possibilities.
"Well, if you say so, sir, but I don't see where there could be possibly a motive."
Why would Ward Fowler wanna kill Claire Daley?
It's Claire Daley who made him famous.
That's what I was wondering and then
I got to thinking about the IOUs.
"Oh, did you, sir?"
Yes.
Oddly enough I did.
"I'm speaking as Lucerne, of course."
"Yes, of course."
Half a million dollars in IOUs.
"Oh, um, okay."
"Uh, well, you'll do."
- Flattered.
- Sorry.
"Listen, Leena, you know that 800-year-old sword"
That we were swapping out?
"Uh, well, it turns out, a piece of it has come up missing."
"So if--if--if you were standing next to Artie, right,"
"And he was looking for this thing,"
Wh--what--what would he be doing?
Artie did say that the sword was from the Edo period.
So instead of trying to track it forward
"From the past, just find it in the present."
Identify any collectors that deal in that period
And then try and find as much information as you can
On any sales or transactions of those pieces.
- Right.
Right.
Right.
"Uh, since-- since you're right there,"
"Do--do you think that, uh, maybe you could, uh..."
"Give me a minute, Pete."
"One point, Lattimer."
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello!
Hello!
"Oh, you should've kept your promises, Erik."
"The tsuba, did you find it?"
- Well--
"- Well, it wasn't easy."
"You know, it--it took some digging."
"Again, Mark, that picture makes me really uncomfortable."
"Good, go with that."
Why does it make you uncomfortable?
"Because I've never seen it before, and I don't know where you got it."
I'm sensing anger.
Let's give it a place to go.
Rip out a few sets on the muscle-maker.
No.
Break something.
Just don't break anything that's...
You know what?
Just break my nose.
"Look, Mark,"
"I can't give you what you're looking for, because the things that I'm feeling I can't put into words."
And that's the problem with people.
"We want to use words, and words are dumb."
You know how the grizzly bear processes loss?
"Yeah, I think they go to sleep for like six months, and nobody bothers them."
"The grizzly bear climbs to the top of the nearest hill, and it roars, Neal."
"Neal, this is your hill."
"Yeah, I am not going to..."
Yah!
"Oh, that feels so good."
Hoo-ah!
"My friend, you have lost your she-bear."
And I am not going to stop until I hear you roar.
Naa-ah!
Ah.
Ah.
Ow.
"Ah, oh, no."
"Uck, oh, no."
See you.
Is there anything that you want to do before you go away?
No.
I don't think so.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven."
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy kingdom come.
"Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
"Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation a but deliver us from evil."
Amen.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Beto, give me a glass of water."
I'm very tired.
"Right away, madam."
I have a surprise for you.
The house is not sold.
"No, it's not that."
But don't worry.
Here's some money.
So you and another person can live comfortably.
I want to thank you for all these years you took care of the house.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Lupe?
Can you come to the house?
Right now.
But come in through the back door because the driver is here and he might see you.
Yes.
Okay.
Hurry!
Here.
You like it?
Mm-hmm.
"You know, it's funny--"
Yo.
Yo.
"I thought you were out with Sandra, the waitress."
"Sondra, the coffee server."
"Oh, well, maybe I'd know how to pronounce her name if you'd introduce me to her."
Stop it.
"Well, that's funny that you mention that."
What are you doing tomorrow?
Uh...
"Meeting Sondra, the coffee server."
"in what, uh, two years?"
Three.
"But, um..."
"She might be someone special, so it's important for me that she meets you."
"All right, bring her by."
"Oh, by the way, Grandfather called."
Lunch is at 12:30.
Day after tomorrow.
Does the guy have to have a birthday every single year?
"Come on, Jerry, you're the one that's always talking about letting go of the past."
He did the best that he could when we were kids.
That's easy for you to say.
"You only defend him because he likes you, and he loves hearing about your work."
Grandpa likes you.
[laugh] Wow.
It's amazing.
"And ironic,if I may say, what a bad liar you are"
"Okay, so maybe he likes me a tad more."
But that's only because you remind him so much of Dad.
How's that for over?
"You let me find the body, Jenny."
- You pretended to be upset.
"- I'm sorry I lied, Bo."
But that was before I understood this thing we have between us.
But everything's different now.
I'll never be separated from the one I love.
"What did you do, Jenny?"
You can learn a lot from the Internet like how to turn ordinary fertilizer and paint into explosives.
When I push this button we'll be together forever.
- Okay.
"Okay, but if we're gonna go out with a bang I want it to be in your arms."
"Oh, I'd like that."
- Okay.
- Slowly.
How convenient.
They're together.
One-stop shopping.
Liar.
You're just like everyone else.
I didn't bring them.
Just calm down.
- Who are you?
- Our sister's dead because of you.
"And you took part, so you both pay."
Don't.
Don't.
She's got a bomb.
No.
This isn't supposed to go like this.
"Everybody, calm down."
We're gonna talk.
"Daddy gave you two songs, and this song now too."
She knows the play by heart.
- She can stand in for me.
"Alex, where the hell are you?"
Sorry!
He is always late!
It's unprofessional!
I'm leaving!
Alex!
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
We are going to solve the murder case at the castle
They're singing too slow.
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"- Goni, not now!"
"Alex, you should've done a full turn by now."
"But you're late, no wonder he is all mixed up."
I don't understand what's going on.
Are you asleep?
Can I give you a hug?
You know that I'm stressed.
The play is opening in 3 days and so many things aren't ready.
That's no excuse.
You're right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I didn't mean to bother you.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
"So are we friends again, Gonki Galonki?"
Did Gonki Galonki enjoyed the rehearsal?
"Yes, yes, yes?"
"No, no, no?"
"Yeah, my way was hard to find"
Can't sell your soul for peace of mind
I hate these plates.
"Oh, look, honey."
We got a food processor.
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
A blender.
"Took a world of trouble,"
Took a world of tears
Took a long time to get back here
"Hey, it's me."
"I, uh..."
I thought we should talk.
"Well... actually, I..."
I don't know.
Always had more dogs than bones
I could never wear those clothes
It's a dark victory
Told us you were satisfied
But it never came across
"Square one, my slate is clear"
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
It took a world of trouble
It took a world of tears
It took a long time...
I brought my computer.
I thought I'd get some work done while she's napping.
"Oh, she's a big napper."
"You'll have plenty of time, but you have to get her down by 2:00 or else..."
Or else what?
She turns into a monster?
Kinda.
But...
"I see other freelancers, they don't work this hard."
For normal freelance people that is true.
But I feel I can do more.
So why do I... have to be like other normal people?
I think your rash not going away has nothing to do with your job.
Make sure you take the bedtime pill.
I did.
"If you did, you'd be complaining about being sleepy."
Shit!
What do you think?
See!
It's okay.
It's as good as if you did it.
"Actually, Jerd is like you 5-6 years ago."
"People are saying he is Yoon 2, you know?"
So why did you ask me to come?
Wasting my time.
Adidas Japan.
I'll do it!
"Shit doc, I'm sorry."
That was automatic.
Good.
You get to work on an international brand finally.
I know you've been dying for this.
You know how hard it was to land this?
I need your best this time.
What's up with you?
Are you possessed?
"No, I was just thinking if I had anything else to do?"
"If you do, make sure to clear your schedule."
Make sure this is your first priority.
- Hey!
"- Thanks, Mater."
"Good evenin', you two."
"Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this."
- Is that what I think it is?
"- Oh, I don't know, Flo."
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out.
Hello.
Not that.
That.
Customers?
Customers?
"Customers, everybody!"
And a lot of 'em!
You know what to do.
look at this and breath and play ok?
I heard you're going?
yes
It's been decided they also want a creator right?
apparently they want a creator from here lucky foreign country
I wanna go at a new place like that
I want to reset everything reset
hey do you want to go?

to Peking
I'm kind of interested at my age it's probably my last chance for new experiences
I can help you but after you succeed with TOKIMOTO

Fujii a slogan after thinking and you can't come up with it you listen to the voices of the item
Watching?
in english a clock is called a clock but a watch is a WATCH
What loud?
Obnoxious?
Forceful. I'm Patty Chase.
- H i.
- Angela's mom?
Angela.
Rayanne talks about her all the time.
She's in love with her.
She wants to be Angela.
Really?
Gosh they seem so different.
You know kids.
They find one person and they just can't get enough of them.
Like being in love only they are not allowed to have sex.
Right.
"No, don't you remember there would be like this one person..."
"who had like perfect hair, or perfect breasts, or they were just so funny..."
and you just wanted to eat them up.
J ust live in their bed and just be them.
Like everybody else was in black and white and that person was in color.
Rayanne thinks Angela is in color.
Major color.
Thanks.
"So, how is Rayanne handling this whole incident?"
- She's great. I'm the basket case.
- Angela's just the same.
"'Who's going to shoot me with this body, Mom?"
' She says.
They think they're immortal.
And they have other things in mind.
Speaking of which Jordan is unbelievable.
Your daughter has complete taste.
"Hi, Norman."
"Oh, hi, Allison."
What's the matter?
Same old thing.
Grownups who act like children.
"Hey, could I walk home with you?"
No.
You'd get home late.
"You mean, your mother wouldn't like it."
- Well... .
"- Come on, Norman."
Come on.
Spend the afternoon in the library again?
Yeah.
Isn't it awfully dull going there every day?
Yeah.
Then why do you do it?
I like books.
Good place to do my homework.
"Besides, where else could I go but home?"
Go down to the water.
Sit in the square.
Take a walk in the woods.
I can't.
"You know, that was a nice speech you wrote for Mrs. Thornton."
I'm sorry I did it now.
Why didn't you read it yourself instead of Rodney Harrington?
Because I was afraid I'd cry.
Still might cry every time I think of Ms. Thornton not getting that job.
"You know, you just might turn out to be a great writer."
"Norman, I hope so."
"You know, every time I touch a book or read a story or even when I just open the dictionary something inside of me goes thump and my heart starts pounding, and my stomach."
Don't worry.
I'm fine now.
Going through all that without a father made me realize
That I don't need one.
I understand that I've lost the right
"To be a father to you, but..."
If there's any way that we can get to know each other...
On your terms...
"Serena may want a relationship with you,"
But I don't.
"Serena, stop it!"
You can't do that.
"The room was on loan, and I'm taking it back."
And I don't care if I did leave it in the closet.
"Borrowing without asking is stealing, Jenny."
"Dad, tell her to stop!"
"Uh, Serena, please."
I think it's great
"That you're moving back in, but this is Jenny's room now."
All her things are here.
You can stay in Chuck's old room.
No way.
That room is haunted by Chuck's depravity.
Jenny can take it.
I'm sure it wouldn't bother you.
"Okay, what-what's going on with you two?"
Nothing.
Fine.
Whatever.
Serena can have her old room back.
"All right, that's ridiculous."
"Serena, I'll have Laryssa make up Chuck's bed for you."
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet, right?"
Afghanistan?
Maybe we crossed paths.
I don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...and me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'll see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.
I got this.
All right.
Here's the plan.
"On three, you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.
Then get behind that blast wall.
- I can do that.
"- No, he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.
His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,"
I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine.
Let's go.
Salmon aren't the only creatures who should stay out of Flight Lieutenant Lundbeck's way.
"So far he's shot down 24 German planes, for which Britain gives her gratitude."
A genuine hero.
"An inspiration to all other Americans, and, as I believe you chaps say,"
- the camera loves him.
- Yeah.
Even more if he was in Technicolor.
Color?
I think we can manage that.
But there weren't any Americans at Dunkirk.
Pedant.
"Pack your bags, Mrs. Cole."
You're coming to Devon.

I'm nearly finished.
"No, you're completely finished."
"If I hear the fucking word ""kettle"" one more fucking time,"
I'm gonna find one and shove it up your arse.
- Sideways.
- Mm...
Sorry.
I think some Fuller's earth through your hair and grease.
God.
Fuller's earth?
"But I would like to make your eyebrows really unruly, you know, so that they're sticking out in different directions."
- Different directions?
"What, you--"
- And then...
"I knew Paulie was still pissed at me, and he's such a hothead."
And I was worried about Jimmy.
"See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was into drug deals with me"
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
"Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope the cops never found, then disappear until I can get things straightened out."
Karen!
Fuck!
"- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?"
- I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
That was worth $60.000!
I need that money!
That's all we got!
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to.
They were going to find it!
- They would have never found it!
"- They would have, I swear to you!"
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
- They would have found it.
"- Why did you do that, Karen?"
"Oh, my God!"
- I had to do it.
Brother.
Grandma isn't there!
These...
They're Grandpa's clothes.
But why spread them out like this?
The clock in Grandma's head is running in reverse.
"So now, she is slipping back to the time of Grandpa."
Hello!
Yes?
"Just a little while ago, your Grandma came to my place."
Then... she saw the clouds and took off in a hurry.
She was headed for Nagasaki.
Today's clouds... look exactly like they did on that day.
Maybe she remembered what happened on that day.
"No, I mean, she thinks she's reliving that day."
Grandma!
Grandma!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field

RHAPSODY IN AUGUST

Presented by Feature film Enterprise 2
"Uncle, the work has not been done."
The work has not been done?
You didn't get the plates?
- We didn't.
"- What say, Pakia...?"
You said that your information is very accurate.
"Yes, Uncle."
The plates were in Kania's godown.
The thing is...
Kania got to know about our imminent arrival much before.
We were only 2.
And they were 50.
They surrounded us from all sides.
We forgot the plates and somehow saved our lives.
"What say, Baba?"
It doesn't matter if you didn't get the plates.
I can sacrifice thousands of plates in the names of tigers like you.
I will deal with Kania later.
"How could you, Baba?"
He's lying.
- Here are the plates.
- How wonderful!
Bravo!
- l knew.
- What do you mean?
I know both of you since the past 15 years.
"And in the 15 years, it has never happened that you didn't execute an assignment successfully."
- Uncle...about me...
- l remember...
I remember.
This idiot says that you should involve him in business.
- What do you feel?
Throw down your weapons.
On the ground!
Throw down your weapons.
Silence.
"(LOLA) Let's go, there's no time to lose."
"How dare you speak to us, harpy?"
The Ministry has fallen and by your fault.
I'm helping you.
"The Ministry has it's defenses, it's own soldiers."
And I have sent the Nazis into a trap from which they can't escape.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
"And what do you think you're laughing at, ""dumbass""?"
That you think you will defeat our glorious army.
We'll see about that.
To where?
To the Ministry.
It's the only way we'll know what's going on.
These will be our shields.
I hope that the Germans are good soldiers.
"Why, so they'll kill us?"
"No, because a good army would never let their General die."
Stay with her.
"No, I'll stay."
"The more of you there, the better."
Are you sure?
Yes.
The Ministry is what matters.
Let's go.
(HITLER) Oh. (YELLING IN GERMAN)
-Pardon.
"Sorry, sorry, eh... (SPEAKING GERMAN)"
Why are you smiling?
AVON:
Tarrant!
Tarrant!
Listen...
Let's go.
- Tarrant!
Tarrant!
"- It's no use, he's cut off."
- Damn.
"- Well, that is it."
"With those ships out there, we can't wait."
They might not be looking for us.
Are you crazy?
You said yourself that was a search formation.
"They haven't picked up Tarrant, so why have they assumed a ship's out here?"
Just a minute.
"Orac, that message from Space Centre, how was it relayed here?"
Through Terminal 4006.
- The terminal on Helotrix.
"- Of course, Avon."
- That is the nearest terminal to our position.
- That's it.
They must have intercepted the transmission.
Computer logic.
The nearest terminal.
"So Orac's thick, we all know that."
Let's move!
- I'm going in under them.
- What?
We'll go down to cloud level.
"If we stay between them and the planet, we may not show up on their scanners."
Once we're below them we'll be cut off.
I will find Phillip's killer.
She won't.
She's been two steps behind me this whole time.
Behind you?
I got to Austin first.
And I got to the knife.
"And although it wasn't the actual murder weapon, thank you to my contacts at the NYPD,"
I have the address to the prop master's cousin in San Pedro who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs.
You see?
I am close.
Okay.
And may the best detective win.
Don't worry.
I will.
You realize she picked your pocket.
"Oh, yes."
Whose address is on that piece of paper?
It's a casting director my mother wanted to have a meeting with.
Hmm.
Kendall is going to be mad when she finds out.
Like I'm scared of her.
She is a master of Krav Maga.
And she is deadly with a sniper rifle from a mile and a half.
Good luck.
I could not sleep last night.
I kept having nightmares that I was sleeping with Bozo the Clown.
Please tell me you found out more.
"Okay, relax."
I spoke with Tyler's ex.
He does not have a clown fetish.
[Sighs]
[Exhales] But...
Chun-su!
"Chun-su, are you home?"
What's your business?
I didn't expect you here.
Where is Chus-su?
What do you want with a man in mourning?
Mourning?
Oh...
His old man was weak with asthma for a long time.
"Well, would you give him a message?"
He must pay his taxes without more ado.
Taxes?
Did you say taxes?
"You took a man and beat him to death, and you want to collect taxes?"
Are you accusing me of murder?
The whole village knows that he was dying of asthma!
What?
He died of asthma?
!
Say that again.
"Say that again, you bastard!"
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you and kill myself!
Chun-su!
Get out of there!
Don't aggravate a man in mourning!
Very well.
I'll go.
But he still has to pay his taxes.
If it is not receive within five days...
Get out of here this instant!
"Men, let's go."
"What's with you and God, anyway?"
"We know you love Miss Orthodox, does that mean you have to wear this costume for her?"
"Yes, but you wouldn't understand since you only love yourself."
- Witty!
- Did you find work?
"No, and please don't bug me about it."
Why don't you move back home?
"I swear to God, if you don't shut up..."
Don't take His name in vain!
Let's not waste time.
I have to open soon.
- Are we watching a movie?
- Patience.
Recognize this picture?
It's from when Morn took you to Paris.
So what?
We know the picture.
Look carefully.
See anything odd?
- Is this a quiz?
- Just play along.
Who took the picture?
"Aunt Rosa, of course."
This is from the same trip.
Aunt Rosa just had the eye surgery that she still talks about.
I don't think she went around taking pictures of you.
"Wow, Shai, James Bond has nothing on you."
She reminds me of Stevie Wonder-.
So who took this picture?
I don't remember a thing.
I was only five.
Look.
Glad to see you've started to eat again.
You've been gone a long time.
I had business to do.
Did it have anything to do with me?
Maybe.
I have a right to know.
Have you sent the ransom note to my husband?
"My dear lady, the less you know, the better it's gonna be for both of us."
Especially for you.
Don't leave.
Please.
You mean that.
Do you?
I just wanted you to know that I read the books that you brought me.
Ah.
What did you think of them?
I liked them.
What I could read of them.
It's so dark in here.
It isn't easy to read.
No problem.
I'll bring you another lamp.
Anything else you want?
Do you think I could have a television set?
Smart.
"You think you're pretty damned smart, don't you?"
What do you mean?
You think your kidnapping will be on TV and you can find out what's going on.
I'm not thinking that.
"Well, it won't do you any good."
It won't help you get out of here.
I've thought of everything.
Any responsibility I might have is to my clients.
- So there is something?
- You trying to trick me?
I can't have this conversation.
- lf there's a conversation to be had...
- Ready!
"All right, see ya, Mom."
Mm-hmm.
See ya.
"All right, Dad, let's go."
"[Jessie] lf l get something long, I couldn't dance."
"[Lily] I love this, you don't need a longer one."
- What about yours?
- l'll find it a week after the wedding.
I'm just going to go on the record right now to say I really don't like salmon.
Would you look at how beautiful your daughter is?
- Don't I know it.
- Dad hates all fish.
- That is untrue.
- [Eli] Just have pizza.
- We can have pizza for the kids.
- Are we getting paid?
- Can we pay you not to play?
- [knock on door]
"Since Eli's friends are playing, would you like to invite your friends?"
"- No, thank you."
- Somebody want to get the door?
I didn't know planning a wedding would be such a big deal.
- You'll find out soon.
- l'm not getting married till I'm 40.
- You mean when you're old?
- Sorry.
"In 1979, I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a church zone."
That fine was never paid.
"And since then, that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City."
For 16 years I pursued him only to see him give me the slip time and time again.
I've never got a clean look at his face but he's become my white whale.
"Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday."
"But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again."
I like that eye patch.
All right.
I'm gonna move my car.
My meter's up.
- You can't park in this city.
- Hey.
"George, you know that company I work for?"
They own the parking lot around the corner.
"- Oh, that's a Kinney lot?"
- Yeah.
There's a space opening and I could get it for you.
You'd just pay tax.
"It'd be, like, 50 a month."
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.
Okay.
Thanks.
"I got lunch, all right?"
Still owe me a secret.
"All right, there is something I haven't told you."
- Yeah?
- But you can't tell Jerry.
"What do you think, I tell Jerry everything?"
It's not like he's my wife.
Okay.
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
The concert was today?
You could make a little planter out of it.
I'm sorry!
I've gotta go!
"Thank you, Scuttle!"
"Any time, sweetie!"
Any time.
"Yes, hurry home, Princess."
"We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?"
Ha!
"Celebration, indeed."
"Oh, bah!"
"In my day, we had fantastical feasts,"
- when I lived in the palace.
- [Whimpers]
[Gulps]
And now look at me.
Wasted away to practically nothing.
"Banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate."
"Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough."
Flotsam!
Jetsam!
I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.
"I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady."
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
I just forgot.
As a result of your careless behavior...
Careless and reckless behavior!
"...the entire celebration was, uh..."
"Well, it was ruined!"
That's all!
"Hey, where is he?"
He took my car.
- Kono.
- I'm on it.
"Shoulder wound, through and through."
- Dana?
- The surgeons are working on her.
"Listen to me, did Dawkins say where he was going after the bank?"
"I saw a passport and now that he has his money, he's gonna disappear."
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoo!
Damn it.
"Dawkins was on his way to the airport, saw our check point and made a U-turn."
"He's in the H-3 tunnel, headed into Halawa Valley."
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh, what?"
We're about to lose traffic cam coverage in about two seconds.
He's gone.
"I'm sorry, there's no other cameras on that road."
All right.
Wait a second.
"Why, hello there, sailor."
"Cath, I need your help."
"I'm pursuing a suspect in a black Mercedes, he's headed west to the Halawa Valley."
- Can you give me a visual?
- You want me to access an IKON reconnaissance satellite for your car chase?
This guy has killed three people already today.
"Yeah, look."
This could raise some flags.
"Classify it as an NSA request from a black ops drop box, okay?"
"Come on, Cath."
I need this.
"Hold on, Mr. About-face."
"Is this the same woman you described as a chippy, a leech and a vampire?"
"All lies to save face, sir."
You don't get over a goddess.
- What else does the little Aphrodite have to say?
- Let me see.
"""Thank goodness for Gus."
"He helped me realize the error of my ways."""
Oh!
Good old Gus.
I knew I could count on him.
- Who is this Gus cuss?
- Gus Nagy... my best friend.
"A while back, he wrote me Laverne and Morty were having fights."
"So, I told him to do his best to keep the fur flying'."
- Ah.
- [Laughing]
"""And so, dear Max..."
"""I wanted to let you know before you hear it from anybody else."
"I am marrying Gus Nagy."""
I can't believe it.
I just lost my best girl and my best friend in one lousy sentence.
"Now, pull yourself together, son."
You'll bounce back.
When you get home to Toledo... you'll find a new girl and a new friend.
Toledo.
I'll be the laughingstock there.
It's like Nero Wolfe said...
"""You can't go home again."""
- [Helicopter Approaching]
- I had one shot at true happiness... and now it's killed me.
"I tell you what, Max."
tomorrow afternoon's edition.
Just in time for the congressman to make his statement... and just in time for it to stick in the minds of Americans over the weekend.
Wh...
What's the source?
Where'd they get the story?
- Unnamed sources close to the investigation.
- I see.
Al.
- Al!
- Yes?
"We can, um..."
Let's...
"Let's dot the I's, cross the T's on this one later."
"All right, thank you."
"I, uh..."
I think I have some self-righteous indignation coming my way.
"Well, is there any truth whatsoever to the story?"
- There will be an investigation.
- She's gonna have the truth on her side.
- She's gonna deny it and make us all look like fools.
- Let her.
Let her deny just that part of the story.
- Hold here.
- What?
Oh.
That's all right.
I can do that myself.
Yeah.
Thank you.
- America Live is not in the circus business.
- Pete's always fair.
Should I hear anything in this?
Addons Then came Max.
He has destroyed more than 30 sites.
Addons like to work hard with his hands.
"You do not kill Max, is not it?"
You do not kill Max.
"You kill the wrong people, stupid."
Addons you kill the wrong people.
Addons But do not worry.
One to capture the real Max.
Addons soon.
Addons And he will suffer.
"Addons Now, where are we?"
Addons Alan was very funny.
"Addons We all know this is nepolitico and, but you, Jo ..."
Addons you Inga what do you do?
Addons Enough ...
You look.
Addons - really like to see ..
- I'm drunk.
Addons I hereby apologize for anything.
You become pregnant.
Addons A pathetic excuse for your life miserable.
"But even so self-centered, to see my son die?"
Addons
- What have you done with my daughter?
- Meriþi not a girl.
Addons The only thing you should do it the waters and the panic button.
You killed my mother.
Your family and pilot and the innocent people you killed.
Addons you sweep the floor with my daughter Lucy.
Addons This is a service of destruction for the people.
Ace knows not receive anything.
Where you going?
To tell gibbs.
What do you think?
I'm glad the glass is bullet-proof.
"excuse me,uh,could I have a word?"
With you?
Workin it's related and important.
She's telling the truth.
God put the body there?
No.
Someone who was playing god.
She didn't bury him.
Your gut telling you this?
"I've been watching her.She feels guilt, empathy,remorse."
That doesn't fit the psychological profile.
"She's deceitful,conniving,an adulterous, which does."
I'm trying to give you my professional opinion.
Then tell me after I have finished interrogating the suspect.
"Timothy,do you have a moment?"
"Uh,actually,I'm watching jody carvell's husband."
"Yes,I know--"
I want to have a word with M.
Sure.
And for you to tape it with that new cell phone yours.
Tape you?
"No,no,no,no.Not me.Him."
"Surreptitiously,of course."
Of course.
"-Here you go,Mr. Carvell."
-Thank you.
"Uh,this is our medical examiner,Dr. Mallard."
"Uh,call me ducky."
"That's good, ese."
Got a little favor to ask you.
All right?
Simón.
"You know that dude, El Chucko?"
"I want you to handle that for us, all right?"
"I'll take care of it, ese."
"Was I talking to you, ese?"
Santana?
Let me do it.
"Mi carnalito, that's not his thing."
"He's not no punk or nothing, but..."
He's not talking to you.
"There's something I want you to understand, Little Puppet."
"What happened to Pie Face, I didn't like it, but it was necessary."
Especially right now.
"Take a look over there, ese."
"El Chucko and La Nuestra Familia's making their play to get respect, ese."
La eme took a long time earning their respect in this place.
"And if we want to keep it, we gotta show some class."
SANTANA:
"Now I know Pie Face wasn't weak, ese."
"And you know he wasn't weak, either."
But how about other people?
"How about El Chucko, what'd he think, ese?"
'Cause that's what it's about.
It's not just about being weak that we can't accept.
It's about other people even beginning to think we're showing weakness.
"It's up to you, you know?"
(ALL cheering)
(MUSIC PLAYING ON SCREEN)
(WOODY WOODPECKER LAUGHING)
"Today, Supreme Allied headquarters reported American combat troops and aircraft have completely routed the attacking German army at the Ardennes front."
"American troops have discovered the frozen corpses of over 70 fellow GIs, taken prisoner then fiendishly executed by their German captors."
Investigating officers at the nightmarish scene say the massacre happened at a small crossroads near the Belgian town of Malmedy.
"General Eisenhower has vowed that upon war's end, all German officers and soldiers responsible for this unspeakable act will be vigorously tried for war crimes and swiftly punished."
"This is Armed Forces Radio, London."
"Ah, cigarettes."
What is this?
My wife.
You speak German?
Hmm.
Please...
Here.
Thanks.
Halt!
Halt!
Out!
Out!
Now!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I surrender!
"Get down, get down low."
Hello!
Is anyone home?
Come in.
It's cold in here.
Light the stove.
Ach!
It's foul.
Not like mom's house.
"Yeah, a little louder."
I do not ...
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn him.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted Proctor to suffer the most.
[Rossi] Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim, it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to Tony Torrell's wife.
- [Door closes] - [Prentiss] How you doing?
"Uh, I'm fine."
"Uh, I'm here to see Agent Rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
I'm Agent Prentiss.
"Oh, I'm Kiersten Torrell."
Uh...
My husband Tony was killed last night.
"I know, and I'm very sorry."
May I sit down?
"Oh, yeah."
Are...
Are you working on his case?
"Yes, I am."
Is there a picture of him in your folder?
I want to see him.
"Kiersten, uh, your husband was very badly burned."
I don't think that's a good idea.
"What do you mean, he was burnt?"
The person who did this uses fire as a weapon.
Was Tony set on fire alive?
- We don't know that.
"- Oh, my God."
My barefoot Cinderella.
Jesse!
Don't need no slippers or a party dress.
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best.
"Singers, actors, just once a kid that wants to be a doctor."
-Hi.
-Hey.
Listen I've been thinking.
Being with you.
It's a real headache.
"And it's hard, it's complicated."
"I mean, it's a lot of work."
I'm starting to think the song outside my door.
Was a little bit misleading.
I'm not finished.
Being with you might be all those things.
But the only thing worse is not being with you.
Did that get to you like it got to me?
"Yeah, a little."
Guys with guitars.
Why do the ladies find us so dang irresistible?
Are you sure you're ready for all this?
I was ready for all this the first time I met you.
I just didn't know it.
Now come on I think I owe you pizza and a movie.
-I mean if you're hungry.
-Are you kidding?
Right now I'm torn between kissing you.
And checking the bottom of your shoe to see if you stepped in a donut.
Let me just ditch Hannah.
What about your omelet?
Sorry dad.
- I don't think I can.
"- Yes, you could."
Kiss me.
I don't know why I should act so experienced.
It was only my second kiss this year.
"It wasn't as good as Rodney's, was it?"
No.
"Hello, I guess I should've phoned but I was in the neighborhood..."
- That's all right.
I have a message for Allison.
Is she home?
"No, she and Selena have just gone over to Kathy Ellsworth's house."
That gives me a good excuse to talk to you.
- May I come in?
"- Oh, of course."
- You have a lovely house.
- Thank you.
Please come in.
This is a very comfortable room.
"Good books, pictures."
My own hotel room is a bit basic.
"I have a mirror for shaving, a basin for washing and a closet to hang my coat."
You ought to find a house.
I'm trying to.
"In the meantime, I have my hotel room, which I clear out of right after dinner."
You said you had something you wanted to tell me.
"I was telling you something, but you weren't listening."
Your husband?
He died when Allison was 2.
And Allison.
- A few years ago.
- She's grown a bit since then.
"Lower it very gently, lower it."
(Boards creaking)
Very nice.
Tie it off.
Tie it off.
"My God, that was heavy."
Good work.
I don't understand it.
"It took nine of us to lift it, we've taken two of the three coffin lids off, yet the whole thing still weighs a ton."
- Mummy must be made of lead.
- HOWARD:
Here's your answer.
The first two coffins were made of wood covered in gold foil.
The third coffin isn't wood.
It's solid gold.
And they said this might not be a royal tomb.
There is one thing that's bothering me.
Look at Harry's photographs.
The physiognomy of the second coffin is completely different from the other two.
Mace always said these shrines were botched up.
I think this one was made for someone else.
I think they buried our friend in a hurry.
"And I think it's time we had a look, don't you?"
HOWARD:
Ready?
Lift.
(Grunting)
"Pecky, tell me when you have it."
PECKY:
I'll take it now.
"Behind me, behind me, go behind me."
Behind me.
"Look, we know that she and the guy"
"Were getting real serious, right?"
"Well, maybe she got jealous about something."
[Mutters with mouth full]
Maybe she had somebody jumping.
Mm-mm.
No.
I don't think she's involved.
RICHARD:
Why not?
"She has a pretty face, sweet smile."
"Look, I don't pretend to know the answers."
I'm just trying to figure out the problem.
I'll tell you one thing though...
I want to know everything there
Is to know about that dog.
[Faint radio chatter]
"Now, tell me how you're doing."
I don't know.
Rotten.
Confused.
There's a whole nightmare going on all around me.
I'm starting to see a doctor.
One of those that Mother went to.
"Is that a good idea, uh, all the memories and all?"
Guess I trust him.
One of the few I really trusted.
OTIS:
I wish we could have some good news for you.
We don't have much of it yet.
Seems like with that boy we're just... any little thing
Will be of help.
"They kill the celebrities first, and then they fuck 'em in the butt."
"Will you just relax, please?"
There are cops always in this club.
They're probably just arranging an engagement party or something.
-Just hold on a tick.
- Yeah.
[Stereo] Toe to toe
Dancing very close
"-Body breathing - [Gig] Goodevening, Officers."
- What can I do for you?
- Are you the owner?
"Yes, I am."
Gig.
"Gig, do you know a guy by the name of Jerry Green?"
He apparently is known to come in here.
"Yeah, Jerry the bookie."
Comes in here all the time.
"Has he been in here lately, because, I mean, nobody's seen this guy around for a while."
"Ah... about a week ago, I think."
Huh.
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spine less movement
- And a wild attack
- You wanna get back to this?
- Maybe ask another question or two?
"- Yeah, yeah."
Where... do you find girls like that?
"I mean, who'd do that kind of stuff?"
"Well, you know, it's remarkably easy."
You'd be surprised.
"These two, I believe, we imported from upstate New York."
"Heather, there is a doctor here to see you guys."
I cannot believe you're calling in outside help when I'm right here.
"♪ I like the way you do it, honey ♪"
♪ Especially when we do that... ♪
Oh.
"Oh, I get it, yeah."
Okay.

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Matt, Chad..."
"- Mm-hmm, yeah."
my three boyfriends before that.
None of them had steady jobs.
And all of them were these dreamers addicted to romance.
"- Yeah, you really do only date your father."
- Yeah.
You guys only got me for another 18 minutes.
You want me to dance or anything?
- Um...
- Can you unload the dishwasher?
(sighs)
"Anyway, I've done some soul-searching, and I think I've finally figured it out."
- I haven't told anybody this...
- HEATHER:
I think that sounds like a natural stopping point right there.
So great to catch up with you.
Proof?
"Hell yes, proof!"
I'm not the kind to talk shit without backing it up.
Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was- stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.
A grown man?
I'm telling you.
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.
Bladder control problems are surprisingly common in adults.
But why go into the woods to treat incontinence?
- Inconfinencen.
- Am I talking to myself here?
"Anyway, he had his face buried in the carcass, his body covered in blood... his eyes all bloodshot."
"Then he looked up, and all of a sudden..."
I haven't slept since that day.
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...
- (Stephen) Yeah.
- So he predicted Jerry Lee Lewis's career.
(laughter and applause)
- (Alan) He foresaw it in a prose poem.
- (Stephen) He foresaw it in a poem.
"Called ""Great Balls of Fire"", or, ""Goodness Gracious""."
"- Stick to ""Great Balls of Fire""."
That's what...
- A meteor.
- His theory...
- (Alan) Cigarettes.
- What's the theory?
The theory?
- (Julia) Relativity.
- The big bang.
- (Stephen) The big bang.
Thank you.
- I'll give you a point.
Well done.
- (applause)
Edgar Allan Poe believed that all matter had once been concentrated into a single particle which then expanded to fill space - a theory not accepted by science until 1931.
"""Eureka"", his prose poem, goes on to predict the general theory of relativity, parallel universes, and the structure of the atom."
Pretty good going for a poem that doesn't even rhyme.
You know the word rhyme?
There's no word that actually rhymes with the word rhyme.
- (Alan) Lime.
- (Julia) Time.
Apart from those two.
- Slime.
- Three.
- Grime.
- (Rich) Orange.

Come on...
"-But she looks so, so..."
-Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
A few days care and she'll be out of it.
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And, Connie, just because it happened in your house... don't think that any of it was your fault."
-Somehow I do.
-You've got one thing to think of:
Allison.
"If you were going to get married, why didn't you tell me?"
-Because you wouldn't have approved.
-You never gave me a chance.
"At least, it would've been a proper marriage... not a cheap sneak-off weekend affair."
-Don't say that!
"-Well, what was it?"
-I'd like to talk to you alone.
-You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
-I'll wait outside.
"-Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
"Look, dad, I don't want any trouble between us."
"I was in love with Betty and I wanted to marry her, that's all."
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
"Good-bye, dad."
-Don't bring her to the house.
-Then I won't be there either.
"Rodney, what about college?"
I'm not going.
I have a wife to support.
And?
"Anselmo said, ""No subway stop no BankExchange."""
- And you said?
I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner but we need BankExchange.
We need jobs.
We need that money going into the community.
Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy it's politically expedient.
The hell with politically expedient.
"I'm talking about a 60-story building that will employ 3,000 people."
It'll put food on the table.
That's what counts.
That's what we're about.
That's BankExchange.
That's all it is.
You said we can't afford a subway stop.
That'll take politics.
More than one way to skin a cat.
Get in there.
Keep that staff fired up.
You're the boss.
What are you doing tonight?
Hadn't thought about it.
You ever see Carousel?
The musical?
You serious?
A little before my time.
You'll love it.
Frank Anselmo will be there.
I'm free.
George Frank Anselmo's in there.
Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.
- Yeah.
So...
"I mean, what do you think?"
"You think it's a myth, Nathaniel?"
What's your explanation?
"Is it hard being alone, Mom, so much in your life?"
Yes.
I always wondered why you didn't find someone else to share your life with you.
"Well, I'm kind of a romantic fatalist."
"Somebody comes along, you know, and I'm kind of a loner too."
- Nathaniel?
- Yeah.
Come in.
- What?
- Lightning.
I know.
I'll come in.
Do you miss him still?
Sometimes.
"But not a great, great deal."
You don't think about him as much as you used to?
No.
Is that shocking?
"Before taking off for India and Bangladesh,"
I finally went back into Lou's old office.
"As it turns out, one of the men who used to work for him has the place now."
It was exciting times.
"I must say, it was exciting being here."
I was...
I can't say there were ever times when I was...
I never quit because of anger.
I never quit because of frustration.
"As long as you practice hard, a year later"
You'll be another Jin Tianyun
"Brother Jin, you're not recovered yet"
Those gangs are still looking for you
As long as they didn't find my body
They will not give up
Sooner or later they will be here
"I know, you're afraid of involving me"
"Brother Jin, we're good brothers"
"We should share everything, be it joy or sorrow"
"Jian, nothing will last forever"
I'll come to see you a year later
"Okay, Brother Jin, by that time"
I'll take good care of you
You mean the rice of original taste?
"Daixiong, give it a try!"
-Me!
"-Y es, master"
Master!
Got it!
"Okay, okay!"
"Ying Chang, it's your turn!"
Me?
No way!
"3rd Brother, if you don't want to learn from dad"
You can leave here!
I didn't mean that!
Then go practice!
Alright!
"Master, which stance?"
As you wish
Whatever!
"Oh, no."
"I'm... too sleepy, I guess."
You ask Joe.
"Joe is probably hungry, though."
"Joe, you talk with Mother and dads."
They can help anybody.
"You see, mother and dads, Joe isn't very well."
Sometimes he doesn't realize what he's saying.
"But it's all right, Joe."
You can talk with mother and dads.
They're wonderful.
"You've probably never had anyone like them, because you wouldn't have had all the trouble you've had."
"Every now and then, Joe thinks he has a son like me."
He even calls me Joey.
It was funny.
"I wasn't afraid of him,"
But...
He's a good scout.
He's ok.
Good night.
"Can I get you something to eat, Joe?"
Thank you for bringing him back.
"With all my heart, I thank you."
"You are proud of him, aren't you?"
"He is the kind of a boy you really hoped for, isn't he?"
"Isn't he, Joe?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that.
"He ain't the kind of kid I'd put my money on, exactly."
"You got him conned into one way of thinking, so what the heck?"
"Let him stay that way, for all I give a darn."
"He didn't swallow what I told him, anyway."
- You don't know that?
"- Oh, my God."
- I don't think so.
- You tell the story.
"It was just someone driving by and went, ""Denzel."""
"A car full, of..."
"No, there were like six people."
"They were like, ""Denzel."""
And they were drunk.
This was probably a Friday.
I remember a lot of people getting out of bars this night.
"Friday night, 7th Street, Avenue A."
"- Yeah, at like 1 a.m."
- We're in the middle of the action.
- Did you happen to think...?
- Hello.
Not a real punch.
"Oh, I was so terrified I would hit you by accident."
"There was a take where you were supposed to, but you didn't."
Pete asked me to slap you and I couldn't do it.
- I started to cry a little bit.
- I saw you two having that discussion.
I was like:
"""She's gonna hit me."
"I'm ready for it."""
It's gonna be cool.
It'll be a good reaction.
That was the only time I started to cry a little because I felt like...
- You actually started crying?
- I was hiding it.
- At the thought of hitting me?
- Just the thought of hitting Michael without him knowing.
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?
No.
"You're like me, then."
Floundering in wet shit.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?
(GRUNTS)
(GUNSHOT)

"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
He is a murder
He has been punish
He just payed for his doing's
Father forgive brother please
Come father
The punishment I already got for my misdeed's
Please let the enemy between both family's end.
My enemy has to be dead
Did you understand
Don't spare him Kill him
Can change any colour but black will always remain black
Rughnath he is out of my reach.
And away from my life.
Shiv listen to me I only have 1 son.
And you go away'
In this village there is no place for you.
He is taking a left.
Where are you going?
Go straight!
We have almost reached the hospital.
"Okay, go."
Idiots!
Take a left.
- Shut up.
We are caught up in some issue.
I'll call you again.
Hang up.
"Is your phone in within the network range, Vikram?"
Not sure.
I'll have to check.
"After Vikram withdraws money from the bank, take the Perundurai route."
"After reaching the outskirts,"
Take off of the highway and drive the car into a deserted area.
I'll scream and pretend to be panicking.
Vikram will get tensed.
"Hit him then, and push him off the car."
We leave with the money like it is a kidnap drama.
We both will escape.
Driver.
Where are you going?
- What happened?
Not sure.
He is taking the wrong route.
Where are you going?
Go back to the main road.
I'm telling you to turn back!
Why are you taking the wrong route?
Not this hospital.
Here.
"-Rodney, I'm going to cry."
"-No, and don't say anything silly."
"Betty, you know how glad I am that I married you?"
"Oh, Rodney, I hope so!"
Your dad is over there.
Go say good-bye to him.
"Go on, go say good-bye to him."
He loves you as much as I do.
Go on.
Take care of yourself.
"And, whatever you do, do it honorably."
That's the family motto.
"Say, do me a favor, dad."
"Certainly, son."
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
"She won't ask you, but she might need it."
-I'll keep an eye on her.
-The draftees assemble over here.
Come right in close.
"Now... as chairman of the Draft Board, let me say that all of us regret... having to send any of you men off to war."
"You carry our love, our devotion and our undying gratitude."
"Please, try to come back safely to your homes."
We've prepared some gift packages.
"Step up here, I'll hand them out."
"Peyton Place draftees, in the bus, on the double."
Let's go.
"Hubba, hubba, hubba!"
"Come on, boys, hurry it up."
Make the good-byes short.
"Name, loud and strong."
Last name.
That's the logical choice for a Master.
But only nearby.
idiot.
It is the sixth day since the war commenced.
You are the first to make their way here.
boy?
O-Of course I am!
You want me to die?
!
and I'm no longer a Master!
I-I'm just an ordinary human.
I'm just a victim in all this!
when we can't do anything!
What?
Do you have a problem with that?
Of course not.
You are the first to withdraw from this war and to use this church's services since it was founded.
I will offer you every hospitality.
What?
You're saying I'm the only one that's been knocked out?
what will he say?
This is all you people's fault!
Rider!
Oh?
Then Rider was of no use to you?
Damn right!
she went and died like a dog!
Any other Servant would have been way more useful!
I did exactly as Grandfather said!
My preparations were perfect!
But those bastards all got in my way!
It was two against one!
!
"No, Yoon Jae's home to get some clothes."
"Honey, Son-in-law seems different, doesn't he?"
"He doesn't seem to mind his manners, and he doesn't think too well of us."
He treats Da Ran with no care.
Right?
"You felt that too, right?"
Yes!
"Even so, I like him even more!"
I think he's comfortable with our family now!
"Now, he seems to be our son-in-law so I'm really happy!"
"Well, if it's because he's comfortable, it's a good thing."
Got it.
Come in faster.
Yoon Jae lives alone too?
His parents live overseas.
Don't just touch his stuff!
We have to hurry up and pack some clothes.
Oh!
I told you not to touch anything!
Come here.
This is where the clothes are.
Pick out some outfits to wear.
"Ah, you surprised me!"
What should I do when you take off your clothes like that?
"It's something you see all the time, so why are you so surprised?"
Change your clothes quickly.
It's something you always see.
Why are you just sneeking a peek?
Just look at it.
I've never seen it.
Why's she acting like that?
"- Darling, please don't go."
You don't want a man for a husband.
You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger.
"That's not me, and never will be."
"I don't care how much I love you, and I do, very much..."
I'm a soldier...
"I mean, I'm a man first."
"All right, MacCheesecake, get that silly smirk off your face."
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Surely Mother Kali is kind.
"One Englishman fly walks in, and now our web is baited."
More will follow.
Two more have crossed the bridge.
It is well.
Prepare.
You said this place was full of priests.
- Sahib do not give Din chance to say.
"- You've got a mouth, haven't you?"
Quiet.
It's Kali.
A Thug temple.
Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs?
I've a good mind to split you in two and stuff you up an elephant's trunk.
MacChesney roar so loud... poor bhisti cannot get a word sideways between roarings.
Enough of that.
We're here to find Cutter.
We should have brought every man in the regiment.
"I only wish you had, sahib."
"Hello, Din."
"Fine work, bugler."
I knew you'd do it.
"Uh, yeah, well, I'm dressed."
"Oh, good."
Let's get this show on the road.
Okay.
[men singing on TV continues]
"Good night, Billy, I hate you."
- I hate you too.
- I hate you three.
Have a terrible time.
[men singing on TV continues]
"Good night, Billy."
[men yip and holler on TV]
"Good night, Mike."
[bell ringing on TV]
"[Taterbug] Come on, will you, start this resignation."
"[Jim] No, no use, Taterbug, that kid's got to get his schooling, that's all there is to it."
[Taterbug] We could find a place in Dusty Bend.
"That's the town near the Circle J Ranch, where we'd be workin'."
"Listen here, old partner--"
"But not tied down like a couple of old women, cooped up"
"- in an office, and for what?"
- [babysitter sighs]
"For an ornery, no-account brat of a kid."
Would you like some chocolate?
Sure.
Thanks.
"[Jim] That's just what he is, an ornery, no good, interfering brat."
"[Taterbug] Hey, look here, you got no right to be talking"
- about Buddy like that.
- [Jim] Haven't I?
"[Jim] Say, listen, I'll put him in an orphan's home."
"That's what I'll do, that's just where he belongs."
"Ted, look at this."
I can pull all these video stills up.
"Come on, we have enough here to build a case."
Do you want to tell me what's going on?
What happened that night?
"Okay, I needed him."
I needed someone and he wouldn't even talk to me.
"I understand, all right?"
You felt abandoned.
No one was there for you.
"No one was there to listen, not even Aldo."
Like I didn't even exist.
"Look, just tell me... what happened that night, okay?"
"I can help you, no matter what you did."
(sniffs)
I didn't kill Aldo.
I did something worse.
What's worse than killing?
I went looking for him in Bellevue.
He started to go there to buy his drugs.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.
"Then, as I'm watching him, someone pulls up."
The driver gets out and jumps Aldo.
Who was it?
I don't know.
"Come on, Ted, look at me."
You have to remember who this was.
It could save you.
"Whatever happens, I deserve."
Because I froze.
I didn't help him.
"Aldo got taken and I just let it happen, like-like I wasn't even there."
Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was-stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.
A grown man?
I'm telling you.
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.
Bladder control problems are surprisingly common in adults.
But why go into the woods to treat incontinence?
- Incontinence...
- Am I talking to myself here?
"Anyway, he had his face buried in the carcass, his body covered in blood... his eyes all bloodshot."
"Then he looked up, and all of a sudden..."
I haven't slept since that day.
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
"You do that a lot with your passengers, do you?"
No.
But I've driven Kelly home before.
So you are on first-name terms?
She booked the cab in her name.
You see anything suspicious?
Anyone outside her flat?
Nah.
Not that I recall.
You went straight to your next pick-up?
"Yeah, in Bermondsey."
Is she all right?
Kelly Mahon is dead.
You're joking?
No.
OK.
We might need to speak to you again.
What do you reckon?
Should get Ange to run some background on him just in case.
I reckon we should go and speak to Kelly Mahon's fiance.
I was working late and...
crashing in the office.
"You do that often, sleep at work?"
No.
We just got this big client.
I was under pressure to get their accounts finished.
That's where Kelly and I met.
My firm do the accounts for the lab.
Kelly didn't mind you staying out all night?
She would have ended up crashing at Chloe's talking flowers.
Someone can verify you staying at your work?
I dunno.
You got anything?
Who knew so many people travelled through Colombia?
Wait.
Who was that?
Back it up.
"That is Alberto Velez, 52 years old, born in Santo Domingo."
Who is that?
"Abby, get rid of his beard."
Lighten his hair.
Clean him up.
I get it.
I totally know where you're headed.
Cross-reference him with the terminal crowd.
Got him.
"I'm gonna have to ask you folks to clear this area here, please."
Thank you.
Excuse me.
"Lana, is it?"
I'm afraid you can't let anyone off that plane.
They've been circling for hours.
I only take orders from TSA.
"Tell her, Ellie."
What's this all about?
Have you found a gun yet?
"No, but we're not done screening."
"Well, unless you want an assassination on your hands, you're gonna move that plane to another gate."
"This is the only gate that's cleared, and the plane's already de-boarding."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, yes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now pleased to announce the arrival of flight 3182 from London, now deplaning at gate 212."
"Esto es para ti, Gomez!"
Esto es para ti!
I do not like the sound of defeat.
You want to know where I'd be if I'd given up on my dreams?
"Living right down the road managing a Dress Barn, driving 400 miles in a ball gown to sing karaoke."
"I would not be the supermodel of the world that I am today, okay?"
Hello.
"Hey, listen."
I'm driving to Texas if y'all want a ride.
"Well, shall we sashay away?"
You know that's copyrighted.
"Say it again, and you owe me $12,000."
- Aah!
- Ah!
Shotgun!
I'm sitting next to RuPaul!
No.
I'm sitting next to RuPaul.
Transcribed by Uncle Andy
My marriage was a sham.
"I'm with Interpol, Serious Financial Crime Agency."
Your husband had the copy made for some oligarch to put on his yacht.
I see it in you now.
That look.
What look?
Revenge!
They were laundering money on a massive scale.
"You know, you learn so much more about people after they're dead."
I found him.
I found John Brandeis.
Choosing a blind man?
That is the Constantine Clios touch.
A blind art dealer?
"Yeah, really."
"You've been dropping a lot of cash lately, McGee."
"New phone, new watch, new teeth."
What's up?
GIBBS:
Ducky matched the dental records.
The body downstairs is Lance Corporal Finn.
"Ziva, when did you...?"
McGee  how long does it take to put on a clean shirt?
Ten seconds.
"With buttons, a little longer."
Rhetorical question.
Contractor's off the hook.
He's been out of town for a week.
Going to check on the real estate agents this morning.
That's all you did?
No.
"While you and McGee were watching the sunrise,"
I was pulling Lance Corporal Finn's SRB.
And I would have to say it was spotty.
He was Unc' on the range and failed his swim qual.
So they made him a supply clerk.
Right.
"Six months ago, he signed out on a three-day pass before deploying to Iraq and never returned home."
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in Iraq.
I'll contact MTAC.
"I put in a request for Finn's bank records, earning statements and medical records."
TONY:
Night wasn't a total loss.
ground radar picked up a shovel about ten feet from the gravesite.
Already sent it to Abby.
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
What did your father say?
"Nothing, what could he say?"
Is he dead?
"Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
Doesn't he come to see you?
No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Me?
None.
What's your problem?
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
No.
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
It wasn't that special.
It was.
Very special.
I need a sergeant by dawn.
"I'll never make a proper sergeant, sir."
So?
I'll never make a proper officer.
"Indeed you will, sir."
You'll make a grand... killing officer
Killing officer?
"God love you, sir."
I thought you would have known.
"There are two kinds of officers, sir."
Killing officers and murdering officers.
Killing officers are poor old buggers who get you killed by mistake.
"Murdering officers are mad, bad old buggers who get you killed on purpose."
"For a reason, for a country, for a religion."
Maybe even for a flag.
"You see that Major Hogan, sir?"
That's what I'd call a murdering officer
Teresa!
"Oh, that Hogan."
He's a murdering officer all right
"Damn it, Hogan!"
I wish I were down there.
So do I.
So do I. But our first duty is to protect Mrs Parker.
"That's my girl, Teresa."
Mmmm!
"Rica, huh?"
Tengo otra muy buena para ti.
Jesus!
No!
"Mr Sharpe, sir."
Lieutenant Sharpe.
And may you find all well when you come back.
"- Say thy prayers, go to bed before dusk, and no harm will come to thee."
"Ah, my poor Faith."
What a wretch am I to leave her.
- You are Goodman Brown.
Forget your past and become him entirely with every inch of your being.
Go.
Go.
"- Dearest heart, pray thee put off your journey till sunrise and sleep in your own bed tonight."
"- My love and Faith, of all nights in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee."
Bravo.
You're ready.
"Only three weeks in, and you're already a better Brown than Lucy ever was."
This will be greatest performance they've ever seen.
- Performance?
I don't understand.
"- Forgive me, Goodman."
"A momentary flight of fancy, nothing more."
Come.
You've been working all day in the field.
You deserve some rest.
"- Oh, God."
"""Mr. and Mrs. Baxter,"
"""you're invited..."
"""9:00 at Rosewood."
"Aconite Society."""
"Come, my dear."
Are you ready to see?
"I've got a surprise for you, my love, something really exquisite."
"Feast, my dear, feast."
Fe...
Roderick.
"-Oh, shut up!"
"You know, in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was."
They'll see.
They'll see.
I'm still Andy's favourite toy.
I was on top of the world livin' high
It was right in my pocket
I was livin' the life
Things were just the way they should be
When from out of the sky like a bomb
Comes some little punk in a rocket
Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
Strange
Things are happening to me
Strange
Things
Strange things are happening to me
Ain't no doubt about it
I had friends I had lots of friends
Now all my friends are gone
And I'm doin' the best I can
To carry on
-I had power
-Power
-I was respected
-Respected
But not any more
And I've lost the love of the one
Whom I adore
Let me tell you 'bout it Strange
Things are happenin' to me
"Yes, we can."
Tell me about your children.
"My girl, Mariana, she's six."
She loves racing cars.
Anything to do with speed.
"And Lucas, he..."
He has dark masses of curly hair and his eyes are... like two bright shining stars.
Sorry.
So Karp packed up his Mexican operation?
We don't know where he is now.
He was moving lots of stuff.
"Supplies, heavy duty equipment."
"Crazy stunt, but no infection."
You are all good.
"Thanks, Doc."
"When I was at Karp's compound,"
I saw something being hauled in on a giant flatbed.
"It was long, metallic, cylindrical, like a submarine."
It was massive.
A missile?
Yes.
Full report on my desk by morning.
I want my dad released.
You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain.
"However, I will allow continued access to your father."
He's been surprisingly cooperative since you two have been talking.
Dad?
You don't look so good.
What's happened?
I didn't think I'd see you again.
Finnerman keeps us guessing.
She came to see me.
tomorrow?
"No, it's today!"
Better call the station.
"Wait, stop!"
How will we explain this situation?
"If they find out about us, you may have to quit."
Word will spread quickly.
So only I suffer?
I guess your post is safe.
"It'll be bad for me, too."
But your wife's the daughter of the deputy director.
"You may have to get a divorce, too."
Fine.
Then you leave first.
I'll report this after you leave.
Look!
Someone was killed!
"Silly, she was just on her period."
So dark.
Apparently it was a murder.
Where?
The hotel next door.
It's a mess with police and ambulances.
Our customers can't come and go with all that tape.
"Suzuki San, could you man the front desk?"
Sure.
"Hey, you can't go in, stay back!"
"Okay, okay."
Looks awful.
Who was killed?
That streetwalker.
"A price dispute with a customer... led to the killing, apparently."
- and to the left?
- Uh-huh.
- Go see if Dad's found his bathing suit yet.
- Gimme a hug.
Yeah.
"Thanks, champ."
"- They are paid to teach, not..."
- To preach.
"I know, but he's six years old, and he also believes in the tooth fairy..."
- and that George Washington never told a lie.
"- Well, it drives me crazy."
"- Mary, wanna turn the ball machine off?"
"- Yes, Mr. Governor."
"Thanks for seeing me, Dad."
- Why wouldn't I see you?
- Partisanship.
I gotta love at least one Democrat.
"You know, Dad, I'm getting some reports that you might not be ready to back me."
That you're opposed to my confirmation...
- You've heard quotes?
"- No, I haven't heard."
Just that we should expect to be reading of your opposition.
"Pardon my Swahili, but you're being led a line of pure bullshit."
- I haven't said a word.
- Maybe it's just that.
Maybe you've been quiet.
- I hate the press.
"- I know, Dad."
"- When I left the mansion, I swore I would never talk to them."
- I remember.
"- I suppose you're gonna force my hand on this, huh?"
- You wouldn't have to say much.
"Daddy, we've found it."
"God, hope you would bless Yu-fa and Nim-sai, make them live happily in heaven, thank God!"
"Sir, beware of catching cold, let us handle it."
"Chung, open the coffin and check the body."
How is the body?
We still can see his face.
Turn the body upside down and remove his trousers.
What did you see?
His ass.
Anything on his ass?
A triangular stain.
It's birthmark.
"Right, he is your brother Nim-sai."
"Actually, Nim-sai was sold to Canton by you for over 20 years."
"If he is still alive, can you recognise him?"
"You know, when one is happy, his has one look."
"And when he is sad, he has another look."
I can't guarantee the change of his look.
Do you remember anything special about Nim-sai?
He has had a very beautiful jade round his neck.
"There is a little door on it, behind the door, the name ""Sai"" of Sir Ho Sai is carved on it."
"Master, what are you doing?"
Wait.
"Master, what are you doing here?"
Wait.
Master.
You are lucky!
What's the matter?
Are you willing to kiss Lotus?
"Master, are you kidding me?"
Will I be that lucky?
It's true!
He's making his way north.
He'll surface.
Aubrey.
"Hey, so I was able to filter out most of the visual noise from the doorbell video."
Did you find the vehicle that was following Aldo?
"Yeah, I'll send you a link."
It's a '97 Intrepid.
Did you get a plate number?
"I couldn't from this angle, so I went through all the traffic cams in the area."
The car belongs to Ted McKinney.
He's former military.
He actually served in Booth's unit.
Booth's not gonna like this.
"Me either, Cher."
That is not something I wanted to see.
"If you think I killed Aldo, you're nuts."
I don't know what to think.
Why were you following him?
That's my business.
"Well, you're in here, so it becomes my business now."
You really think Booth's the guy for this?
They have a history.
I can't think of anyone better.
BOOTH:
Recognize that car?
It might be mine.
It might be yours.
"Oh, I think it's yours, 'cause that is you inside of the car."
Following Aldo.
That's not true.
"""That's not true?"""
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
We can come and visit as much as we want to.
But I want to stay here.
Everything is so good here now.
I don't want to live there.
You don't like people there.
You said so yourself.
"Yes, but you..."
But then we won't see each other.
You can come and visit.
- You want to go out and play?
- Yes.
Then go.

"Previously on ""What about Brian"""
He still won't tell me who he did it with.
I'm just gonna miss... seeing you.
Mostly what I feel is just afraid--
Afraid that I'm gonna hurt it or be the wrong sort of mother.
You are gonna be a great mother.
You're my best friend.
"You always have been, and you know the rules--"
"Never let a girl come between us, right?"
I know about you and Marjorie.
You think I wanted to fall in love with her?
You think I wanted to kiss her?
It just happened.
You guys shouldn't get married.
You can't marry Adam because I want you to marry me.
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.
Yeah.
"I mean, totally."
What we are working on now is the most personal survival horror game in history.
Cool.
One that works out how to scare you by using your own mind.
Whoa.
That...
That sounds crazy.
Can't wait!
I'm uploading a neural net package.
"Neural net packing, neural net."
Hmm.
"Name could use a little work, I think."
It's all 90s.
"I'm just kidding, it's a good name."
It's state of the art intelligence software.
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity and try and work out how best to frighten you and then adjust to your experience accordingly.
- Whoa!
- Are you ready?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Beam me up.
"Here we go, lock and load."
- Eyes closed.
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.
It's uploading.
"Five, four, three, two, one."
How are you feeling?
Um...
Give him a piece of this.
Hmmm...
Hurry!
Dad!
Can I come in?
"Don't be mad at me, Dad!"
"Aw, you know I don't hold a grudge!"
I'm coming to open it.
Have a taste!
Can't we go a bit faster?
I'm sorry but this isn't an airplane.
"We're going all right, by the way."
"A department store on the left, a photoshop and a drugstore on the right."
Heading towards the square.
"A roundabout on the square, in a clockwise direction."
Compulsory yield of way.
"Hotel Lion to the right, the city museum in the front."
"You're trudging so slowly, as if you weren't aware of the fire!"
"Meanwhile, the house is burning down!"
Faster!
That way!
Everything fits.
"A dairy to the left, a watchmaker to the right."
Everything's reversed here!
Are you sure we didn't come in through the other gate?
What's this?
What the hell are you looking for here?
Can't you see it's a one-way street?
Don't you know where the fire is?
It's the Bernaus' house.
"No. 15, Lake Street."
Move back!
#Lap me up
# Why don't you come on and lap me up... #
All right?

Walking on the beaches Looking at the peaches... #
All right?

"Well, there goes another one Just lying down on the sand dunes"
#I'd better go take a swim and see If I can cool down a little bit... #

"- Yeah, it's quite hot in here."

Um... hi.
"I wonder if you could help us, please."
We're looking for a...

Who is this Babette?
"This is a new one, a friend."
"Tomorrow, you are welcome to get a room."
"You go to the reception desk like everyone else, so you won't have to sneak in here at night."
Then I'll introduce you to everyone else.
Fine.
I don't know if everything is fine.
At least it's not for me.
"Franz, just leave."
"Franz, please!"
Can't we lock the door?
No.
We're talking about months worth of work here!
Intellectual work!
100 Euros for you.
No more!
No less!
Thanks.
No way then.
I promised the people an event.
I want the seats full.
"And next year, we make your place into a respectable hotel."
"Alfons, this isn't just some quiz show here."
I'll make it sound captivating...
This quiz show is the dawn of a new era.
Who's dreaming here now?
Last offer... 300 Euros for me and you can call it a 99 cent show.
100!
"Thanks, then I'll look for someone else."
Who?
Where would he go?
Television perhaps.
He's the enemy!
"Suddenly, all homosex, we must be friendly to?"
That's not the point.
This particular homosex is one of us.
- Ain't one of me.
- We don't even have gay in India.
"Look, he's like a working stiff, juste like us guys, you know?"
"And I got to know this guy, and I kinda like him, regardless of his private... weener business."
All right?
"So we don't do that, we don't burn a guy like this, a nice guy, that's..."
That's just not the Knights of Prosperity way.
"Are you with me, Louis?"
"I'm sorry, what?"
Wait a second...
"Hold on a second, yeah!"
"Wait a minute, I got it."
"Yes, Eugene Gurkin's brain has figured it out once again!"
Ralph said his boss is cheating with his secretary.
Squatch?
Get your camera.
"So last night, I'm at the bar,I meet this girl, she's like a cross between..."
"Miss December 1993,"
"Alyssa Bridges, and Miss April 2004,"
Jamala Dissiza
"So I get her back to my place, right?"
"ok, listen, everyone."
"As of today, Frank Cortland is no longer with Burton Security."
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Carnucci?
I want you to take his place.
"- Yes, sir."
- Good.
Since when do they pass up Sunday brunch?
"Your grandfather's at the office, and Taylor's busy."
Too busy to save his immortal soul?
Funny.
But not the part where you burn in hell.
I liked the sermon this morning.
"Oh, nice pandering."
I'm serious.
"Okay, okay, first off, it was a homily."
Sermons are for Protestants.
Filthy heathens.
We're glad you came.
I was glad to be included.
"While you're here, would you mind looking at some paperwork for me?"
No such thing as a free brunch.
We have to pick up the kids from my folks.
On it.
Stay with Audrey.
Earn some Brownie points.
Can I get a ride?
"I mean, I can always hitch."
Maybe get picked up by some harmless-looking guy in a panel van.
Go get ready.
Wheels up in five minutes.
- Thank you.
- I'll be at the car.
Meaning you'll be having a cigarette.
I'll be having a cigarette.
Ohh now.
You smoke?
Only crack.
"Hey, I got to talk to you about something."
Bee sting in 1 is asking for you.
Have them start the orientation manuals.
I'll be with them soon.
"- Carter, MVA, two minutes."
- But not to hold their breath.
"Dr. Carter, so there's a trauma coming in."
Yeah.
"Why don't you take the bee sting in 1, the wrist fracture in 4 and the burning rash in 2?"
Care to give me a hand?
- Help me!
- Why not?
- Help me!
- Hey!
"That's just been mopped, damn it!"
You don't talk if you're having a real seizure.
- Remember that for next time.
"- Come on, man!"
- Think it's always this crazy here?
- Probably.
"They need to bring you back to the VA hospital, sir."
- I don't understand.
- Your driver will explain.
"You guys suck, you know that?"
- Don't bother.
We don't have any beds.
"- So, what else is new?"
"- No, I'm serious."
Try Mercy.
- They' re refusing patients too.
- Then try Rush.
We' re filled.
- I've been bounced all over town with this guy.
"So his DNA is at a murder scene... and he's not the victim, so what does that leave?"
Is he a witness or is he just someone who happens to be there?
I'm gonna double-check the results.
"I'm gonna triple check them, okay?"
There's a possibility that the DNA is old.
20 years!
"I'm saying it's possible, okay?"
He may not have been there.
"Mark, just think about it."
It's Jesse!
- I know.
"- It means he's alive, yeah?"
"Yeah I know, you're right."
"I know, I know..."
"It's what we always wanted, isn't it?"
"Oh man, it doesn't make any sense to me."
"What am I gonna tell my Mum, Dad?"
"Nothing, not yet, okay?"
"Look, I shouldn't even be talking to you guys."
I could get fired.
Sorry.
This thing could end up being public.
I mean it's the sort of thing the papers have been all over.
"Yeah well, if it comes to that we'll let them know."
But don't you think there's someone else we should tell?
Someone who was with us that day.
Pru?
Come on.
"Dad, I wanna ask you something."
Do you remember him?
"This is Jesse, Dad."
You remember he went missing as a young boy?
You take that one.
Uh--

Press gang muster on the jetty.
I shall return to Defiant in three hours.
- We'll have the crew ready to serve.
"- Thank you, Mr. Scott-Padget."
Press gang!
Stop him!
Catch him!
Don't let him get away!
- Press gangs are busy tonight.
"- Yes, probably ours."
We're a few men short.
"Well, a few dozen."
Things get worse.
The English sailor's lost his taste for fighting.
Maybe he's lost taste for the conditions in which he fights.
- Must have discipline.
- His Majesty's Navy uses a heavy hand.
"At times, perhaps too heavy."
"Apart from finer feelings, it could be dangerous."
The lower deck's like a prison.
"No freedom, irregular pay, and food that even rats won't touch."
- I speak out of turn.
"- True, every word."
We've enough trouble without provocation.
"Still, that's for the Admiralty to settle."
I used to be in charge of all this shit.
And now...
"I'm gonna have to hurt you, Henry, but it's for your own good, mate."
"Just give me your arm, son."
Hey!
Shit!
"Henry, it's Jimmy."
"We've only got few moments until they won't let us escape, mate."
"Okay, just give me your arm."
"Okay, just relax."
Here he is.
Here he is.
Bingo!
This little fucker is how they've been tracking you.
Goodbye.
In a few moments... your mechanical parts are gonna start shutting down.
Your friend Akan's got an important Russian connection named Slick Dimitry.
"Slick handles all Akan's cops, guns, real estate ?"
", lot of shit."
This (helpful?
) dot on the map.
It is Slick's place.
"All you gotta do is break in there, kill him, open up his rib-cage, take out his beating heart... and fucking eat it."
I'm kidding!
"I'm kidding, don't you fucking eat his heart ."
Under his heart is his charge pump?
Yeah?
Bring that to me.
Use this and I'll contact you on this.
That's going to be the greatest jacket I've ever seen.
Great jacket!
Where can I get one?
"Guys, I'm giving you the password of geometry."
"Pi, meaning 3.14."
I got it.
Try it first. 3-1-4.
Or 4-3-1.
Try them all.
This is it!
I couldn't delay her any longer.
She dropped off the grandson too.
We are almost at the street of the school.
What did you do?
We'll be done in 2 minutes.
We found the questions.
"Come on, get out of there."
What are you still doing?
Questions for physics and history.
This is heaven!
Get out!
You'll get caught.
Forget about history and physics.
What happened?
CSI Urfa operation has been completed.
Let's hope for the best.
This is it!
This is what I call killing three birds with one stone.
"Oh, come on."
That can't be.
They wouldn't dare do such a thing.
Don't you think I will be able to understand from their answers?
This is the first time in my life I've passed a math exam so easily.
"As I said yesterday, you all solved it in a different way, right?"
"If we all get a full mark, we will mess the whole thing up."
He's at Rocky Point.
I oughta know that.
Hanley and Grayce got him picked up for an old rat and sent there to get him outta the way because the papers was getting hot.
It's like having him put in a safe.
Yeah.
That's all I know.
You can't blame me.
In Rocky Point.
No wonder you couldn't find him.
The old homestead.
So now what?
"So, what do you suppose?"
"I promised the girl we'd find that fink and clear Ross, didn't I?"
"Well, we did."
Now we gotta get to Carlisle.
Is that right?
Duck soup.
"You take off the kelly at the front door and say,"
"""Please, sir, can I see Mr. Polecat Carlisle?"""
It's too hot.
And supposin' we do find the guy?
Where's the payoff?
"Yeah, the payoff."
"Why don't you forget it, Stacey?"
What difference does it make if you promised the girl?
What do you care about Ross?
We can't help it if Polecat's in stir.
We'll just fool around at Rocky Point and get paid off with a slug in the belly.
And I ain't taking it for Ross or nobody.
Okay.
"If there was only a half a chance, Stacey."
"Listen, don't do nothing foolish."
I just picked up our little man and thought we'd drop by for a visit.
I've been trying to get Fen interested in food.
She shows a passing interest in oatmeal.
- (Fen grunting) - (Murdoch):
Any other changes?
"She's still making the gestures, but I haven't been able to decipher any pattern."
It certainly doesn't match any sign language that I can find.
(Murdoch):
Perhaps it is just random.
- (baby babbling)
"- Hello, Roland."
Am I ignoring you?
(Julia chuckling)
- Oh!
- The nanny says that
- we are to feed him more often.
- Hahaha!
"- He's hardly underfed, William."
"- I agree, but she insists."
There.
No?
"See, you're not even hungry."
(Fen grunting)
"Do you see that, William?"
(Fen grunting)
You like the baby?
- You want to see the baby?
- (Fen grunting)
"I think she's more interested in you, William."
Pa!
- She's speaking.
- Paaa!
"Well, I don't have it."
- Is there anything else?
- Yeah.
Why did you bring them back here in the first place?
I was hungry.
My last meal left me just a little unsatisfied and they were yummy.
You might think about curbing that appetite.
"Hey, hairy palms, what's it to you?"
You jealous much?
I have to find Olivia before she hurts someone else.
"In the meantime, keep the door locked and your eyes open."
- Where are you gonna look for her?
- Furies always have sisters.
"Big, strong Dyson."
Is it true you're a cop now?
How tame.
I know Olivia's sick.
Tell me where she is so I can help her.
Someone tried to kill our sister.
No one we don't trust gets near her.
"Ladies, we're here under the auspices of The Ash, okay?"
Wanna mess with that?
"- Well, we can't get her out."
- That's why you bring a Siren.
I promise.
We'll do what we can for her.
It cuts the stems and pulls off all the pretty petals.
Someone's breaking in!
Not asleep.
Not me.
I'm fine.
- I gotta go check on our house guest.
What have you got?
I made the meeting for Eddie with Tino...
... sohecouldgiveup what he knew about the judge.
And what was that?
"10,000 and a plane ticket."
I'll give you the destination later.
Your information is worthless unless I can bring a witness.
Which Zapatti are we meeting?
Paulie had two brothers.
"Tino was John 's boy, Vinnie is Jimmy's."
So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."
Then why not run for office instead of carrying the mayor's bag?
I consider it an honor not only to carry his bag...
... butalsoto fillitwith  things I think the city needs.
"Oh, the kingmaker."
The man behind the throne.
I'm beginning to suspect you don't like politicians.
You're no politician.
They run for office.
You're a walker.
Take a right at this gas station...
... becausewearealmostthere.
Thank you.
Vinnie sure likes strange places.
It looks like Monday night in Key Largo.
He's impersonating Mafia.
Vinnie Zapatti's a joke to his uncle...
... buta dangerousjoke.
"Almighty Lord, word of God the Father, Jesus Christ God and Lord of all creation who gave to your holy apostles the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions."
Grant me your unworthy servant...
-...pardon for all my sins...
-Bastards!
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
See the cross of the Lord.
"Be gone, you hostile power."
"-O Lord, hear my prayer."
-And let my cry come unto thee.
-The Lord be with you.
-And also with you.
Father.
"I cast you out, unclean spirit!"
"-Shove it up your ass, you faggot!"
"-In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!"
It is he who commands you!
He who flung you straight from heaven to the depths of hell!
-Fuck him!
-Be gone...
"Fuck him, Karras!"
-...from this creature of God.
Be gone!
"In the name of the Father, and of the Son and the Holy Spirit."
"By this sign of the Holy Cross, of our Lord Jesus Christ who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit."
Damien!
Amen.
"God, defender of the human race look down in pity...."
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!
-Shut up!
-She'll never forgive you!
- Shut up!
"Oh, just leave it!"
You're going to wake him up...
So what?
God bless you!
Help me!
"Mom, why return so soon?"
Look at you!
"Such strength, what's yourshoe size now?"
Yourson...
Yourson.
Yourbabies will be someone else's but his will be ours.
Where were you?
If I'd known I would have picked you up...
I called many times.
You didn't answer.
"Oh dear, sorry."
Love is in the air.
"If you screw up love, it starts to stink."
Your husband's fingerprints?
Back again for a fidelity reading.
"This strong man, your lover, in his thirties, with wide shoulders..."
"Look sugar-puff; dunno about the wide shoulders with a guy at 58, I only care about his wallet."
Then he definitely has a son...
"Yes, he is cheating on you."
With a woman ora man?
"Listen baby-cakes, if you don't know this shit, shut up!"
"There is no strong, young guy."
"That old fart dumped me, okey?"
Which one?
But there's a young guy...
Enough!
"If you figure it out, just fax me orsomething."
"No, I don't."
"- When we found Allison, she was on a direct course for self-destruction."
Poor kid would be dead by now if we hadn't intervened.
"We saved her life, Ted."
You might even say that I still have a hand in keeping her alive.
Should we have another listen?
Don't worry.
Your daughter's not going anywhere.
"Yeah, we can keep her as long as you like."
"I understand your timeline, Liana."
"No, we're arranging transportation now."
Tell Musa his delivery's on its way.
"Florida, seriously?"
Right.
"Well, we'll move somewhere colder, then."
- Canada?
- Maple syrup and mullets?
No thanks.
Did mom fight for me?
"You told her I wanted to live with you, right?"
"Yes, but..."
"She didn't put up a fight, did she?"
Liana was overwhelmed by the news.
She doesn't want us to leave.
- Screw her.
- Don't be like that.
Like what?
She's never home.
She treats you like shit.
- She hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Hey.
Why did you cry again?
"Oh you know, the money I lent to Suh Yeon, her last payment came in yesterday."
I checked my bank account on the way home from the sauna.
There were 4 zeros after 2.
My eyes started dropping tears and my heart was broken.
I couldn't stop.
"My God, can you imagine how hard it must have been for her to pay all that back?"
"You know, just going to work must be hard enough."
"But imagine her getting all stressed out, staying up all night in front of her computer."
And the only Aunt she has isn't well off either.
And I just had to take that money back.
Why is your cooking getting saltier?
-Hello!
"-Oh hi, did you need anything?"
I'm sorry.
How do I get to Yang Pyung from here?
I missed the exit.
You came quite far away.
Turn left here and go 5km.
Yi Jung Pyo is there.
And if you turn right and keep going it will be there.
Thank you!
-Hold on.
-Huh?
This.
Thank you!
Thank you!
I'm sorry!
I won't even make excuses.
I'll just die!
What happened?
I think I'm becoming stupid.
Arthur Agee.
Please hold your applause so everyone can hear.
Christine Bowman.
Erica Byrd.
Sandra Crockett.
I never thought he would get to the place where he's at now.
Arthur's self-esteem was really drained from St. Joseph's.
"I said, ""Well,you are somebody."
"""No matter where you go, it's what you have in your heart... that you're gonna go somewhere. '"""
Come on.
"Move out of the way, boy."
"Everybody out there, there's gonna be a party tonight."
There's gonna be a party tonight.
You know it.
These flame-broiled burgers -
"It's scary, man."
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you the truth.
"Scary generation, man."
"- I thought you might hit me in my head, fool."
- I didn't hit you in your head.
To my son.
I hope you pursue all your dreams and your desires... that you have within you.
I love you very much.
"- Ooh, that is so nice."
- Whatever.
"Oh, no.!"
"God, we thank you for this day, Lord."
"And we ask you to go with junior, Lord."
"And we thank you, Lord."
"Go with him as he try to better his education, Lord."
And we thank you for him for coming this far.
"This way, we will forget each other."
I'll take him back whenever I want to.
Don't go!
I have to go after her.
Do you need to deal out pain in order to survive?
Even to a kid like that?
"She's not a kid, it's worse."
The worst must be me!
Want to bet?
"A proper little lady who would want the worst, is it able to suffer then?"
Is it trying to suffer?
Does one really suffer in theater?
You'll taste.
Feel.
I'll help you.
Come.
You dithering?
"If you pull out of me, you're finished."
Because of that?
That?
Lyon Station.
I owe you for this one.
"Oh, how happy Mickey will be!"
"For me, this is a pleasure, a vision of the Apocalypse, the Whore on her throne of blood, the fourth horseman, the lamb of the seventh seal, Kafka and his goldfish!"
Kafka and his goldfish.
Good.
Good.
There I can't.
I spent my holidays here with my father and mother.
My father died in that room.
A bullet to the attic.
I'm lying again.
"Now, that, brah, is what I call a good-looking wahine."
She sure was.
"What do you mean, """"was""?"
Is she dead or something?
Or something.
[ Man ] I don't think you understand.
I'm John Sculley of the Newport Sculleys.
"[ Rick ] Mr. Sculley, I'm sure in Newport, you make the tide go in and out, but here at the King Kamehameha Club, you have to be a member, which you're not,"
"or the guest of a member, which you aren't, in order to use the facilities."
"And anyway, sir, it's after 6:00."
It requires a jacket here.
What about him?
"Hey, didn't I tell you to make all the deliveries in the rear?"
Right.
I think I understand.
How much is it to join your little club for an afternoon?
Don't even try it.
"I was gonna buy you one drink, as a courtesy, at the club."
"Now I want you out right now, or I'm gonna throw you out."
You and who else?
Me.
- Get me a drink.
- Coming right up.
Thanks.
That's all right.
I just didn't wanna see you kill anyone.
"Besides, I need your help."
I gotta find her.
She used to work Hotel Street.
What club?
Wiki-Wiki.
Wiki-Wiki?
Woman's pump at 10:00.
"Oh, so how does it feel being the, uh... little guy?"
What's that?
Earthquake?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Blech!
"And now, for the moment of truth."
It fits!
The shakes worked.
"Hi, there."
I thought you might like to try our new flavors.
"Gaunt grape and lean, mean nectarine."
"Thanks, but I lost all the weight I had to."
I don't need any more shakes.
You really think so?
You guys must work on commission.
"As you can plainly see,"
I... (gasps) look awful.
I'll take two cases.
"Quick, before the firemen have to come and cut me out of my bedroom."
"Hey, by the way, how did your meeting go with the president of Everything Emporium?"
Not bad.
"At first, it wasn't going well, but then he had, uh..."
metamorphoses.
"Either you're up to something, or..."
"No, that's it."
You're up to something.
"Mmm, Sabrina, you've got to try these croissants."
They're just like Grandma used to make.
"Well, not my grandma, but someone's grandma who knew how to bake."
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.
Can we be of service?
Chief?
"Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved."
How may I be of service?
Sonny!
"Yes, detective?"
Calvin's fine!
Save me!
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V. I. K. I. ' s prisoner.
I don ' t understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.
That's true.
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.
"Did she, Sonny?"
No.
He said I had to promise.
Promise to do one favor for him.
He made me swear before he'd tell me what it is he wanted me to do.
He made me swear.
Then he told you to kill him.
He said it was what I was made for.
His suicide was the only message he could send to you.
The first bread crumb.
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.
Lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you.
"Are you going to arrest me, detective?"
Of course I'm sure.
The mayor's wife left a letter.
"Wait, what about the film?"
You promise me you'll destroy it?
"Previously on ""Death Comes to Town"":"
That's a brooch?
And why do we need a camera again?
For my investigation.
"Marnie, I need to know who really killed the Mayor."
"But if Shuckton is going to continue to grow or even survive, we need to bring in some new money."
What's that?
You want a kiss?
"Well, if that's what you want."
"Oh yeah, Shuckton, I still got it."
I'm your soul taker!
I got it.
Two for two.
I got two souls.
I'm your man.
"Oh yeah, I still got- Ahhhh!"
Ohhh.
Shit.
"And now the sad, freaking news."
It appears that one of our own has become the story.
"Heather Weather was killed yesterday, which leaves us to wonder, who could have killed this aging bright light."
"What, you don't like the picture?"
I picked it out myself.
"Ma'am, can I talk to you for a minute?"
I've live on the air here.
We have some questions regarding your involvement in the case that you're reporting.
Levon!
"- It seems to say ignore these guys, I'm with you."
"Well, it's not Nick and His Friends' Infinite Playlist."
- Right.
"- Oh, that's sweet."
I say we do a drive-by.
No.
Absolutely...
I was loopy there.
I think it was pretty late.
Pretty early.
You can normally tell by our eyes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You didn't CGI out any of the red in some places.
I'm sure it was...
Or maybe you did.
No.
I took some of the red out of your cheeks in the exteriors because you looked cold.
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- Hey, did you have to take out some of our icy cold breath coming out of our mouths?"
- No.
We just didn't use...
- No?
Look at that face.
"Look, they were falling in love."
"You see a bit of breath in this movie, don't you?"
"- Well, this is worth talking about."
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Kevin Corrigan.
"Ari, tell us about your evening this night."
"This was, like, 3:00 in the morning and we were supposed to shoot a whole other scene."
I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon.
He can be with any girl he wants!
There you go.
"Feel better, p-pal?"
What am I supposed to do?
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.
"I mean, Wendy says she'd never leave me for him, but what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings?"
"She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl."
This is all so crazy.
"I mean, really, how could my day get any worse?"
"No, no-- no, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it!
"No, fuck off, I'm not doing it!"
"Aw, jeez, you're no fun."
"- Hey, Bridon!"
- Hey.
"- Hi, Bridon."
- Hi.
"Hey, Bridon!"
Hey.
"Hey, kid, over here."
"Hey, uh, listen..."
"You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do,"
"I think you need to, uh, ease off a little bit."
Huh?
"Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you, but actually they're all getting really annoyed."
- They are?
"- Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy."
I don't blame them.
All that singing and dancing-- I can't stand it.
You don't like doing it?
It just isn't me.
Sunshine Welfare.

"""Hi, have you ever been abroad?"", someone asks you."
We can use present perfect to talk about our past experiences.
[school bell rang]
"Okay class, we're done for today."
What do you think you're doing?
I...
I just want to take my notes back.
"Eonni, what are you doing?"
(Eonni - older sister)
Sorry.
Are you scared?
"If I only knew, I wouldn't lend it to you!"
Do I have to make it more obvious?
The President is my father!
It's not me!
Da Hye!
"Just now, sorry about it."
This is my first time as a security guard.
"When my father became President,"
I have expected these things to happen.
So I've never had any friends.
Take these.
They should be suitable for you.
"Now, I'm going to the nightclubs."
"You can't wear guard clothes when you go inside, right?"
I certainly don't want to show any surprising flaws.
We will be going to Jiaye Ban.
Ah.. noisy!
Was she just about to tell me she loved me?
I'm so glad we came.
Blair£¬I need to talk to you.
Gossip girl knows.
Ominous.But ill-timed.
You can tell me tomorrow or never.
About new year's?
"Look,the mean girls want the best piece of gossip"
In exchange for keys to the kingdom.
I just thought you'd want to know.
If gossip girl were gonna post that information
She would have done it this morning.
"and like I said,the mean girls don't control anything."
"Blair, wake up."
You're not queen anymore.
You haven't been for a while.
And you're not going to be either
If you tell anyone what you know.
I'm sorry I wasted my time on you.
You don't have what it takes.
You never did.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Bring me your leader.
It's not midnight.
My gossip's too juicy to wait.
I wanna talk.
I prefer to talk after.
What do you think about my coat?
I like it.
Why?
- And now?
- Even better.
I forgot to post the invites.
Dinner is served.
-
- Last few what at the old price?
-
- W--Worry about that when we get 'em inside!
-
"- We need a bigger window, you know."
-
- What for?
So we can write bigger letters.
I doubt if they can read that across the street.
All this m--money I'm spending on advertising!
I'm n--not r--r--reaching p--people.
All this money?
What money?
One little brush and a pot of whitewash!
"Do you want to cross the road, love?"
Off we go!
It's all clear.
"How about a kiss, then, to start the day right?"
"It might start your flaming' day right, but it won't do a lot for me!"
I see you've just met Dennis.
That's Dennis.
We're training him for a round of his own.
I hope it's not round here!
Thank God it's dark.
Suppose somebody had seen me kissing the milkman!
Some of these firms spend a lot of m--money on advertising.
That's it.
"If it's gonna cost money, that's us finished before we start!"
I can go home by myself.
You had beer earlier...
How can I neglect a kid that's been drinking?
I've only had this much alcohol!
Teacher Gil...
Are you naive?
Do you think that was the first time I've had alcohol in my life?
"Anyways, I have no choice but to feel responsible."
"Since you're my student, Kang Gyung Joon."
And...
I'm sorry...
For making you pretend to be my fiance.
And...
Thanks.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Since you found this for me.
And if you're grateful...
Fill this up for me.
This face costs more when I take the bus.
And do something about the clothes too!
I feel like it's going to rip if I flex too hard.
And this back here keeps eating my pants!
You're right...
We can't leave my Yoon Jae like this.
-Let's go.
-To buy clothes?
No.
To Yoon Jae's house to get clothes.
Honey...
Doesn't Yoon Jae seem like he's changed a little?
He doesn't seem to mind his manners...
And he also doesn't seem uncomfortable around us...
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
He's not here.
I hope nothing will happen to him.
-It doesn't look safe here.
"-Well, it's quiet instead."
"If I'm not wrong, it's such a sharp, frosty silence."
I would say even a dry silence.
Personally I'm more suited to the silence on Jupiter.
The silence there was so fizzy.
"-I'm not wrong, am I?"
-Yeah.
"On Jupiter it was fizzy, but sometimes deep and sublime."
"While on Ganimed the silence was kind of dark blue, lazy, blending together."
-Am I right?
Do you remember?
-Of course.
Only I don't remember what the silence blended together with.
With a morning cock-crow.
But on Oberon the silence there was something wicked.
-The nicest silence is on our planet.
-That's right.
Such a silence I haven't heard anywhere else yet.
The evenings in front of the bunker...
It's such a silence.
"Hallo, Doctor!"
Quiet!
You are in a reserved area.
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
Is that what you tell yourself?
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Scott...
"Scott, I'm fine."
"Scott, I'm fine!"
Scott!
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
(FAST-PACED music playing)
(GRUNTS)
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
adrian:
What the hell's going on?
"I had to, to make him quiet."
"""And then I didn't know what to do."
He was too heavy.
It was too far to the river.
So I left him.
Things kept going bad when I got back to our street.
His mum was already looking for him.
Thom!
Thom?
"""So I went behind mrs Bailey's house, where dad found that weird guy."
"That's where I had to leave the jacket."""
Christy.
Christy?
Ben!
Where's the phone?
I thought dad would still be asleep.
Must have been right behind me.
"""Things kept going wrong."
I went back for the jacket it was gone.
"And then I found out you were looking for a torch, so I thought if I put dad's torch back, you'd leave him alone."
"On Christmas day, I heard dad get up early."
I followed him up to mrs Bailey's house and I found the jacket there.
""" That weird man must have taken it."
"""All I had to do was put it back in her house."
""" Now ""her"", meaning ms murnane?"
But mum mum made it hard.
"""I just wanted us to have a normal Christmas."""
But it wasn't.
"""I came back with Tash, but then she came over."""
"We'd only been gone a day, and she was already after dad."
Thom was gone.
We'd gone.
"Trying to get it together, but we got a little problem."
(speaking spanish)
We spent all of our time trying to get it together.
"Dealing with whites and the mayates, only to be dealing with our own."
"Órale, carnal."
These aren't our own people.
They're nothing but lame farmers from up north.
They're chicanos.
"It's too late, homes."
They're already too big in Vacaville.
And now they're making a play on our shit in Folsom.
"They gotta pay the bill, ese."
Who's carrying all the weight for them?
Dude named El Chucko Peña.
I know that vato.
I know him real well.
(speaking spanish)
"That should make it easier to get next to him, ese."
He used to be my crime partner!
(speaking spanish)
"What the fuck is wrong with you, ese?"
It's cool.

"Baby, do you understand me now?"
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong
(speaking spanish)
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
That's when I felt a burning in my back and I knew he bit me.
I never saw him do anything like that.
Maybe he knew his mother was gone.
Maybe he did it to show his grief.
"Maybe he would've bitten himself, had he been alone."
We don't know.
We don't know how he thinks.
"Maybe he understands, but it's all stuck inside, and can't come out with words."
Poor polo...
What's gonna happen to him?
Where will he end up?
"'Twenty years old, a heart filled with hope and dreams"
'He comes to buy 'a few roses still in bud

Goddam tragedy!
Goddam gun!
Why did I leave it with her?
Goddam son-of-a-bitch.
Fine... you can go.
Thanks.
You hurt yourself?
It's nothing.

I misbehaved with you
I wanted to tell you something else
What...?
- This

"First come, first served"
Hurry!
The train is about to leave.
- Where did I keep my money?
"One minute, I don't know how to count this currency..."
lots of small change
"Can you tell me one, two's, eighths...?"
Stop
Train's gone?
The train is gone!
"Don't cry, Senorita"
But you just stopped crying
It's raining!
"Don't cry, please!"
"I'm with you, I'm here!"
Look
"Okay, I'm gone... gone!"
Here's your bell
The next train is very late.
"To catch up with the train... at Zurich tomorrow morning, we can either take a bus or hire a car"
What would be your pleasure?
Bus or car?
Where's she?
"Ever since you met me, you've been harassing me"
What are you saying?
- All along the trip... you've been chewing my brains.
You're okay with me doing this?
That's what you came here for.
Who is he?
Takenaka San from Planet Music Japan.
Sleeping your way up?
Why are you working here?
I thought you were at Grand Pacific.
You've been lying to me.
I wasn't lying to you.
After the tsunami I couldn't pay tuition.
I graduated thanks to 1.4 million from your parents.
How could I tell you I didn't get that job?
Then return the money.
You said we'd merge our finances anyway.
Maybe not.
Maybe I need to rethink marrying a whore.
"""Sorry, I was trying to turn you into a delivery girl."""
"""But you made me want to go straight."
"I promise I'll be back!"""
Yes?
"If you're staying, you'll need to pay the overnight fee."
Why?
Your companion left.
He'll be back.
- But...
- I promise he'll be back.
"Could you contact him, then?"
What?
Call his cell.
Don't have his number?
"I have his email, I'll email him."
He's not coming back.
It was my mom's.
Isn't she going to miss it?
She died before I was born.
I don't think that's possible.
"She died exactly when I was born, to the minute."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
You can turn around now.
What's this?
Did some rich guy give it to you?
Is it worth a million bucks?
No.
"Oh, did your mom give it to you, and then she died, and that's all you have to remember her by?"
No.
I stole it.
Oh.
T oo bad it's empty.
T oo bad you don't have a guy to put in your locket.
"A guy with a house, a job, a car, credit cards... and a son."
"Yeah, I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work."
"Well, what am I trying to do?"
You want me to go out with your dad.
"No, I don't."
That's good.
I want you to marry my dad.
Let me explain.
I never mix business with pleasure.
I'm not talking about pleasure.
I'm talking about you marrying my dad.
But people like your dad don't marry women like me.
Well...
"I told him what you did, and he didn't mind."
I told the truth.
I'll fix that guy's wagon.
"I gotta go to town, but I'll be back tomorrow."
"- But, Patsy--"
- I gotta go change my clothes.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
"- Funny, right over--"
- It would've been nice--
- It's just a hair--
- See a beautiful life in this--
"- Hey, boss."
- What is it?
"Been doing all right for yourselves, haven't you?"
And Joe's been doing himself plenty of good.
"- Well, what do you say?"
- We thought you was through.
What gave you that idea?
"- You're a reformer now, ain't you?"
- Who's running this racket?
You was.
Who is now?
- Me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
You think I built this racket up for seven years to let you guys walk away with it?
I'm telling you all something.
You're through.
And as for you....
- Wait a minute.
- Dirty son of a--
Keep those gats in your pockets.
"- Come on, let's get out of here."
"- Yeah, go ahead."
Take care of that rat.
"Your apprentice is smart, he has a bright future"
Enough is enough!
Just now it's me against you all

Not bad!
That's my Master's teaching!
Dad!
You want to drive me mad?
Dad!
What do you know about kung fu?
T alk about fighting?
You deserve it!
You!
"I'm sorry, I should have taught him better"
I'll teach him a good and harsh lesson
"Master Shi, please take it easy!"
"Gentlemen, please take a seat inside"

Won't live long even if I survive this
Don't be such a cry-baby!
More hardship is coming
It's bad luck!

Let me show you
She took what she needed from me to survive... until I perfected the serum.
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry.
She never fed on anyone after that?
No.
All right.
"Teyla, ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here."
"Colonel, the retrovirus is acting quickly."
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects,"
"If you bring her back alive, but I doubt she'll cooperate."
She's also stronger and faster than any wraith I've ever seen.
Great.
All this time... we thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us... and I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Addict's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you.

What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
"Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds."
- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!
First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.
"Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem to think I'm giving you the best of it."
"Don't do it, boss."
Let's go outta here.
A thousand dollars.
It's a bet!
It's a bet!
"I think you make one big mistake, mister."
"But, well, we go outside."
- Thornton's crazy!
"- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!"
- Ten-to-one he can't!
- It's a bet!
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!
"- Gee, boss, he can't do it."
He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.
You're not only doing this for money.
You're afraid of getting stuck here and losing that Blake woman.
"Oh, all right."
Your dog is to pull the sled a hundred yards from the standstill.
That's the bet.
A hundred yards.!
"No, it was a mistake doing it."
And poor Barney.
How is he?
"Doesn't, won't and can't ever know, OK?"
"Wendy, it's over, alright?"
I've learned a very big lesson.
Fuzz!
How hot is your English teacher!
Mr Bartrop made it pretty clear he's at the end of his patience with you.
No-one takes Bartrop seriously.
We do.
(Mobile phone rings) And you must.
"Sorry, work."
He is the principal of a school that your father and I spent a fortune on.
"Isn't that right, Cleave?"
"No, ten units, Race Four, Charlemagne's Pride."
Cleave!
Yes!
"Yeah, a fortune."
"An absolute fortune, mate."
"No, 15 units."
Only to the station.
"You're a really clever boy, Fuzz darling."
If you just knuckle down...
"Tell him, Cleave."
To win.
When have you heard me back a place...
"Most important years in your life, mate."
Why don't you just buy your lunch like everyone else?
"Because there is a perfectly good, cold roast lamb in the fridge."
So is this how it's going to be now?
A permanent cone of silence until one of us dies?
"Yeah, that's what I'm doin'."
"Uh, where's the powder room?"
He ain't got one of them.
My bathroom is right through there.
Thanks.
"Rick, I want you to check a... a light blue sedan for me."

It's a... a government vehicle or a rental.

"Yeah, government type."
Yeah.
"Uh, thanks."
What are you doing?
The Iron Man contest.
"Oh, no, T.C."
No way.
I told you.
I am not entering that.
Don't start again.
Not even to save Island Hoppers?
"I mean, I figure what I need is better promotion, better advertising."
"What could be better than to have the company name... in front of the public in a big, fancy..."
"Oh, I see."
You're entering the race.
Did I hear somebody mention a race?
"Oh, yeah."
It's the Iron Man.
It's a big event with men and women if you're into competitive suicide.
"See, first you swim five miles in rough water."
Then you run a complete 26 mile marathon.
"Then, finally, the people who are still alive, they bicycle a hundred miles."
T.C. here is gonna enter.

You won't tell me your name and you won't let me see your face.
At least light the ground so I don't trip up.
How long did she study?
Who?
That woman whose poem you recited.
Forough?
I think she was in school until the fourth or fifth year.
"You know, writing poetry has nothing to do with diplomas."
"If you have talent, you can do it too."
How much do I owe you?
What do I do with the bones?
- Back there.
- Really?
"Yeah, the squirrels love 'em."
"Do you know that I lived in New York for most of my life, and I've never been to central park at night."

"How you doin', mama?"
- You goin' out?
- I ain't goin' out.
"If you wanna let someone come in, we can do some business, man."
What do I have to do?
"It's a hundred bucks, baby."
You don't ask questions... come on.
Cute.
[Heavy breathing]
There's this client of mine.
He likes to do young boys.
That's our specialty around here.
This one also wants to be done by a chick at the same time.
That's where you come in.
"Not me, man."
I don't get involved with chicken hawks.
I think you're pretty sick...
I'm goin'.
"Hey, this guy's a good customer of mine."
"I told him I'd get him a chick, cunt."
You ain't goin' nowhere.
"What's goin' on, here?"
I've been waitin' twenty minutes.
- Let me go!
"- Shut up, bitch!"
"Deborah Duchet is the Gatekeeper, the ""Saint Peter"" of Skirt..."
She separates the men from the boys.
Let's watch her in action.
What the hell are all these cameras doing here?
I'm doing a tour for channel 13 that nobody else wanted to get.
"- Hello, Skirt."
- Isn't she a genius?
Let's move on.
"That's Roxanne Rochet, our Fashion Director... let's follow her."
Don't you just love her Chanel?
This is her first day back since the accident.
Her breast implant exploded on a Concorde.
The show must go on.
Messages?
Get Tokio on line 1.
"Get my boots back to Christine, because they need new legs."
Give me an overwrap.
Did you call Garin?
What's going on with John Bartlett photo shoot?
"Get me an overwrap, I want an..."
Himalaian rejuvenation lime and berry acid peel.
"And get me some Valium, I'm suffering from such jet lag."
Where is Cecilia Soleil?
She's on maternity leave this month.
This month?
It only takes one day to bung with a baby.
"- Yes, Roxanne?"
- Capuccino.
"Right away, Roxanne."
"Okay, let's move on."
This is the Editor Large.
This is the Editor Super Large... and this is the Editor Slender Regular.
Then I won't go to Stanford until next year.
But you've been thinking about this for like forever.
Yeah and didn't you just order the official Stanford coffee mug.
Mouse pad combo pack?
"Don't you have an omelet to make, mister?"
[Sighs] No wonder Oliver's always on tour.
Boy's not as dumb as I thought he was.
[Sighs]
"Look, you're right, I mean, I have always wanted to go there."
But I've always wanted to go there with you.
And you know I can do that next year.
But it's such a sacrifice.
"Yeah, but look what you've done for me."
"I mean, you've taken me into your house."
"-Uh, whose house?"
-Omelet!
Yes ma'am.
And you let me be Lola.
I get to ride around in limos and private jets.
And live the rock star life.
"I mean, I can never repay you for all of that."
-True.
-That didn't require a response.
Sorry.
Go on.
Look the point is I just want to do this for you.
So please let me.
-You really are the best friend ever.
-I know.
"Aw, if grown men could only hug like teenage girls."
There'd be no more wars.
"When I ask, do you wanna dance?"
"I am a bear, not a cow."
"You hairy daisies, you think yourhairwill save you."
At least we look like real men.
Ever heard about Scottish drags?
They weartrousers like you.
Save yourbullshit for your cook book!
Being a real man doesn't mean you can't be polite.
Are you fertilizing the fur on yourshoulders?
You're all dying fora real man... and when you find one...
- Get the fuck out of here!
Right now.
"- Look, I was just trying to say..."
"Ah, of course."
Yourhairy ass doesn't get fucked.
What the hell?
Just leave the poor boy alone.
"Come on, it is yourturn."
"Wait here, I'll come back and wax yourshoulders."
What have I done wrong?
!
"Son of a bitch, he screwed up my show."
Why do you pity these people?
This ZENNE is a really great dancer.
AZENNE?
Amale belly dancer?
What's that got to do with yourwork.
I am just interested.
"Perhaps, you want to do art photography."
I could arrange an exhibition.
It should be easy with all your awards.
I don't know.
Stop blaming yourself.
It tore her apart.
My father'll be happy now.
"""Not the girl."""
My mother and I were always telling him that.
But she turned out just like him.
Don't upset yourself.
What time is it?
It's been four hours.
THREE WEEKS LATER
You're going home?
Yes.
"I'd like to stay, but I can't."
You know there's nothing more we can do here.
Our bar's been closed for three weeks.
The kids are with a neighbor and I've neglected this man.
If anything should happen you can get here in two hours.
You can be sure of that.
We must have faith.
Faith?
"I keep lighting candles, but I'm finding it hard to have faith."
When can we put her medals back on?
Not yet.
"With all that she's got, the injuries, the tracheotomy..."
She never took them off.
- I'll get a vase.
- Thank you.
I have to go to America for three months.
My agent says it's important.
But...
The way things are here...
I don't want to go.
Can you go outside for a moment?
"- of course you can, baby."
"harley, make sure you get all the right ones, okay?"
- we get our own presents this year?
- yep.
and i didn't even use the claw machine. [chuckles]
- what about me?
- of course you.
"honey, come here."

but you know your daddy is away in yuma.
he had a match.
but i told him i'd take [singsong voice] real good care of you.
"- here, brandie."
- [chuckles]
"- so, you need to start dressing a little more respectable."
- this is really great what you did.
we are gonna be so happy together!
"- um, can i give this to you outside?"
"awesome. bye, baby."
come on.
"- come here, champ."
let me look at you.
"- look at me, dad."
- look at that!
"she made you stronger, too, huh?"
- [sighs] here. open it.
[paper ripping]
- your hammered gold record?
"- well, i figured it would take care of your account over there at the dollar king, 'cause i know all that wasn't cheap."
- wow.
the harley?
"and the ring, too?"
- Nothing?
The very time when you should have.
We call that dumb insolence.
"Bring the lamp closer, carpenter."
- There is a trace of worm.
- I thought you should know.
Nothing a little whitewash won't cure.
It might make its way to the midshipmen's berth.
You should look.
If you think it important.
Somebody being taught his manners?
"Overdoing it, isn't he?"
- That will do.
"- Aye, sir."
"All right, get up."
- What is he being punished for?
- Cutting his initials on the table.
- Where is this trouble you mentioned?
- Chapman!
All I see is a patch of uncoated timber.
Is that all?
"I thought you should see, sir."
- The wind's freshening.
- Why have you reversed my orders?
- Sir?
- I wanted the gallants set.
- But I find nothing.
- I judged...
"You judged, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
You judged?
- It's good seamanship.
- You're impertinent.
"Honey, that""s not nerves."
"That""s intuition."
"And that""s a blessing."
"Do you know when women suspect their husband of cheating... they""re right 85% of the time?"
Men are only right 50%.
"Oh, my God!"
"Lt""s the Lucky at League City."
- No.
- No?
- How do I know if my husband is cheating?
"- The wife""s the last to know."
"The co-workers know, the mailman knows, the dog knows."
"But not the wife, because it could be right there... underneath your pretty little nose, but you don""t wanna see it."
Signs of cheating.
Number one:
Changes in personal appearance.
Is hubby working out?
Shopping at The Gap?
Suddenly strutting around like Mr. Sexy?
Changes in phone habits.
Sneaking off to make calls.
Hiding the bills.
Computer obsession.
"Ask yourself, honestly, is hubby spending every waking moment..."
"logged on, so to speak?"
"Hi, honey."
Sexual changes.
From complete lack of interest to the bastard wanting sex now.
New positions.
Role-playing.
Foreplay with condiments.
"It""s really not funny."
!
Just write whatever you want!
I don't care!
It's not my homework!
It's your homework!
"Well, this time, we're just gonna have to make it fun."
Write it down.
Write it down!
Why aren't you writing it down?
!
That's not how Ms. Rinsky told us to do it!
"- Well, how did she say to do it then?"
- I don't know!
- Just write it down!
- We're supposed to show our work.
"Well, you didn't do any work!"
I did.
You should show her a picture of me.
Are you sure there's not some other instructions that
"Were sent home or something, something you might have lost?"
"Oh, yeah."
You know what?
There is.
There's a big ol' packet of instructions with
"All the answers to everything we'd ever want to know,"
And I've been hiding it from you.
"Well, go get 'em!"
Mom!
"Oh, no!"
It's your turn to go help aunt Edie and aunt ginny.
I went last week.
"Yeah, but last time, I accidentally drank"
"still, I am content."
I've seen you at last.
And I am delighted to find you're not a man at all.
You're an angel.
"Hands, halo, wings... everything."
"Good night, my dream."
"My poor lady, you are a wreck."
I am a resurrected wreck.
Move over.
(grunting)
"Citizen Maurice, the prisoner is ready for execution."
"Viscount de Swamp, you are guilty of crimes against the people of France."
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
The king has escaped!
- Catch him!
- I will!
Tyrant!
You will be brought to justice.
- Long live the republic!
- (gunshot)
- The king's guard!
We're surrounded.
- We'II hold the king as hostage.
We'II shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?
- I don't think so.
- I can help you.
- My papa's got plenty of gunpowder.
- This could be very useful.
(girl) beautiful!
"[J.D.] I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back,"
"I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things, even a woman eating my former bangs."

You never know who it's gonna rub off on.
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
"[High pitched Southern accent] ""Oh, have you, Stanley?"
"I wasn't expecting any."""
"- ""I hope you like it."""
- Aw...
"- You're hating this, aren't you?"
"- No, that's not it at all."
I don't believe for a second that you really want me to leave.
"You gotta feel it, Lyle."
Get involved.
What do you people say?
Let's take it from the top?
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
Again.
Do it with some force.
"Okay, honey, finish up."
We've gotta get to school.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
Does this map look like Portugal?
I have no idea.
But nobody knows what Portugal looks like.
"I mean, even the Portuguese think they live in Spain."
Sorry I'm late.
This is all I could find.
"I know, you're sensitive."
"Trust me, I get it."
"Hey, why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids then you can just stay over...?"
Why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?
The last thing I'd feel like doing.
If being in this wedding is too painful...
"Oh, God, you guys."
"Please, stop it."
"Relax, relax."
"That's enough, okay?"
"Seriously, you guys, I'm f..."
I've gone through breakups before.
"If you remember, I handle them quite well."
"You've been there, you've seen it."
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.
I can do it again.
I want you to stop worrying about me.
I'm fine.
BEN:
I know it's here somewhere.
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.
"Well, that's okay."
You can just call me when you find it.
I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
I know.
"A girl can dream, though."
You're just too good a guy.
[SIGHS]
Why are you married again?
[LAUGHS]
"Seriously, why?"
!
I hid it in my office before the police came.
You stole the medallion?
"Oh, purely for safekeeping."
Why?
"I had no choice, MacGyver."
You don't realize what's at stake.
I'd say about 20 years... for robbery.
I can explain everything.
My office is this way.
Come on.
In you come.
It's been torn apart.
"All right, don't touch anything."
I'll call the police.
"Nonsense, this is how it always looks!"
A neat office is the product of an empty mind!
Professor?
"Just a moment, MacGyver."
Hold your horses.
Ah.
"There we are, safe and sound."
Just as I promised.
"Now, what's going on?"
"Ah, yes, well, that requires some explaining."
Yes.
We are here.
You said the riddle on the Ark was a set of instructions?
Exactly.
"And if, uh, Cleeve stole the Ark, it can only mean that he's after the treasure!"
Is there some reason you cou--?
Is there some reason you couldn't have told the police that?
[Man] A penny for your thoughts.
I'm thinking about the - the store we had - about your father.
- Yeah?
- But I don't remember him very well.
I remember you were a little boy... and you printed your name on the sidewalk.
"- Yeah, I did that."
- I remember that.
We used to keep the store open till 12:00 at night.
"Well, that was many, many years ago."
"Well, your father was still doing it."
But he stopped doing it.
He stopped doing that about 10 years before you sold it.
And Goodman or Goldman - What was his name?
He used to come around.
He
- He lost his business.
- I don't know.
- His son broke up his business.
- Hmm.
I don't remember that.
- He used to come every night and talk to your- to your father  [Coughs]
- After we closed the store.
- Yeah?
- They used to sit down and talk.
I don't know who you're talking about.
"- Well, you don't remember."
I remember.
- I don't remember.
"""Goldman"" or ""Goodman"" was his name."
Don't remember that story.
Do you remember working in real estate?
"Oh, yeah."
"You respect Jesus, but not us?"
!
Emergency signal from Fred.
"What happened last night... you didn't have a choice, Phillip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan --
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to DC for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett -
- Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.

"- Yes, he was --"
"I miss him, too."
But we're working together now.
Ok?
"Winter break and then the month of July, and this is the first time she's even ever been around the house."
I don't think she's actually a mom.
She told you about my mom taking pills?
Did she?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You know everything about your mom?
The bulls and clippers are on tonight.
The point spread is perfect for a killing.
You want to put 50 on it?
You want to tell me why you stole my palm pilot?
What are you talking about?
From the office earlier today.
I want it back.
"You know what, screw you!"
"You know, my father's a little embarrassed to tell your mother, but..."
Heh heh...
I'm not.
I didn't take anything.
"All right, man?"
[Engine starts]
I want to set something straight.
Burton:
Ok.
I never told Anne about your flirting with me.
My mother saw us in the pool one afternoon that summer.
"I don't know where Anne was, but..."
"We were wrestling around in the pool, and my mother saw, and she jumped to a conclusion and told my sister."
Ok.
But it was the truth.
"Liz, you were a kid."
Let me do that.
It'II be faster and simple.
-I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
-What are those underneath?
Those are love letters yellowing with antiquity...
-...all from one boy.
Give those back.
-I'm just gonna have a look.
-The touch of your hands insults them.
"-Now, don't pull that stuff."
"Now that you've touched them, I'II burn them."
What are they?
Poems a dead boy wrote.
I hurt him the way that you would Iike to hurt me.
But you can't.
"I'm not young and vulnerable anymore, but my young husband was, and I...."
Never mind about that.
Just give them back to me.
Thank you.
What'd you mean by saying you have to burn them up?
I'm sorry.
I must have lost my head for a moment.
Everyone has something they won't let others touch because of their--
Their intimate nature.
AmbIer and AmbIer.

-More AmbIer and AmbIer.
-What's AmbIer and AmbIer?
A firm that made loans on the place.
-It was lost on a mortgage.
-That must have been what happened.

You make things so messy.

Oh!

"Actually, I clogged my sink up hard."

For real.
"I mean, leave the poor guy no hope."
None.
I can do that.
Consider Dr. Everett Lonsdale completely dumped.
"- Although, you never know."
"- No, no, no."
This time I need you to know.

"Sir, what about you?"
"First, get me two large, one lime cordial and some ice cubes."
Quick.
- Will that fill you enough dude?
- I shall order more later.
"- Sir, side dish?"
"-Get me scrambled egg, salted green peas, 75 gm mixture, a pack of Ravi's pickle"
- Sorry sir.
Ravi's pickle is not available in such a big bar?
I can't believe it!
It's such a shame!

"The Kaio take notice, and fear that a new battle may begin..."
"Elsewhere, a large crowd of friends have gathered aboard the cruise ship where Bulma's birthday party is being held, however..."
Vegeta's not coming because he's training?

And Son-kun too?

- Benvolio!
Welcome.
And with Verona's news?
I do bring news.
It's true.
Then spit it out.
How does my lady?
Is my father well?
How does my Juliet?
"See, I ask it twice."
Then I must answer once... to say the worst.
Her body sleeps among the Capulets... in the great monument that marks their fame.
Juliet is dead?
Only her mortal part.
Her soul lives on in heaven's blessed care.
You know this or you heard a story told?
I saw her laid inside her kindred's vault.
"That done, I came as quick as I could find a horse to bring me."
"Pardon me, cousin... that I come with a tale so full of grief."
And it is so?
Then I must hurry.
Jack!
I beg you give yourself some time.
You must be riven with a savage grief and need a while to calm your raging thoughts.
"Cousin, you're deceived."
I know my mind.
Are there no letters to me from the friar?
"No, my good lord."
No matter.
Go with Jack.
Get fresh water for your horse.
I'll meet you by the city gates.
Stage three.
How long do we stay there?
Two days at the most.
Then we go to four.
"Well, what I wanna know..."
"Would you make a note of this, Cathy?"
What I wanna know is do we really need this set?
"Excuse me, sir."
I don't wanna interrupt you.
Is that the shark from Jaws?
"Yeah, I believe it is, Lieutenant."
That's the one that they used in the picture?
I think so.
"Well, that looks different to me."
I can't help that.
If we do scene 31 on stage four...
Could they have two?
I...
"You know, because in the picture..."
Lieutenant...
"...at the end, it got all mangled."
"Lieutenant, I know you didn't come here to talk about sharks."
I'm pressed for time.
What do you want?
"Well, I just wanted to ask a couple questions..."
We got wardrobe in five minutes.
I can give you two minutes.
Fine.
Thank you very much.
"I understand, sir, that you and your wife were living apart."
"That's true, Lieutenant."
We haven't been close for some time now.
Please leave a message.
"Hi, baby."
"It's me, Stan."
"I was just sitting here on my bed eating dinner by myself, and I'm looking at the place where we, you know, were last night, and..."
Holy cow!
It's still warm!
"Oh, wait."
That's because I put my spaghetti pot on it.
I make a good sauce.
"I take a jar of Paul Newman's, and I add..."
"Wait, what happened?"
I slept with him.
"No, with the sauce."
What did he add?
I picked the worst person to have a one-night stand with.
He's a parent at Ritchie's school!
"He's depressed, he's needy."
"Well, it sounds like you two have a lot in common."
"What was I thinking going to the supermarket, picking up a random guy for sex?"
Huh.
"Out loud, it sounds foolproof."
"Oh, this is awful."
Sad Dad isn't going away.
"""Sad Dad""?"
Isn't that sweet.
You guys already have pet names for each other.
"Shut up, Matthew-- you've got to help me."
"Just pick up the phone and tell him the truth-- he was a one-night stand, and you never want to see him again."
No.
I'm gonna handle this my way.
I'll cut my bangs and eat a Dove bar and go to bed.
"Hey, did you hear that?"
That's great.
This-- this is nothing.
I hope not.
This is unexpected.
"Yes, well, uh, turns out that Bill is gonna have to work late again."
Oh?
"Uh, so, we won't be able to use these ballet tickets, which is why I'm giving them to you and Stephanie."
"Well, that's, uh-- that's very thoughtful of you."
"Well, I can see the two of you are really hitting it off, and since I feel I had some hand in this,"
"- and, uh--"
- Wait.
You were watching us?
"No, I--"
"I was just getting the mail, Paul."
I can't help it if Stephanie's laugh travels like a hyena's.
Your friend Stephanie.
"All I'm saying is, uh, please take the tickets."
I will.
"And, uh, I better call Stephanie right away, see if she's available."
So... cross your fingers for us.
Fingers crossed.
Enjoy the evening.
We will.
Oh.
You're home.
As usual.
"I supposed you want dinner, as well."
"I, uh, haven't even given it a thought."
Where-- where have you been?
I was just next door offering Paul our ballet tickets.
"Uh, well, it turns out he's dating someone."
Stephanie.
"I mean, aren't you happy that you decided to wait?"
"Not to wait, but to wait to do it again?"
'Cause you're worth waiting for.
"And if Jack's not ready, then he's not ready."
Let him do whatever he wants to do.
You just have to stay committed to yourself and your beliefs and who you are.
Wow.
I wish we had been closer the last few years.
"Well, it would have been awkward, considering my mother and your mother were not so friendly."
Yeah.
Think they'll ever be friends?
Yeah.
I do.
My mother is clearly not interested in being with my father anymore.
How's that going?
"For you, I mean?"
Is it weird?
"Uh, yeah."
(CHUCKLES)
"Yeah, it is."
"But you know, she should be who she is, too, and I just have to get used to that."
Do you think your dad and my mom will ever get married?
Think we'll ever be sisters?
I wouldn't mind.
I always kind of wanted a sister.
I always wanted a nice sister.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Let me get that.
"Ugh, she better not have come back."

I want only Flora Enterprises to get Umbrella Creations' order.
For that we will have to make such designs that Umbrella Creations..

"Don't worry, sir."

Not try.

Definitely.
You are working so hard.
It's very late.
Go to sleep.
Coming.
I will just finish this and come.
Okay?
Hey.

What is this?
Along with your time why are you wasting our time as well?
But have a look..
If our company starts working on the sketches made by you..
..we will even stop getting the few contracts that we have got.
Unbelievable!
Hey.
- Hey.
What happened?
And this flaming janitor comes out the door.
TJ is the janitor of the school.
"And after the building blows up, he's the person"
One that comes out in flames.
So Kimberly's gonna light him.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Now, this is a broomstick"
That's lit in flames?
WOMAN:
Just the tip.
It's like a long match.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, a long match."
OK.
"OK, so she ignites him, staggers along here,"
Runs around like a maniac.
Slides down the banister here and we'll
Put him out right down there where that big blood patch is.
INTERVIEWER:
He's playing a janitor.
Who you don't actually see before or after this.
"But you know, hey, we can light a guy on fire,"
"So might as well, right?"
"Now is there flames only on his back,"
"Or his front, or his side?"
His full back.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
Nothing on the front.
So that's why he's gonna be twisting.
"Yeah, I'll be twisting and getting the flame all the way."
And [shouting]
And you do not like your mom.
- And I do not even.
- I had not had sex forever.
OK.

"So many years I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again and then I did, in a photo, in a briefing room and I was being sent to meet him with a gun."
I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.
What's he saying?
"This man's a young Ronan Murphy, a suspect shot by Daniel Waldron during Operation Damson."
"What, they knew each other?"
Did you fabricate the improper relations between you
- and Detective Sergeant Arnott?
- No.
- Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you?
The Inspector is up with him now.
Father.
What a terrible shock for you both.
Who could have done such a thing?
Edie is quite understandably wondering whether it was me.
I haven't said a word.
"No need to, Edie."
I made the tea and no-one else touched it.
"If I was in your position, I would think it was me too."
"Padre, what a surprise!"
"Good morning, Inspector Mallory."
Last rites and a murder.
"It's Christmas come early for you, isn't it?"
"Right, George, with apologies,"
"I gather you made Henry's tea, so I'll have to take a statement."
You know the drill.
"Yes, of course."
And please search my house.
"You don't need a warrant, I've got nothing to hide."
I don't doubt it.
"Thank you, though."
Goodfellow.
"All yours, Padre."
"Henry, may I?"
I'm here to offer you confession and absolution.
No.
Thank you.
As you wish.
Have you any idea who did this to you?
"May I ask, was that your first cup of tea of the day?"
Yes.
"That woman at your party, Iris Lightman, and the cover-up she was talking about."
And it took a lot.
Aunt Edi we've driven around this block a million times.
Do you see your old house or not?
Not.
I think we need to go back to Wheeler's market
And make left this time.
That's it!
That's my house!
"That's a taco stand, aunt Edie."
We need to go back to wheel market
And take a left this time.
"Any of these look like your house, aunt Edie?"
Look for the boy who brings the ice.
He'll know.
"Well, thanks to that new high-speed internet we tried free for 90 days."
The principal did get my e-mail and called to say
She wanted to meet mike and me as soon as we got off work.
Hi.
We're the Hecks.
We're here to see principal Larimer.
"Oh, you're Brick's parents."
He has ms.
"Rinsky, doesn't he?"
Isn't she the best?
I just love her.
Really?
I just love my family members.
I think it's a really overused word.
"Aunt Edie, are you sure this is the right yard?"
How many holes are we gonna be digging here?
This is crazy!
I found this weird bone.
He said there was one person who ordered the hits on the five spies.
One person behind Mom and Dad's cover-up.
But Henry says he doesn't know who it is.
"Well, we have to find out."
But how are we gonna-- [phone rings]
Damn it.
Let the machine get it.
Hello?
Any closer to finding Gus Walker's killer?
How did you get this number?
"Come on, Special Agent Henson."
Why do I even ask?
You really should consider using me as a resource on Walker.
I don't need you as a resource.
"Well, for, uh, someone with no leads, you're quick to throw away free information."
What could you possibly know that I don't already have?
Something I'm unwilling to share on the phone.
Meet me at King Street Lounge in ten minutes.
"I'll be gone in 15, along with the info."
[hangs up phone]
I have to go.
But what about-- And don't go anywhere.
"We're gonna work on this as soon as I get back, okay?"
Okay.
Okay?
Would I lie to you?
"Um, Sondra..."
"I'm sorry, I gotta go."
But thanks for the cookies.

"Michelle, does this kind of thing happen often,"
"Darren hitting Tammy, hitting you?"
It was an accident.
I want to see my daughter.
"Michelle, look, I know this is hard to talk about, but you stabbed your husband."
"Now if you were protecting Tammy, if this was self-defen..."
"God, you're making us sound like..."
It was not like that.
Darren didn't do anything.
You don't have to make excuses.
I was cooking... and Darren and I started arguing.
"Tammy tried to stop us, and she got in the way, and Darren pushed her."
"It was an accident, but I got mad and I overreacted and I had a knife in my hand."
Please.
I need to be with Tammy.
I need to make sure she's okay.
"Okay, okay."
Michelle Larsen.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
"No, no."
"No, officer."
Her husband hit her.
It was an accident.
"Okay, Michelle."
"No, look, she has a daughter who needs her."
She's pregnant.
It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar from Boston?
"Yes, it sure would."
Do we know each other?
"Oh, he's from Boston too, but you wouldn't know him."
- Not unless you had your house robbed.
-Maybe he would.
"We were gonna be officers together, remember?"
Only they washed me out.
Glad to see you made it.

"Plus, she doesn't respect me because she thinks I'm an idiot clown."
"Well, you could... you could make her respect you."
"I mean, that's what your mom does."
"Maybe be a little forceful with her, and tell her we gotta get out of here."
"Yeah, you can do it."
- What's that?
"- Um, high five."
"You haven't spoken to me for over a week, since... ."
"Allison, I understand how you feel."
You'll just have to accept what's happened and make the best of it.
Mother.
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.
- You can't mean that.
- I mean it.
I'm going to New York.
"Please, Allison."
I was only trying to protect you.
I was an accident you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.
Try to believe me.
"Well, how will you live?"
What'll you do for money?
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.
Suppose you can't find a job?
"Then I'll live off some man, the way you did."
God.
"God, help me."
Allison.
Allison.
Didn't want you to come here.
I couldn't say goodbye to you in person.
- You know I don't want you to go.
- But I'm going.
You stay here.
"You belong here, both of us, together."
- We've been friends since we were kids.
"- Goodbye, Selena."
That's a good girl.
This will allow you to climb.
There are other dangers.
"Thankfully, you've got me to protect you."
"I can't climb one-handed, can I?"
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.
"(Bird calling, wind whistling)"
(Grunts)
(Panting)
First beanstalk?
"Well, you never forget your first."
"You know, most men would take your silence as off-putting, but I love a challenge."
I'm concentrating.
"No, you're afraid."
"Afraid to talk, to reveal yourself, to trust me."
Things'll be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
Oh.
The pirate thing.
"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite.
Let's see.
You volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated.
You need to get back to a child.
That's not perception.
That's eavesdropping.
"Ah, but you don't want to abandon him the way you were abandoned."
Was I?
This is proof.
Is it?
"Well, this is fake."
Huh.
Oh.
"Oh, yeah, that's my credit card number there."
Oh!
"Vexing, isn't it?"
Eh?
The cuff link that I bought- very similar
In design and style- winds up at a crime scene.
Let's cut the bs.
You planted it there to help your client beat a murder rap.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Is that your theory?
That's not fact.
There's no foundation there.
"Plant anything else, and I will personally drive you to chino."
"Yes, I believe you would."
"As a matter of fact,"
"I've been contemplating retiring, anyway."
That's your problem.
"You know, you can buy a sense of humor."
"We got to catch this guy, calleigh."
We got to catch him.
I just-
- I know he did it.
I think I may have found a way.
Really?
"Well, I started thinking about it,"
And the print alone is not gonna sink coop daly.
"No, he's got, uh, that other explanation--"
It is my fault.
I should have worked harder.
Now she's gone!
She's not gone.
I know where she is.
Sit down.
How do you know where she is?
Now use your head.
She's a young girl.
She wants to party.
She wants to get wild.
Too late to leave the island.
Where is she?
Where's the only place she could go?
"Eden East, the singles' side."
We gotta go get her.
You're damn right we do!
And I'm going with you!
I am not letting you go alone!
I don't care if I have to go there all night!
To find Trudy.
We're gonna go find Trudy for him!
"We can't even go to that side, all right?"
"And it's gonna get very dark, very soon."
Plus we have to be in bed...
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
We have to be to bed at a very reasonable hour tonight because we cannot miss the sunrise in the morning.
"Now, Marcel said if we miss that sunrise, we will not be completing our course."
"We are here for the course, all right?"
- Yes.
"And stop eating and drinking, as well."
"Have anything to do with the ""Gossip Girl"" blast?"
¶ science will just have to... ¶
Is it true?
Are you dealing?
¶ all right ¶
"I was,"
"When I was dating Damien, yeah."
"But, no, not anymore."
This could so easily get back to dad.
I I think it'd be better if he heard it from you.
Are you insane?
I
"- I mean, you and I both know that's a suicide mission."
Look...
"If you want him to have faith in you, Jenny,"
Maybe you need to have a little faith in him.
¶ how many times can this be repeated?
¶
"Yeah, all right."
I'll go see if I can dig out a dress from my old closet.
"Maybe I can catch him at the gala-you know,"
"Big crowd, lots of witnesses."
Oh.
"Uh, is everything okay with you and Vanessa?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, at least I think it is."
It's been hard to say lately.
"Maybe you need to have a little faith, too."
"¶ all right, given our history, what can you expect?"
¶
It's great to see you again.
"You, too."
You've got just one thing to think about:
Allison.
"If you were gonna get married, why didn't you tell me?"
- You wouldn't have approved.
- You never gave me a chance.
"At least it would've been a proper marriage, not a cheap weekend affair."
- Don't say that.
"- Well, what was it?"
- I'd like to talk with you alone.
- You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
- I'll wait outside.
"- Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
I don't want trouble between us.
I was in love with Betty and wanted to marry her.
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
She took you.
"Goodbye, Dad."
"- When you come home, don't bring her."
- Then I won't be there.
Rodney what about college?
I'm not going.
I have to support her.
"You can have a job here, if you work like everyone else."
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, Dad."
"I knew you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought... ."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
Bye-bye.
"Hey, Danny."
"Listen, I'm telling you there's something not right about those two."
You mean something besides the fact that they believe in ghosts?
I don't know.
"Just check 'em out, all right?"
I already did.
"Neither one of them has so much as a speeding ticket, much less a criminal record."
You don't think the guy that lost the money clip was in with them or something?
Could be.
I'll look into it.
"Yeah, because there's something strange."
"I just got this... this feeling, you know, that something's not right."
"Maybe it's like a sixth sense, I think."
Mr. Harpel.
Hi.
I'm so sorry.
I thought we were supposed to meet at Opus.
My mistake.
Nice dress.
"Oh, thank you."
"Samantha Marquez, I presume."
Logan.
Paul Logan.
At last we meet.
Excuse us for a moment.
[Clears Throat]
"[Sam] I'm not sure how they do things where you're from, but here, stealing people's clients is considered bad form."
Stealing?
"Far as I know, Harpel was never your client."
Mmm.
Right.
"Well, I could."
I don't know where Enid resides.
You are reckoning without the Brierley Nymphs
And Shepherds Association clipboard.
"As a matter of fact, the firm she works for happens to be in this building."
Does it?
Is it?
"We'll have to hack it back, Frank."
Seepage.
Lovely.
"Aye, you can smell the damp."
"Mr Kirkby, could you get everyone in lines, please?"
"You, there."
"You, on the end."
Stand up straight.
"Good evening, everybody and welcome back."
"Good evening, Miss Riall."
"Now, we have some new children with us."
"Could they put up their hands, please?"
Hands down.
"Now, the other children have heard this before, but being in the Manchester School Children's Choir is a great privilege and with privilege comes what, Hewitt?"
What?
With privilege comes what?
Comes what?
"""Comes what, Miss Riall?""!"
"Comes what, Miss Riall?"
"What does privilege come with, you nitwit?"
"I give up, sir."
It comes with this.
Chump.
"Well, it comes with responsibility, doesn't it?"
"Now, we have got a lovely new song to learn by Purcell."
To help you and Victor
He isn't safe here I know what happened to him.
"He's not the only one I don't know what you mean lf you stay, you're putting Victor at risk"
Soon people like him will be hunted lt's safer at the Helping Hand
Not a chance
Pack your things
The power could be down for a while
Do you want to go out?
No
Shall we play a game?
OK
Truth or dare?
OK
Truth
How old was I when Dad killed himself?
You weren't born
So he never saw me?
No
Did he want to die because of me?
No
Was it because of you?
It's complicated
You're too young to understand I'll ask Thomas.
At least he will tell me the truth
It's natural that you want to know
"But the truth is, I have no idea"
You don't know why he did it?
No
Was he unhappy?
"Sometimes, he was"
"Other times, he wasn't"
Why was he unhappy?
"Dad, I need to tell you something."
I passed the exam.
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Yourpast, yourfuture, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonors us.
You even sold yourgold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you anotherson right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Yourson didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
-Fuck your mother.
"His car was stolen by some Puerto Ricans.They took his cell phone, too."
I don't know what to do.
I already packed a suitcase for my aunt's in Daytona.
Take it easy.
Don't do something you'll regret.
Three weeks before their wedding.
Maybe he needs to be in rehab.
"You can hire someone to do an intervention, apparently."
"Girls, come on."
We're a family here.
Now I gotta spell it out for you?
Take it easy.
Let me figure out how to handle this.
"Please, don't hurt him."
...fight plan will win out.
At this stage the fight is getting closer because....
Why am I always having to come here?
"-How are you doing, man?"
-Did we come at a bad time?
The decorating ideas.
You want to come in?
I'm sorry for the mess.
"Please, this is nothing."
"So, there is a page from Metropolitan Home."
"Now, wait till you see how a mirrored backsplash can amplify a room."
You want something?
Something to drink?
We gotta go.
If you've got a cup of coffee.
"-He loved that little man, by the way."
-Gobbetto.
Appreciate it.
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
That's an arm.
Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
–What'd he say?
–He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
–Pretty ugly stuff.
–That sounds like Armadillo's MO.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
–We got cut off.
–Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"–An ax, maybe a machete."
–How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
–Three to four hours.
–So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
–Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
"No, failed; drinks are to the right."
But I wanted to give you a tiara.
Don't know if that's quite allowed.
Who's going to have giggles first?
Everett.
You're all very symmetrical at the moment.
Tonight's soup is asparagus soup.
Zachary.
Seem to have miscalculated somewhat.
Is there any more soup?
Ah.
I'm afraid cook didn't make enough soup.
"Tonight was quite strange, almost seeing them as, like, normal people."
"We've always looked up at them and I found it almost quite unbearable and uncomfortable to be served by them and I mean constantly I felt myself, like, wanting to help them."
"I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Mason."
Yes.
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO LIGHT.
"AND IF YOU'RE LIFTING A WEIGHT, YOU COULD STOP."
IT STILL HURTS.
JOE'S GONNA FIND THE BURN.
"NICE, DUDE, KEEP THOSE ELBOWS BACK AT THE TOP."
"WHAT NUMBER YOU ON, MR. HAAS?"
"THAT WAS IT, 16."
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE?
"ALL RIGHT, I CAN TRUST YOU."
"NOW, HOW WERE THE BANDS, WAS THAT THE RIGHT BAND?"
"YEAH, IT'S THE RIGHT BAND."
"I JUST HAD A BIGGER LOOP, SO."
"BY THE WAY, THERE YOU GO."
"YOU MAKE YOUR LOOP BIGGER, YOU MAKE IT HARDER."
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A HEAVIER-DUTY BAND.
"OKAY, FOLKS, WE GOT CROUCHING COHEN CURL."
"We've got the Carson wedding, the Dankowski party, two funerals, and Jill calls in sick today of all days."
"Sara, I'm sorry, I have to handle this."
There isn't anybody else.
"- Mom, what about..."
"- Glynn, do they want roses in this?"
"Judy took that order, ask her."
"Mom, this is the most important day of my life."
You have to be there.
You promised.
I know.
"Excuse me, are you Sara Johnson?"
You're next.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Before you audition.
Is there anything you'd like to say about your contemporary piece?
"No, it's pretty self-explanatory."
Did you have a good ride?
I slept through most of it.
I guess you've got stuff.
Baggage?
Three suitcases.
One big one.
Sorry I had to split so soon after the funeral.
"If I could have gotten out of that gig, I would have hung around longer."
Guess it was pretty tough leaving all your friends.
Here we are.
Put them anywhere.
I'll give you the grand tour.
"Not like what you're used to, but the water's hot and the mice are friendly."
Bathroom.
Kitchen... big kitchen.
With a pistol... as was the custom of this kind of execution...
"He fired the ""coup de grace""."
Do you believe in God?
"No, but I enjoy the tranquility here."
Want to check the gun?
I trust you.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night ofdesolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams
When we have each other
Who needs tomorrow
When we have today
- I can't see.
- Your corneas are badly damaged.
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.
Will I be blind?
"Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang."
Do you remember the murderer's face?
"Please, leave me alone."
I'm frightened.
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Hi...
"Oh, no, not again."
"Uh, I think it's an allergic reaction to something I ate, you know."
"Come on, come on, come on."
- My throat's starting to close up.
Oh!
- It sounds like you're dying.
"Rose, it's the third time this month."
Are you sure you're not allergic to me?
"Barry, please don't think that."
That's a terrible thing to think!
I'm gonna be blacklisted at every restaurant in Manhattan for not keeping reservations.
"Why don't you call me next week, okay?"
If you still want to.
- Sure.
Feel better.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Think I should start with a joke?
"Oh, you're serious?"
"No, I don't think so."
There's not enough time.
- For what?
- For you to develop a sense of humor.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the author of Absolute Truth,"
Columbia's very own Professor Gregory Larkin.
You're going to be fine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored by this warm and gracious welcome.
"As I stand here at the end of a journey,"
I can't.
Why not?
"It was, it was pouring rain."
I could barely see out the window.
The car started to skid.
"I don't know, I saw the wall coming and I didn't stop, I just kept driving."
"What are you saying, Judy?"
What happened?
I didn't know that Grace's car seat wasn't clicked in.
I would never do anything to hurt my child.
Did you do this on purpose?
Sometimes I...
I can't help it.
"Sometimes, it's like I don't know how to snap out of it."
It's like... everything is coming at me at once and I just want it all to go away.
"Judy, did you try to hurt yourself?"
I just wanted it to stop.
- Do either of you have a moment?
- Shoot.
I think my MVC mom's suffering from severe postpartum depression.
- Just one second.
- It's the baby.
Grace Anderson.
- What about her?
- She's waking up.
I thought you might want to extubate.r.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
What are her symptoms?
She drove head-on to a wall with her baby in the car.
I think it was intentional.
I'd like to put her on psych hold.
- Dr. Rasgotra?
"It's ancient history, man."
"Hey, I still feel bad."
"I mean, I heard where you ended up."
Community college ?
You trying to rub my nose in it ?
"Hey, I'm saying it's my bad."
Yeah ?
"Dude, tell me something I don't know."
My net worth is like ten times his.
I was looking forward to rubbing that in his face at the picnic.
"Don't go far, Mr. Banks."
Right this way.
So what now ?
Check with Dr. Talcott in DNA.
"See if our murder weapon is telling us anything, would you ?"
Yup.
"The reunion murder, right ?"
Yeah.
"Uh, is there any non-victim blood on our champagne bottle ?"
"No, but I did find something else, though."
There's something in the blood.
Any idea what it could be ?
"Whatever it is, it's underneath the blood."
So it was stuck on the bottle before it was used as a weapon.
"Yeah, I gotta get this to Trace."
Thanks.
That from the Bob Keaton murder ?
Dusting powder.
All they got was smudges.
Dusting powder...
"Eric, here's what I want you to do."
"Let's stay focused on this powder, okay ?"
There are bills to be paid.
Take a check from the drawer and pay at the bank.
There's a checkbook with signed checks.
Alright.
"Do it by tomorrow, otherwise there'll be a fine."
Okay.
And sell some of the short-term deposit at the bank.
Tell Yaffa she promised me higher interest.
I'll handle everything.
Did you move all yourthings?
How's the apartment?
I brought everything back home.
Why?
Daddy...
Come on...
I brought yourthings from home and the play from your nightstand.
Do you need anything else?
I don't need anything.
What'll you do with the contract?
It's a waste if you pay and don't live there.
I feel bad about all this.
I ran out of licorice.
Okay.
I'll relieve you.
"Hello, Mr. Director."
"Once again, you took things to heart."
"I'm going, will you be alright?"
Of course.
"Goodbye, my child."
I'll be back later.
Those dancers don't have a contract?
"Sorry, I don't work like that."
Just a unemployed person.
What does Yoong Sung want to do?
You don't know how to make people happy.
You cannot deceive my heart.
How come you're meeting with that kind of guy?
"That's what I don't understand,"
Withdraw from this plan.
When I get back I'll do it on my own.

"Lee Yoon Sung,"
My father...
Please forgive him.
I'm sorry.
Kim Young Joo.
Kim Young Joo!
Kim Young Joo!
"If you want to see the classified documents, come to the Seoul junkyard"
- City Hunter.
"Father, why did you do that?"
Why did you have to lie and tell Kim Yong Joo to go there?
This Republic of Korea Prosecutor wanted to know the truth...
I was just helping him.
Do you know?
"The person who killed the innocent Kim Young Joo... is no one else but you, Father."
"Even if someone commits no sins, that person can die at anytime."
Just like my colleagues did.
"Now, that Cheon Jae Man will die by my hands."
Let's go!
So you want to smuggle your way out.
The punk who's smuggled himself out knows what that feeling is like.
Really?
- Haven't you exhausted the subject?
- No.
"No, I wanna go deeper, you know?"
I want to understand why people were labeled as vampires.
"I mean, maybe there is such a thing as vampires."
Just different from the way we always thought they were.
What do you mean?
"Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders, you know."
Um...
Misunderstood.
"You're kidding, right?"
Don't you think it could be possible?
You did give me all that info.
"Jeremy, I made it up, okay?"
"I mean, you were all cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression."
- Is there anything you're not good at?
- Double dating.
This is all kind of new to me.
I usually keep to myself.
I don't always fit in.
- That's because you're that guy.
- What guy?
The guy who seems like he has everything.
So the people that don't kind of run the other way.
- Is that what I seem like?
- Pretty much.
Hm.
- What a dick.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, um..."
Yuuki-kun?
!
I thought the Supporter eliminated you!
I destroyed my Noblesse phone and disappeared on purpose so I could get revenge on him.
I have an urgent request.
Yes?
Move the third trailer to the front.
Of course.
Thank you.
Request accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray that tomorrow you continue to be a worthy savior.
Juiz.
Juiz...
You were the best employee I ever worked with.
No. 09.
I can no longer be your guardian angel.
No. 01 is making a bid to win the game.
But I'm betting on you.
Don't forget your promise.
Promise?
I pray that you'll be a compassionate king.
Go.
Help him in any way you can.
Kuroha-san...
I'm going back to Japan.
Ato-san's not happy about it either.
the political fallout will be huge.
That's exactly why we need Iinuma-sensei's son as our scapegoat.
I have faith that in the end you'll prevail.
you're the man who launched 60 missiles at his own country.
You have my word.
"Yeah,"
I have a date with you.
Half with olives.
We aim to please.
"Well, you hit the bulls eye Tara."
What?
You know how I like to kid around.
"Yeah, you're famous for it."
"Dad, you really think that's gonna help what's going on?"
"Look, you know I think this counseling crap is ridiculous but I promised your mom I'd try again."
We'll be okay.
Right.
You just focus on your game.
Whitey kick your ass today?
I didn't go to practice.
"What's going on with you, Nate?"
"Nothing, I just need some time."
Okay?
No its not okay.
It's career suicide.
"- Dad, Keith said..."
- Keith said!
You talked to Keith?
You take advice from Keith you'll end up spending the rest of your life running a second rate auto garage.
Is that what you want?
I told you.
I don't know what I want.
That's just freaky.
Where do you get off telling Nathan he can quit the team?
I didn't tell him he could quit.
"He wanted to talk, we talked."
"Maybe you ought to try it, sometimes."
ADRIAN:
It's me.
I'm not going to be left out.
I'm not interested in you.
Where's Clementine?
What are you doing here?
Why shouldn't I be here?
I'm friends with all of you.
"Er...well, nothing now."
You know what he does to his victims.
He lures them off trains by gaining their trust.
"He gets them alone, kills them."
Lots of people kill.
What does he do specifically?
Er...
He takes them somewhere dark...underground.
It's strange.
They're such pretty girls yet he wants them in the dark.
Go on.
"He strangles them, he waits until they're dead and then rapes them."
What else does he do?
Tell me.
They wear perfume.
"He puts them in cellars, Anderson shelters, confined spaces, things like that."
The smell of it becomes almost unbearable.
"You know who he is, don't you?"
What I'm going to tell you goes no further.
- It's entirely confidential.
- Mm-hm.
"But if there have been 12 deaths, I think I must tell you."
"There was a man, he worked for me."
Good at his job.
Let's just say we both did good.
Beifong says you're free to go.
"Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."
"Don't worry about it, bro."
"Nice job, Mako."
You're going to make a great Detective.
"But, chief, there aren't any Detective openings right now."
"Actually, we have two openings."
Mwah.
"Mako, I missed you so much."
"Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you?"
Korra's back.
"Korra, hey, I missed you too."
So you're not still mad at me?
Why would I be mad?
"We had that fight before you left, remember?"
"No, not really."
"I got attacked by a dark spirit, and I lost my memory for a little while."
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.
Was it a bad fight?
Uh...
Mm...
No.
"No, it..."
it wasn't that bad.
"Korra, we don't have much time."
We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.
I think I know just the man to talk to.
"Guys, hey!"
What do you think?
"Varrick industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special."
I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What'd you do that for?
I confronted Tyler about his bed-wetting.
[Laughs]
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, we're sorry, okay?"
It's far from okay.
We broke up.
"Well, we'll talk to him."
We'll work it out.
- Yeah.
"- No, I broke up with him."
"After he denied being a bed wetter, he admitted to having a fetish for..."
"Ooh, let's just say it was nasty."
"What do you mean, ""nasty""?"
"Yeah, what kind of nasty things was this dude into?"
Get out of my morgue!
Losers!
The competition has ended.
"Richard Castle, you have solved the murder of Phillip Harris."
[Applause]
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're too kind.
"You have proven yourself worthy, and we, the members of the Greatest Detective Society, offer you a place at our table."
"I'm humbled and flattered, but I'm afraid I must decline."
What?
What are you doing?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with the best of the best.
Not for me.
How do you know what Christine looks like in the nude?
Because we went swimming and I was in my bikini.
"This is Gerard, the writer I told you about."
He's here to work.
Well...
"Working with the whiskey bottle, by the smell of it."
"Let's go to bed, I'm dead-tired."
Tomorrow morning...!
Look at it this way... ln Germany they're in need of plumbers too.
So I set me up a business with Dutoh labor.
Pour me some more.
"And I got 5 chaps there now, all working black and drawing welfare in Holland besides."
"A lot of sugar, baby."
"And they give me no trouble, 'cause if they did I would report them to Labor Inspection."
Those ham and eggs are just the thing especially after last night.
"Really, Herman."
I mean the long drive.
"Don't be shy, Gerard's a writer."
- He's used to a thing or two.
- Stop it.
"Damn, it's empty."
I'll get a frosh pack.
The world of Peter Stuyvesant so much more to enjoy.
What do you think of him?
He's really got something.
How was it last night?
- Zilch.
- Zilch?
We hadn't met in weeks... and oopla!
He came and zonk!
Fell asleep.
Tough...
# If life were movies
# If we were Ginger and Fred
# Then we would glide by
# Like people tied by a thread
# We'd have an amorous
"# And, oh, so glamorous affair"
# If we were Rogers and Astaire
# Wouldn't it be so groovy
# If we were in a movie?
# Nobody thought it silly
# Dancing in Piccadilly
# And looking at all of you
# You could be in it too
# If life were movies
# Then we would know all the words
# Know exactly what to say
# And unsurprising
# Be harmonising in thirds
# Thirds are easy by the way
# Your heavenly chorus
# Would then implore us to wed
"# Oh, for heaven's sake why don't you wed?"
# If you were Ginger If I were Ginger
# And I were Fred And you were Fred. #
What were you saying about yoghurt?
"I didn't know which flavour, so"
I got them all.
You didn't get plain?
I didn't know there was plain.
I can only have plain.
I never saw plain.
"If it's not plain, it's not slimming."
"And one day, who knows?"
"All right, sir."
I'm sure the senator can handle Mr. Webster.
There is one concern we need to...
"Oh, right, concern."
Laine?
K told me about your little sexual romp in college.
Shit.
Tomorrow is the 17th.
- Glenda?
"- Yes, sir?"
Tomorrow is Jacobson's birthday.
Have you got something for the son of a bitch?
"Yes, sir."
You got him a leather-bound Don Quixote.
"Oh, good."
Good gift.
Metaphorical gift.
He'll be trying to figure out why I got him that forever.
"Ah, were you married at the time?"
"Uh, I was a freshman in..."
"You know, sir, I'm just not going to comment on the whole thing."
It's beneath me and it's beneath the press.
That's the way to go.
Fuck the press.
Senator Hanson does not kiss and tell.
- It's perfect.
- Maybe I was too rough on Shelly in Hartford.
"Then this would all be moot, 'cause you wouldn't be president, sir."
You know what?
"Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys, the whole football team."
Who the fuck cares?
"You did her, and now you've come to see what it did to me?"
"- I love her out of pity, Mickey."
"- Don't you, by chance, pity me a little?"
- I love her out of sorrow.
"- Me, I love her out of full stop!"
- She respects you.
- Like one respects graveyards.
I'll never leave her to you.
It's to have you in her mitt that she took that mad flat just across from yours.
"Yes, you did your bit to waste the Venom."
But there's still three to go in her noble cause.
You up for it?
Now it's you she'll run away from.
Mickey isn't the brute you believe he is.
I don't have beliefs.
It...
It's tough to hurt you.
"For me to be able to kill you, you need to be a woman."
I'd wrap the blade in silk.
You wouldn't feel a thing.
No.
She would.
Buzz off!
Oh no!
"We are such children, prince."
Mary...
See?
- D'you suffer?
- D'you?
Our clients!
"Right on time, like for church!"
"Hey degenerate, you got Gothic mosques at home?"
Halt!
Attention!

"Yes, I understand!"
Staff Sergeant Seo Dae Yeong.
Staff Sergeant Seo Dae Yeong.
"You're dating my daughter, right?"
"Yes, that's right."
I worry about my daughter's future.
"So I wish you'd consider my daughter's future, too."
"I believe that you know the method, in the most sensible way."
Is it a command?
I hope it's not but
I'm thinking of doing it if I have to.
"Until when we can be civil and honorable to each other, itisnowyourchoice."

Did you deposit it well?
Thanks to you.
But did something bad happen?
My comrade has been commanded to return to Korea.
The sheriff.
Non-commission officer?
You studied a lot.
Are you envious that your close comrade is going home early
How careless of me.
I left my cigarettes at home.
Then you won't need the matches.
"I'm afraid that won't work, unless you have a needle and thread."
"Excuse me, have you change for a quarter?"
Thank you very much.
You shouldn't have done that just for me.
I could've gotten along without them.
- You hold it.
- All right.
Looks like a jackpot.
"Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick."
I beg your pardon.
You probably think I'm silly.
"Yes, I'm afraid I do."
Just a moment.
"That quarter, I wonder if I could have it back?"
This isn't getting you anywhere.
You don't understand.
I'm not trying to get acquainted.
All I want to know is...
"It's all my fault, too."
I'm awfully sorry.
"Yes, I know."
You've been trying so hard to avoid me.
"All right, give it back."
- Give what back?
- The quarter you stole from my purse.
"Come on, will you?"
Hand it over or I'll call a policeman.
I haven't got it.
I gave it to you at the cigarette machine.
I need new hair.
"Hi, Mom."
This is Rebecca.
"It's kind of a new relationship, so don't say anything too embarrassing, OK?"
"Oh, hi, Rebecca."
He wet his bed till he was 12.
Oops.
Wanna sit?
"Hey Weasel, you wanna move your stuff off the table?"
We gotta cram for the math test tomorrow.
"My name's not Weasel, it's Morgan."
I thought you liked it when I called you Weasel.
I've never liked it.
"You like it so much, it's your name now..."
Weasel.
- What an assertive little sister you have.
"- Oh, it's the uniform."
"When she takes it off, she has a vulnerable side, I'm almost certain."
"OK, Morgan, soccer practice."
Remember what we learned last week?
Don't kick the coach.
"Hey, before we get started, why don't we take a break?"
Can I get you something to drink?
I got full access to all the major appliances in the kitchen.
Aren't you gonna show me your house first?
The house?
You wanna see the house?
Sure.
"Uh, this is the house."
Are there any other rooms?
"Uh, yeah, there's probably one right through here."
Do you wanna...?
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean, maybe unfreezing 'em."
It's like when captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice...
Doc.
Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean, Lex Luthor."
Case in point.
"Hey, psycho."
"Hey, psycho."
What's up?
You switch to decaf yet?
Not a chance.
I got nine lives.
Haven't burned through half of 'em yet.
"Oh, right."
"Well, uh..."
This is some ugly-looking shrapnel.
Ugly and old.
Like FDR old or Bush 41 old?
I'm thinking somewhere in between.
But this puppy's been modified.
- Who are you?
- Soto.
Civilian authority.
Pulled that from a tree branch.
So he's putting something in them.
"Yeah, most of these whack jobs add ball bearings, nails, whatever's handy, put 'em in the mines to maximize carnage."
This doesn't look like some random piece of metal.
"You mind if I, uh..."
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
"And then, too, after- when I got married -"
My husband was a lawyer.
And he was very active in the community- the gentile community and thejewish community.
He was a controller for the city ofToronto... and his office was at the city hall.
He worked for this place.
My husband's picture's the first picture you see when you walk in.
It's still there.
The entrance when you come into this building.
One day I would like to go downstairs with you.
Would you show it to me?
- Yup.
- I would like to see that.
- By all means.
- I would love to see that.
Any day you're ready.
- One day we'll do that.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It's a date.
- Okay.
- All right.
Right in the front entrance.
- Right in the front entrance -
- Wow.
- The first picture you see as you walk in.
"You know, there are a lot of pictures hanging from the ceiling."
There's a lot of pictures.
Yeah.
"- Well, he's there."
- Let's do it.
All right.
Let's see if we can find him.
Sure!
"- So, why..."
- Huh?
Ouch!
Wh-Wh-What?
I only got closer because you were speaking softly!
Ahh...
Is this okay?
Y-Yeah.
That will do.
How did you figure it out?
"You mean, ""How did you realize that I was the person behind Eromanga-sensei""?"
Yup.
"If not, I won't ever let you in."
"When you were streaming, the meal I made for you was in the background."
"You forgot to turn the camera off, and you started taking your clothes off..."
Th-That's enough.
I get it now.
"So after all, Big Brother, you were ""Masamune Izumi-sensei""."
"""After all""?"
You had noticed?
I was just thinking you had the same name.
For it to actually be the same person...
What kind of probability is that?
To think that I've been living under the same roof as Eromanga-sensei.
I can't believe it.
And I don't know anyone by that name.
"Um, this is so sudden, and I don't know what to do."
"For starters, I'm sorry I made you draw all those lewd pictures!"
I-Idiot!
"Don't suddenly shout so loudly, idiot!"
Y-You're the idiot!
Wait a bit.
- How much do you charge?
- Let go of me!
Fuck.
- That's what I'm asking about.
- Go eat shit.
Alright.
- So what are you doing right now?
"- Nothing, nothing."
There's some boys that need a medic.
- Come with me.
- I didn't finish my studies.
"If you don't say anything then I won't either, alright?"
Come.
- Jimmy!
- I thought you weren't coming.
We have to stop along the way.
Pasqualino's coming too.
Let's go!
"As you can see, the interior of Vesuvius isn't dormant."
"And examining the seismographs, we can see that activity... has increased in recent weeks."
- Does that always happen?
- Absolutely not.
This is the first time I see this phenomenon.
- Strange...
- Yes.
"Maria, we..."
"Excuse me, one moment."
Maria!
Where are you going?
What about the picnic?
Tell my father we're going to see the nuns.
Sam:
Let me guess.
"Alonso wasn't a big fan of portion control, was he?"
No.
"During a routine treatment, he almost killed a client."
He sucked out too much fat.
"I demoted him to kitchen duty -- no human contact, just fat from a jar."
"But he said the more I deprived him, the hungrier he got."
[ Sobbing ]
And now three people are dead.
My husband...
[ Sobs ]
Where's Alonso right now?
The -- the basement?
That's -- that's where he spends most of his time now.
[ Sniffles ] What about her?
"Well, till we figure out which side she's on, she stays put."
I am on your side.
Okay.
Then how do we kill him?
[ Sighs ]
[ Grunts ]
You and stupido have no chance.
The fat makes us stronger.
Your sister didn't mention that when she ratted you out.
You're lying!
[ Growls ]
[ Grunting ]
[ Panting ]
"I guess after you killed her husband... you were too monstrous, even for her."
[ Grunts ]
[ Both grunting ]
Tiny Eyes!
I think revenge is a dish best served flaming.
Why did you do that?
It was such a cool line.
"The other day, you mentioned your Saint Bernards."
"You had two, I believe."
What were their names?
I don't think we ever got around to naming them.
Dusty and Bear?
I thought Dustybear Financial had an odd ring to it.
You made it up.
Roger didn't get me fired.
And he didn't derail my mayorship.
"I did, by being a sucky mayor."
"The jig is up, sweetheart."
"You baited me with an old newspaper, cooked up this plan, then ran me around on a wild-goose chase."
Why?
"You were so down, and I-"
- I wanted to get that spark back.
What better way than blowing up someone's office?
But does it spoil all the fun we had to know I made it all up?
The fact that you made all this up for me is so much better than any revenge.
- Boom.
- [ Chuckles ]
Listen up.
"So, Roger didn't fire you..."
but he is a total d-bag.
"Yeah, tremendous d-bag."
Shall we?
Let's.
Come on.
Hey!
"All I needed was a 2,000-watt generator, a test vehicle, and someone willing to risk their life for science."
You look great.
Look at this.
I have cameras all over the place ha-ha!
Really good.
"All right, so here's the plan..."
You're gonna be in the back of the truck.
"When I get a little low on juice,"
I want you to throw me the power cord right through the open top.
Perfect.
"- Charge it up, be good to go."
- Got it.
Who's driving the truck?
He is.
Oh.
That's why we got you the harness.
"I was pretty sure we were about to make history, continuing the American tradition of bold innovation."
"All right, Adam, here's what I want you to do..."
Throw me that football.
It's got a plug in there.
And I'll catch it.
We're just two kids playing football. [ Laughs ]
"All right, stig, nice and easy."
[ Tires screech ]
Geez!
Wait up.
I can't catch up.
He only knows one speed.
[ Laughs ]
"Stig, slow down."
Too much!
"All right, we can do it."
The Falcon was called by Dragan.
"I made a movie about him, titled ""Tycoon""."
He was a champion at the Sarajevo Olympics.
Then he became a sniper during the siege of Sarajevo.
That's where I met him while I was locked up with the Serbs.
Are you serious?
- One thing?
A sniper.
- A sniper?
Then...
What is the plan?
- We do not complicate things.
Do not we commit?
What does it mean to her 'not to complicate things'?
We do not reveal who we are.
A king's knee would go a long way to many of these parts.
I do not want to go.
- Quiet.
We eat and go.
I'm not hungry.
I do not want to go.
"And so, I found myself facing two of my worst nightmares:"
"Dragan the Falco and Rakia, the Balkan lubricant."
Cheers.
We have said more than once.
More than once.
A million times.
But do you know something?
Now...
Now you can do the second part of the documentary.
"Can you say something, please?"
Thank you.
I want to get you some answers.
Don't make me wait.
So who removed the wire from Bob Keaton ?
I don't know.
Still searching.
Just switched over from a local criminal database.
"Okay, take your time."
"H, I've been thinking about this crime scene."
"The wire, the scene being processed..."
"It's above my pay scale, isn't it ?"
Maybe all of ours.
Who's this ?
"""David Park."""
This guy's not a criminal.
He's a GS-14.
David Park has government clearance.
Let's have Homicide bring him in.
"Thank you, Eric."
Mr. Park.
Yeah ?
My name is Lieutenant
Horatio Caine.
Caine.
"Yes... now, I understand you work for the federal government."
Census Bureau.
I count people.
"Now, a GS-14 clearance is a little high on the food chain for a census taker, don't you think ?"
"Again,"
I count people.
"Well, I guess that could explain why I recovered your fingerprint from my victim."
And that would also tell me that you removed his surveillance wire.
So that's how you tracked me down.
"- From their denture cup, so that should count for two!"
- I'd say three.
If aunt Edie asks me one more time
If I've had my BM...
Why does she care?
!
You know what?
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
You should want to go over there and soak up every bit of wisdom
You can get from them!
"If I were you, I would consider it a privilege!"
Then why don't you go?
Because I'm trying to teach you to respect your elders...
And I did my time.
And you know what?
"Since you're fighting about it,"
You're both going.
That's not fair!
"Ohh, no!"
I don't want to hear another word.
Go.
No!
I don't...
ohh!
"We're useless, mike."
We can't even help our kid with third grade math.
Well...
maybe you should go
Talk to his teacher and get him some help.
"We were both banned, but I was banned first, so you have to go."
"Oh, I was banned last, so you should go."
"Okay, you know what?"
Okay.
Okay.
Here.
Your fee.
But if you ditch me
I won't want my money back
but something else in return.
Is this even worth it?
"It's 4 am already and you are not sleeping yet, Boss?"
You should have joined us for dinner.
"Because you didn't go, Aey and Chai kept clinking glasses with me."
They sent their regards to you too.
Look.
There are a lot of them.
Gosh they wrote on me like I was a notebook.
"Don't be sad, microdick"
"- Hey, Marcia, how are you doing?"
- All right.
- Can we come in and talk?
- Yeah.
"Hi, puppies!"
'Marcia's been a little bit difficult to speak to.
"'She, I think, is embarrassed a little bit about her family's past."
"'And so, she's hidden a lot of information from us.'"
"So I know growing up, your family didn't have a lot to eat."
- Yeah.
Were there ever times when you didn't have running water and electricity?
- A lot of times.
- A lot of times.
SHE COUGHS
"DOG BARKS So, when growing up, the drugs in the house were weed and cocaine, right?"
Right.
"Keep him safe and I will light a candle in Torrecastro, Holy Mother."
Why didn't you tell him before?
His burden is great enough.
"Besides, it would ruin his voyage of discovery."
"Prime the pan, close the steel, butt to the ground"
"Charge the barrel, spit the ball,"
Pop it in with your thumb.
"Draw the ramrod, ram it home."
Put it back in its hole.
Bring her back and she's ready to fire
"- You wanted to see me, sir?"
"- Yeah, er..."
Teresa has a plan that might improve the odds in or favour
"I'd like to know what you think, let you decide."
Tell me.
Torrecastro has strong defences.
We can't attack from the outside.
But there must be a way in.
I will go on ahead.
"As a Spaniard, I can find it."
No!
I forbid it.
Easy dear boy
Easy.
"I said I'd let you decide, have the last word"
"Oh, forget it."
He forbids it.
Who does he think he is?
Who does he think I am?
"Evening, Sergeant Harper."
"- You want to make me sergeant, sir?"
- Get a needle and thread.
Haven't you been taking care of her?
I don't have too much money.
What about all the money that I gave you to hold for me?
I bought all these things.
I haven't been able to sell many of them.
It may interest you to know that some time ago
I heard that mother was starving in a little town called Podesin.
I couldn't get money even for myself.
Where's Zina?
Have you been taking care of her like I asked?
Yes.
"Well, at least I can thank you for that."
You're going to have to sell some of this stuff.
I need the money.
I'm going to marry Zina.
Where is she?
Zina!
They said you were killed in a German camp.
Did Gerry tell you that too?
Yes.
Gerry told me you were dead.
Well...
I'm glad I'm here to dispute that.
I married Gerry.
I'm his wife.
You didn't even have to tell me.
Mother always said that you were the one with brains.
I was the dreamer.
I was the dreamer they took to the Nazi prison.
"I loved you, Zina."
That was the dream.
And what became of it?
And he's very blunt with Da Ran too...
Right?
"-You felt that too, right?"
-Yes!
That's why I was so happy!
He must finally feel comfortable with our family!
"Now it really feels like, he's become our son-in-law, so I'm so very happy!"
Well...
If it's because he's become comfortable....
It's a relief then.
It worked.
"Hurry, hurry."
Hurry up and come in.
Does our Yoon Jae live by himself too?
His parents are overseas.
Don't carelessly touch random stuff!
Let's quickly pack up what we need.
I told you not to touch things!
Come here.
The clothes are in here.
Pack up a few things to wear from here.
Oh my goodness!
You scared me!
How can you...be undressed like that!
Why are you surprised when it's something that you probably see all the time?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why steal glances when you see it all the time?
"Here, just look."
I haven't seen it!
What's wrong with you?
"When I was completely naked in the hospital, you ran over and hugged me."
"'Yoon Jae, I thought you were dead!"
"We shall test each other's courage, and then... and then we shall see."
Let's get on with it.
"As you will, sir."
"Honor will be served, eh?"
"Oh, wait!"
"As the one challenged, I claim the first shot."
We shoot together.
"It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded..."
All right.
Captain...
"And now, Captain, how do you have the expression?"
My fate is in your hands.
You've ruined everything!
The machine.
[ Communicator Beeps ]
Subspace interference is clearing.
Try to contact the ship.
The remarkable treachery of this species.
"Go on, Trelane."
Look at it.
It's over.
Your power is blanked out.
You're finished.
You've earned my wrath.
Go back.
"Go back to your ship, all of you, and prepare."
"You're all dead men-- you especially, Captain."
Trelane?
"Everyone, we're getting out of here, and now."
This is the captain.
Commence beaming up-- maximum speed.
Set course for Colony Beta 6.
I want to say that it's all A's fault but I'm the one who gave your mom that ticket.
I don't like knowing what I'm capable of.
"Yeah, but you didn't go through with it."
Okay?
That's the difference.
"It was a silent auction, and a private book-signing and coffee with the author."
"I liked his early work, that book about the teacher in Newark."
Do you want coffee with Leonard Addams and an autographed book?
Count me in.
What was the name of the Newark book?
Loose Leaf.
"That was good, wasn't it?"
"Well, why don't you come with us, Ella?"
How many people can you bring?
- As...
As many as I want.
"- Come with us, Ella."
"All right, I will."
"You know, Aria might be right about this."
Toby does have every reason to give us a hard time.
"I suppose, but that's just not the feeling that I got from talking to him."
- Do you know what I mean?
"- Yeah, I do."
- Hey.
- Hey.
What is with you and the Artful Dodger?
- Who?
- Caleb.
Thought the thing at the meet was a one-off.
- It was.
- We just saw you talking to him.
You gave him something that looked like a wet mitt.
What a god damn waste.
I want Lanagan Pike in the back of my car.
As soon as you can.
They're going to kill me!
"- Take it easy, Mr. Pike..."
- Are you kidding?
"Hanging a protest sign off a coal plant smokestack,"
I got thumped so bad I couldn't see out of this eye for 3 days.
- Just breathe.
"- Look at what he did to you, and you're a doctor!"
Stay still.
"I told her I was coming down, she came after me anyway."
"She didn't know what she was doing, how to walk up there."
We both fell right through the floor.
She shouldn't have been there.
You were trespassing.
"She was doing her job, too."
"OK, bend your knee."
It was an accident.
"I'm going to keep you here for a few hours to monitor you, check for toxicity in your blood."
OK?
OK.
Dr. Young to the NICU.
Dr. Young to the NICU.
We need to start questioning him.
And I need to be sure he's medically clear before I release him.
Excuse me.
What's happening with the jackass?
- Excuse me?
- The kid who caused all this.
He's OK.
"I mean, he's not, but his injuries are."
"Hey, is somebody down there?"
I didn't see you sign in.
Hey?
Is this somebody in here?
You're beautiful.
You already have me in bed.
You can stop.
"No, please continue."
It's a hell of a show.
Marcus?
Get dressed.
We're leaving.
"Wow, no!"
Wait.
"You don't wait, you don't listen to him!"
You get up and you get dressed now or I will kill you before you take another breath.
"You were here to close a deal, not to whore yourself out to a degenerate Pure Blood."
"Wouldn't you rather just, cut the insults and rip my throat out."
"Oh that's right you can't, because I am a Pure Blood."
And what are you?
You're just... infected.
Which is all you'll ever be.
"Doing our biddings, serving our will."
Yeah.
Vampires like you it's... nothing but pieces of meat.
They got a reprieve.
Thank you of reminding me of that.
Chase?
Chase?
It's getting dark.
It's time to go.
Where?
- That's a pretty good call.
"- That's nice, yeah."
Hey.
Here's a little bit of everything.
Let your education begin.
This place is perfect.
"Seriously, it's totally safe."
"Ryan, how perfect is this place, right?"
"Seriously, what else could you need?"
Anyone bring any food?
Um...food.
Guess we're going on a mission.
Faster!
"Go, Ryan!"
Whoo!
"Well, call me if someone meeting that description comes in."
Thank you.
Nothing at the hospitals.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Not if he's smart.
I think Seth knows where he is.
Are you accusing him of lying?
That'll be really good for your relationship.
Let the police handle this.
"Oh, I wish you hadn't called the police."
They don't have the resources or the manpower.
Ryan'll just slip through the cracks.
"Sandy, how many of these cases have you seen?"
Or passed across your desk.
What is it about this kid?
I thought I could help him... make a difference.
I was this kid.
He's found the error.
The Doctor must reprogram block 4 of the dimensioning routine.
Those numbers are the ones that have to be changed.
"-If I show this to him, will he know what to do?"
-Yes.
Leave it to me.
Adric.
-The Master's out here somewhere.
-I came here to find the Master.
-No.
-I must know what's happened to my father.
-This could be very dangerous.
-I'm coming with you.
"""The cheese board is the world,"
"""and the pieces the phenomena of the universe,"" as my old friend Huxley used to say."
Cheese board?
Chess board.
"""And the opponent makes no allowances for mistakes,"
"""nor makes the smallest concession to ignorance."""
I'm an ignorant old Doctor.
And I've made a mistake.
There's only one direction help can come from now.
I'll just have to sit here and wait.
"Ah, yes!"
Something along those lines.
The mark of the Master.
He must have added his own voice to the numbers and corrupted the Doctor's code.
But he's still here somewhere.
-I saw him.
He's been following us.
-The Master?
I think so.
"Thanks, Mike."
"Well, plus some of your other outstanding attributes."
Please.
Please!
Tell Miss Mancuso to talk to me.
This is Mike.
I'll be right down.
Two guys throwing' at Bella Petto.
"Look, man, read the sign."
"Read the freakin' sign, all right."
"Look, I am here."
"Get up, read the sign because-"
What is the problem?
That douche bag took a chair I reserved.
I left my magazine and sunblock on the table.
Only thing that reserves a chair is a towel.
"You don't know jack, pal."
"Sir, there are plenty of other lounges available."
"Okay, I get it."
"Uh, first of all, give it another 30 minutes."
There'll be 10 more just like her out here.
Trust me on this.
Looks like your brother from another mother beat you to it.
"So what you gonna do, hmm?"
"Relax, sit back and enjoy the Bella Petto experience."
"Believe me, there is nothing more important than asset management."
"And I mean that, really."
"Listen, why don't you- Why don't you call me?"
Okay?
Thanks.
All right.
You setting up shop here?
I knew it was wrong.
I thought someone would find them and mend them.
[Edith sobbing]
I didn't think I was being a traitor.
I was just so scared.
What will happen to me?
Will they hang me?
Will I go to prison?
No.
Don't have a case to answer.
You're free to go.
"Well, thank you."
It's ok.
"You're not going to forget David, are you?"
No.
"'Cause he was right, wasn't he?"
Yeah.
[Birds chirping]
"You should understand, Stanley, that you could go to prison."
But I haven't done anything.
"Yes, you have."
"You've lied to me, a police officer, and obstructed the course of justice."
"No, I didn't."
"You told me you hadn't touched anything when you went into your father's room, which isn't true, is it?"
You took your father's suicide note.
No.
There was pen and paper up there on the desk.
"And when I visited him in hospital, he was as surprised as I was that the note hadn't been found."
What did you do with it?
I destroyed it.
Why?
To...
What?
You said you saw twenty Ree.
Yeah?
What you talking about?
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.
You said you saw twenty Ree by the creek.
"Well, yeah, twenty, a dozen, it don't matter."
I wasn't gonna hang around counting fucking feathers.
As a matter of fact what was you doing down by the creek all by yourself?
I'd already brought up plenty of water.
Hey!
"Answer me, Fitzgerald."
I asked you a question.
Don't question me on account of you feel guilty.
Answer me or I'll blow your head off.
"You got a short-term memory, boy."
Your ass would be floating around the Missouri right now if it wasn't for me.
You want to ask questions?
What you want to ask?
"If you want to know, ask it."
Hmm?
You want to know why you left
"Mr. Glass back there for dead, huh?"
Or why you left your little boyfriend running around?
You want to know if he's still alive?
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't a man yet.
It's 'cause you was scared shitless.
You're scared now.
The Ree.
What of them?
- I want him dead and disintegrated!
"- Roger, General."
We continue the search.
We need an evacuation group.
Ishmael is almost frozen.
You must leave here immediately.
General?
Can you hear me?
Send an evacuation group.
I repeat:
Send an evacuation group.
"Will we stay here all night, or what?"
An electromagnetic storm is coming.
"If we wait, we'll lose Ash."
"If we move now, we still have a chance."
"I can do it, Commander!"
"Kix, stay with Ishmael, until the storm is over."
I'm not a fucking nanny!
"""What were Trajan's orders?"""
- Ash's going to die.
Then I'll take care of that.
"I was born to hunt, Commander."
The collection team arrives in the morning.
All you have to do is stay warm until then.
"Can you do that for me, Spartan?"
"I can do it, Commander."
"Stay strong, brother."
See you upstairs.
"What is it, Kix?"
Where's the fucking bitch with thick balls now ?
!
"I have your breath hanging right here, Hatta."
Thank you so much!
- Mom really did that?
"- Oh, she did!"
Wow!
I did not see that coming.
What about you?
- Are you OK?
"- Oh, I couldn't be better!"
Even with the town not getting behind the mosque
- Like we thought they would?
- I'll bring them around.
"And you getting arrested for that whole non-bomb thing, plus Fred Tupper trashing you on the radio?"
- I couldn't believe that!
"- Look, remember when I came"
- To Mercy five years ago?
- Uh-huh.
"Those exact same things happened to me, and look how that turned out."
- It turned out pretty well.
- I think we're right on course.

[ knock!
knock!
] What's going on?
Charles called.
My cell battery died.
I'm waiting for him to call back.
Have you been waiting here all weekend?
- Yes!
"- Oh, Ann!"
Why does he have to live in Ottawa?
Why does he have to be engaged to somebody else?
Why is he such a stupid jerk?
You are so good.
Wow.
Thank you.
We really don't even have any notes.
I think you just became my favorite network.
Just a few tone questions.
O-kay.
We're a little concerned that the characters all seem a bit too... angry.
Oh...
"Well, it... it's called ""angry men,"" so..."
"No, I know, and we love it."
Mm.
Shouldn't we maybe wait till the new guy starts and see what he thinks?
I think we want to make sure he's seeing the best possible version of this.
Maybe this is the best possible version.
It's not.
I'm gonna kill somebody.
Phew.
Thought that was just happening in my head.
Excuse me a moment.
"Okay, stop!"
Stop!
"I know you have jobs to do, but so do we, and it's just..."
it's... it's impossible!
Seriously!
Enough!
How many fucking bookshelves does this guy need?
!
It's true.
I heard he can't even read.
No one told us you were coming in today.
I'd have prepared a more embarrassing way to meet you.
Any physical details that may help to identify him?
There's nothing.
He's completely perfect.
"Freddie, now that you're here, I've been thinking..."
Yes?
"If Roland's parents were looking for him, surely they would have informed the Constabulary."
Maybe so.
Perhaps... they don't care.
You're having second thoughts.
You asked if I wanted to know the truth... perhaps not knowing is the best course.
You wouldn't be the first of my clients to change their mind.
No father could be better than William.
He loves the boy.
He truly is his son.
"And you, Julia?"
I can't bear the thought of not having Roland.
Well then it's settled.
"He couldn't have better parents, you must never question that."
(Julia sighs.)
- I'm gonna take this way!
"- Come on, over here!"
- I've got nothing!
- Help me!
Nothing that way!
Look.
Over there!
It won't get away this time!
"- Everyone, stay close."
- It's over here!
Come on!
Keep up with them!
Go!
It's over.
"Oh, and, Nina, it's not me, it's you."
Ladies ofthe Hub... why do we try to act like we have no needs?
I have needs.
"For instance, I need a date for Saturday night."
Any takers?
"You, blondie."
"You there, with the glasses."
What about the redhead trying to cover her face?
"12,378, here I come."
Hey.
So I went to see Jake Bradley-
You mean- [Imitating Eric] Jake Bradley?
Yes.
To see if he wanted to hang out.
And you know what Mr. Cool Guy was doing?
Just hanging out in his basement with his friends... and they were watching The Six Million Dollar Man.
It was eerie.
Was there a skinny guy dating this really hot chick... who's way out of his league?
"You know, there was."
Wait.
Does this mean we're not gettin' a fat kid to play with?
"No, man."
We don't need anyone else.
You know what?
We've only got two months until graduation... and we can't waste a second of that.
Forman's right.
"Let's seize the day, man."
"Hey, weren't we supposed to seize something, man?"
You know what the Six Million Dollar Man should have?
A bionic nose.
You could smell everything!
I know that crowd.
Watch out or they'll get him into trouble.
You understand?
"Tomorrow evening, you say?"
Is Biberkopf really coming with us?
Of course.
Why not?
"One bale of cheviot, 75.29."
"One half bale of worsted, 75.64."
"One bale of cheviot, 75.66."
- How many bales are missing in total?
- Just a moment.
"My wife said just yesterday, ""No one can get through that door!"""
So they came through the roof!
- The very best English cloth!
These men clearly have no sense of patriotism!
The very best English cloth!
The very best English cloth.
"I certainly hope so, or I'm conning myself."
That tickles!
No nonsense!
I'll send for my old things later.
"Mieze, come and be amazed."
What do you think?
- Very smart!
Clothes make the man.
Now it's your turn.
No!
Don't be so silly!
Business is good.
We can afford decent clothes now.
Right?
...including Lora del Rio and other towns.
The situation is becoming very serious.
Similar incidents are taking place as they had in recent years in the Andalusian countryside.
Damn!
Are you okay?
These are Joaquin Varela's blood test results.
Quini.
His blood type doesn't match the one we're looking for.
I remind you this is a democracy.
"Next time you want to arrest someone, you ask me first."
This country isn't what it was.
The harvest is soon and people are nervous.
Please don't waste any more time.
Good day.
You're not going to school today?
I'm sick.
My stomach hurts.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
I went to a movie.
With who?
- With some friends.
- What friends?
"One moment, I'll be right back."
Who were you with yesterday at the hunting lodge?
"Who was the man in the hat, Marina?"
What man?
Aren't you a little hot in that sweater?
I'm sick.
How did you hurt yourself?
- What?
- Your wrist.
My watch gives me a rash.
Let me ask you one last time.
Let us go.
You can call me an obsessed hypocrite if you want... but I can't let you go.
You never loved me back.
I thought things would get better if I held onto your empty glances... but you never thought of me the way I cherished you.
"If I can't have your heart, then I'll keep your body at least."
You'll stay with me until I die.
(Downtown Magok)
How did it go?
I found a merchant who trades with Puyo.
He's at the tavern.
Let's go.
I work for Sosuhno.
You want to buy seal fur?
Yes.
You're late.
Mr. Oh from Haengin bought all we have.
I heard the pirates smuggle seal fur.
I'll pay you handsomely.
"Let me meet Buwiyum, the pirate captain."
You can't meet him unless he approaches you.
Help me.
That's him.
Step back!
I want to see your captain.
I don't want to fight.
Lead us to him.
Mr. Yu in Magok sent them.
They have a letter from him too.
I'm Buwiyum.
You want to trade with me?
"I'm disguised as a merchant... but I'm Jumong, Commander of the Damul Army."
You get used to me.
You funny.
- You...
- In here.
What's the status of your crew-served weapons?
"We have two 81 s, four 60s twelve .30 calibers, three on each wall."
One 4-deuce.
"Besides crew-served, we have six M-79's."
No .50 calibers?
I'd give an R and R in Bangkok for the smell of a .50.
KIRBY:
"You hear that, sergeant?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Know where there are any .50's?
MULDOON:
"No, sir."
Neither do I. You better tell Sergeant Petersen.
I almost forgot.
Captain MacDaniel needs corrugated tin.
- It's been hard to come by lately.
- Sergeant.
"Yes, sir."
I know.
"""Tell Petersen."
"Tell the scrounger."""
Petersen!
What happens if Charlie hits this camp before you get it completed?
"If he does, and he's too strong for us to handle we have 3 LZs within 4 clicks to send 10 choppers each to reinforce us."
One is by that shale cliff you saw on your way in.
And the second is to the west of here near a deserted Montagnard village where some of these people used to live.
"The third is to the north, near an old bridge."
What if Charlie overruns the camp?
I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor.
It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop.
Hang on.
It's the wildebeest.
Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
W-What the hell did she say?
"She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what."
That bitch!
How do you want to handle it?
"Um, okay."
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
Got it.
Is it going to be in 3-D?
What?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna say 3-D.
That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.
You're kidding.
3-D?
That's what I hear.
Then the studio must have real faith in it.
Wonder why she didn't tell me.
Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
No...
Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?
"Well, it's not as much ""surprised"" as you know..."
uh... the other thing.
What other thing?
"Well, if you... uh..."
I don't... oh...
What's the word I'm looking for?
"He mix ed them, sir, but he got busy, so I brought them up."
"- Ramos gin fizz, madam."
- Thank you.
"Our very best, sir."
Mr. Martinelli's private stock.
- Louis!
"- Coming, sir."
I got it all right.
Something in the drink.
Also my private stock.
That's all.
To the beauties of St. Louis.
- You disapprove of the toast?
- l'm thinking of a better one.
"If I didn't drink, he might fall in on Louis for tipping me off."
And if I did-
"- But I kept remembering, Louis had been Johnny's friend."
Maybe his only friend.
I needed Louis alive.
We await your pleasure.
Geronimo!
"A lovely word, with the added charm f or me of being meaningless."
- A St. Louis expression?
- No.
Just one I picked up.
"Your expressions have the Baretto flavour, almost medieval."
Baroque.
"Mobster, as applied to me, is more colourf ul than accurate."
I've always had a preference f or legitimate enterprises.
With a gambling racket on the side.
"Scarcely a racket, Mr. Murdock."
"More f or my own amusement than f or profit, as you know."
- Come on.
"No,it's disgusting."
It was like a little freckle a month ago and then it just ran amuck.
"All right,now you're gonna have to show me."
"Seriously,you might be,like,sick."
Let us help.
I'm very sensitive about this.
Do not make fun.
I'm serious.
Do not make fun.
Okay.
"Promis promise,promise."
Oh!
No!
"Oh,my God,you guys suck."
"So,if I had one of those on my back, you wouldn't lust after me anymore?"
"Um... no,no,I wouldn't."
"Seriously,you should never show that to a potential soul mate ex."
Maybe it's a sign.
You should see if psychic chick can read it.
"Hey,what's up,guys?"
"Hey,dude."
- Morning.
"- Hey,man."
Late night?
What are you doing here?
It's a beautiful day.
I thought I'd take Rufus for a hike.
I don't like that you just show up here whenever.
Yeah?
Like how you just show up at my house?
Those were extenuating circumstances.
You might as well.
I'll be grand.
I can always slip downstairs.
"I was so embarrassed, I was scarlet."
"I'm not joking yous, I was burnin'!"
How are yous?
- Go on.
"- How are you, Sharon?"
He was holding the eclair in his hand like this.
"The place was full, and he says..."
"""Why did you rob the cream out of me eclair?"""
"- The head on him, Jesus!"
- And did you rob it?
"Well, I paid for the bleedin' thing."
Why shouldn't I have?
I told him to cop on.
"""I seen ya,"" he says, ""with your finger."""
So I gave him the finger.
I'd shag the elephant man before I'd let him near me again.
The prick.
"Here, young fella!"
"Give us three vodkas, two cokes, and a glass of Furstenberg."
"Have you got that now, chicken?"
"Hey, handsome, give us a packet of crisps as well, will ya?"
And do you have any nuts?
Whoo!
You dirty bitch!
I'm only messing with you.
He's a nice little bum on him... like two eggs in a hankie.
"He'll be nice-looking when he's older, won't he?"
Are you going to break it off with him anyway?
Yeah.
I still do.
Huge.
"So, are you gonna have sex with her?"
I was her mentor.
She was my mentee.
I am not going to take advantage of a girl that looks up to me.
"Dude, God has dropped a porn star into your lap, okay?"
Don't disappoint Him.
He can be a jealous and a vengeful God.
Mmm.
Amen.
I am officially done with this conversation.
"Aaron, I am with you."
"And right now, you can still influence her life in a totally positive way."
And it would be creepy and weird if you slept with her.
"Hey, hey, hey."
We all agree that it would be creepy and weird.
That's why we want him to do it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Come on.
It happened on a doctors without borders trip in Indonesia.
A lovely woman was a few weeks from giving birth to a child with a heart defect.
I operated on the baby in utero.
"Fortunately, both the mother and child survived and are now thriving."
I found out later she named the baby after me.
Very flattering.
"Aw, little Dr. Lonsdale."
"Um, Everett, actually."
I know.
That was a joke.
Oh.
Okay.
"Bring some milk, I ran out."
"Okay, see you later."
Bye.
Good evening and welcome to The Bombay.
The next song is one of my favourites.
I hope you like it.
And now a song dedicated to La Loba.
"No thanks, I'm done for today."
"The only thing we have left is our spirit and our wives, right?"
She applies the real ten Commandments:
"Give me, I need it, you have to, pay look, I like it, I want it, buy it and fuck you."
You can't do anything about it.
And when we get home tired and ask:
How did it go?
"How was your day, honey?"
They are always grouchy and reply:
Do you really want to know?
No man!
It's hard to deal with them every day.
But that's how it is.
We have to learn to live with it.
"Don't you think so, Miss?"
"Hey, Beto!"
"- Hello, beautiful!"
I don't get it.
You live in this mansion and we have to fuck in this room.
Did you like my stockings?
"Yes, they're terrific."
"I have really nice legs, right?"
Legs are not important.
- Why not?
In here!
"Joey's in trouble, Ray."
"Ray, let's just break the fuckin' thing down."
Got it.
God.
"His father is serving a life sentence for murder, murdering an ex-girlfriend... with a sawed-off shotgun back in 1988."
The New York Times is quoting one friend of Royster as saying... that the guy had an IQ of 160.
I need your help.
They're tryin' to kill me.
- Who?
"- ""Who""?"
My friends tried to kill me.
Ray Donlan tried to kill me.
Shit!
Holy shit!
Speak of the devil!
"Freddy, forget it."
I don't get this.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why'd they get Superboy off the bridge... to bring him back here and kill him?
Ray had a plan... and it got very fucked up.
"You awake, Freddy?"
I feel like shit.
Fuckin' allergies are killin' me.
Hey.
"In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life... through our Lord, Jesus Christ... we commend to Almighty God our brother Joseph... and we commit his body to the ground."
The Lord bless him and keep him.
The Lord make His face to shine upon him... and be gracious unto him.
The Lord lift up His countenance upon him... and give him peace.
"Honor Guard, retreat."
"- No, I don't know."
- What the hell are you doing?
- I know.
- We should shootthe son of a bitch.
- [Horse Whinnies] - [Nervous Chuckle]
"I wanna fight justas dirty, Edgar."
His women.
Use his women.
Any information you have.
The son ofa bitch is not going to steal from me again.
Can you back me up on this?
Can I count on your support?
I look at itfrom the pointof viewthat the system can only take so much abuse.
- Itadjusts itself eventually.
- Yeah.
Butthere are times there are savage outbursts.
"The late Dr. King, forexample."
- Amoral hypocrite.
- [Snorting]
"Screwing women like a degenerate tomcat, stirring up the blacks, preaching against oursystem."
Sometimes the system comes very close to cracking.
We've already had one radical in the White House.
I don't believe itwould survive another.
[Whinnying]
"Well, like I said, uh, Edgar..."
You ask... if you can count on my support.
As long as I can count on yours.
"[Nixon] Yeah, the old queen did it on purpose."
"No, he wasn't protecting me."
He was just putting me on notice.
- [Haldeman] That he knew Roselli?
- No.
Hoover knew a lotof gangsters.
Johnny Roselli wasn't justany gangster.
Have a spot?
Rather.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir."
"Too watery, sir."
"Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach."
- We'll be the judge of that.
"- Wait, sir."
There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
"There it is, sir."
It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him?
Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame?
There he goes.
"Come along, Mitchell."
I think we'll forget the punch.
"Tommy, you know we have Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition."
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
"I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service."
"One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment."
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much.
It's just as well.
"- The army's no place for sentiment, I says."
"All right, well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you."
"Well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you!"
So let's try.
I want to try!
"Well, let's try!"
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry that it took all of that.
But you know what?
"Now I can honestly say, with love in my heart' that you are my man."
Could you ever love me again?
"Well, you're my wife."
And I never stopped loving you.
Now come here and give me a kiss.
This next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"And that time that you got sick, you didn't want me to see you, so you locked me out of the bathroom?"
No!
Then I passed out!
Yeah.
And you called the ambulance.
"Well, because, before you passed out, it sounded like you were dying in there."
You know?
I thought I was dying.
I did.
"Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do?"
I should have broken down the door.
You've been a really good friend.
You have been the best friend in the world to me.
"Now don't stop dancing, y'all!"
Party ain't over!
It's far from over!
"Silence, please!"
-l was playing with Joe Horton.
-Horton;
He's a bad boy.
-You wanna look out for him.
"-l did, in one hand, especially."
"We both drew one, only I drew first."
Got him right in the belly.
You mean you shot him;
Not conclusively.
He's gonna live.
What happened;
How'd the fight start;
"I had a few too many, I guess."
I don't remember.
I never saw you that drunk.
Then I'm a liar.
-How long were you in jail;
-Not long.
"Who got you out, McCurtin;"
Hasn't he always before;
Yeah.
When are you going to tell me how the fight started;
"I told you, I was drunk."
"Now, if you'd rather I hadn't come home, I'll get out."
"I'd rather you didn't lie, Brock."
"Come on, let's go into town and face whatever's got to be faced."
Not me. I'm going to Denver.
You're going to Salt Fork and get this thing over with.
Then you're coming back here.
And it might be a good idea if you spent a little more time here in the future.
You can't run me anymore.
I wasn't cut out for living your way and I'm sick of trying.
Everything is going absolutely according to plan.
Right now the most important thing to me
Is sending jake home.
It's mind-boggling.
"Like, I just wanna punch the guy."
"I can't do it, so I'm gonna punch him mentally"
"And just beat down his spirits, drive him crazy."
He's gonna go nuts.
"He's gonna try to talk his way out of everything,"
And there's nothing he can do.
"Peace, bro."
Jake's a joke.
I'll be damned if I lose the next competition to him.
(woman) good night.
♪
(chris) guys!
Let's go!
(jake) right now my position's a little unique.
"You know, I came in with a huge target on my back."
I'm...
Pretty confident that
Everybody's starting to get to know me.
There's a pretty good consensus.
"You know, ""jake is-- wow, he's really not a jerk"
"That he wawaportrayed as."""
I'm in a pretty good spot.
Yeah!
(chris) come join me for today's challenge.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
But winning the competition is still very important.
"Very, very important."
There is a bottle in the fridge.
There's sippy cups.
Don't give her any juice though.
Only water.
"And, well, you know where the diapers are, so... well, you really should use those organic disposable kinds because they're better for the environment."
"Well, here you go!"
"Thank you, honey."
You are the best friend ever.
"- Well, thank you."
- For what?
For believing in me.
"You coulda hired a babysitter, but you didn't."
"Oh, it's okay, bubba."
Bye-bye!
Okay.
What does she like to play with?
"Uh, mostly Tupperware."
I can't believe you did that.
- What?
Adam?
- Yeah.
"I gave him the ticket as payment to look at the contract, which he did, by the way."
"Okay, you know what?"
Whatever.
"I was hoping that you guys would get back together, and just put everybody out of your misery."
"- But I'm guessing it didn't work, huh?"
- Just drop it.
"We need to focus on this interview, and I swear to God, if I hear the name ""Adam"" one more time, I'm gonna--"
Hey.
I'm Adam.
"What, are you the... doughnut guy?"
"No, dude."
Stop trying your Yiddish out on me.
You sound like a Shakespearean actor from a Savannah pogrom.
- But do you know him?
- Sure.
But the trial was 2 years ago.
I was long gone from the department.
"Hello, Larry."
Good to see you.
This is Deputy Mayor Calhoun.
The first deputy mayor to set foot on this floor.
"We had a commissioner once, but it was the wrong floor."
- May I have a seat?
"- Please, sit."
"Abe, you're already at home here."
I think I know why you're here.
I've logged 12 calls already.
Tino Zapatti.
- You want to know why I handled it.
- Exactly.
Because sometimes we get overloaded.
And you take on the extras?
The extra-specials.
Such as Zapatti family members?
Something like that.
- Mr. Deputy Mayor...
"- ""Kevin""'s good enough."
Any case that comes here that looks like it's connected I take a special interest in.
- Why's that?
- To avoid making mistakes.
You sure made one on this.
"I blew one, okay?"
I don't mind admitting it.
"- This way, Mrs Dashwood."
- My dear Colonel.
- I found your mother starting out herself.
She had determined to come on her own account.
- Mama!
"- Oh, my love!"
My love!
Thank God.
"Oh, thank the dear Lord who has given you back to me."
"Oh, I was so frightened."
"I had no news, you see."
I expected you home and you had not come.
Let me look at you.
"Oh, how thin you are."
"Well, I shall feed you up."
You will have all your favourite things.
"I am very thirsty, Mama."
We must let her rest.
She is still very weak.
"You go to sleep now, Marianne."
Mama is with you.
She will not go away.
"You need sleep too, my dear."
I can see that.
This is my place now.
"Colonel, I cannot find words to acknowledge what we owe to you, or to thank you adequately."
The glimpse I had of your sister is sufficient thanks... not that I need any.
"If ever a man deserved his heart's desire, it is you, Colonel."
"At last, we are alone."
"Oh, my dear Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness."
Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.
He told me so himself.
- Mm-hmm.
What the dog do?
Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of yours without any help at all.
- Sure!
I'll bet you he could.
"- Well, he could."
"How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner?"
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome... he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
"Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds."
It's impossible.
"Well, then it's impossible."
Let's drop it.
"Is it all right to look at him, mister?"
It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
"Come on, boss."
Let's get outta here.
"What's the matter, gentlemen?"
If I overheard correctly... the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet.
Says he's broke.
"I don't want money from you, my friend."
"If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000."
- If he can't-
- Well?
"Why, then, I'll take the dog."
No.
"Say, that sounds fair to me."
"Tonight, we bring you one of the dark pages of American history:"
the story of Benedict Arnold.
This once-respected American soldier who disgraced his uniform lived to regret it.
(turns TV off)

"Look, fellas, I..."
I'm just wearing it.
-(laughter)
-You remember when he tried to teach the natives how to play gin rummy?
He wound up with all the coconuts on that island.
-(laughter)
-Where is Bilko?
Almost time for chow.
"""Chow""-- get him."
"Yeah, how do you like that?"
-How G.I. can you get?
-Are you still in?
"Hey, fellas."
"Hey, hey, hey, look."
(laughter dies down)
"Hey, he's for real!"
"Oh, you son of a gun!"
"(laughter, indistinct chatter)"
I'll bet I'd still be a private if I was in there.
Bilko in the Army-
- I'm going to sell my defense bonds.
(laughter)
"Bilko, are any of your men as dumb as we were?"
-That would be impossible.
-(laughter)
"Well, what are we standing around for?"
I've been waiting for ten years for this.
We tesseract to theandromeda.
"All right, all right, just give me a minute first."
This is incredible.
Why are you doing this?
"Helping us, i mean."
"That's what people do, isn't it?"
Help each other.
"Yeah... people, but haven't you heard?"
"I'm not exactly ""people."""
I feel my pulse racing.
And the warmth of your lips... how can i feel all that and not be human?
You're so much more than you know.
I love you for that.
There's one thing i don't get-
Why your employer
Would tell you so much about his plan.
It's complicated.
"You wanted to see theandromeda,"
But are you willing to pay the price?
Harper!
Why are you doing this?
Because i love you.
This is not love.
"Well, not you exactly."
I love your power.
"Tell me,"
Are you afraid of death?
You shouldn't be.
"I can't kill you, unless you believe i can."
"You're machine,"
Nothing organic in you.
"It's you who should kill me, like a machine must."
What the hell was I thinking?
You said it we're not gonna get caught.
Hi!
"Lizzi, what happened?"
We were worried.
I've been running around like a crazy person.
Think you gave me the wrong address.
There's no book store on 3rd.
Oh my God!
Did I say 3rd?
I meant 13th.
I feel terrible.
"No, it's alright!"
I found a store that gave me a 40% book discount.
I'm so excited right now.
Did you tell the girls?
They loved the idea.
I'm gonna go in a girls' room and freshen up and we've to start planning.
ASAP cause I wanna be involved in every single detail.
Partez!
You're having a party?
Sure you've got enough liquor there?
"You know, smuggling liquor for a party."
"It isn't just a violation for you, it's gonna reflect poorly on all of us."
"Then it's a good think we only got diet soft drinks, Evian."
You gotta be kidding me.
You got him working for you now?
You with them?
"They're my friends, that's all."
"Actually, he's thinking 'bout pledging with us."
Just realized the Kappa Taus are a whole lot more fun than the Omega Chis.
Is that true?
"Turn them over, George."
I wanna see them.
Come on.
I'm calling.
- What do you got?
- Gary Fogel never had cancer!
"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you for me when in fact, it was an unauthorised hi."
- You didn't say hi?
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what you came to tell me?
- Correct.
- You never said hi.
- Correct.
"- You still like me, don't you?"
- Correct.
What?
"Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day."
How can you say that I still like you when I didn't even say hi to you?
Coming down to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Jake...
The doctors thought he had cancer but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
"- So, what was wrong with him?"
- Nothing.
He's been lying to me for two months?
- That's right.
- What kind of person is this?
"There's one other person who might do something like this, and that's you."
- Well...
- I don't even think you could do it.
"No, I could do it."
"- Yeah, I guess you could."
- Come on.
I don't know you.
Mujik.
Let go of my arm before I get mad!
I heard that you have a friend in the detention facility at the
Royal Repository.
I must see Chun-su.
Can you get me in?
You're the one who put him there and now you want to get him out?
I'm begging you.
What are you going to do?
Break him out of jail?
I'll find a way.
"And if that's the only way, I will break him out."
Now that's a joke!
What do you think you're doing?
!
"If I can just talk to him, I know I can find some kind of evidence."
Get up from there?
A nobleman can't kneel before a peasant!
A friend's life is at stake.
I don't care about status.
I have no excuse for what I have done to Chun-su.
But you have to know this.
Chun-su is a friend I treasure more than my own life.
Stop right there?
"Hey brothers, what are you still doing here?"
"Mujik, is that you?"
What are you doing here?
I told you to fetch the brothers!
Do you know this boy?
"Oh, he's a new kid that just joined the gang."
What are you waiting for?
"WHEN A REPORTER ASKED HIM WHAT OPPONENTS COULD EXPECT FROM HIM,"
"ROBINSON REPLIED, ""THEY BETTER BE ROUGH ON ME,"
"BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE ROUGH ON THEM."""
RACHEL ROBINSON:
"JACK SAID, ""WE'VE GOT THIS THING GOING."
"""THE TEAM IS WINNING."
I'M DOING WELL.
"I'M GONNA SPEAK OUT."""
AND SO HE BEGAN TO CHALLENGE OTHER BALLPLAYERS
AND CHALLENGE UMPIRES WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE.
MAN AS JACKIE:
SPORTSWRITERS SEEMED TO COME DIRECTLY TO ME
WHENEVER THERE WAS A HINT OF A STORY.
THEY KNEW I WOULD SAY WHAT I THOUGHT.
THEY KNEW I WOULDN'T BACK DOWN IF I GOT INTO TROUBLE...
THAT I WOULDN'T WHINE THAT I WAS MISQUOTED.
"IT FELT GOOD TO BREATHE FREELY, TO SPEAK OUT WHEN I WANTED TO."
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, ROBINSON PLAYED BETTER THAN HE EVER HAD."
"BY MID-JULY, HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE IN HITS, BATTING AVERAGE,"
"STOLEN BASES, AND RUNS BATTED IN."
"WHEN ALL THE VOTES WERE TALLIED FOR THE 1949 ALL-STAR GAME,"
ONLY RED SOX OUTFIELDER TED WILLIAMS HAD RECEIVED MORE.
CARL ERSKINE:
"YOU KNOW, KIDS, THEY'RE HONEST."
"AND WHEN A KID CAME BACK 3 TIMES FOR MY AUTOGRAPH, I SAID,"
"""WHY WOULD YOU WANT THREE OF MINE?"""
"WELL, HE WAS HONEST."
"HE SAID, ""ACTUALLY I WANT SIX."""
"""IF I CAN GET SIX OF YOURS,"""
"""I COULD TRADE IT FOR ONE OF JACKIE ROBINSON'S."""
NARRATOR:
What's he waiting for?
I'll get it out of him.
Crates are loaded up.
I want a lead and a chase car.
Don't do the scenic route.
Let's get it behind ssr walls a.S.A.P.
"I'll wake up the eggheads,"
Start figuring out what the hell this stuff is.
"And, boys, drive carefully."
I don't want to be the one who sunk manhattan.
"I don't envy you, buddy."
My pal jack... he's got a special gift for interrogations.
"He's real convincing, gets guys to spill their guts."
That's not an expression.
We've had to use a mop.
I need a doc.
My arm's broke.
What's the point of fixing you up if we're just gonna break you again?
Was that dame working for you?
What dame?
The one on the boat...
"English broad, solid right hook."
English?
Yeah.
What's she look like?
"♪ let's jam that boogie, babe ♪"
"Ohh, damn it!"
What the...?
♪ why don't you come back ♪
♪ let's jam that boogie ♪
W-watch where you're going.
You're lucky this is a company car.
Who better than a former Time Master?
And any of you who'd like to join me.
I should stay and help you with Darhk.
And get justice for Laurel.
"That's happening, honey, with or with out you."
I promise.
"Uh, listen, I-I can't pretend to understand this time travel thing, but it sounds important."
So is family.
I wasn't going to go the first time.
Then Laurel convinced me.
And now I'm going to do this for her.
"Well, she'd be proud of you."
How do you know?
'Cause I am.
What German lone word literally means
"- ""the desire to hike""?"
- Wanderlust.
A word which could also be used to describe that look in your eye.
- What look in my eye?
"- Martin, we've been married for 28 years, and you're still a lousy liar."
Now about this new sabbatical.
I decided to decline the invitation.
But...
I think you should.
I-I think...
I think it's important...
"Clarissa, I'm not leaving you."
That's final.
"- Hey, Gray."
- What are you...
"I'm so glad that you could make it, Jax."
What are you up to?
-I have nothing to tell!
-Impossible!
"At least something real, at most a dream."
Do you think it is nothing?
The dreams are part of the reality.
Is this the only reality?
-Then it will let me go?
I see.
"Then you, wherever you want."
"Well, I dreamt, that I went to a shoeshop with my boyfriend."
"Is this the story, which I interpreted?"
"Yes of course, you deserve it."
It was the most wonderful shoeshop ever seen.
There was no customer.
"Only a few women dummies, a shoeshine black... and the owner of the business."
I would like some red boots!
"Suddenly I realised, that the owner was you."
Your final fulfilment.
As you would have expected.
Run along.
"-Yes, master."
"But, Lucia!"
What are you doing?
Don't you you see?
I am with Tinto Brass.
"Aye, director!"
Ripped by elcodigo and retranslated
We need this completely filled.
We don't have time to haggle over price.
Understood.
Captain.
- I know I promised.
- Won't you come for my birthday?
"Pramod, I'm really sorry..."
- I have to go to class.
Bye.
"- No, wait."
"So, here you are."
Please excuse the formalities.
You only need to read the last three pages.
Did Helene invite you to my birthday?
- No.
- You can't rely on her.
- Then I better do it.
- Thanks.
There are a few things I don't understand.
Can we look at it?
What does that mean?
It means that you and Anna have 100% control of the fund.
"No, not that."
Here it is.
The part where it says I have to live in Denmark.
"Yes, we haven't talked about that yet."
To build an organization like that you have to live in Denmark.
- Can't I just come to board meetings?
"- No, it's a demand on my behalf."
Why should I do that?
Because I said it's a demand on my behalf.
You mean that?
I can't spend half a year here and half a year there?
Have I said anything I don't mean?
"Maybe everyone else kisses your ass, but I won't."
- What do you mean?
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
"We were scared and miserable, and we took it out on each other."
Us and everybody else.
That's high school.
"But you suffer through that, and it gets better."
I'm just sorry you didn't get a chance to see that.
"You over, Barry."
Nothing is gonna get better for me.
Not ever.
Dean!
Find the hair!
"Hey, buddy, this isn't what it looks like"
Little help?
He's giving you the full cowgirl.
"Five more minutes, Jerry."
"Amanda, hey!"
"Gettysburg Address, 1863, right?"
History test next period.
We're studying.
"Come on, baby."
She means nothing to me.
Don't be mad.
"I'm not mad, Dean."
"I thought maybe... underneath your whole ""I could give a crap,"" bad-boy thing, that there was something more going on."
"I mean, like the way you are with your brother."
But I was wrong.
"And you spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool, but it's just an act."
We both know that you're just a sad... lonely little kid.
That will allow me to climb up into the air ducts.
(whistles)
"Holt, this is where you come in."
You're gonna create a diversion.
Can I do Church Lady?
Don't care.
I'm gonna do Church Lady.
Isn't that special?
(organ music plays)
"That will allow me to drop into Lester's laundry cart, and then we'll all rendezvous at the nurses' desk, where we'll sign out because this is a voluntary facility, and we can leave any time we want."
"See you later, Mr. Brown."
Or not.
Totally up to you.
"Sorry, Cleve-bro."
We're staying.
What?
We're making some real progress.
Okay.
(panting)
(ship's horn blares)
Dirty-Rassen-frassenpercalumin chabadamin-back-rackalacka!
"Ooh, a Jet Ski!"
Spring break!
Cleve gone wild!
Ahh!
(ship's horn blares)
"Aw, hell!"
I keep waking up tied to a bed.
I feel like Hugh Jackman's cabaña boy.
You should be so lucky.
You were pulled from the water by Somali pirates.
"And they kill everyone who isn't of use to them,"
- Shut up.
How do you like the new you?
Did I interrupt the procedure?
Can Henry not talk yet?
"- No, he can't."
No.
"- Don't look at me like that, Henry."
"Your girlfriend here... might have rebuilt you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with."
"And I mean really, really raw materials."
- What's your name?
- Timothy.
"Nice to meet you, Timothy."
Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here?
Yeah.
Would you please be so kind to describe them to better Henry's understanding of how good he looks now?
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the... below the elbow and the...
the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a football-sized dent...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"Um, the skull was dented in and there was this, um... his eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shred to pieces."
Just about right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little strenuous.
Stay close.
Henry!
Hurry up!
Close it.
"Henry, come on!"
"Henry, try to keep up!"
There's some pain involved.
"You know, this is the only place around here with bars on its windows."
- I wonder what Doug was so worried about.
"- Come on, baby."
There better be somethin' good in here.
There we go.
Got it.
Looks like he didn't leave much.
"- Well, I've worked with less."
- Check for bills.
Bunch of junk mail.
Magazines.
Hello.
Hey.
Here's a quiz.
Tells you how to pick your mate based on what you eat.
"Okay, Mike."
What's your favorite meat?
"- Pleasure reading later, Sam."
"- Oh, you're no fun."
"Mike, two guys with guns coming fast."
They must have been watching the house.
They got the back covered.
Nothin'.
Just because there are no windows or doors... doesn't mean there are no exits.
The thing to look for is the air-conditioner unit.
That's where the wall is weakest.
"Also, people watch doors."
They don't watch air conditioners.
"Ooh, the damsel in distress."
She said it was an emergency.
What do you want me to do?
Thanks... for the bus.
Nicolas.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
I have to go.
We have to go back to Brussels.
"Come on in, Victoria."
Then she is the mayor of this beautiful village.
"Well, I have no other choice, so I'm the mayor."
It is a big responsibility because I love these people and I want them.
I want...
That they are happy.
It is difficult to understand what happiness is.
It is not conditional.
You can not say:
"""I will be happy if I have this, if..."""
"When you say 'if', it means you're not happy."
"That's why we're all happy here, hear 'yes'."
"I heard from somebody here in this beautiful country,"
She did the stuntman.
"Yes, I was the stuntman coordinator, but it's just one of my professions."
I'm black karate belt and I have the fourth level of Shotokan.
I have...
I'm a diving instructor.
I was the first Bulgarian to cross the Swim Channel.
Do you know where the Channel is?
Between England and France.
But  I...
I've never seen a mayor and bare feet.
"Occasionally, when I go to the capital,"
I put my sandals or shoes.
Maybe buy some time.
Willhebe abletogetthisextremely volatile situation under control.
Muriel Walker's here.
"Thousands are gathering, leaving candles and ﬂowers.."
at the doors of the U. S..
We've got movement.
We've got movement at the Federal Reserve.
"Stenz, do you hear me?"
Confirming they're loading the money.
Let's wrap this up.
"Stenz, we're wasting our time here."
"Walker, are you sure they're down here?"
Did I spend 15 goddamn years running this place or did you?
!
This guy is losing it.
What do we care if he gets the president?
We made a deal.
Cale was right.
This is not about ransom.
Walker has cancer.
His doctors gave him less than three months.
He has a golfballsized tumor on his frontal lobe.
Jesus Christ.
I think he's on a suicide mission.
You ready?
Yes.
What do you think you're doing?
If anybody can talk him down..
"it's her, trust me."
A little birdie told me you're finally moving the money.
Martin?
"I had to tell them about the tumor, Martin."
Gil's been down at the nursing home with your mother.
"Obviously, they're gonna call you, but I said...."
"You know, I felt I should be the one to...."
I suppose we can't say we haven't been expecting it.
For some time now she'd been gradually winding down.
-And at least it was peaceful.
"-Oh, no."
I just wish we could've been there.
"So, what were her last words?"
Do you remember?
Her last words were....
"Actually, yes, I do."
She said the two of you deserved each other.
Ah.
"Anyway, I'll just, you know."
I'm just really sorry.
"So, what sort of fruit does he like on his cereal?"
Bananas?
He's not keen.
I know what you mean.
"There's always those long stringy bits down the side, aren't there, you can't bring yourself to eat."
Why is that?
"Oh, no."
God.
-What's happening?
-It's those two guys from school.
Gary and Jamie.
Oh?
They look nice.
"Yeah, except watch how they completely ignore me because I'm about as interesting to them as a fly."
Bet they don't even say hello.
"-Hey, Julie, you all right?"
You told me I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"Ah, so you managed to do your own thing, huh?"
"Yeah, uh, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.
Responsibilities and--
"But still, um you took an interest in me when no one else did."
That matters.
So thank you.
"Well, you know, the only thing that really matters is, uh that you're happy."
"Are you happy, Sam?"
[ENGLISH SDH]
"When I told dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45."
What was he supposed to do?
I was 9 years old.
The weapon training and melting the silver into bullets?
"Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
"Lock the doors and windows, close the shades."
And most important
Watch out for Sammy.
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
It's called being a good son.
"Dad's gonna be here, right?"
He'll be here.
Promise.
"- Where is he, anyway?"
- On business.
- And that's why you ran away.
- I was just going to college.
"Come, give me a hand."
Come on.
That's it...
Excuse me so much!
I'm just a little dizzy.
Maybe I haven't eaten sufficiently today.
- Thanks a lot...
"- Don't be in such a hurry, Miss."
First I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.
So that you'll feel better.
"Bruno, bring the girl to the apartment."
I'll come by soon.
"- Many thanks, I really am fine again..."
- He's my brother!
Allow me:
Mechelke.
"Now just come here, Miss..."
And then nothing more.
No news and no address.
"Just poste restante, the main post office, Berlin."
My letters are there now.
He didn't even pick them up.
What do you want to do now?
Turn to the refugee centre?
Should I give the refugee centre a sob story?
That he promised me...faithfully his mother's ring.
He promised to return for me but then let me down till I cleared off to the West.
Away with it!
And I don't even know his address.
I won't be kicked to the curb like that!
I've had enough of compassion and humilation at home.
But I'll find him soon and settle the score.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
(pencil SHARPENER WHlRRlNG)
The principal wanted to see me?
No.
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. Stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
(WHlRRlNG)
No.
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Or for the person controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
I am a seagull.
"Since I'm here way, way and I think very intensely."
And I grow the forces of my soul.
"I know now, and understand, Kosta, that in our profession an actress or a writer,"
I'essenziale is not the glory or the splendor of which I dreamed.
But the main thing is knowing how to resist.
Learning to carry your cross and keep the faith.
Here the object is full.
So now we define the details.
"It is shocking, eh?"
They are conspiracy or what?
Our girlfriends ...
There is a doll ...
here is the head and feet here.
I put it upside down.
"Close your eyes, close your eyes ..."
Fa 'see where his head.
And the walk?
And the sex?
"It's good, eh?"
Good one.
Give me a pleasure.
You can ask that illuminate the scene?
Desire a child ...
"Turn all the lights, quick!"
- Do as he says.
- Do not want to mica again?
You do not.
"You played, you have enjoyed."
I do what you had to ...
And you loved me?
I would bite.
That's all I know.
And you have mules.
And you're not kicking them hard enough.
It's ridiculous.
It throws the rest of us in a tailspin whenever
The first shot involves Toxie.
Toxie's late.
It takes two hours to get his makeup on.
"And even if he's supposed to be there at 5:00,"
"And all of a sudden it's 6:30 or something and there's no Toxie,"
"It's, like, major."
Because then we know the first I can't get off until like 8:30.
INTERVIEWER:
"Lloyd, do you have a word of the morning?"
"Uh, a lot of very, very bad production."
No actors.
INTERVIEWER:
"What are you doing, Sandy?"
I'm making this guy a Toxie double.
INTERVIEWER:
Why?
"Because supposedly Dave-- unfortunately,"
His costume takes a while to prepare.
"So they want to get this shot done, so--"
One just wasn't enough.
They're using--
INTERVIEWER:
Are you gonna be able to tell
That's a different guy?
We have a great editor.
[Laughs]
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I tested it on myself.
"From what I can tell,"
Larson had no knowledge of the murder.
Keep looking.
♪
What if I'm losing it again?
What happened today?
I got an up-close look into the mind of a man
"I was convinced was a murderer, but all the evidence says otherwise."
Every explanation comes up in his favor.
Maybe he's innocent.
Maybe.
I've always been good at spotting guilt.
Haven't always been good at spotting innocence.
"Hey, hey."
You're not that guy.
"You're home with me, with your daughter."
You're in a good place.
But you don't know what goes on in that room.
You don't know what goes on in here.
"Julian, you can't do this job alone."
Find someone you can trust.
[machinery puttering]
- We're almost out of power.
"- All right, we need to move."
"Can you, please, clear the room?"
I'm gonna try to jump-start it.
[flatlines] [high-pitch whirring]
Clear.
Clear.
- You're killing him.
- Have to reset it manually.
Whatever.
Something the matter?
"The minute the two of us are alone, you can't wait to get out of here."
That's not true.
"The other day, we had that long conversation about stamps."
"About how the price always goes up, but never goes down."
- Did you wanna revisit that?
- You know what I'm talking about.
You and Christine got divorced and it's kind of like we did too.
"But, whatever."
I guess I'm the jerk for even caring.
- Are you serious?
"- No, forget I said anything."
I guess I'm the ass for bringing it up.
"Okay, okay."
You know what?
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I guess things have changed.
"Um, look, I've got errands, and then later I'm taking Ritchie to the batting cages."
You're welcome to come along if you want.
- We could spend the day together?
"- Yeah, it'll be fun."
"We'll grab burgers, go to the batting cages, anything you want."
"- That'll be great, Dad."
- Did you just...?
- No.
- Good.
[SIGHS]
CHRISTINE:
"Good morning, ladies."
Or should I say bonjour and...
The Major's found your money.
- No!
N-nn...
- What?
"Thank you so much, Major."
There you are.
I told you it would turn up.
"What is it, Basil?"
"Bit of luck, eh, Fawlty?"
It's £10 short.
"Oh, dear."
It's not!
£10 short?
"Oh, my God!"
"Don't worry, we'll have a whip round!"
"Basil, stop!"
That's where Ted Bryar's been living for the last nine years.
- His doctor?
- I say probably.
"She's unmarried, lives in El Paso, she's written several books and papers, mainly published in medical circles."
She's a popular lecturer.
"She's scheduled to speak several symposiums this year, and tonight in Dallas."
That's it.
That's all I got.
"Garcia is in the process of looking deeper, but I don't really see how this lineup is going to be much of a help to us, Gideon."
"Well, let's just hope none of them makes the situation worse."
"They're messing with you out there, Ted."
Trying to weaken you.
You need resolve.
Hey.
Why aren't they helping us?
We're going to get through this just fine.
Real life with the boring bits cut out.
Don't confuse facts with truth and for Christ sake... don't get either way in the story.
Now...we know how it starts...
Johnnie in France.
We know how it ends.
Home safe.
"And we know somewhere in between, we have..."
"dog, Dunkirk, engine failure and uncle's death."
"Now all we have to do is, fill-in-the-gaps."
I'm buyin' it.
Down payment.
Call it a trend.
"Call it what you like, but I'm not leaving London."
Hmmp...
Sorry we're not...
"Buckley, Parfitt."
Meeting now.
Ministry of War Transport.
Seems they had wind of your proposed filming scenario.
"Apparently they are concerned that,"
"""The Nancy Starling"" engine failure may cost moral sapping doubt on the quality of British engineering."
It was her.
Bloody Ministry spy!
What if it's not the engine?
What if it's the propeller?
"It gets snarled up with blotsun and Uncle Frank goes in the water to free it, gets shot and the girls have to finish the job."
And the fire.
Not the girls.
Not the girls?
Aaa...
Johnnie!
Johnnie?
"Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max."
There's two things the Slop won't do.
Alert the proper authorities of my flight pattern or step foot in Texas.
I'll drop you here.
"When I agreed to follow you cross-country to chase your ex-boyfriend,"
"I didn't realize I'd be thrown out of a plane, scavenging for my belongings and fighting a snake for my favorite pants."
"You can have them, sir!"
Ah!
Found my toothbrush.
"Max, that's disgusting."
"Oh, you're right."
This isn't mine.
"Ah, found a purse..."
Under this syringe.
Anything in there?
"Uh... nah, pretty tapped out, which is too bad 'cause you could use a two-day heroin nap."
I meant my bag.
Look what else survived!
Ah-ha!
My Popchips!
Only to meet an unfortunate end.
"Oh, no, Max, my wallet."
"Mm, yeah, I know."
You've aged a lot since that license picture.
"No, it's gone."
All of our cash and our credit cards were in there.
What are we gonna do?
I'm freaking out.
"Nah, nah, nah, calm down."
Caroline will get us out of this.
"Oh, wait."
You're Caroline.
- about Carlos Mejia?
- Anything I told you.
"- No, I have not."
- You sure?
Yes.
"- Bryan, I'd never..."
"- Well, they found out somehow."
- Who found out?
Found out what?
- Mexican Government.
"- Okay, wait."
Slow down...
- Probably the cartel too.
And you think that's because I said something to someone?
- Not even accidentally?
- Like at the hair salon or something?
That's not what I meant.
I thought we understood each other.
Respected...
No.
"Actually, I thought it was quite a bit more than just that."
I am the one person who understands what you've gone through at the hands of this monster Mejia.
And now you're accusing me of betraying you?
- Not betraying me.
"- So what, then?"
"I had to ask, Asha, and I know you know why,"
- so don't act like you don't...
- I'm not confused.
I'm upset.
You immediately suspect me.
People at your job knew too.
They keep secrets for a living.
- you should be sobbing about the fact that she took off with all your money.
- [sobbing]
- all right.
get ahold of yourself!
it's christmas eve!
look.
"you put in some long hours here, and you do some overtime -- heck, by the time you're 40..."
- [cries]
- there you are!
[giggles] of course i'll marry you.
why don't you just say so?
- really?
- yeah.
what the heck else am i gonna do?
- do you love me?
"- if wink wasn't here, i'd show you just how much."
- don't mind me.
"- but since he is, i'm just gonna take the minivan and i'm gonna get used to it."
"i'll see you back at home, okay?"
"- wink, please don't make him work too late."
"- [mockingly] no, i won't."
- [chuckles]
- see?
she does love me!
- get off!
"for as bright as you are, you are as dumb as a bag of hammers -- dumb, dumb, dumb!"
- oh.
[sighs] dang it.
- [echoing] you looking for this?
"- oh, not now."
really?
[sighs]
Fine.
Here.
Take it.
- Keep the bell.
- What?
"I thought we were gonna handle this like adults, Jess."
"Yeah, well, I thought you were the love of my life, so..."
"Suck it, Mr. Crabs."
- You hit that guy.
- Whatevs.
You know.
You know what?
Maybe I didn't have respect for you before because if this is what respecting you feels like this is definitely not how I felt.
So you recognize.
"Represent, what?"
"Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest."
I've been messing with you.
It's just that I wanted my old room back.
"You know, you're right."
I've been away a long time and things have changed here.
So I guess I kind of gotta get used to that.
You can keep the big room.
"See, now you're just deep dogging me, man."
I'm not scared of your mind games.
"I'm taking the small room, Winston."
"- Schmidt, that's not what I mean..."
- No.
Listen to what I mean.
You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home.
I'm not falling for it.
"What do you take me for, some kind of idiot?"
Yes.
I'm sort of a workaholic.
So you're a pro.
You can put it that way.
"Now, let me examine you first."
Sickness in the heart means that the left ventricular heart has a problem.
"To put it into exact terms, going down from the collarbone, passing by the diaphragm, meeting the third nerve cell."
Here.
How do you feel?
I feel hot all over.
I knew it.
- What happened?
"- It's gotten hard, you see."
Am I going to die?
You won't.
Then what shall I do?
I should set it free.
It'll get serious if you hold it in.
Wait!
Since when have humans become so scary?
You said it would be a piece of cake.
"You're the one who always said that, not me."
So then?
Are you trying to point fingers now?
How dare you speak to me that way?
Damn it!
I got you!
Damn it!
How dare you strangle your father...
Dad!
- Dad?
- What?
"Sir, I didn't intend on this."
Oh!
He just... he just kicked me!
"Annie, tell him off."
"Oh, that's Mitchell."
- I'd better warn him about this.
Can...
"- Yeah, yeah."
Just put the Hoover round and maybe just dust a little.
Thanks.
Mitchell?
Is that another ghost?
"It's bloody Hogwarts, this place."
"No, Mitchell is a vampire, actually."
Vamp...
"At last, someone normal."
I'd better go and...
Are you gonna do both beds?
- Do both beds.
Do...
- OK.
"Just in case, you know, in the night, me and you just want to... in the night, just sort of do that."
- You've got to be joking.
- It won't be for long.
"It's just until his dad recovers, and then he'll be out of here."
I will make sure of it.
"We just thought, with you having gone through it..."
Me going through it is exactly why I can't have him in the house.
The kid's still feeding.
Staying clean from meat is a day-by-day...
"No, no, a minute-by-minute thing."
"How am I gonna manage if he's giving it, ""Oh, let's go out on the razz,"
"""find some women, drink them dry""?"
Crap!
I thank the Lord that I've been blessed...
Let's thank the mums.
"Hello, mums."
"Here to keep an eye on Dad, are you?"
"Richie, it's not going very well, is it?"
...than my share of ha... ppiness
Ha ha ha.
"Thank you, one and all."
"Happy hunting and if you can't be good, be careful."
I've done that one.
Er...
"And if you're in a car, please drive safely."
"Thank you and good night, one and all."
I love you all.
"Well, tough crowd but I think I got the measure of 'em."
Ooh.
They probably couldn't afford flowers.
This will do for our dinner party.
"Richie, I've got some rather bad news for you."
- You're under arrest.
- That's the bad news.
I wasn't that bad.
I stumbled on a couple of punch lines.
It was our alibi-it collapsed.
"Mr Forsyth, he followed us here."
It's pris for us.
"- Are you coming quietly, sir?"
"- No, it's just the way I walk."
Note that down.
I want all to know I was still cracking woofers.
Woofers or ancient double entendre that everybody else gave up in the playground?
"How many people have you killed, rescuing me?"
I don't know.
Less than I'll save if I get that information.
That doesn't make it right.
- It's still playing God.
"- That's a doctor's prerogative, is it?"
- Don't preach to me.
- No.
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
I've spent my whole life trying to prove that I was different from him.
Only to realise that I'm just the same.
I've killed people.
I killed my own fiancé.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
It was my fault that we were abducted.
He hated the camps.
"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."
Because I wanted to save that boy's mother but I didn't save her.
She died anyway.
"So they'd blame you too, would they?"
"They're dead now, and you'll never forgive yourself because neither would they?"
They deserved to live.
"Clare, have you ever saved anyone that didn't?"
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
Fuck!
Fuck me!
Fuck!
Can somebody get this fuck off me?
MAN:
Where's Hendricks?
"♬  Oh, we were destined  ♬"
"♬  Oh, underdone  ♬"
"That girl, Eul, doesn't know her place."
How could she linger around you?
"Noona, from your perspective,"
I think I'm better than Eul.
Of course!
"Even though you're still unemployed, you can't give yourself to Eul."
Eul is in a lot of debt and doesn't even have a great personality.
She only mooches off of you.
So that's why I'm telling you this.
"Oppa, there is a woman I know who cooks well, has enough money, and doesn't fall too far behind in terms of looks."
"I... am not good enough, Noona."
"Because I am not good enough,"
I cannot accept Eul.
"Ah, Eul left her cellphone."
So clumsy...
That oppa is not normal either.
Eul!
No Eul!
What is this?
Yes.
This is No Eul's phone.
Hello?
Why are you picking up No Eul's phone?
"We were together, and Eul left her phone behind."
- Who is the person picking up the phone?
- What about you?
Who are you?
- I asked first.
"- When you ask for someone else's identity,"
I believe you should reveal your identity first.
Right now.
And I also want authorization to question Corrales and Quini together.
I heard you were a troublemaker.
What did you say?
All you have is literature.
Your partner saw a man in a hat.
Nothing more.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
I wear a hat too.
Does that make me a suspect too?
I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.
Now please leave.
I'll call you when I hear back.
You're protecting him.
What?
You don't know how things work around here.
"Yes, I do."
Just like everywhere else.
You're going to be a father.
You should be more careful about what you do.
Get out.
Why didn't you say anything?
Whose side are you on?
Are you with them too?
I just want to solve this case.
I don't want to be taken off it.
You're just like the rest of them.
You'd rather things were like before.
I know what you used to do.
I know about Vallecas.
You don't know anything.
"No, I work on Saturdays."
Big shoplifting day.
I catch dozens of punks like you.
Thas wonderful.
If everyone were that dedicated...
Bet you're an ace at Blackjack...
How'd you guess?
I know you inside out.
Lots of guys like you around.
They stick to you like flies these days.
Looking for trouble?
"No, just like a pair of jeans..."
Is my brother's birthday.
"Down there, on the right just past the television sets."
I'll frisk you later.
"Hey, look!"
Must be your first paycheck!
Not a chance.
I met this rich lady...
She's hooked on me!
Ursula's very generous.
Congratulations!
You don't need that badge your hair tonic gives you away!
You're lucky I'm in a good mood today.
Me too.
Life is beautiful.
I'd almost like to touch you...
"If I touch you, you'll know it!"
You feel up the salesgirls?
I'll throw you out on your ass.
Understand!
Little punk.
"We have, like, 8000 undocumented workers here daily."
"Okay, and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think..."
You automatically assume that they're mine.
"Oh, yeah."
"Honey, I'm not lying to you."
I think you are really freaking out.
This whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.
Just say no.
Get it out.
Gonna take a shower.
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga would fix me up with such a good kisser?
"- Back at you, sister."
I can't wait to kiss you again.
But we're kissing right now.
"I know, next time."
The second-date kiss is way more intimate.
"Well, listen I'm leaving tomorrow, so I'll be out of touch for a little bit."
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.
Okay.
[PHONE RINGING]
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah?
"Hey, sorry to bug you again."
Quick question.
"Excuse me one minute, babe."
Sorry.
What's going on?
- No fear or favour.
How about Mr. Crawford?
How does he take it?
- I've not had occasion...
- Not had occasion?
"He's made of good stuff, he must be spirited."
"Therefore, he must get into mischief."
"If he gets into mischief, he must be punished."
The captain insisted on no favouritism.
- You heard him say that.
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, be watchful, Mr. Kilpatrick."
- And diligent.
"- Yes, sir."
"And if you ever need my advice, don't hesitate to ask."
"Thank you, sir."
"- Don't lie, son."
"- I didn't do it, sir."
- Are those your initials?
"- Yes, but I just made a scratch."
- You could hardly see it.
- You did?
- You lied to me.
- I thought...
- It's so marked-up anyway.
- It shouldn't be.
There's a rule against defacing the table.
I've been lenient with you.
Too lenient.
- Anything to say?
- Only that someone else must have...
- I have nothing to say.
From the programme.
Tubby Baker.
"Very pleased to meet you, Pauline."
"Oh, don't be."
I'm only a lowly secretary.
Enid is the PA.
She has the desk planner and the intercom.
And what have I got?
Some Handy Andies and a plastic lemon.
We're on lemon and hot water.
"I told you, we're slimming."
How's it going?
This week?
Not great.
"I can have 7,000 calories a week, and, so far, I've had 3,800 and it's only Tuesday, but, hey, two days on potted meat and water biscuits."
That could level me back off.
"Speaking of chips, where are you taking her?"
You're not escorting her to lunch?
Of course!
"Pauline, it's Tuesday!"
I was thinking of having a sandwich.
Can I interest you in sitting on a bench?
In the square?
No.
I don't have time.
"No, fair enough."
"Well, I won't clog up the mighty wheels of commerce."
"Very pleased to have met you, Pauline."
"Enid's got a lot more leeway than me calorie-wise, she can have a jacket potato and a yoghurt."
I don't think I've ever had a yoghurt.
"No, you don't look like you've ever had one."
No offence.
"Cool, right?"
Are you for real?
Are you blind?
Or am I invisible?
There's no money here!
"If that bothers you, you're welcome to leave."
"Calm down, Franz."
I see how you are  and I like what I see.
"Here, Jesus and the merchants."
It's all in there.
- Only no one understands it anymore.
- It's a culturally useless artifact.
It's quite heavy.
Shall I quickly summarize it?
"I can read, thank you."
"Jesus enters the temple, it's filled with merchants..."
"He flips the tables over, and says:"
"My house shall be a place of worship, but you've turned it into death pit."
"Okay, you want to attract more guests, right?"
"Generally, yes."
But who would want to come here?
Let me worry about that for now.
Do you two need a priest now or what?
Who's that?
- That is a man in a monkey mask.
I thought so.
What does he want?
Hannes is a television producer.
"Yes, but what is he doing here?"
He's interested in this place.
Is he also interested in us?
"- Yes, he is."
"You know, actually, we have a lot in common."
Okay. I'll bite.
"Well, we both went through tough divorces."
-Sherri was married?
-You didn't know that?
-lt never came up.
-What did come up?
Never mind.
Scratch that.
Where should I take her to dinner?
Where did you go so I can take her somewhere else?
Last thing you want is for her to start comparing you to me.
Exactly.
Wait.
What do you mean?
You want your relationship to stand on its own.
-Right.
"-Well, that's what I meant."
Okay. I thought you were trying to rub my nose in the fact that you dated her.
"Alan, I would never do that."
"Well, thank you."
I don't have to.
You think you could kill a guy with a piece of toast?
No.
"Because if you did, you could eat the toast."
The police would never find the weapon. it's the perfect crime.
And part of a nutritious breakfast.
"Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later."
Where you going?
-Out for dinner.
-With who?
"Jake, look, I think-- l think you're old enough to know that your dad's not just a dad."
-Don't follow me.
-Gyung Joon...!
-Leave me alone!
-Gyung Joon...
-Why?
Are you scared that your precious Yoon Jae is going to be seen as a ruthless jerk?
Are you going to cry again?
"Then before I do more, leave me alone and go."
"I'm sure you're upset after hearing those words, so how can I go and leave you alone?"
Don't pretend that you're worried.
You're just like my uncle!
"You're worried that I'll always stay in this precious Yoon Jae's body, right?"
"Just like my uncle, you don't like me and are burdened by me, so why are you pretending to worry?"
Gyung Joon...
"I told you the more things are like this, the more I'll do things my way."
Da Ran!
Yoon Jae...
Did you just shove my sister?
Why are you yelling at my sister?
Choong Sik...
It isn't something for you to get involved in.
Just go.
He was being weird to you this morning at school.
I came to see what was going on...
And it's a good thing that I came.
Yoon Jae...
I really didn't take you to be like this.
But you're weird...
Yoon Jae!
(Mae-Hyung = Brother-in-law)
I'm not your brother-in-law!
If it's your husband...
What does that mean?
"Okay, we need to get you to a doctor right now and get that thing checked out."
I'm not going to a doctor for a cat scratch.
"Listen, your life could be in danger."
That's ridiculous.
- Juliette.
- I'm tired of this.
You don't understand what she is.
What?
"What is she, Nick?"
"She's an attractive, successful woman."
You saved her life once.
I don't know what it is you have against her now.
What is it that you're not telling me?
Do you have some kind of relationship with her?
- No.
- Then what is it?
"She's a witch, okay?"
"You're going to need to try a little harder, Nick."
What?
Does she ride a broom?
Because I distinctly remember her getting into a BMW.
"You don't know what's going on here, Juliette."
Then isn't it about time you tell me?
You're going to the doctor.
"I told you, I'm not going to a doctor till you tell me why you're acting so crazy."
[Sighs]
Okay.
You want the truth?
"Yeah, the truth would be nice."
Get your coat.
"I told you, I'm not going to a doctor."
It's right under your nose.
Vadim.
You let me know the second you find these guys.
Copy that.
Somebody please shut the alarm off!
I got work to do.
Motts.
Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.
I'll show you the way.
We got some important people waiting for us.
"- Are you okay, sir?"
- I'm all right.
- Is your family in the complex?
- They won't be here till tonight.
"- Your daughter, where's your daughter?"
- I couldn't find her.
I hope she got out.
Do you know these men?
"That old son of a bitch, his name is Martin Walker."
He's the head of my Secret Service.
You should have a conversation about how serious you take your protection.
- I didn't pick him.
- Why is he doing this?
I think it has something to do with his son Kevin.
- Why?
What happened?
- He was a Marine.
He got killed last year in this covert action that I ordered.
Would he do this for a personal vendetta?
He said he wanted you alive.
There's gotta be a bigger play.
We gotta get out of this elevator shaft.
--It's been called off --Who called off?
--Sorokin called me.
"--Why didn't you say anything, moron?"
But our main thing was to liquidate this military cell in a touristy spot
--So you haven't knocked down a single garage?
--Sure did.
Gaeva's.
--Did it early in the morning --Gaeva's was permanent and not subject to demolition
"You're mistaken, Pavel Ivanovich."
It was subject to it
I started off with hers.
You need to see me?
"--He's not in, Pavel Ivanovich --I know, I know, he's at the clinic"
"When he shows up, connect us"
Why are you following me?
I thought I explained it all in detail
What else?
"Natalya, where's Galkina."
Don't you hear me?
--I'm talking to you --I'm on my break
--Everyone has a right to take a rest --We know all about that right
--Run out and find her --Let those with bonus pay run around
"--In that case, you're fired --Oh, I'm so scared"
"Comrade, are you Vasin?"
Vasin speaking.
Hello.
Hello?
"Comrade, so then you are Vasin?"
I am Vasin
--Hello --Semenov?
--Yeah
--Is your bulldozer gone?
How is cardoza?
"We're here about the enright case, captain."
Bel air mansion.
Tony enright sliced up his wife.
Cardoza was the primary.
"And he had him nailed, till trial."
How do you go from top cop to zero?
That's all on the record.
"I need to see that file, captain."
"Gentlemen, that ship sailed."
Double jeopardy's a bitch.
Not for cardoza.
"Well, that doesn't sound like my business."
It is now.
"All right, gentlemen, follow me."
All this evidence says one thing:
Enright murdered his wife brutally.
The guy's a known wife abuser.
Jesse found blood from the dead wife
On enright's clothes and in his car.
And then he walks.
Yeah.
Right in front of all the cameras.
Real black mark for the department.
Ah.
You know what?
Here.
Here's the thing that brought jesse down.
Homicide found a key piece of evidence
At the murder scene.
"A cuff link was thought to belong to another suspect,"
Not enright.
OK.
Mads?
"Right, all the doors and windows are locked."
No-one's getting in or out tonight.
You two OK?
"Yeah, Mrs S. Just a bit twitchy."
"Maddy, if there's something going on you better tell us now,"
- 'cause we're running out of time.
- Why are we doing this?
Didn't we have a great time last full moon?
Didn't we?
"- Well, yeah, but..."
- We were a proper wolf pack.
"Free, alive."
I had the best experience of my life.
And it was because I was sharing it with you guys.
"It was a special night, Maddy."
One of the best.
So why are we pretending like it never happened?
Because we're never going to do it again.
- Why not?
"- You know why not, Maddy."
It's not safe for us out there.
- We were fine!
"- No, we were lucky!"
What if we'd got shot at by a farmer?
or
Or we'd walked into a poacher's trap?
All it takes is one person to spot us and then they'll hunt us down.
- It's what they do.
"- Tell me you understand that, Maddy."
I do.
Maybe you got a point there.
- You bet I do.
I'll make it easy for you.
I'll be your personal secretary.
You just talk.
Tell me what you want to say.
[Clears Throat]
My dearest...
precious flower.
Ah.
Thank you for your note of October 16.
It's always good to hear from you.
- And how are things in Toledo?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
This-This is not an application for a car loan.
It's a love letter.
Let your heart do the talking.
"Laverne... this is gonna knock you off your pins, but I still love you."
Ah.
All right.
"When I give my heart away, it's for good."
- Good.
- I even loved you when you were married to me... and you cheated on me with Morty.
"After all, you're only human."
I was thousands of miles away... and there was Morty with his thriving sausage business to bring home the bacon.
"- Boy, that must have hurt."
- You bet your life it did.
"- I have feelings, you know."
- Don't tell me.
Tell Laverne.
"Laverne, I have feelings, you know."
I don't need you and Gus to use my heartstrings for a taffy pull.
"And of all the cars to borrow, why mine?"
You just don't like him.
Never gave me a chance.
"This shouldn't be about Danny, it should be about us."
I care about you.
"I'm sorry, A.J."
Hi.
Did you come to take my mother to lunch?
"You screwed with me, son."
"I don't really care about that, but you're keeping your mother from being happy and you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
She is happy.
And I'm happy.
It's not our job to make you happy.
Still driving a rental car?
"I'll be sending you the bill, boy."
I never consented to marriage with Mustafa.
I accepted him only as a friend of my father's.
A friend of the family.
I spent many hours in their home.
Fatimah was always happy to see me.
I was a child.
You brought me presents.
"I thought of you as a favourite uncle, not a suitor."
Fatimah's father came to me with her promise.
- He signed the kitab.
- He signed the kitab.
I did not.
- Her father was her wali.
- Objection.
Fatimah was 18.
Her father was no longer entitled to serve as her wali without her consent.
"Thank you, Miss MacKenzie."
Why am I in this filthy place eating cup noodles?
"Listen, Kim, I'm not the kind of person who belongs here."
Where do you belong?
Know the Grand Pacific?
It's a 5 star hotel.
No?
I worked there.
"Some stuff happened and I'm sort of stuck here for now, but I'll be back working at a first class hotel."
"This is just a temporary gig, you understand?"
Temporary?
Know that word?
"Room 307, vacating."
"They're out, can you go clean?"
Do it in 20 minutes.
Boss scolds me for slow turnaround.
Where's Suzuki San?
I saw her by the fire escape.
"No, no, no!"
"Don't go return it, we can just pay the late fee."
"You can't go out, okay?"
"Please, just don't."
I'll go return it later.
Okay?
"No, you can't!"
You hear?
What're you doing out here?
I need you on cleaning duty.
Right.
Here for bill collection.
What did Suzuki San do before coming here?
People who end up at places like this have their reasons.
It'd be wise to not pry too much.
- Welcome home
- Thanks
What's that?
It was just lying there
Someone was in a hurry
"I'm home, baby"
Can you hear?
Hirano san...
Are you all right?
Do you have a stomach ache?
Hirano san...
"Hey, Sada san!"
Look what a mess you made of the floor The landlord won't like this
"Get a doctor, quick!"
"He'll be fine, it's the third time And the sword's bamboo"
He tries to commit hara-kiri every spring
- Pathetic
- Ouch
"Listen, if you do this on the floor, it's a pain in the neck to clean up"
"If you must, do it on the dirt floor"
Answer me
"Oh, no!"
"Soza san, please get Dr. Onodera"

I get goose bumps talking about these things.
"6'2"", waist-length hair."

He only mentioned one:

The question is how do we screw Ellsberg so bad... it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
The other issue is how do we stop these leaks once and for all?

We gotta stop these leaks at any cost.

"Some people aren't comfortable about using their real names, you know."
And not just the thieves.
There's a lot of shame in falling on hard times.
Sad.

He said he'd be back for all of it.
"Mind, they all say that, like, but I believed him."
And all this is definitely his?
No question in my mind.
"Well, if he's half-inched anything, I'll be back to see you."
Drink it.
Just let me..
-Are you all set here?
"Its all fit, how can it not be?"
Lights on!
"ScoundreI, you betrayed your own family!"
I embraced you with love and you strangled my trust!
This is what you gave me in return of my favours?
Beware if you show me your inauspicious face again.
Get out!
Go away from here!
Sir..
I am not sad because..
..the entire village got me wrong.
I am sad because even you couldnt understand me.
I will take you leave.
What have you done!
The one whom you loved all your life..
..you threw him out of the house!
Why?
Why did you do that?
Thats because I Iove him a Iot.
And the one who you love the most..
..you have to sometimes act of hating them..
..fortheir own benefit.
"You tell me, what do we have left with us?"
"Poverty, pain, sorrow and troubles."
I didnt want him to lead such a life with us.
He is so young.
He has a whole life in front of him.
How could I see his life getting ruined in our sorrows?
His life was getting ruined!
"Yours, you mean."
My interests are those of France.
All I can be is King.

It's that too much to ask?
The Canal du Midi serves all of France.
You cannot own it any more than I can.
What's this for?
So you don't have to steal it from me.
There is one way you can retain your commercial interests:
It would require you performing a service for me.
A service?
"The historian, Thomas."
You know him well.
I know him.
Get to know him better.
"I want him to trust you, implicitly."
Why?
Because he's a spy.
Let us through!
You want some?
"Yes, I want some."
"Are you, Matilde?"
"Yes, but I'm not on duty."
I'd like to have a word with you.
"I am a friend of Madamoiselle Masson, the doctor."
A kind soul.
Whatever happened to her?
She was murdered.
"the day before she died, she came here looking for poison."
What a delightful woman she is.
Very...generous disposition.
Knows how to show her gratitude.
Only the best malt whisky.
"On the other hand, she's a woman of eccentric tastes."
Positively weird.
"Do you know what she asked me to do, Helen?"
"I couldn't begin to imagine, Siegfried."
"All right, I'll tell you."
She asked me to ask Tristan if he'd like to have supper with her.
(James) Ohh!
(Siegfried) On Saturday.
"James... you wouldn't care to hold the fort for me on Saturday, would you?"
All right.
(Laughter)
"Hey Sara, is your mother around?"
What do you mean who am I?
Don't you really recognize me?
It's not funny!
Don't laugh.
Can I talk to your mother?
Are you alone?
Do you like being alone?
Yes that's true.
We haven't been going out much lately.
But that doesn't mean I don't think of you.
"""WHAT MAX SAID"""
"Sara, you seriously didn't recognize me?"
It was a joke?
"Well, if your mother is not around, nothing."
Don't tell her I called.
At three.
"Their part-timer is away for three days, so they asked me to fill in."
What about the convenience store?
The owner said he'd take care of it.
"All right, I'm going."
Did you come from home?
No.
Then what about the car?
You said you needed to take care of someone and took the car.
Yeah.
"Oh, so you didn't want to waste gas, left it at the office and took the bus here?"
"No, Moon Kwon, I came in a taxi."
What about the car?
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?
Where's the last place you went to?
Hospital.
I don't understand you.
Who leaves their car and takes a taxi?
"You shouldn't be taking care of anyone, you're the one who needs to be in the hospital."
Is something really growing in your brain?
"I'll get it, what hospital is it?"

What should I do for my wedding?

"Charlotte, what did you do for your wedding?"
Was it like a fairy tale?
My wedding was exactly like a fairy tale.
"Um, once upon a time there was a princess with low self esteem..."
And terrible taste in men.
She went to Las Vegas and ate some magic beans.
Then she married an evil ogre named Mark.
"Mark put a baby in her, and ruined her credit."
"12 weeks later a wizard named Jeff, the divorce attorney, annulled her mistake."
The end.
OK.
"Um, I'm surprised."
But just so you guys know you're all going to be in my wedding party.
"Except for you, Charlotte."
- I'm sorry.
I just met you.
"- Oh, you know, that's fine."
"I'll just uh, I'll come to the next one."

I want to go home.
I want you in pants!
"Well, are you happy, Eric?"
"Your brother's wearing yogurt pants, and let me tell you something."
One size does not fit all.
Now can we please just go home?
"Hey, not so fast."
They got a whole schedule of events here.
What kind of events?
It's a giant yogurt cup!
"Now, why can't you just experience something new you've never seen before?"
'Cause I don't wanna?
"Look. 4:00, we have the parade of sprinkles, 6:00, we got the march of the dancing lids..."

"Uncle Kwai, no need to stand on ceremonies"
"Miss Man, how old are you?"
Twenty two
Have you got any brothers and sisters?
Four
Are they all in the Mainland?
Yes
You have great responsibilities
"Yes, come..."
"Let me tell you, she..."
"... rightoutfromunderme, and now she sashays into town..."

"-Well, this is a fine deal, Mr. Brown."
"-We can still drink here, right?"
"-Hello, boys."
-Mary.
"-Ezra, may I speak to you for a moment?"
-Of course.
I just got this wire from a certain Preston Wingo.
He owns the Cattle Baron Hotel over in Snellville.
It concerns your mother.
"Oh, Mother?"
Are you familiar with a gentleman by the name of Preston Wingo?
I know a fat little weasel called Preston Wingo.
-What about him?
"-Well, this Wingo has slandered you."
Mary just received a telegraph...
... claimingthatyouabsconded with a pair of diamond cuff links.
He's demanding you be jailed until he arrives.
Jailed?
I'm no thief.
"Yes, of course not..."
"... butunfortunately, the burden of proof is on you."
"Now, I would suggest that Mary search your bag..."
... justsoyoumightacquityourself of these ridiculous charges.
MARY:
"Sorry, Maude."
This is so tiresome.
My own son.
Looks like Mr. Wingo was wrong.
How deep?
Can you tell how deep it is?
"Okay, roger."
Two feet.
"Okay, roger."
Visibility's not that great.
It that the same down there?
He lost visibility because he's stirring it up.
Clouded up just like 10X.
We lost all visibility.
"Whenthewellgot murky, itwasmoreasense of ""not again."""
Another dive where we can't see anything.
BecauseI wasabsolutely convinced that ithadbeen a fitted stone bottom.
Up five feet!
All stop!
"DiverTonySampson has just found anotherpossibleclue in an old stone well, whichsomeresearchersbelieve to have been built bymembers of the Knights Templar."
That's a Broad Arrow!
I see something.
Do you guys not see that in there?
Show... show me...
show me what you're seeing.
Right there.
But when he comes at a different angle...
"Okay, okay, there I see it."
-Yep.
You see it now?
"-Yeah, yeah."
I see it there.
"Right here, here and there."
You got her.
"Whenitcametome, then I could see it."
"The left side of the point, ifyouwill, saw that well-defined."
I'm going to meet my friend.
Sir.
Yes.
- I'm from Chennai.
"2 days ago, a man was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari."
Yes.
How do you know him?
Actually...
Then why do you want to know about him?
"Sir, I'm from the media."
You guys want news 24/7!
Why do you torture us for that?
There is a guy called Panju.
He is dealing with this case.
Go meet him.
"Thank you, sir."
Give him the keys.
Don't drink and drive.
Got it?
"- Okay, sir."
"Sorry, sir."
- Bye.
He is a relative of the MLA.
Won't you enquire all these things in advance?
"I will be careful hereafter,Sir."
Have you caught a single proper case till now?
It doesn't make a difference either way...
It's my mistake to have become a cop.
Don't go and drag another problematic case just because I said this now.
Get a case that will bring honours to the station and me.
Bring something that brings cheers to me and the station.
"Definitely, sir."
-Grade school or high schooI--?
"-Hey, Mitch!"
-Coming!
"Gracious, what lung power."
I teach high school in AurioI.
"well, what do you teach?"
What subject?
-You guess.
"-well, I bet you teach art or music."
"well, of course, I couId be wrong."
You might teach arithmetic.
"Never arithmetic, sir."
Never arithmetic.
I don't know my multiplication tables.
Nope.
I have the misfortune of being an english instructor.
I attempt to instill a bunch of bobbysoxers and drugstore Romeos with a reverence for Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe.
"well, I bet some of them are more interested in other things."
How very right you are.
Their literary heritage is not what they treasure above all else.
But they're sweet things and in the spring it's touching to notice them making their first discovery of love as if nobody had ever known it before.
-Sorry.
"Oh, excuse me, excuse me."
-Have you finished?
"-Oh, yes."
"Yes, I have."
"-Wait, wait."
I'II turn on the radio.
Turn on the light above now.
"Oh, look."
We've made enchantment.
"-Three bullets, mustache."
I'll be damned.
"So, that's what happened."
Why did you call me?
Things are crazy at work.
Because of this case.
Remember what I told you before?
What?
How the Jap raped a woman?
What about it?
You filthy slut.
That woman.
It was her.
What the hell are you talking about?
That woman he raped- it's the same woman whose house burned down.
"She went crazy after that, and used to run around naked at night."
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.
"She was totally covered in rashes and boils,"
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.
Are you out of your mind?
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.
You worthless bastard.
It was your theory.
I was just messing with you.
Who in their right mind would believe crap like that?
"No, I think you're right."
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.
Gimme a break.
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!
What?
Tomorrow's another day.
Time to go to the bar.
-Karaoke?
"Sure, karaoke."
He comes and goes His roads nobody knows
A traveling man he is
Nice to see you normal like us.
Without the superman stuff.
"Thank you for the dark motions, Jakki."
"Next, the indisputable local tango queen:"
Marjukka!
You came like a flame that day
"Charming, intoxicating"
"You came to me, took my heart I was yours, all yours..."
Look who's here!
The mad loser.
You're sitting in my chair.
Your place is in the back.
Never knew the perils Of the burning flame
Never knew it could bum The happiness to ashes
I looked into the flame Brilliant and burning
You were my only one My universe
Always on my mind
Operation Ostrich is off the ground.
Did you take the scooter?
"-Yeah, I told him I'm moving."
Are you sure he didn't notice anything?
-He never does.
How's the virginity barometer?
No change.
Right.
You know what?
Run!
An earthquake!
No!
Look!
The ark has started to move!
What's all this shaking?
That brat is moving the ark!
I've activated Noah's global warming mode.
Ice from the North and South Pole will begin to melt.
And seawater that is warmed will cause abnormal weather conditions and swallow most of the land.
Professor?
You can't turn back now.
This is the beginning of the second flood legend.
So cockroach you're still alive!
I'll destroy it from the inside.
I'll take this ark down with that brat.
Professor!
That's it!
That bastard!
That will be enough!
Silence!
Professor!
So there you are.
I'm taking the Doc and Ms. Margaret back.
other than the door into Noah.
hurry and go!
The plate...
I won't let you go!
I gave the Professor the one chance to co-exist with God.
I'm your only enemy here.
Let's fight our way to the pits of Hell.
haven't you learned your lesson?
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.
I got to go on the lam to get away from this guy.
This ain't right.
I can't go here or there.
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.
You've known this Tommy all your life.
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
When I leave my house in the morning I look over both shoulders.
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.
I'll do it.
What could I do?
I would.
I'd like to help you out.
Tell him what we talked about.
take a piece of this joint.
It'd be good.
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
but that's the way it is.
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
10 scotches and a bag over her head.
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"No, I-it's better that I know..."
who they really are.
"Martha, I-I've never been any good... at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
"We need, like, a code of conduct for how far we're willing to go."
"Like you said, we can't just steal from normal people, right?"
You know what else?
"Bushido, the samurai code... the true warrior must hold that loyalty, courage, and honor are important above all else."
Nice.
- No old people.
- Sure.
Yeah.
No kids.
"No people who look, you know, sad."
Yeah.
No nice moms or dads... or anyone who's limping.
No babies.
What does that leave us?
"Hey, lady... next time get both hips replaced."
Assholes.
"Excuse me there, bud."
"You know, I seem to have gotten a little bit lost."
Maybe you could help me out here.
Sure.
I'm tourist information today...
where you going?
"So we are heading, um, to the east, and we need a..."
I'm trying to get on the 29 here.
"Yeah, that's where your finger's pointing..."
"- Right there, the 29."
- That's right.
But I-I can't figure out how to get to it.
See right out there where it says turn left to the 29?
That's how you get to the 29.
"Okay, that would make sense."
What?
"For the public opinion, and in agreement with his family, he was called Juve."
Why did you hide me the truth?
I had given Monsieur Havard my word that no one would know the truth.
And I kept to my word.
Why passing up for dead?
To better track Fantomas?
Exactly.
I learned that Lady Beltham had fled to England.
I knew Fantômas would join her.
So what?
I crossed the Channel: unfortunately he had just left for Canada.
And you have changed your face.
Yes.
To start again at the same level.
"Not without difficulties,"
I got introduced to this band of hoodlums that you know.
People who may work for Fantômas?
That's right:
"Cut-Nose, Gas-light, Mother Toulouche."
Because... they began thieving again.
"Fandor, Fantomas is back."
"Why not arrest Nibet, Nose-cut"
- and the others?
- No.
"No, they are small fry."
Small-time criminals.
No.
"I let them act freely and thanks to them,"
I'm sure that I will find Fantômas.
But for now...
"""Tail-hair"" I am, and ""Tail-hair"" I will remain."
It's the name they gave you?
"You're not very proud of me, are you?"
"You know, Bob, I-"
I wasn't gonna give you your present till later... but I think I'll give it to you now.
I think it'll help you control your appetite.
"What is it, a muzzle?"
"Oh, honey that's a very expensive suit that I was so crazy about."
"Yeah, but you were crazy about it in a larger size."
"Bob, the waist is two inches smaller than your waist."
"I mean, I thought it would give you something to shoot for."
"I know you can do it, honey."
- Hi;
Bob.
Happy birthday
"- Oh, Hi, Howard."
"Well, I got your present."
Guess what it is.
- Feels like lead.
"- Yeah, go ahead, Open it up."
See for yourself.
It's a belt.
"Yeah, I, got it in Tokyo."
It takes the weight right off.
"I had a hard time, finding your size there."
Not too many guys as heavy as you are in Japan.
- Is this the way you wear it?
"- Yeah, you wear it under your clothes."
"Uh, here."
Let me show you with your coat here.
Wear it playing tennis or handball or golf.
Just don't go swimming in it.
"I'll get it, honey."
Oh.
I have this incredible house because it makes a statement about who I am.
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
What you are Vic?
You know it's time you stop jacking off and started making a serious commitment.
"Not to just carmine, but to this family."
"And the rust and most important step in doing that is to, stop thinking about what you need and start talking about what you want."
"Well, I want respect."
"Well, I want respect."
You want respect?
You take out tendo.
You put him out of business.
I don't care how you do it.
He'll have all the respect you need.
And then we'll talk about the house.

Hi.
Hi there yuko.
Shuji!
So happy you could make it.
"Well, my client insisted."
Yuko said she needed to know more about me.
I'm kinds of helping her do her job.
Good idea.
"Hi, yuko."
"Hi, aja."
Speaking Japanese
I'm so happy to see you again.
"Nick, this is aja."
She is my manager here.
Hello.
Send him in.
"- Would you come in, Mr. Rossi?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- I'm Leslie Harrington.
This is the school board.
Mr. And Mrs. Partridge.
He's a lawyer.
Dr. Swain.
Seth Bushwell.
He's editor of the Peyton Place Times.
"Mr. Rossi, here's our situation."
We're prepared to offer the job as principal to a qualified man with a minimum guaranteed five-year contract.
"Mr. Rossi is a graduate of Penn State, summa cum laude."
He holds a master's degree in English and literature.
He was an outstanding athlete.
He's single.
"Personally, now that I've seen him, I like what I see."
- Did I miss anything?
- I've been working in construction.
"If you're a teacher, why were you working there?"
I couldn't live on the salary of a teacher.
This job starts at 3000 a year.
Then we're all wasting our time.
That's only $5 a week more than I was making as a teacher.
But this offers you security.
A long-term contract.
Guaranteed poverty is not security.
I want 5000 a year and a raise of 500 in the second year.
- We can't do it.
- You own this mill.

Get out!
Mrs. Brendan?
Yes.
You wanted to see me?
"Yes, I did."
"The, uh, girl said it was urgent, Mr..."
"Uh, Hoolick."
I'm Wilbur's father.
"Oh, how nice to meet you."
Do sit down.
Thank you.
I hope our keeping Wilbur here didn't inconvenience you.
"A little, but it's going to be all right."
When did you want to take him home?
"Uh, now."
"Yes, sir."
Commander...
"Don't worry, sir."
I will go.
"No, that's crazy."
Woo-song...
"Commander, let me go."
Lt. Suh can't go.
The Japanese will recognize him.
I will go instead.
You won't make it back alive.
"I know, sir."
Chun Woo-song...
It will make my wife and my son proud.
Confirm Chun Woo-song's position and go directly to the Field Marshal.
"Yes, sir."
Chun Woo-song!
Everything is riding on this letter.
This is our last chance to wipe out the enemy.
We will exact revenge for you and your family.
"I will sacrifice my life for the mission, sir."
What brings you here?
I have a request.
A request?
I will strike Konishi again on the 18th of this month.
Without Yu Jong and the ground forces?
That's right.
Are you proposing that you and I strike Wekyo alone?
No.
I'm asking you to make the Japanese think that Chosun Navy will attack Wekyo on the 18th.
"I know about our meetings with the Japanese, Admiral."
Tell them that I am preparing a full-force attack on the Wekyo.
"He still thinks that you've got a long way to go, but he's engaged, and that is a good start."
"Look, I'll do whatever he says."
"I mean, this is..."
This is all I care about.
Good.
"'Cause I also had an interesting meeting with a sponsor today who is looking for a female fighter,"
- and I thought of you.
- What kind of money?
[Laughs] It didn't really get that far.
I just wanted to see if you were interested first.
"Fuck, yeah, I'm interested."
Are you kidding me?
What is it?
"Mm, it's an energy drink called Slaughter Water."
"You know what, I don't even give a fuck."
"I mean, dude, I'll freaking sponsor an abortion clinic for all I care."
Are you kidding me?
[Chuckles]
My bad.
It's okay.
I'll set up a meeting.
I also wanted to find you a fight.
How do you feel about that?
"I mean, yeah."
What do you and Alvey think?
"I mean, what does..."
What does Alvey say?
"We both agreed that it's got to be the right fit, but I'll start looking around."
Jamal:
What are you doing?
I clocked out.
Employees can't eat in the dining area.
- I'm not sleeping here?
- No.
You need a pee?
Go on.
I can't do it for you.
Then we'll go.
"Mum, I must tell you."
It's all gone wrong.
- What's the matter?
- Guillaume has a lover.
I'm almost sure of it.
Sure?
Do you have proof?
Loads of proof.
"Absences, lateness, poor excuses..."
He's always texting.
"If guys could lie, it would be easier."
"I tell you, he's seeing someone."
"I don't have to tell you, you know all that."
So I'm really pissed off.
"But don't worry, I'll survive."
- Did you tell your father?
- What?
He'd probably defend him.
We have about 7.2 billion people today.
That's going to go to nine and a half by 2050.
That means that we have 35 years to basically double the food supply.
We will need to produce more food than has been produced
In the entire history of the world.
That's probably the greatest challenge facing mankind.
"And I'll tell ya, I think we can do it."
Yeung:
Surely a few hours' sleep wouldn't--
Contact me if you find anything else.
[Solemn instrumental music]
"-Is there a problem, Corporal?"
"-No, ma'am."
-Why are you guarding this chamber?
-Captain's orders.
[Solemn instrumental music continues]
-Lieutenant Reed's report.
-What?
You requested a tactical analysis of the Insectoid ship.
Later.
ARCHER:
Are we ready?

"Just a few seconds, Captain."

I asked Major Hayes to assign them.

Malcolm?
Malcolm?
"Well, he and Trimbole are a little too close with each other for mine."
Oh-- he likes it a lot.
- Yeah?
- What's it about?
- I'm kind of reworking it.
- It's fucking awesome.
Mickey!
"You haven't seen it yet, dude."
You told me about it.
Did you check out that apartment I told you about?
"Yeah man, it's the shit."
"Maggie, you got to see this place, it's a railroad flat on Ninth Street and Avenue C."
- Ninth Street?
"- Yeah, baby, it's great."
I'm not moving down there.
- It's already rented out.
- I don't care if it's rented out.
I felt like a little pendejita sitting there.
"I asked Danny 'cause it was an idea, and he looked into it."
You even went to go see it.
"It was beautiful, a gorgeous place with a lot of sunlight."
I felt like I could breathe for once in my life.
Really?
"Well, maybe you should go breathe by yourself."
I can't be without you.
Don't you get it?
"No, I don't, because you don't talk to me anymore."
- I don't know what you're doing.
- I was thinking about both of us.
"You sewing in the back and me drawing in the front,"
like we dreamed.
Like we talked about.
We've been here our whole lives.
Mine.
Kenzi?
Jenny?
- Yes?
- Hey.
You gotta hear this.
I was checking out Samir in our system.
"- What, he has a rap sheet?"
"- No, but Jenny does."
- Jenny?
- She was picked up a few weeks ago in the garage of Samir's office.
- No kidding.
- I checked with the arresting officers.
Samir told them that Jenny had become obsessed.
"He slept with her, but she became delusional."
Thought that they were having some sort of a love affair.
"What, so the entire relationship was in her head?"
That's nuts.
She's been stalking him for months.
"Begged us to keep quiet, didn't want his wife to find out."
- Which means what?
"- Look, our fox screen shows the wine Samir was drinking was laced with tranquilizers."
"Olivia did not have the presence of mind to drug him, Bo."
She's not our killer.
I think we have bigger problems.
Yeah?
Bo?
I found the head.
There's a note.
"""Beloved, I've taken steps to remove the obstacle between us."
Join me at the farm.
"We'll start our life together."""
- Just the children.
- All right.
"Meter's running, hop in."
I got it.
I've been waiting here forever.
"You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people."
We're exactly on time.
"Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up."
"I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months."
We have seats on the 50-yard line.
Deliver the children to this address.
You'll be paid after you arrive.
This is a big fare here.
"If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip."
"Now, everything's been arranged."
I'll see you Friday.
- OK.
"Goodbye, Uncle Bene."
- Goodbye.
"Have fun, you two."
Look at that dummy.
"Get off the road, you dummy."
These civilians don't know how to drive.
They ought to be kept off the streets.
The streets belong to us professional drivers.
"Taxis, buses, trucks."
That's all that should be allowed on the streets.
"You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving."
I have a perfect safety record.
"Come on, get out of the way, you bum."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Sickle."
That's rather nice.
"I think I'll go dancing tonight, get out of this dungeon."
- Can I be your partner?
- Certainly not.
I want a proper man.
LISZT:
It's only for six weeks.
You only just got back.
It's humiliating!
I know you.
Six weeks means six months.
My concerts raise money for the refugees.
The floods this year were devastating.
"It's my country, these are my people and they need me."
Suddenly you're the patron saint of Hungary!
I couldn't stand between you and mankind.
I'll return as soon as I can.
My beautiful archangel.
I'll miss you.
(BABY CRIES)
- You made my milk come out.
- Hadn't you better feed the baby?
I gave up everything for you.
"I disgraced myself for our dream, Franz."
All I wanted was to kneel at your feet.
"- Don't start, Marie."
- Inspire you to write music.
- I can't get anything done here!
- Nor anywhere!
You're impotent!
"- Musically, that is."
- Get up!
I know.
I know.
"Okay, this is going to sound a little weird, and I know it's going to sound a little weird, okay?"
[Inhales deeply]
Here goes.
I can see things that--
That what?
That most people can't.
"You mean, like, ghosts?"
No.
No.
Not the dead.
"Well, that's good."
"Look, apparently, my ancestors from Germany, the Grimms, well, I guess I'm related to them."
My mother's side of the family had the same ability.
What kind of ability are we talking about?
See these books?
They're filled with drawings made by my ancestors and some other people who had the same ability.
"And the drawings are of Wesen, which is how they like to refer to themselves."
"Who, the Grimms?"
"No, the Wesen."
And that's what I can see.

Whoo!
Where the fuck have you been?
You're on tonight.
I don't need a warmup.
How much you drink today?
I want to fight.
That's who you're fighting.
Cool.

Just lost.

I wanted to be anything but that.

"-Oh, I thought he was psychotic."
-Huh?
No.
He had a psychotic episode.
He OD'd on methamphetamines.
But he's not psychotic in general.

Furry brown coat?
Where are you from?
Who sent you here?
"Well, since you didn't see such a guy this really shouldn't bother you."
Lot of people with furry brown coats show up here.
"See, he knows!"
But then one has to know who sent you.
That still doesn't mean that I have to tell you about my business here.
When you ask someone if they saw someone with a furry brown coat... then he has the right to ask you who sent you.
I don't need to tell you who I am nonetheless.
No no buddy.
...and squeeze the life out of you for what you've done because you're a scumbag and I hate you.
And you're out of order!
Don't ever think you can come back into my life and do it again!
All right?
"Hi, there."
I'm looking for a car seat.
What type are you looking for?
It's a silver Audi with a black leather interior and a metallic trim.
I don't know.
Cheapest.
What do most people get?
Not necessarily the cheapest.
Parents are usually worried about safety.
"Oh, yeah."
"There's not much point in saving a few quid if they end up through the windscreen, is there?"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's a cool one.
"Even if you get a cool one the kids will mess them all up, anyway."
What with their sweets and all that.
Right.
Yeah.
"So, what's this song then?"
"If you live off of it, we must've heard of it."
"It's ""Santa's Super Sleigh""."

"# With a ho, ho, ho and a hey, hey, hey #"

"The planet is actually controlled by a creature, which moves on four legs."
It's called a car.
It is the most numerous creature on the planet.
A car is used for moving from place to place.
The meaning of this moving is unknown.
"A car is noisy, comfortable... and gives off an intensive stench."
"Despite this, people live in perfect harmony with this creature."
They remove various obstacles from it's path... and build for it huge structures which are called highways.
But that didn't mean that Claire was finished watching over Ward's career.
She stopped being a lover and she became a mother.

It was ego.

Nothing.
"We still think it was premeditated, don't we?"
"Oh, I don't know, sir."
What do you suppose?
"Well, I suppose if that's your instinct, then it must be right."
"My instinct about Claire, and I don't have any clues to go on, is that she was what they call,"
I believe the term is victim-prone.
"Some people are, you know?"
"And Claire, well,"
Claire was given to taunting people.
She was a born victim.
She was the kind who asks for it.
"In her marriage, in her life..."
That's a bad one.

I'm talking about your condition.
"If Doc Campbell gave me the all-clear, so will the navy."
The navy?
"- As soon as I'm 17, I'm going to join the navy."
Have you told your dad any of this?
"No, he fell asleep before I could."

"Yeah, so now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of renegade Divergents and their sympathizers."
So then they're blaming this whole thing on us?
Yeah.
Jeanine needed a reason to petition the Council to institute martial law.
Now she has one.
(CHUCKUNG)
Staying here at Amity is still our best option for now.
We need to keep an ear to the ground.
Find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.

Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.
Dr.Roncero's office.
"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephant-sized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
I started going to the ballet on my days off.
And to the Cinematheque.
I try to see all the silent movies.
"As for the DNA findings,"
Didn't you know this kid?
Weren't you there that day?
He was a brother of a friend of mine.
I don't intend to let that cloud my judgement.
I'm gonna deal with this case like I deal with any other: professionally.
"Alright, the murder weapon..."
Daddy!
I need to tell you something.
Right now ?
"No, mom, tomorrow night."
"Now, of course now."
And this is ?
"We were married for 23 years, Mark."
You both need to hear this.
"I told you, didn't I?"
I told you I knew he was alive.
It's a mistake...
It's a mistake.
"It's been checked, it's DNA."
It's a mistake !
Alan!
Accept it.
What accept that he's alive ?
Give myself that hope only to have it dragged away again?
- We are gonna get our boy back.
- I would give anything... anything to put my arms around my son again.
"But what is this, where does this leave us?"
Just like when he went:
with a million of questions and no bloody answers.
"Alan, Alan don't walk away."
- I can't do this again.
"Learn your duties, obey orders and no harm will come to you."
"Remember, the only enemy is the Frenchman."
"Read these men the Articles of War, they are compulsorily enlisted."
"Now, you may proceed with your other duties."
"Thank you, sir."
Muster on the forecastle.
I'll read the Articles.
Turn forward and follow me.
Get them moving!
Use your starter!
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Jump to it, you swabs!"
Anchors aweigh!
Up aloft there.
Come on.
"Look lively, lads."
Next!
Next!
Set the foresail.
Give her the mainsail.
Lift the jib!
Full speed!
"- Don't look down, swab!"
"- Keep them moving, damn your eyes!"
"Go higher, you scum!"
Last man down sent for punishment!
Get them moving there!
"Come on, there."
Jump to it!
"Come on, jump to it!"
That's not good enough.
We'll do it again.
Talking to you?
Is she dead?
Yeah.
She used to say things like that when I was down about something.
Here.
Sorry.
There you go.
"If I start foaming at the mouth, just shoot me, OK?"
Found something.
- Here.
- I lost my appetite.
Have it later.
Do you hear those wolves?
They're all around here now.
They're not going anywhere.
They don't have anything better to do.
- Will they come over here?
- No.
You did OK.
It's good.
I can understand your point of view.
Now listen to mine.
Someday the world will be entirely populated with bureaucrats such as you because real people will do away with themselves out of frustration.
I myself do not want anything out of you.
They do.
They wanna be rescued.
This is what they would say if they could speak themselves.
- What's it look like?
- There's a hole over the Tuscarora mine.
- The whole front's breaking up.
- Everybody go!
Let's go!
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.
"When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers."
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?
You're getting clever again.
Do you want me to get kicked out of the army?
"All right, I'll sign, but on one condition."
That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through.
You don't trust me.
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing with that in your pocket?
I always carry one.
In case.
"No, you don't."
"Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand?"
Shake on it?
Hurry up.
"Excuse me, miss."
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Lf we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail."
- Come this way.
"- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins."
"- I'm going, Emmy."
He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.
"Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding?"
Be reasonable.

Where's O'Malley?
- Pukin'.
- Pukin'?
"Yeah, it was pretty bad."
"One of them was still alive when we got here, even though the rats had eaten off half his face."
"Another psycho killer, just what we needed around here."
Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch.
What do you mean?
Somebody offed some of the ghetto ghouls?
Is that what this bullshit's about?
You check it out.
I'll see ya down at the station house.
See ya later.
"Hey, Dalton, you want a TV?"

Nothing.
"I, uh, did the right thing."

Okay.
Well...

I think it's time we move on.

I want it to be the right person.

What?
We made a pact.
Addison and I are ignoring our problems.
We are not going to talk or think about our problems anymore.
Nothing even closethinking or talking about our problems.
We're gonna be strong.
Strong.
"In denial, but strong."
Strong.
"Yeah, well, that's, um, you know... stupid."
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.
Bobby.
Thank you.
And you're pretty pretty.
Thank you.
"Well, there are some people dying, so we should..."
I have a meeting to get to.
"I'll see you later, Sara."
"Hope to hear from you soon, Riley."
Awesome.
"Okay, this is not good."
This is not good.
This is totally weird.
- What's weird?
- You.
Going out with Dr. Lonsdale.
That guy's my hero.
My roommate can't date my hero.
Just like you can't date my dentist.
Remember that?
"So, I haven't heard from Riley in a month now."
Shouldn't I have some sort of anesthetic?
Please.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
"I mean, it's not like I'm going to embarrass you or anything."
"What, you think I'm going to embarrass you?"
It's a strong possibility.
"Well, I will have you know that I have dated congressmen."
And two hockey players.
I think I can hold my own with a measly doctor.
Where are you getting all these good dates?
Bam.
"Oh, hey, you remember Noah from our flag football team?"
Yeah.
* And your sister and your brother
"* And the poodle, too"
* That they'll never ever love you * like I do.
CHORUS:
* This fella won't love you like a relative
* This fella has lots and lots of love to give
* I know your uncle loves you
"* Your auntie loves you, too."
"Yes, of course."
* But no relative can possibly give what I could give to you.
That's true.
* I know your doctor loves you
"* Your dentist loves you, too"
I'm not so sure.
* No skill with a drill or vitamin pill

You're the doctor.

"You'd say ""man of my life."""
"I think ""soul mate"" is more romantic."
Good morning.
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, sir."
Vermont Associates.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
Your new law intern.
It must be some mistake.
"I don't have an intern, old or new."
Is this Mr. Pedro Paulo's office?
"That's me, but at the moment I need no intern."
"New Resolution #5, 7 83/99 requires that... five percent of the payroll of law firms be made up of interns."
Yes.
So you're my five percent.
I ranked third among the 23 candidates for this job.
Your first assignment:
"Take these papers to Mr. Juan Alvarado, my father... and return with them signed."
"Copacabana, 534 Duvivier, suite 902."
I'm not a messenger.
I'm a law intern.
"For your information, my father is a client."
I'm defending him in a lawsuit in divorce court.
Aren't you going to write down the address?
"534 Duvivier, suite 902."
"""Alvarado Custom Tailors Refined Clothing Since 1 938"""
"Senor Juan, please."
- Who would like?
- Who would like what?
Senor Juan.
I would like Senor Juan.
- Just a little something.
"- Okay, okay."
"I, uh..."
I'll call back Joe Glynn at the Times.
He's okay.
He'll write it up well.
I once leaked him some shit about Buchanan.
Damn near won him the Pulitzer.
"- Thanks, Dad."
- Sure.
Thanks.
"What would you do, or have done, in my case?"
"Well, when your president asks you to jump... it's hard not to jump, that's for sure."
But you remember what Ben Franklin said about the vice presidency.
What did he say?
I didn't talk to him this week.
"He said he ought to be addressed as ""Your Superfluous Excellency."""
"In the past ten years, I've enjoyed the kind of power the vice presidency can't offer."
Why would anybody want to give that up?
Am I crazy?
"Baby, power is where power goes."
- Think you can beat me?
"- Uh, yeah."
Okay.
"Hey, Tony!"
Foul!
Can't trust those fuckin' people.
"Speaking of which, Mr. Webster, it turns out you're a Democrat."
"I, uh, wasn't keeping it a secret."
"Sad to say, I don't think I can bring you aboard the committee, son."
Ray Spies makes all the decisions regarding the other party.
- It's a courtesy.
Ki-dong!

No matter how much I try nothing makes me happy lately.
Nothing is working out.
My kids only make things harder for me.
And that day is coming soon.
This looks very bad.
Want a head massage?
"If you put some toothpaste here and beat it with a brush, then hair will come out."
"It'll be 3,000 Won extra, so how about it?"
- Mr. Fox!
- Yeah.

Hello?
"Miss Hwang left, saying she'll"
- What?
- throw herself into the river!
What?
"Hey, it's dangerous, don't do that!"
This is the map Mom left for us.
There's four roller coasters.
"Oh, no, no, no."
"We agreed, no roller coasters."
"Go on any ride you like, but no roller coasters."
Because I am scared of the roller coasters.
"Ha, ha."
"Oh, you think that's funny?"
You think that that is funny?
Okay.
No roller coasters.
(PHONE RINGS)
Dunham.
Where?
"Uh, no, I'll tell Walter and Peter."
So we're gonna have to take a rain check.
"That's okay, Aunt Liv."
I know you have an important job.
"Well, I'm gonna call the Jacobson's and see if they can baby-sit."
And then I'll...
- Make pancakes?
"- Yes, ha, ha."
Then I'll make you pancakes.
- You're sure it was him?
"- Uh, we don't have security footage yet but an eyewitness said that he was wearing a gray suit and a hat."
"Quote: ""One of those old ones, from the '60s."""
- We don't have information on the girl?
- No.
The police showed her picture around the museum.
No one knew who she was.
- Is Walter awake?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Oh, damn it!"
You can not prove anything with a stolen mobile phone.
I give a shit about evidence.
What the hell are you doing?
- What the hell have you done?
- I have not been here.
You're crazy.
"CODE NAME ""LAILA"""
- You have to press hard.
"- Fuck, man."
Satan.
Share Russians.
- Tell the Russians.
- Why the hell would I do that?
Because it determines whether I'll drop you off at a hospital or in a ditch.
There is a lot of money in this case.
A lot of money.
I do not take them.
I'll let you keep them.
Although I desperately need them.
Think of what it will mean to you.
I have never done anything that has been directed at you.
Everything I've done has been against your competitors.
You will aliigevel ... you will ...
never could find them.
Why not?
Because they drive around in a car.
- What kind of car?
- With sleeping bags and canned goods.
A black van.
A Chevrolet.
An older model.
You are safe here.
This is the most important thing.
I'm frightened all the time.
And this is the prison where they killed my brother.
"Yes, but the assassination of your brother was premeditated."
And criminals do not have accomplices in every prison.
"Finally, you are being closely watched, by order of the judge."
You said it yourself:
Fantômas is capable of anything.
"Yes, but less here than elsewhere else."
"Forgive me, Elizabeth."
Forgive me.
You lied to the judge.
It's called contempt of court.
You should be here at my place.
But when you're a great journalist...
I did it because...
I want to know when they will release me.
As soon as you are out of danger.
Anyway...
I love you.
Love me?
"No, you think you do."
But you belong to Fantômas.
So leave me alone.
Happy hunting.
Ah!
At last.
"Excuse me, I went to see Elizabeth in jail."
How's your love?
Bad.
She can not forgive me for what I've done.
"All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."
Terry feels like a whore.
"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
"Great, Hitchcock's in."
Who else?
I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"Yeah, about that."
"Um, there were no tickets left."
"But I brought my minivan, so..."
Road trip!
I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
"Needles, needles, need... whoa!"
So many dogs!
I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
All right.
This is gonna hurt.
You the one that's hurting him.
[Parnell] I ain't got time for this shit.
"You okay, baby?"
They said it would be more fun than a Ferris wheel.
They said?
"I ain't always gon' be here, so you listen up good, you hear?"
"They two kind of people out there, discerners and fools."
Discerner know the difference between what people say and what people mean.
Fools...only hear what they want to hear.
You got to know the difference out there.
"You hear me, Adam?"
"How I know, Mama?"
You watch they eyes.
"A mouth smile easy, but not eyes."
"[Al] So my wife's new husband is younger, better looking, better job, bigger dick... [laughter] ...nicer car."
Why would she leave me?
Just because I made noise when I chew?
"Well, she made noise when she chewed-- his cock in my bed."
[laughter]
Hey.
[Al] The kids were home.
[laughter]
"Hey, keep it tight."
Haul ass offstage when you see that light.
[Al] I'm back in the dating world.
- [Al] Nobody knows.
"- Man, look."
"About the other night, I'm sorry."
"Okay, you were cool and I wasn't."
It won't happen again.
It's disrespectful to the next comic when you running the light.
Disrespect for who?
You better tell me the truth.
Give me the knife.
"Frankie, give me the knife!"
What are you doing?
Slit your wrists and let Stella come and find you?
- Give me a chance to talk about it.
"- Tell me, are you fucking her?"
- No.
It's over.
- I'll kill her if you're lying to me.
"It's okay, honey."
"It's okay, honey."
There's nothing going on here.
"Go on downstairs, OK?"
"You heard me, right?"
Deal with it!
How are you?
All right.
Did Immigration tell you why you were picked up?
They said they are investigating Katarina's escort service.
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.
I am still waiting on a lawyer.
Good.
I am supposed to be travelling tomorrow and I haven't spoken to George all day.
He is going to wonder what happened to me.
I'm not gonna let you go.
Unless you sign this...
"Go ahead, read it."
- What is it?
"- It's your contract, to work for me as an agent at CSIS."
"It's not the same as being a confidential informant, which is what you've been doing so far."
Mickey!
The Arabs have been gone!
I offer you a peace honorable!
Whether we are to make all alone in that hole?
- With me you have a chance.
- Crack all together for you!
This look is without me.
I should also see him.
- I do not see anything.
- But now you see.
"At the end of a normal film, I too would get a kill, become a hero."
There are no more heroes.
- There are only humiliated.
- Do not say cazzate.
Leave.
We go away on foot.
"Disappeared, lice, Moroccans."
Damn!
Léon!
It's the end of the world.
I do not have the lake.
There will be no more true revolution.
"Now do not you move more, understand?"
Sorveglialo.
Save me ... take me ... where you want ... where you want ... where you want ...

"Dear asshole, have you unlocked the safe?"
How brave of you!
No.
But why?
Are they doing this to spite him?
Could be.
Why?
Maybe they don't want him to be strong.
I'll tell him he has to be strong.
I'll hide in there and they won't find me and I'll spend Saturday with him.
"No, we won't go in now."
"We brought him his things, we'll give it to the guard at the entrance."
I want the guard to tell Daddy that I came to see him and to give him a kiss.
I'll write him a note.
"You're the witch and I'm the prince, okay?"
The princess too.
"You're the princess too, okay."
"No, you're the prince and princess, I'm the witch and all the guards."
Then the prince came.
"- Look, look."
"Hi, Alex."
I can't get a hold of you.
"I left you messages at the theater and at home, you haven't called me back, so I'm trying again."
Please call me back.
It's Ora.
Thank you.
"So, my child?"
I know what you're going through.
It's as if we're losing the ground beneath us.
Dear God.
Do you need money?
"There, there."
"Dinner is ready, and stop with your secrets."
"You're not alone, so stop whispering."
Two weeks and still nothing!
- And now?
"- l promise, within three days."
What if it doesn't happen?
She seems to be better now.
Her son left yesterday.
"If she'd been in a bad way, he wouldn't have left."
How do you know that?
We just know.
It's not something you can hide from us.
"She's better, this is useless."
You say that you know but you know nothing.
"First of all, her son is a guard at Kermanshah."
He's gone back to warn his boss.
It's 45 miles away.
He can be back in a day.
"If we want to go to Tehran, it's 450 miles away."
"450 miles, understand?"
We have to go to Tehran.
450 miles in one day!
"We didn't say we'd come back... lf no one decides for us, we have to decide for ourselves."
I can't decide for you.
You decide.
I can't decide.
God's the one who decides.
Who drew up this shooting?
I can't strangle her!
What am I supposed to do?
We're not asking you to strangle her.
What then?
How much longer do we have to stay here?
What if the event never occurs?
Neil or Arjun?
Neil is fine.
Let's not complicate this case any further.
Drink?
"No thanks, I'm working."
To murder.
Murder?
Even you believe that Kabir Malhotra was murdered?
People and their strange habits.
For instance... when people are having a drink and smoking at the same time... they always hold the glass in the non-dominant hand.
"Like Kabir Malhotra, I too am left-handed."
Oh my God!
You're right.
And if he was left-handed... why would he pull the trigger with his right hand?
He was murdered.
"But, who did it?"
There's a well known Latin phrase.
'Cui bono?
'
Who benefits?
'
Exactly.
We need to re-examine the evidence.
I'll see you at the airport in an hour.
Why are you doing this for Kabir Malhotra?
I'm not doing it for him.
"Neil, this is Mark and Aiden."
They're on the Malhotra case too.
Here are the details on the will you asked for.
"Oh, and Samara came by... she dropped of the blue prints and documents that you wanted."
I still can't believe that you are a police officer.
I swear.
"Dr. jenester, to emergency."
[Groaning]
"The bed's a little small, but, uh..."
Tilts electrically.
[Laughter]
[Monitor beeping]
I finally got Maria to accept the money... so she and the kids should be okay.
I heard about the doctor's report... and that you wanted to see me right away.
[Sighing]
"I guess we never did bullshit each other very much, did we?"
"So, listen, if you want me to cut you off this, uh, system here, I will."
Just blink your eyes twice if that's what you want.
[Monitor beeping]
[Gagging]
[Alarm sounding]
[Flat lining]
"Paging Dr. jenester, Dr. jenester."
[Alarm sounding]
What's the alarm?
Respirator failure.
[Indistinct pa chatter]
"Hey, your fly is open."
[Indistinct pa chatter]
Somebody cut the wire to the respirator.
Was that Jefferson?
"Oh, sweet Jesus."
W-where are you going?
That guy that just came down the hall?
I think that was the exterminator.
Dalton!
Take care.
[Siren wailing]
OK?
So now it's time for you to be honest about how you feel about Justin.
Let me put this in a way you'll understand.
You've been an emotional grower.
Now you need to be an emotional show-er.
I mean Justin's your best friend.
Have you ever even told him that?
"No, but in my defence I"
- have a really good reason not to.
- Why is that?
Because he wants me to so bad.
"I'm disappointed in you, Danny."
Good night...
Oh.
You want to get high and watch wrestling?
- To Candace and Justin.
Cheers.
- Thank you.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Did he say happiest day or last day?
"Babe, you can sulk about this whole Danny situation this whole time."
Now I know that you said you want to do whatever you want to make me happy.
"If you want to make me happy, you go out there and you get Danny"
"Yes, ma'am."
"- Guys, I'm here."
Where's Justin?
- You just missed him.
- He went out looking for you.
- Aw crap.
Let me go see if I can catch him
"Well, look like those guys will never..."
- I got the text.
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur.
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.
(Laughter)
"I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders."
(Laughter)
"The sixth-graders look at it and they say, ""No."""
(Laughter)
"""You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."""
(Laughter)
"""The chicken is not."""
(Laughter)
"So this is our problem, as you can imagine."
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
(Laughter) (Applause)
But the sixth-graders demand it.
"""Fix the chicken."""
(Laughter)
So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken.
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.
"Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools."
We'll call them biological modification tools.
We have selection.
And we know selection works.
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese.
"Recreation, get out of Dodge for 30 days."
So were they here just during the summer?
Yeah.
Nobody was here in the winter at all.
They'd leave and everything.
"Did they interact much with the townspeople, or?"
"Oh, yeah."
They were very friendly with a lot of different people.
"They got to know - like I said, I can't remember any names now, but - they had their free time."
"They had their retreat stuff and their prayer type times and their whatever they would have, but they'd be meandering around the dock or next door."
In the evening I think they might have had a prayer time in the evening because then they'd have a habit or something like that and after their meal they'd walk to the Coast Guard station and back and then disappear.
Go back probably for prayers or something like that.
I don't know what the hell they did.
Any interesting stories about some of them - incidents or anything?
Not really.
That I can think of.
"Talk to Loretta Slaters, she would know."
Because they were right at the end of the row there.
"She would know who the ones were, I think."
She was a little more religious than me.
"And, I'm trying to think who else would have been around at that time."
Donald Cole would be familiar.
So your high school graduating group - what other things did you do with that group?
Those...
I'm not going to put it on tape.
Okay.
"No, the things -"
We set some school records.
We had them cancel -
We used to get a group... we'd go over there and...
They came here so of course we thought we'd just entertain them.
So we did.
And um.
"It sounds like the level of reference is working well for you, right now."
Yeah.
"You don't have on your website like, if you're an advanced person, or a beginner."
You don't have those kind of groupings?
We don't.
"We're working on it. , I don't know if you've seen some of those websites where they actually have kind of portals to deal with beginners and things like that."
Speakers:
Yeah.
"But you don't have it, like tailored for those kind of."
Things on the site.
Would that be helpful for you as a user?
"Yeah, I think that would be helpful for me.'Cause I am, I've been using a lot of these programs that I would not."
"I mean, some of those are really very basic beginning stuff."
"I mean, I mean, stuff, stuff will cross over, of course."
"Like, , when you have a new."
"I need product and stuff, they probably want an analysis, start to get in what those things are, and upgrade."
"But on the other things, too."
"I also like, too, that, you know, when you have those ones that show pictures of artists."
"Creative, um..."
"Oh, creative inspiration?"
Yeah.
I do like watching some of those and the artists.
"Those are very, very nice."
"It's, it's weird the way that you guys have them listed, though."
"Ah, it."
It's always hard for me to remember how to find it.
Mm-hm.
"Let's call it documentary, but this ."
Yeah.
"Navigation wise subject, like I wasn't to know that when I sort of, of , something. these guys beginning. ."
"Where, the, the, the stories."
"Yep, it's all here.."

"Ah, then should we try the ""yawning method?"""
Yawning method?
"So, now the word ""concluded"" is basically the same as ""to finish"" something."
"You start it and it's over, so therefore, it's concluded."
"Now, the second sentence we're going to look at"
Tariffs lowered on industrial goods and services.
"In this particular sentence, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yawning is somewhat contagious."
"So if you see someone yawn, you find yourself following. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Just use that. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You yawn during class. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But if Seung Jo yawns after you, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;then that means he has glanced over at you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If he's not interested, why would he look at you?"
Yes!!
"So, you're going to make effort to get it."
"They're both advocating a deal, it means they both really want the deal."
Is my lesson really that boring guys?
It's ruined.
I haven't suffered from anything so far.
I met my parents well (saying) so I've lived comfortably.
"Yeah, You and Me..."
I just lived off my greatness.
Since all the attention that was supposed to be pointed at the world was actually pointed towards me.
What do we do??
It seems we belong together more and more.
"That's when, Oh Ha Ni came to our house."
Looking at her...
I came to realize that maybe the world has different plans for me.
"And that is right, and maybe I'm wrong."
It was quite surprising
So I should experience the world more...
"I think about it often, lately."
"Anyways, thank you He Ra."
That I could talk to someone about this ...
It's a relief
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me... if you can forget me... try forgett-"
"Hey, Ha Ni ah!"
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world
That picture of everything I ever dreamed
Now the picture's crashing down around on me
Calls are coming in and we're looking at our friends
Wondering who's it gonna be
It was so good once upon a time
It was a simple time
It was a good time
Now we got the perks and all the crème
And it's tearing us apart at the seams
But I remember
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world
Once upon a time it was real
Once upon a time I was thrilled to get yo call
Then I could get yo all
Then I could get your heart
Now ain't the same
Seem like now it's a game
Once was reckless but now it's tame
You may see on the right side
"Casentino and Murlo, two small villages, once Etruscan settlements, closer to South West Asia than to Europe, while in Volterra this ancient signal is now too diluted to be detected."
"Human and bovine mitochondrial DNAs indicate that Etruscans and bovines docked to Tuscany, sailing from S-W Asia."
This also confirms how the Italian wisdom
"""take wife and cattle from your homeplace"" is now totally implemented."
"Since domestication, animals always accompanied humans during migrations, wars and conquers."
"They have been silent witness of human history, but until recently they have been impossible to query."
"Now, thanks to DNA analysis, they can tell us their story."
Thanks for your attention.
(Applause)
Elaborate a plan
So team... are we Formula One or are we driving a clapped out old banger?!
Oh no is that the fire alarm?
Quick everyone out!
Quick!
Quick!
Pathetic....
Susan?
SUSAN?!
Ok this could be a plan to end the meeting but you can find a better one:
Elaborate a media plan
Elaborate a plan
Right gang.
Are we in top gear or have we stalled in the pits?
What have you got for me?
Adding YouTube to the TV media plan!
Bravo!
World champions!
A big bottle of bubbly on me!

"I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns, shed no tears"
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
Ladies and gentlemen...
At last we stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din but with one fat ball the Yanks stove us in.
Goddamn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns shed no tears now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Barrett was smashed
like a bowl of eggs and the main truck carried off both me legs.
Goddamn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
So here I lay in my twenty-third year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
It's been six years since we sailed away and I just made Halifax yesterday.
Goddamn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns shed no tears.
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.

"Hey, look at this one."
This one's my project.
"You decrease it to 0, then that'll-- and you could list them all out, 0 through 10-- and then the median number will shift to 5, so that will change it."
"E, increasing the largest number only."
"I can tell you that's the answer from deductive reasoning, but if we just take this 11 and we make it one billion does that change the fact that they're five numbers"
larger than 6 and five numbers less than 6?
Ignore the 0.
Five numbers less than 6?
No.
I can make it into a trillion.
"I can change it to any number, but the fact remains that I have the same amount of numbers larger than 6 as I do below 6."
So choice E cannot affect the value of the median.
E.
Next problem.
"OK, something for me to draw."
"Let's see, they have a 1/4 circle, so I'll just draw a big circle, and I'll just focus on a 1/4 of it."
Close enough.
That looks like a 1/4 of a circle.
"They say that-- oh, and there's a rectangle there too fascinating."
"So this rectangle in this 1/4 circle, so this rectangle could look like this."
"I know theirs looks taller, but I think this will do."
And then I think I'm almost done.
"I think I'm there, I think I can."
"And then they shade in some stuff, so if they shaded it, I will shade it."
A suitably tasteful color.
"OK, so I have shaded what they have shaded."
"And now, what are they saying?"
"They're saying that this is R, C, T, B, S, A."
And then they tell us that is a 90 degree angle.
"And then they tell us that this distance, from here to here, from all the way to the top-- so it's essentially the radius of the circle-- is 6."
The radius of the circle is 6.
"In the figure above, arc SBT is 1/4 of a circle with center R and radius 6"
Fair enough.
"If the length plus the width of rectangle ABCR is 8-- so the length plus the width, so ABCR."
"How much do you have, if the interest rate is eight%?"
2.59 million.
Huge difference in magnitude and who's the culprit?
Compounding.
"In this case, the culprit is helpi ng you."
"But in the case of if you are paying it, it hurts."
"So, we'll do a loan later."
"So, here it's helping you."
"So, let's talk through this problem a little bit."
And so that you understand how empowered you are.
"How empowered actually you are and Finance will make you feel liberated in some, in the simple problem."
"So here, here you go."
"Let me ask you, who decided the 10,000?"
Think about it.
"Who should decide the 10,000 every year?"
You?
Or a financial adviser?
Who?
I hope the answer is you.
"So, 10,000 if you have, I know it's not easy to figure out."
But I would encourage you to think about what your needs are in the future so that you could figure out how much you need to put away.
"And we'll talk, do a problem quite the reverse in a second, say you put away $10,000, who decides that?"
You decide that.
"Second question, what is the other number in this problem?"
It's 40.
How many years to retirement?
"I know you can say that a job may have a retirement age or some sort of, but I, I challenge you in that."
"Hopefully, you will have much more control on when you retire."
Then you think you do.
"By that, I mean you should keep learning in"
"life so that you will always have the opportunity to do something, right?"
And we are talking about the money problem but it could be about anything.

They surely don't wash his feet.
None of the things that a great aristocrat is supposed to do when a stranger comes up on their shores.
Even lowly ones should receive this treatment.
Remember what Nausicaa said when she saw
Odysseus at the beginning of book six.
He was basically dead.
He had no clothes on.
He was totally bedraggled.
He was in that beggar situation.
Even worse off than he is right now.
At least he has rags on when he approaches his own house.
"When Nausicaa saw that uh-huh, naked and destitute Odysseus, she said even this person deserves our respect because all guest friends come from Zeus."
"So she said in book six you got to be nice even to those lowly people, rode down to the totem pole."
But the Suitors don't have any of the graciousness of this.
They don't give him hospitality.
"They're busy you know, hoarding and taking Odysseus' goods without sharing anymore themselves."
"Page 366, that comes out."
"Then Odysseus, as he, as he works his way into this group has a chance to tell his story."
We've seen him do this in the context of
Eumaeus.
"When he offers a story, Eumaeus listens to all the details and makes a connection with them."
"Not so, with the suitors."
"Odysseus goes on, talks about being a"
Cretan sailor.
They don't understand the meaning.
"They don't understand that, yeah, maybe there's a stranger here we should be nice to."
They have no fellow feeling.
No linkage with Odysseus.
368.
"That comes off, they treated him very rudely."
Contrast this with what Eumaeus does.
Eumaeus is doing the right thing.
These Air Force guys.
"We can't pick a nice day - if it's windy we can't say, ""No, leave them float down there for a couple days."""
"So, they really practiced."
And they were good.
I was impressed with them.
The paramedics?
Yeah.
The Air Force.
They were before the Green Berets or before any special forces.
The Air Force had them in the 50s.
One other short one.
When I left Yemen when we flew back - we left Saudia Arabia or Beirut - and we flew back to the States so that was maybe 30 hours of flying time.
"30, 35 hours from Beirut back to Zl."
So they'd have a volunteer crew out over Christmas and single guys would always sign so that married guys could be home with the wives and kids.
So I signed up for it.
"It was like the 5th of May, and... went up to Pakistan up to Peshawar, where Gary Power, you know, the guy got shot down."
The U-2 pilot.
Yeah.
"Anyway, that was around that I happened to get on."
"Not a very particularly good run, because you're in"
Turkey and Pakistan...
"So, I couldn't even fly because I needed like 70 hours."
You could only fly 120 a month or 330 in three months.
So I was pushing my 120 hours flying time with getting back to the States... and then with this thing for a round trip.
So we get over there and spend the night there in civilian clothes.
"Normally we can stay in a pretty decent hotel but because it was Christmas Eve, they had us stay in the Embassy Compound because the Marine guards and everything like this just because there wasn't really any hostility with - animosity with - You weren't an American walking around on a Christian holiday, you know."
So we run up to Peshawar the next day
Christmas Day.
And had a load of stuff.
"Food, and, you know vegetables, perishables, whatever."
"Unloaded and they said, ""Hey, we've got a trailer over here."" It was like a 32 foot semi trailer and"
"""Can you haul that?"""
"Both - Martin Luther King, a baptist pastor -"
"- and Ku Klux Klan, movement led by white people, protestants in the USA. -"
"And so, you will find the catholic church, with a moral, well, it is a conservative society."
"Like, the prohibition of marriage to the priest."
To forbid the use of condoms.
"And you might find too the episcopal church, in the USA, the anglican church in the USA, that allows gays pastors."
They live in union with those pastors.
There are specific denominations for homosexuals.
Like a contemporary church in Rio.
A few brothers here have heard of that church.
There is the metropolitan church too.
Those are communities to the homosexuals.
You might find people with totally different opinions.
There is no way you can join them.
As an example:
Obama and Bush.
Both are christians.
Obama was a member of the United Church of Christ.
A tradicional denomination in the USA.
I don't know if until today.
"Spiritualistic, catholics, protestants, mormons, Yehovah-witnesses, all of them declares themselves christians."
And there are many other groups!
"But...Well, everybody seems to be christian, huh?"
"So, depending on what christian is, in the head of a person,"
Jesus really doesn't want christians.
What christian means?
What the word christian is?
"If you search for the origin of that word, it arises in the city of Antioch."
"Before that, the church of Jerusalem, the church of Judea, was serving the Lord."
Then came the persecution.
"They had to flee and establish in Antioch, Syria."
"And there, it was the first time the disciples were called ""christians""."
So we're going to add 5 again and get to 16.
Let's do 4 just for good measure.
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5 gets us to 21."
"Now, I want to think about, can we, using this pattern, figure out how many toothpicks it would take for us to, say, make 50 of these townhouses or even 500 of these townhouses, or even 5,000 of them?"
Now we just have to look at this pattern here and see can we come up with an equation for each of these actual values?
"So, for example, we see a pattern that-- well, we already recognize that we started with 6, and we're adding 5 every time we add a house."
"So when you add the second house, you add 5 once."
"The third house, you start with 6, and you add 5 twice."
"The fourth house, you start with 6 and you add 5 three times."
So let's actually write that down.
"So 21 is equal to-- you start with 6, you start with this 6 here, and then you add 5 three times, plus 5 times 3."
"When you had the 3 houses, once again, you started with 6 and you added 5 two times."
Let me do that same color.
And you added 5 two times.
Plus 5 times 2.
"When you had 2 houses, you started with 6 again."
"This is equal to 6 and you added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1."
"And then when you had 1 house-- and it'll fit the same pattern-- you started with 6, and how many times did you add 5?"
"Well, you didn't add 5."
You could say that you added 5 zero times.
So you might see a little pattern here.
"However many houses you needed, you take one less than that and multiply it by 5, add that to 6, and you get the number of toothpicks."
"And actually, let me rewrite this."
So I could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1.
I could write this as 6 plus 5 times 3 minus 1.
You could write this as 6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1.
You could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1.
And maybe that makes a pattern a little bit clearer.
This 4 is right over here.
This 3 is right over here.
This 2 is right over here.
"I'll find a way, don't worry."
And...
I love people who keep secrets... who are silent until his death or be silenced by death!
You have a sister named Nurten!...
Ayten-Nurten ..
"She goes to high school, she's a very beautiful young woman..."
It is good to be careful because you never know that samething bad could happen but...
I'm sure you'll be protected!
yeah... but is Nedždet there?
I do not know.
"Is everything all right, young man?"
I'm looking for Necdet.
Me too. but he is not here.
ok
"My daughter, it was a lower class, but I wanted to set it to a higher level to fit accommodation in our society."
"For your sake, I chose not to respect your love for him."
I said to myself I will accept it for Feridie well to see a smile on your pretty face.
"But there have been other things, and the man was lying in the face manipulated you..."
"Now tell me, dear Feride will you accept the man who cheated and lied to you?"
"Maybe you're still confused that's why you went to see him in the hospital, but do not do it anymore, Feride.,"
You're not like that you are a person with dignity and pride even if it was love.
Can a person put their pride and dignity to a compromise?
This man does not deserve all your pain.
All these tears like that from you flowing drop by drop.
Is that what is broken.
"Him I can not never forgive, never!"
"Listen Feride, whatever is done I can not live without you, but please do not use this paternal feelings."
Whatever happened left behind in the past bury love and feelings in the heartand considers them dead.
"I do not want nothing from you,nothing else."
Guard...
Watchman!
I'm coming...
How does that not drive you crazy?
You get used to it.
I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
He can say what he wants.
The bottom line is he's showing me off.
Dr Bension.
"Oh, just give us a second."
Will you big guy.
Did you hear about it.
Watching Dr Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.
Any questions?
Great.
He seemed nice.
Careful newbie
You know I'm hearing it now.
It's kinda annoying when I talk.
I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met
So Elliot's exam was that bad
Dude she violated me.
Ina good way?
What's the deal?
Ah!!!
I think I broke my ass.
I heard
Well of course.
"The hope is, and experience shows that material like this does contribute to reduced civilian casualties and a higher threshold for war and more cautious planning for war."
"And hopefully, in this case, and understanding and careful planning for what the exit policy is for Afghanistan."
This is a war that has been going on now for nine years and is clearly been getting worse for the past three years.
Something has got to change in this equation.
"And soldiers, foot soldiers, are of course victims of war."
"They do benefit to some degree, I mean they benefit in terms of their career and in terms of money."
"These are not people, frequently not people that are totally innocent unless they are conscripts."
"This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert numbers into words."
"I store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers."
I know it sounds complicated; it's not.
"I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of ""Rain Man."""
(Laughter)
"There's definitely a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely."
Sorry.
(Laughter)
"If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then."
"By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here."
"If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, ""you're close,"" or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself."
"If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?"
(Laughter)
"Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK."
"So, without any more stalling, here we go."
"I'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683."
"57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931."
"38,931; double that to get 77,862."
"77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822."
"That seems right, I'll go on."
"Cookie fission, OK."
"Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion."
"Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489."
Audience:
Yeah!
AB:
Good.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.
Thank you.

"There are so many different countries, I don't know, where should I go?"
He said Italy?
"Never go there, it's no good."
The Italians are as false as the Chinese.
"Everything depends on sympathy, if you sing well or not doesn't count."
The teacher sais about France:
"France is super, everybody wants to go there."
"Paris is an excellent city, but when your no genius, you don't have a chance to get in there."
Then he gave me a good advice:
Germany is the best.
Why is Germany so good?
In Germany there are theatres everywhere.
Also in the small towns.
Therefore you build your career from place to place with endurance and passion.
In the end you can stand on the big stage in Bayreuth.
"And in Germany, the teacher said, there is an important difference:"
In Germany the north is more liberal than the south.
Therefore I wanted to go to Berlin.
I then asked everybody who is concerned with Somalia for advice.
"Wolrd Hunger Aid, journalists in Africa, UN, foreign ministry, everyone said the same: don't go there, it's too dangerous."
"But then I found out, that noone I spoke with was in Somalia in the last years."
Everything I found out was only hearsay.
"Entrance examination in Berlin, the next is Bee Chang from Taiwan, with an aria by Rossini:"
Semiramide.
Semiramide by Rossini.
This is really very beautiful.
Wonderful.
But I think you really can't sing Rossini this way.
"This was the sentence that the professors in Berlin said to Bee, when they rejected her."
This european way of singing turned into a legend for Bee.
She later sang a concert in a church in Germany and found out: there's also something about the architecture.
My voice sounded just as the voices on the european CDs that I was always listening to in Taiwan.
And where is he getting all his protein from?
From this.
"His diet consists of roots, shoots, bamboo and banana."
"He is getting all his calcium, all his iron, all his vitamins, all his minerals, the amino acids from this."
You get everything.
Everything.
Here is the new food pyramid.
There are two things.
Your body is like a machine.
Think of your body as a machine.
You have to put the proper fuels in it to get it to work properly.
"If you don't put the proper fuels, it aint gonna work."
"And if you put fuels that aren't as good quality as others, that will lead to heart disease, cancer, strokes, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol."
"It's like, if you take a Porsche, and you fill it up with diesel, what happens?"
"You just screwed your car up, right?"
"And I guarantee what are people gonna say to you, when you say, I put diesel in my car today."
Do you know what they gonna say to you?
I guarantee they are going to say
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No offense.
"When somebody puts a hamburger in their mouth, nobody says"
"What the fuck is wrong, stop!"
Stop!
You get everything.
I know I said to think your body as a machine now think of your body as a house.
I love analogies.
Think of your body as a house.
"To build a house you have to start with the foundation, you can't start with the roof."
Here is the foundation.
This is the foundation.
This is where all of it starts.
The fruits and vegetables.
Mr.Sameh
"The people were asking, do we stay or do we leave?"
Their presence now isn't really important I guess...
Pay them and let them leave
What?
Nobody is gonna leave
Assume he suddenly returns
He has to return to find everything the way it was
Yeah I agree
"If he returns, treat him just like you did at first"
Got it?
Okay
"Let's go, looks like we wont find anything here"
"It's no use, we've been looking for 2 weeks"
Now what?
We're doing what we can
All this is useless
The court meeting is tomorrow
And now what?
"It's a difficult situation, if the father isn't here, we'll lose the case"
We'll be jailed for at least 5 years
"No, we can't wait that long"
"Karim, Sameh, you have to decide on something"
Can't we get another guy to pretend he's dad?
"This situation has other arrangements, we have no time"
And we can't postpone tomorrow's court session?
That was the final postponal
Can't you lend us money till we find dad?
"If I had money, do you think I would've been helping you now?"
"Listen, when it comes to the bank we all took that loan"
Which means we'd all go to prison
"Don't say that, hopefully nothing bad will happen"
Babies... are little.
Gas.
That is a cheetah?
A cheetah.
Cheetah.
"A letter ""O"", but it has a dot in it."
"An ""M"" for McDonald's, and it looks like a fry, but it's an ""M"" made out of fries."
On a car.
It's a peace sign!
"A turkey, that's very colorful like the rainbow."
The Nikes.
That is coffee again.
Maybe on a restaurant?
That looks like a marble.
That is on a control that you use to control the TV at Ryan's house!
"Panda bears live... out in the woods, I think."
Baby toys.
Those look like baby toys!
The end!
Now do me a favor and please make a bar chart of the same data.
"And after you've done it, I'll ask you the same question of whether there's an approximate"
linear relationship between age and wage.
Chechnyah
"During our journey in this show 'Travel with the Quran' we have travelled to many countries to spot light The Quran institutes.. to find the miracles of the Quran around the World. and amongst these countries, is the Country of Chechnyah."
Everyone knows that Chechnyah have been through many wars and it finally became stabilized 6 years ago
When i first decided to come to Chechnya - people thought that the war is still on!! even my mother asked me:
Isn't There a war in Chechnyah?
I replied to her:
"""No mother, Chechnyah is now stabilized"" after it was stabilized.. their main focus was on the book of Allah swt and they have a great Quran institutes now"
This is why we came here to introduce to you.. the Kids of Chechnyah and how well focused they are When it comes to the Book of Allah swt
"Also to show you the Quran insititues here which I am sure you will love, here in Chechnyah but while I was recording, those two young boys were heading to register for Summer Quran classes so I've asked them to join me"
"May Allah protect them and keep the Quran firm in their hearts, and may Allah preserve you all as well."
100 billion 68 thousand miles.
"2.6 trillion, two-thirds of the way to the moon."
Spendin g that every year on your health care.
Just an outstanding amount of money and here's my last comparison.
"If you look at our health care spending in the context of the world GDPs, France is the fifth largest GDP in the world after the United States, China, Japan, Germany,"
"France, okay?"
They've got 66 million people.
This is their spending on everything.
"Vacations, education, the good French food, housing."
"Defense, cars."
They spend roughly what we spend at everything for 66 million people what we spent for 300 million people just on healthcare.
"In other words, if the US Healthcare System, with world economy, it's the fifth largest economy in the world, the sixth largest world economy."
Just an amazing amount.
If you look at China.
You know we're spending about 40 percent of the Chinese GDP.
Just on health care.
We're worried about them taking us over.
"You know, we should be worried about our healthcare system."
"Now, it's not just the level we need to worry about."
That's very high but if it weren't moving.
We can handle it.
It's also how fast it's growing.
"So, get your audience response clickers out."
"If health care inflation continues at the current rate which is the rate that's been going for about 30 years, when will one-third of the"
"GDP, that's one out of $three in your wallet go to health care?"
"We need music, we got to do the music."
The answer is.
Twenty to 30 or you guys are even more pessimistic than reality.
Alright.
"It's twenty, 40 round about."
"It's actually twenty, 37 and it obviously depends upon healthcare inflation but that's an outstanding number."
One of every $three.
"Ok, well, the moment we've all been waiting for.. this is what I'm getting Judy for May Day, these cool underwear things."
I'ts a new style for panties.
They were my mom's when she was little.
So I'm pretty sure Judy'll be really happy to wear my mom's used underwear.
Here I go.
"Judy, happy May Day; here's your new panties."
"Judy:Ew, get away!"
"Fred:How could you say that, Judy?!"
"Oh, my God!"
I'm so embarassed!
"Oh, my God, this is so embarassing!"
This is so embarassing!
I didn't get it on video tape but Judy put the panties on my head.
She's so mean!
Yet so attractive.
"Whatever, I guess I'll give them back to my mom."
I'm going inside my house and never coming back out.
Nobody understands me.
(singing) My May Day didn't turn out
How I wanted it to
Everything went wro-o-o-o-o-ong
I hope next year is better
I can't believe Judy threw panties on me (high-pitched note)
"Fred:Okay, well, that's all I have for you guys."
"I hope all you guys' May Day was better than mine, okay?"
"No need to rub in how good your May Day was compared to mine, no offense."
"Okay, well, see y'all."
(high-pitched note plays again)
The early detection of the risk of suffering from depression during or after pregnancy may reduce the negative effects in both the mother and the foetus.
"Researchers from the Universitat Jaume I in Castelló and from the Universidad de Zaragoza have developed the computer application 'Mamá Feliz' [Happy Mum], which enables to anticipate depression."
-The main objective of our project 'Mamá Feliz' is studying the risk factors which the scientific literature has proven to be related to the greater probability of developing depression during the pregnancy or after birth.
"Therefore, we have created a computer application, 'Mamá Feliz', which includes these variables."
"So here, more work is going to get done."
"And now my force, I would say, is maximal."
"So I've got lots, and lots of force finally."
And so it would be something like this.
"And so based on my curve, I've also demonstrated another point, which is that, the first issue, getting us from point one to point two, really helped a lot."
Really.
"I mean, that was the big, big deal."
Because you needed some space here.
"Again, this space really was necessary to do work at all."
"And now that we've gotten rid of the overlap issue, now that we've gotten these last few myosins working, we have even more gain."
But the gain was really-- the biggest advantage was in that first step.
"Now as we go on, let's go to step four."
So this is step four now.
"As we go here, you're going to basically see that this is going to continue to work really well."
"Because you have your actin, like that, and all of your myosins are still involved in making sure that they can squeeze."
So all the myosins are working.
And our titin is just a little bit more stretched out than it was before.
And our force of contraction is going to be maximal.
"And you're going to have-- and so here, I'm drawing the z-discs again."
They're very spread out.
Our sarcomere is getting longer and longer.
And our force of contraction is the same.
"Now let's just take a pause there and say, why is it the same?"
Why did it not go up?
"Well, it's because here, in stage three, you had 20 myosin heads working."
20 out of 20.
"Up here, you had something like 16 out of 20 working."
"Here, we said maybe zero out of 20 right?"
"And here, you again have 20 out of 20."
So you still have an advantage in terms of all of the myosins working.
But there's no difference between 0.3 and 0.4.
"Because again, all the myosins are working."
"We've already gotten used to the world of vegetation and are no longer amazed,but truthfully what does it resemble from a real viewpoint?It's just like if someone would ask you how many cellphones you would like for free,from the new generation phones,how many would you like for free?So you say if it's free give me 300."
I have people to give them out to.
"So he tells you,no problem."
"Buy this phone,which costs 30 Shekels."
"Go to your yard,dig a hole,plant the phone in the ground,cover it,water it and wait till it rusts,before it turns rusty it won't work.But afterwards..."
"You're looking at him shocked but he continues and tells you that after it rusts,you will suddenly see that an antenna will grow from this  phone and many phones will grow at the head of the antenna."
How will this sound?
"Totally strange,right?If you take a person from the North Pole who doesn't know what planting and growing is."
All he ever saw was ice.He never heard or knew of such a thing.
"If you tell him that a seed is planted in the ground,goes through a process and grows a stem which has tens of grains on its head."
How will that sound to him?
Totally strange!
He will say that it's not true!
It's like a phone that grows.
It's not logical.We've already gotten used to it so we are not amazed.
"God tells man,are you surprised that I will resurrect the dead in the future?"
"Look,I do it now in the world of vegetation."
This is the tale of Mister Morton
Mister Morton is who?
"He is the subject of our tale, and the predicate tells what Mister Morton must do."
Mister Morton walked down the street.
Mister Morton walked.
Mister Morton talked to his cat.
Mister Morton talked.
"(""Hello, cat."
"You look good."")"
Mister Morton was lonely.
Mister Morton was...
"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does."
Mister Morton knew just one girl.
Mister Morton knew.
Mister Morton grew flowers for Pearl.
Brandon:
Ok.
Ok I like that.
That's not one I usually put up there but that's a very good point.
Characters should act like themselves.
And you can't get to know someone if they're not consistent.
"In fact, characters in books tend to be far more consistent than people are in real life."
This is case of truth is stranger than fiction.
"And in the book, you're going to have to give foreshadowing and reasoning for why a character's acting that way if they're acting erratically, which they can do, that in real life you may never not give."
"You might just be a moody person, and you're jumping all over the place."
In the book you'll have to establish that this is a moody person.
"Alright, what else?"
Student:
"They have depths in their interests, and what they think about."
Brandon:
"Ok, depth."
That's a good one.
What else?
Student:
Something you aspire to be.
Brandon:
OK.
That's one of the other big three that I usually point out.
"In a lot of ways, I view characters like this:"
"It's almost like there's a continuum between what we call the ""everyman"" and the ""superman"" or woman."
The idea being that these two things are kind of core concepts that make up what attaches us to a character.
"Either we see what we are in them, or we see what we want to be in them."
And a lot of times you will have books that this is the growth archetype of the character.
Can you think of one of these?
Student:
Star Wars.
Brandon:
Peshawar and they've got rotor conveyors from the mess hall - little dinky ones.
"And they have big heavy duty ones and they're making these guys - the cooks, because they don't have a load crew there."
It was just a spook base.
They have the U-2s and the
RB57's and stuff like that there.
All spy stuff.
So we loaded it all up and I got it ready [?] comes out and hands me a can of beer and he already knew because we joked about this before.
"He put a can of beer under the front crew door and when I just barely touched the top, the plane was perfectly balanced."
Not [?] but you can fake it.
"Anyway, I did that and then I had him jump up and down the back."
"All these guys, to get it to rock a little - see how it stabilizes, you know."
But what I didn't realize was the wheels - they put the wheels on the ramp that slopes up in the back of the plane.
"So anyway, I chained it down."
You could really chain stuff.
He's back out there and I'm ...
They're tying it down and everything.
"So he says, ""Well, what do you think?"""
"I said, ""I'll sit in front of it."""
"He said, ""If you sit in front of it, I'll fly it."" I said okay."
So we take off and it was just a little bit tail heavy.
Not bad.
So we got down to Karachi and I just moved it forward about two inches.
That's all it took.
Swinging on into Germany.
Same damn thing again.
We pulled in there and we just backed a 40-foot flatbed up to the back end they dropped the ramp out and put a wench on it so we pulled the tires and they skidded this thing off.
There's another one of these E8s from Washington.
Wants to know where my manifest is.
I didn't have one.
How do you know this is it?
He's looking at this big trailer.
He knows it's not a ...
So in the end I didn't get written up again.
Another letter from whoever it was that charges these spy planes crew get another letter from them thanking us for the job done.
And then I get promoted.
The average staff sergeant made it in somewhere between 7 and 9 years and I made it a little over 3.
"And every time I got in trouble, I got promoted."
"Because, we did stuff."
It was a special request mission and you broke the regulations but helped out...
"Yeah, well, we had to do it."
Because it was our job.
Our line pilots.
We didn't have any trouble with our
line pilots.
"These guys are up to 30, 32 years old."
"You get in to maybe a colonel or something, he's"
looking at the back a little bit.
The other guy - you wanted to load up didn't care what you were loading.
"Now load it, they'd fly it."
That was it.
"Now, did you ever speculate on what was in that trailer?"
No.
"Just electronic gear, I'm sure."
Because they were still flying the U-2s.
He'd been shot down already but they were still flying
U-2s and the RB-57s.
There was a B-57 they converted to - Now you see these big 747 jet engines.
At the time - a 707 engine was yay big.
They had those engines that were bigger than that window on the U-2 and on these RB-57s - reconnaissance.
That they had converted to fly reconnaissance missions.
And an RB-57 will do almost as high as a U-2.
They'd take off from there and they'd have to fly
South from Pakistan.
"To get up to 70,000 feet or so, and then turn over to Russia, and land over in Sweden, you know, taking pictures on the way."

how dare youhit the prosecutor?
"What do you say now,prosecutor?"
"I'm telling you,Mahir Kara,"
"I will destroy you,I swear."

'Can these be...
Can there be enlightenment without light?'
"If enlightenment... we're using this term,  'enlightenment'; enlightenment means to bring light  to the mind, maybe, not to the Self."
"Because even the term 'guru,' it means the remover of darkness, which, here, means ignorance, not the giver of light, even."
But let's speak  about this light.
Does the Self  need to be enlightened?
It cannot be.
"It gives light to consciousness and the mind, but It, itself,  is the source of light."
But light  is also a phenomenon;
light is also perceived.
"Space is also perceived, because it is said that amongst all the elements known to us, that space is the most subtle."
"And we are the perceivers  of space, so something subtler  also than space is here."
To the extent that we can say even the perceiving of space  is perceived.
You cannot use your mind here.
"Mind will only create images and images are gross forms, are emanating out of that."
"The image is itself seen, the image  cannot witness itself."
A cloud doesn't know  it is passing.
A flower doesn't know  it is beautiful.
To whom do they appear?
This one.
And this one sees them with the light of consciousness.

My camera.
Why is it beeping?
It buzzes every 15 minutes.

On photos?
Yes.

"I grew up on Oracle from Oracle four on, and there are some really awesome features in Oracle."
- That's so sad.
- It would take those 3000 queries and actually work whereas mostly [indecipherable]
"- Oh yeah, no, no, no, no."
"The 3000 queries was, in fact, Oracle, and it did, in fact, work just fine eventually."
- 9000 seconds later.
"- It just took a while to run, no problem."
- Are you saying qualifying the dates or indexing the dates or both out of curiosity?
All of the above?
"Oracle dates, time stamps."
"Sequel, JBC when you're using a NS timestamp will output a Java sequel timestamp."
"If you have your Oracle column set to date,"
Oracle then in the database has to convert that Java sequel time stamp into a date.
"If you've used that date, say as a partition column, you're going to have a query that takes 100 to 200 times longer to execute than if you had just passed in a time stamp, or if you used a time stamp for your partition column."
There's a nice work‑around.
I'm not sure if there's a techno publish for it.

"He says, ""Slow down a little bit."
I got a girl with a diamond up ahead of you.

Now on problem 37.
And they say what is the value of xy minus yz.
"Statement one says, y is equal to 2."
"Well, that by itself doesn't help us."
That just tells us 2x minus 2z.
So if you don't know what x and z are you can't figure out what this whole thing is if you just know y is equal to 2.
So that alone doesn't help.
Statement two is x minus z is equal to 5.
"Now this is interesting because this expression, we can factor out the y."
What happens if we factor y out of both of these expressions?
I'm going to just rewrite it. xy minus zy-- I just switched the y and z-- that equals x minus z times y.
"Well, we can figure out x minus z from statement number two. x minus z, this is equal 5."
And we know what y is equal to from statement one.
So y is equal to 2.
So we can definitely figure it out as long as we have both statements and we can show that the answer is y is equal to 2.
"So the answer is, 2 times 5 is 10."
But we didn't have to figure it out.
We just have to know that we could figure it out if we had both of these data points.
"One by themselves, you wouldn't be able to solve it."
So the answer is C.
Both statements together are sufficient but neither alone is.
Problem 38.
"OK, they drew us a picture."
"Let me see if I can draw that same picture,"
looks like some type of device.
"So it looks like that and then they have the other end, and the other end looks like that."
"There are these handles, or something that looks like handles"
I haven't read the problem yet.
So they say will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?
So this is a book rack.
It was the defendant.
Counselor.
Ethan Thomas calls himself a man of faith.
"I, on the other hand, am a woman of doubt."
Angels and demons.
God and the devil.
"These things either exist, or they do not exist."
Are we all alone in this life?
Or are we not alone?
Either thought is astonishing.
Do I really believe that this tragedy is the work of the devil?
"To be honest, I don't know."
But I cannot deny that it's possible.
The prosecution wants you to believe... ...that Emily's psychotic epileptic disorder was a fact... ...because facts leave no room for reasonable doubt.
But this trial isn't about facts.
This trial is about possibilities.
Is it a fact that Emily was a hypersensitive... ...as Dr. Adani suggests?
"A person who's more likely, by her very nature, to become possessed?"
"I can't say that, but the question is:"
Is it possible?
Is it a fact that Gambutrol anesthetized Emily's brain... ...so that the exorcism ritual was rendered ineffective?
I can't be sure of that.
But is it possible?
Is it a fact that Emily was beloved by God?
"And that after her exorcism, she chose to suffer till the end... ...so that we might believe in a more magical world?"
A world where the spiritual realm really exists?
I can't say that's a fact.
But ask yourself:
Is it possible?
It's what Emily believed.
It's what Father Moore believed.
And that sincere belief is what determined her choices and his.
That is the total number of ways that you can set the
Enigma machine.
This would be an army Enigma machine around about 1939.
-You are telling me that the Germans would send each other messages like Numberphile or send--
DR. JAMES GRlME:
"Yeah, they did that all the time."
-Or send the U-boat to this position or whatever.
But how were they telling each other their plug settings and their starting rotor numbers?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
So this is very important.
"So these two people, who are miles apart, need to have the same setting."
"Now, the setting was written down for you on a piece of paper."
What they would have is a sheet of paper like that.
And it would be a big sheet of paper for each day of the month.
So it was a monthly sheet.
"For each day of the month, they told you how to set the machine for that day."
"If you didn't have this sheet of paper, you wouldn't know what the setting was that you had to use for that day."
"And nice, little story, the Navy would write these code books in soluble ink."
"So if you get sunk, if you get caught, if you throw the code book into water, that's how you keep the secret."
"-It sounds to me that all you need is an Enigma machine and a copy of that book, and you know everything they're saying."
DR. JAMES GRlME:
You would do.
"So if you had the machine and you had that code sheet, you would be able to decode all the messages."
Fantastic.
Great.
But we had the machine.
"And once we've had the machine, we can pull it apart and find out how it works."
Great.
But it was getting those code sheets.
That was difficult.
They were monthly.
They would change every month.
What is the planting date? planting density? planting methods? the pollination systems?
What roles to bees play in pollinating this particular crop?
"We'll look at what is the impact of pennycress on soybeans, which is a crop that would follow pennycress."
And we'll have a chance to take a look at all of that tomorrow.
We'll offer coffee and doughnuts.
Beth Seaton:
Great!
Win Phippen:
And it starts at 10 a.m. and finishes at noon.
Rain or shine.
Beth Seaton:
"Are your students going to be out here, helping you tomorrow?"
Win Phippen:
The sure will.
"The students, they play a big role in trying to do these research plots."
"They learn how to develop a plant-breeding program, and develop a crop from essentially a weed."
Beth Seaton:
Who is invited to Field Day tomorrow?
Win Phippen:
The intent is really to introduce pennycress to the general public.
"Now, we've invited fellow researchers over from Peoria, who have been working on the crop. and industry folks, who have a vested interest in pennycress in the bio-fuels area."
"They'll be over to talk about what they're up to, in terms of building a bio-diesel plant."
"And local growers, who have had to chance, sort of, play with it, nd they'll give us some feedback on how well it went and some of the challenges they are facing in growing the crop."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, well, we'll be back tomorrow to look at your Field Day."
I hope the weather holds out for us.
Win Phippen:
It sure will.
Thank you.
Win Phippen:
"So we've got some growers and sales folks, and the local support, chemistry support from the USDA."
I'd like to being the day first by introducing Terry Isbell.
Here is another example
For example they want to insult you and calling you gay
Most probably you will be called gay in a rude manner
"Now then, You know you're not gay"
So it's not true
"Second, if in your value system there is nothing wrong with being Gay"
So there is no insult
"If however gay, is evil for you"
So you see only the first point.
You're not gay....
So who ever is insulting is lying
Now take the stormtrooper Come over here
"Yes, my dear"
"As you accidentally have learned from the episode ""vulgarization of the senses"""
Stormtrooper is gay
And now try to insult him
"Hey glasseyes, you Gay!"
Hope I've insulted
Want to hurt me?
Call me Natural
From this we reach the conclusion
The offender in this case is quite homophobic
"And he will not name the Stormtrooper,Natural"
Because in his value system it is normal
"When insulting,the offender just telling us from what he afraid of..."
Whomever he would not want to be
And He simply LYlNG.LYlNG and LYlNG
Only projecting his complex on us
"Ideally,in order not to disclose information about yourself"
Should insult so
"Hi Kostya,All II want is for yout to feel bad."
LOL I'm so evil ...
"Second, it has to be in this string."
So a1 does match this regular expression.
"We're looking for things like a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, etc."
There's actually an a1 in this string.
"So, yes."
2b does not match this regular expression.
"For this particular regular expression, the first letter always has to be a letter and not a digit."
This doesn't work out. b2 looks very promising.
"It's one of the strings we would match, except that it's not actually found in our haystack string."
"It can't be part of the return value. cc doesn't match, because we're looking for things like a1, b1, c1 that have a digit in the second position."
This is not a digit. cc3 does not match because it's three characters long and we're looking for strings that are two characters long.
"44 doesn't match, because it doesn't start with a through z. d4 looks very good."
"It's the sort of thing we would match from this regular expression, but it's not actually in our haystack string."
Instead we have 44d.
The empty string--this was a bit of a ringer or distracter thrown in-- doesn't match our regular expression.
It's too short.
"It's zero characters long, and we're matching things that are two characters long."
"But finally c3 matches our regular expression and it's present in the string, so yes."
And the answer is 88.
It takes 7 steps to go from start to goal if we just count the go straight steps.
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
"And we have to turn once in this spot right over here, which costs an additional -5, so we pay a total of -12."
That plus 100 gives us 88.

"Do not come any closer, Young Miss."
I cannot reveal my identity due to reasons untold.
Then at least tell me your name.
"What is the use of revealing my name, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when we are like two leaves flying by in the wind?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let us just remember each other by our fragrances in the moonlight.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
But I don't smell anything.
Do not come any closer and ignite the explosives of love in my heart.
But I don't have any fire on me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The light in your eyes is enough to light any fire in a man's heart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Now that the fire has been put out, I will bid you farewell like the wafting smoke."
Are you telling me to be like fire and go out?
Alright then.
"I'll go. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell, Doe Eyes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
What did you just say?
I...
I mean...
Do you know me?
No.
"But didn't you just say, ""Farewell, Doe Eyes""? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;No, I said ""Farewell, Goggle Eyes""&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because you looked like you had bad eyesight."
So you may go.
"In any case, thank you."
I'll repay this favor in the future.
I am Heo Yi Nok.
I sell medicine in front of Merchant Wang's store.
"By the way, I have great eyesight!"
Don't worry about me!
"He hasn't seen her in a year, and yet he can't say what he wants to her."
Wait!
I have a request.
Forgive me for sending you away without showing you my face.
But I cannot reveal myself to you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But I know I will think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Please take care of yourself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm sorry for sending you away like this.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I will not be able to show myself to you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But even so, I will always think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I hope that you'll be safe.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Farewell, Young Miss."
Maybe there's even more magic here than we know about.
"Now, I have continued to discover  that there's little things in, anandamide, for example,  the bliss chemical is present in chocolate."
"The love chemicals,  phenethylamines that are damaged by heat, but entirely present  in raw chocolate."
There's at least seven of them  in raw chocolate.
"And those are the feelings of love, happiness and fulfillment that chocolate gives us."
It's from a chemistry that's in the plant.
This is the book.
"And if you recall the book,"
"I do want to mention that when I got to chapter 16, there was a most amazing citing that occured for me  when I was in Amsterdam many years ago."
(Laughter)
[You] can guess what happens there.
"""Oompa-Loompas!""  everyone said it at once."
"""Oompa-Loompas!"
"Imported direct from Loompaland,"" said Mr Wonka proudly."
"""There's no such place,"" said Mrs Salt."
"""Excuse me, dear lady, but..""  ""Mr Wonka,"" cried Mrs Salt,"
"""I am a teacher of geography."""
"""Then you'll know all about it,"" said Mr Wonka."
"""And oh, what a terrible country it is!"
Nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world -- hornswogglersand snozzwangers  and those terrible wicked whangdoodles.
A whangdoodle would eat  ten Oompa-Loompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a second helping.
"When I went out there, I found the little  Oompa-Loompas living in tree houses."
They had to live in tree houses  to escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers  and the snozzwangers.
They were practically starving to death.
"And they were living on green caterpillars,  and the caterpillars tasted revolting, and the Oompa-Loompas spent every moment  of their days climbing through the treetops"
looking for anything to mix with the caterpillars to make them taste better.
The one food that they longed for  more than any other was the cacao bean.
(Laughter)
But they couldn't get it.
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky  if he found 3 or 4 cacao beans a year.
"But oh, how they craved them."
Listen to this:
"They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die."
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
They try and build it.
They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
So what do you do?
Do you let them die?
"Well, somebody had a great idea."
And it was a simple idea.
It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field.
Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment.
"And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this, that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over, can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through."
"So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?"
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?
Because there is no profit in it.
Because nobody can get a kickback.
But it still needs to get to people.
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.
[Video]
Woman:
Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.
Man:
You know how expensive those are.
"I have a solution that requires neither machine, nor wood, nor cooking gas."
Woman:
What solution?
Man:
"Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have."
Boy:
"Grand-dad, tell me the solution please."
Man:
I will tell all of you.
"Well, here are her total reading scores."
"Last year in the seventh grade, she made a dramatic leap."
"Her comprehension score went from fourth grade, second month up to seventh grade, nearly a three year gain."
"What's very distinct in our community is a division between blacks and whites, right?"
"What, specifically, about the way that they speak?"
How does she feel about the way mama speaks?
"She feels embarrassed because, like, she's still using improper English."
She feels it's improper English.
Great.
What else?
What other issues about race have come up?
I definitely noticed a willingness in Sarah Lee to think beyond the first initial thought.
"She's starting to push herself beyond that, beyond cliches."
She compares how the schools-- the stamps are different from the schools.
She's highly intelligent and she's a good thinker.
She's capable of thinking through ideas.
But perhaps the best witness to Sarah Lee's progress is Sarah Lee herself.
Remember this moment from a year ago?
He used it in-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
I have matured a lot.
I have participated in my classes.
I've been behaving well.
I've been doing my homework.
My grades have been pulled up.
I've been working very hard.
"And, like, I've been overcoming the mistakes that I did many years ago."
It's clearly beginning to happen for her.
And I think this is going to be a wonderful year.
She's a wonderful girl.
And I think she will leave here and go to high school and college.
"And I hope that whatever her wishes are, they will be realized."
So far our journey through these young lives has been a difficult but mostly hopeful one.
"So, the kind of programming , the kind of programming that is going on."
And I'm asking you to just stay as only the awareness of it.
You're aware of that.
"And somehow in being aware that you're observing a kind of pattern, a kind of story, a kind of picturing."
"Because this is what actually happens quite often, is that there is a picture, you've a little youtube in your head, of somebody going , 'I'm having a baby'"
'being happy and it's like forever'.
Although it is only 10 minutes.
"It's kind of , you know.."
"You tube is only 10 minutes, but you can.."
"So, like this and something, the mind embellishes everything else."
It fills in.
This is how it is.
"You suggest something and the mind fills in all the other parts of it, like this."
"And so, it is the mind that is addicted to it's own projections."
And you've identified with the mind.
And so some of the stain feels like it is coming off on you.
That is the 'I' who want it.
"So, it's a bit entangled there, you see."
"So, I only say, that you're aware of this."
This activity of the mind or personality.
"It's creating these pictures, Ok?"
"So, just now, even now, you can do, that you're aware of what you've spoken also."
Something is aware of this.
There is an awareness of this.
That's the awareness of.
"But now I'm pointing you just to the awareness, without the 'of', something, you see."
In which anything can come.
Ok.
"Well, this story of wanting this, you know, shining prince or whatever, it comes and goes."
"It's not constant, continuously in your mind."
Is it?
No.
leads a lonely existence.
"A bright boy who loves science, he cannot succeed in school."
"Forgetful and willful, Nathan has been a handful from the beginning."
Getting out of line and talking in class--
"Those were some things. --kicking other kids, you know."
From kindergarten on there were signs of discipline problems.
So Nathan's parents had him tested.
They came up with a diagnosis of ADD without hyperactivity.
And so we knew that the pencils rolling on the desk or dropping or anything like that would probably take him off task.
It's like a jigsaw puzzle.
Some days I wake up and it's just like two or three pieces to put together.
And other times it's like 500 3D puzzle or something.
Ritalin was prescribed.
But Nathan's parents learned there was no magic pill.
We went up to 10 milligrams.
It helped for a little while.
But we still had the problems with getting the assignments home.
So his parents took him off Ritalin.
But now they had nothing.
"He would be real sad that he was not able to learn, that people didn't like him, that they were out to, you know, ridicule him or make fun of him."
He got to where he hated everything when he started school.
He didn't want to
"learn, didn't want to read, didn't want to write."
Didn't want to go.
He didn't want to go.
"A lot of times when, you know, he's not in a good mood and he's real irritable and says stuff like why am I even here and stuff, I get real worried."
I hope he doesn't get too drastic.
"And when he said, I just shouldn't be alive."
"I said, this child does not have to go through this."
His parents are desperate.
"For them, public school is not working and private school is too expensive."
"So his mom, Edie, is trying home schooling."
NCATS is going to do.
[Applause]
"The last thing, just to illustrate how NCATS is going to do things differently and, may I say, better,"
"I'm going to show you what real music is, and so let's take it away."
"I should say, how did I choose this?"
"Glen and I chose this in a somewhat whimsical way but somewhat with a serious note, and it gets to what I started saying."
"This is an aria from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart and, as some of you may know, Mozart died at the age of 37 of causes which aren't entirely known, but there was some sort of infectious disease, perhaps a urinary tract infection or tuberculosis."
Just imagine if Mozart had not died at age 37.
What could he have created that our world would have to enjoy?
"That didn't happen, and it doesn't happen for so many patients now, and we can change that."
[Applause]
I want to make little townhouse shapes with toothpicks.
So this would be my first townhouse.
"I've used 3 toothpicks so far-- 4, 5, and 6."
So that is my first townhouse.
"Now, let me make a little table here keeping track of things."
So I'll do that in white.
So here's my table to keep track of things.
"So this is the number of houses, and then this is the toothpicks that I'm using to make that house."
"So this first house here, took me 6 toothpicks-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
Now let's make our second house.
And these are going to be townhouses.
They're going to share common walls.
"So I'm going to add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks for my second house."
"Now, why did I only have to add 5 and not 6?"
"Well, they shared a common wall here so I didn't have to add another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall."
"So starting with the first house,"
I really just had to add 5 toothpicks.
I had to add 5 toothpicks to get to now 11 total toothpicks if I want two houses.
I think you see the trend here.
What about 3 of these?
"Well, this is going to be another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks."
They're the... our genre's most important things.
You need to make them feel alive.
You need to make them breathe.
You need to make them just realistic.
"So, let's talk about ways to do that."
First thing that we'll start to talk about is the concept of a sympathetic character.
Sympathetic Characters.
This is kind of the word that a lot of us use.
"Because, sympathetic is better than saying protagonist and antagonist, or heroes and villains."
"Because you want, generally, almost all of your characters to be sympathetic for one reason or another, ok?"
"Even your villains, the villains that you love, are sympathetic for a couple of... for some odd reason, and we'll talk about that."
"Let me throw it at your guys first who haven't taken the class before, since the rest of you know the answers to this, hopefully."
If you don't...
What makes a character sympathetic to you?
What makes you like a character when you're reading a book?
Student:
Some similarity between you and the character.
Brandon:
Ok.
You hit one of the big three right off the bat.
Student:
They have problems.
Brandon:
Ok.
Problems are good.
"Another way to put this is the ""underdog syndrome."""
"We like the underdogs, don't we?"
It's just human nature.
"Ok, what else?"
Student:
Consistency.
"I mean, they can evolve, but not be doing just random things."
"Separated regions fight about borderlines, are reigned by different clans."
Some of them seek independence.
One could claim that the breakup of the state is related to the destruction of the National Theater.
Most of you will know the movie Black Hawk Down by Ridley Scott.
In one scene the US-pilots are flying over Mogadishu.
Their mission is to destroy the arsenal in the National Theater.
Ever since the theater has no roof.
"Only these metal bars are left as you see here,"
"And everybody is sitting under the open sky, as in ancient greek theaters."
Liu Xenfang is standing behind me.
"He is from Hongkong, about 55 years old,"
And he worked as a young man at the construction site of the National Theater in Somalia.
"When I'm standing in this picture, I always think:"
Please give the Peace Nobel Prize to this human being!
I showed him the picture once and told him what I think.
"Lui, Peace Nobel Prize?"
"He laughed at me and said, the only Chinese that got the Peace Nobel Prize, was a provocation of the West."
Liu how are the real human rights conditions in China?
"Well, China is ok, much more stable, than other countries."
"But, Liu, stability and human rights have no bearing on each other."
"Well, I think it has."
"Liu, China is the state with the most executions."
"You know, in some occasions, politics must kill the people."
"China is such a big country, it's hard to establish discipline, but you need it."
"When the construction of the theater was finished, Liu stayed in Africa."
"Now he runs a shop here in Nairobi, where he sells lots of different things."
"Plastic bags, clothes, mobile phones, akkus, shoes and so forth."
"There is one bestseller, which is this: a multi-band radio."
With slack joint.
"This is Ahmed, a friend of mine, from Somalia."
"He was born in Bonn, Germany, maybe he is not somali."
We studied together in Berlin.
"We'll give the whole class time to work with one deck of cards,"
"All 30 of you together, and see how fast you can sort it."
This will be interesting.
We'll [INDAUDlBLE] lab.
"Eh, and we'll see all these problems."
"So there are some common problems with eh, parallel programming, and I will cover three of them today."
The first one is called Race Condition.
The idea is that if two people are trying to use the same resources at the same time.
So let's look at this code.
"Let's say the balance is 100 and, the balance is 100."
The amount is 100 and two people want to withdraw 75 dollars each.
They could get a conflict in this code.
So let's actually try it.
We will set the balance to 500 and broadcast withdraw.
Each sprite with will recive withdraw and withdraw 300.
"And this is the code, the same code."
That if the balance is greater than the amount then set the balance to balance minus amount.
"And eh, so the buffalo withdraws 300 and the star withdraws 400."
So let's see what could happen.
"Eh, oops."
Edit.
Make this bigger.
Zoom in.
"Big, too big."
Maybe.
Still big.
"Okay, so what could happen, maybe the buffalo checks the balance, 500, is greater than his amount, 300, and it is."
And then he sets the balance to 500 minus 300 which is 200 and reports true.
"And then the star comes along and checks if 200 is greater than 400 and it's no, so he reports false."
And no problems right?
"But what could happen is that the star checks if the balance is greater than 400, and it is, and before it gets over here, before it gets to this set, the buffalo comes along and checks if 500 is greater than 300 and he says well, I, there's still enough money in there."
And then they both come in and set the balance to whatever they think it is.
"Oh, by the way, the Louvre was doing them too."
"Programs are now available, they are on art."
The history of art.
There's a group called Art Education for the Blind.
New York.
"They produce twenty volume set, with great photos in it."
Art history for the blind.
Cave art to the present.
It's spectacular.
A lot of people are getting hehind this evidence.
"This is not a practice or a fashion, this is evidence that this stuff works."
"And when you build a practice, a program on top of that to suit whatever needs you have."
Why do this?
"Well the evidence shows, raised line pictures can be used by the blind."
When they are drawing objects they show the shapes of objects.
The very thing you see.
And they have different levels of sophistication in their drawings.
Especially if they have only recently gone blind.
A child and an adult.
And I think
"Eriko and Esref's perspective and metaphor drawings are kind of ""firsts"" in art history."
"We had no idea, 20 years ago that any of this was possible."
And it's just spectacular that it is possible.
Thank you very much.
(clapping)
Constance:
So we have time for a few questions for Dr. Kennedy.
"Does anybody have anything they would like to actually comment on, based on what he said, or questions for him?"
"Anything you would like for clarification, possibility for your museum."
"Speak loudly, if you don't mind."
"I'll ask you to say your name, your organization and then ask your question."
And if you could stand up.
1979 I ended up paralysed from the waist down.
The doctor told me I had a tumour on my spinal cord.
"He said that if that tumour is on the inside of the cord, you have"
less than one chance in a million you will ever walk again.
"Made me stop and think for the first time in my life that I was part of the problem, not part of the solution."
"I saw the birds die, I saw the trees die."
I saw the soil changed.
And it was not until I was paralysed that I was willing to admit that I was the problem.
I ended up with a one in a million operation.
"I walked out of the hospital, with a one in a million operation, but I walked out a much different individual than I walked in."
"I knew that what we were doing was wrong, was absolutely, totally non-sustainable."
Here's a scone that my wife made.
Try that.
Vegan.
Everything in the house is vegan.
There's no animal products in anything that we have here.
And it tastes good.
Everybody thought the same way.
It was mass hysteria.
"Everybody was doing it, it must be OK."
You started and went on from the time you were a child.
"And can you imagine what it was like, when I first asked myself the question:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
It was one of the most thought-provoking questions
I had ever had in my life.
"Because I had never even considered that, and when you stop and think about it, it is so straightforward and open:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Do we need them for protein?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Are they good for us?"""
Absolutely not.
He made it sound as if the coffee pickers were his colleagues and the plantation owners were the company director's cousins.
Once we attended a lecture series.
"I heard Rolf Blomberg, Eric Lundqvist and other adventurers."
Sometimes I saw a human vertebra on the necklace.
It was a human Atlas vertebra.
They wouldn't have a chance in a beauty contest.
They buy their pigs and their wives...
Sten Bergman from New Guinea...
He was a bit of a comedian.
He showed a film where he put up an axe on a greased pole.
The natives had to try to take it down.
Dad was so upset that we left in the middle of the lecture.
It was so condescending.
Of course people wanted a good axe.
They shouldn't have to do circus tricks for it.
That attitude affected me a lot.
Dad identified more with the natives than with the explorers and the company head.

Tiny fishing villages where people are poorest and lead hard lives are the prettiest to us.

Do you see Sweden in the same way as you see other countries?
Sweden is an integrated part of the world.
"We have a tendency to see Sweden... ...as more ""permanent"" than it is."
"We speak of ""Swedish values""."
When I was in the student union in 1969-1970 we handled a secret fund where women could borrow money to go to Poland and get an abortion.
We didn't have abortion in Sweden in 1970.
Female students in Uppsala borrowed money from us.
Then they took the boat to Poland and got abortions.
That was Sweden in 1970.
Sweden legalized abortion a year after India.
Now we think it's a modern part of Swedish society.
Unfortunately there are no such churches in Taiwan.
And then Bee went to Hamburg.
To the musical.
"When we planned our journey to Somalia, the media reported about a humanitarian catastrophe."
Back then 20 000 people starved to death.
Half a million Somalis fled to Kenia from the draught.
And I saw a photo in a newspaper report.
"There is a small child on the ground in a bent position, about 4 years old, naked."
"Next to it, there is a vulture, waiting for the child to die."
The photographer waited 20 minutes for the vulture to spread its wings.
I would like to stage a play in the National Theatre of Somalia.
It should be like this.
"So good, that the whole audience would be so enthusiastic, that suddenly there would be peace in the whole country."
Then I made one more attempt.
On the rehearsal stage I focused all the lightning on one place.
I lay down there.
"I wanted to see, how long it takes that I get really thursty, and how long I could endure it."
I made a performance as well.
I wanted to feel the earthquake of tsunami 2005 in my body.
I fell to the floor.
I slipped over the stage with tap-dance-shoes.
There were ugly scratches on the stage and it sounded ugly.
And then much more text.
Bee is still in Hamburg at the musical.
I went to drink some water first and turned on the radio.
In the National Theatre in Mogadishu a suicide-bomber blew herself up at an anniversary.
"Mogadishu doesn't need beautiful arts, but hard life."
"At the musical I realised, that the over-optimistic entertainment style doesn't fit my mentality."
Ladies and gentleman:
Bee Chang from Taiwan!
[musical song]
"Then I took of my costume, and looked exotic enough for a part in Lion King."
So the third -- the algebra way to look at the
problem is the matrix form and using a matrix that I'll call A.
"Okay, so can I do an example?"
The whole semester will be examples
and then see what's going on with the example.
"So,"
take an example.
"Two equations, two unknowns."
"So let me take 2x -y =0, let's say."
And -x +2y=3.
"Okay. let me -- I can even say right away -- what's the matrix,"
"that is, what's the coefficient matrix?"
The matrix that involves
these numbers -- a matrix is just a rectangular array
of numbers.
"Here it's two rows and two columns, so 2 and --"
"minus 1 in the first row minus 1 and 2 in the second row,"
that's the matrix.
"And the right-hand -- the,"
"unknown -- well, we've got two unknowns."
"So we've got a vector, with two components, x and x,"
and we've got two right-hand sides that go into a vector 0 3.
"I couldn't resist writing the matrix form, right -- even"
before the pictures.
So I always will think of this as
"the matrix A, the matrix of coefficients, then there's a vector"
of unknowns.
Here we've only got two unknowns.
Later we'll have any
number of unknowns.
"And that vector of unknowns,"
well I'll often -- I'll make that x -- extra bold.
"HerO, you know, I mean this is what happened, and this is what?"
The third game in a row now?
ZeneX Life is just really trying to kill him in about this time in the game and it hasn't worked out.
He is slowly building up a Corruptor count and kinda slowly moving towards that Hive tech.
But he is still on three bases.
"He needs to start taking more bases, it is obviously not working."
"-	There is 41 kills, 42 kills between the Immortals now, his micro has been so good with those, picking them up once again!"
"HerO, this is legendary!"
-	Unbelievable play by HerO.
Look at that!
These Immortals are living up to their name for the first time in Starcraft 2 history.
- 47 kills now and ZeneX Life continues to ride in.
"Still saving those Immortals, keeping those at the back."
"HerO, you are so good!"
"-	Ohh and he get one finally, but man!"
"This is a huge mistake here, ohh, Liquid HerO is getting a little bit far down the ramp, but he has got enough."
Nice micro with the Warp Prism again.
"Ohh, he gets the Warp Prism before the Colossus got down."
- And he kept the Immortal alive!
Just at the very last instant!
A 45 kill Immortal now.
- Target fire down these Probes to make sure that HuK cannot mine anymore.
"If NaNiwa can make sure that HuK has no more Probes left and no ability to make any more, the Stalker will be able to out micro the two Zealots all day long."
"With that being said, the Stalker is getting dangerously low on health."
"NaNiwa are still trying to target fire down those Probes, will it be enough?"
"The Probes getting so low on health, only two remaining!"
But the Stalker is getting so low on health.
NaNiwa has to be extremely careful if he wants to win this game.
"- This is coming down to the hit point bars, we can't let them go."
- Oh no!
The Stalker could get surrounded!
"- It is down to just seven hit points, three hit points."
"This is the first lecture in MlT's course 18.06,"
"linear algebra, and I'm Gilbert Strang."
"The text for the course is this book, Introduction to Linear Algebra."
"And the course web page, which has got a lot of exercises"
"from the past, MatLab codes, the syilabus for the"
"course, is web.mit.edu/18.06."
And this is the first
"lecture, lecture one."
"So, and later we'll give the web"
"address for viewing these, videotapes."
"Okay, so what's in the"
first lecture?
This is my plan.
"The fundamental problem of linear algebra, which is to solve a system"
of linear equations.
So let's start with a case when we
"have some number of equations, say n equations and n unknowns."
So an equal number of equations and unknowns.
"That's the normal, nice case."
And what I want to do is
"-- with examples, of course -- to describe,"
"first, what I call the Row picture."
That's the picture of one equation
at a time.
It's the picture you've seen before in two by two equations
where lines meet.
"So in a minute,"
you'll see lines meeting.
"The second picture, I'll put a star"
"beside that, because that's such an important one."
And maybe new to you is the picture -- a column at a time.
And those are the rows and columns of a matrix.
And his Enigma machine is exactly the same as the first one.
So there's something I have to do.
I now need to set these rotors to the correct position.
"So we've got this code over here, Y-T-H-M-Y and whatever."
Let's type that into the machine this time and see what happens.
"OK, so we start with Y. Y becomes N. T becomes U. H becomes M. M, in the code, is a B. Y. I. F. And W, finally, is E. So each rotor has 26 starting places."
"In fact, these rotors come out and swap over."
"In fact, again, they had five rotors to pick from."
They had a box of five rotors.
You would pick three from a box of five.
"And already, we've got thousands of settings."
And each one will produce a different code.
So we're going to work out those combinations.
"So the first thing I said was, we pick three rotors from a box of five."
"In the first slot, you would have five rotors to pick from."
"Once you've picked that, in the second place, you would have four rotors to pick from."
"And in the final place, the third place, you would have three rotors left."
And you multiply those numbers together.
So it's 5 times 4 times 3.
So there are 60 ways that you can put in three rotors from a choice of five.
We have 26 starting positions for each rotor.
"So we have 26 choices for the first one, 26 choices for the second one, and 26 choices for the third one."
"And if you do that, you get 26 cubed, which is 17,576."
"It gets worse, because the military, the Army, Air Force,"
Navy had something extra.
"The commercial machines-- if you were a bank or a business, you could buy an"
Enigma machine to use yourself to send your own secrets.
But the military had an extra bit.
They had this thing at the front of the machine.
"Now, this is called a plugboard."
"And it's like an old-fashioned telephone switchboard, like an old patchboard."
We have 10 of these wires.
"So while I'm fighting in the war,"
"To Devil, Wife, don't open the door."
Comrade Army Commander!
"An urgent message, Comrade Army Commander!"
Zbruyevka's been freed by some avengers.
Some avengers?
Who are they?
- Nobody knows for sure.
- And if not for sure?
Have you contacted them?
That's impossible.
- Why not?
- They are not there.
- Who is not there?
- The avengers.
"- And Zbruyevka, is it there?"
"And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour, boil them up, use the oil."
"They also used the flesh as well, for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks."
This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -- the finning of sharks.
"We're often frightened of sharks, thanks to ""Jaws."""
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
"There was someone recently, wasn't there?"
Just a couple weeks ago.
We kill about 100 million sharks a year.
"So I don't know what the balance is, but I think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them."
It was a well-documented fishery.
"As you can see here, it peaked in the '50s, where they were killing 1,500 sharks a year."
"And it declined very fast -- a classic boom-and-bust fishery, which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates."
"They killed about 12,000 sharks within this period,"
literally just by stringing a Manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
"Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s, especially out of places like Dunmore East in County Waterford."
"About two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85, mainly by Norwegian vessels."
And we said well the acceleration of the pulley is just half the acceleration of the block.
The pulley's velocity and its acceleration is half whatever the block's is.
And so we substituted that in for the acceleration of the pulley.
"And now we can substitute tension, which we solved here, for the-- my mind's getting flustered-- for the tension in this equation."
So what do we get?
We get 150-- let me move back to a nice color-- minus 2 times this expression.
This is the tension in the rope.
"10 times a, b, acceleration of the block, plus 39.2 is equal to 5 times 1/2."
Well what's 5 times 1/2?
It's 2.5 acceleration of the block.
So we have 150 minus 20 times the acceleration of the block minus-- what is this-- 78.4 is equal to 2.5 times the acceleration of the block.
Well let's add 20 times the acceleration of the block to both sides.
"Well, we'll just simplify this."
150 minus 78.4 is equal to 71.6.
So 150 minus 78.4 is 71.6.
So that's just this minus this.
"And I'm going to add 20 a b to both sides, so I'm essentially moving this 20 a b over on that side."
I'm skipping a couple of steps just to save space.
So if I add 20 times the acceleration of the block.
"That's not a, b."
It's a sub b.
You get 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
"And this is a 6, not a block."
71.6 is equal to 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
We're almost done.
So we divide both sides by 22.5 and what do we get?
Let's see.
"Divided by 22.5, and we get the acceleration of the block."
So that's this block right here.
The acceleration of the block is 3.18 meters per second squared.
That's how fast this thing accelerates to the right.
And we already figured out that the pulley accelerates at half that rate.
Once was real love and now it's fake

When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good

Hi guys.
"This is Max Tapper again, for Howcast."
What I'm going to do today is talk about a set.
"So, what exactly is a set?"
A set basically is just a certain number of repetitions that you choose to do in any exercise.
"So, say if I pick up a dumbbell and I want to work my chest and I'm going 10 to 12 repetitions, after 12 repetitions, that is one set."
Okay?
"Now, you can choose different repetitions for different reasons, depending on what you're trying to achieve."
Let's say your goal is just complete strength.
A lot of times they'll do six sets of repetitions.
"If your goal is to build muscle, like hypertrophy, then we'll work somewhere between 10 - 12 repetitions, and that's one set."
"If your goal is for endurance, then you're doing 15-20 reps, and that is still one set."
"So, a set basically is just a certain amount of repetitions."
That's all.
All right guys?
Get out there.
Do your sets and be safe.
(Music playing)
Let's do this last problem right here.
"The world's largest trench digger, Bagger 288, moves at 3/8 miles per hour."
"So its speed, or its velocity, or its rate is equal to 3/8 miles per hour."
We could write it like this.
How long will it take to dig a trench 2/3 miles long?
So we want to go a distance that's equal to 2/3 miles.
So we just remember that distance is always going to be equal to rate times time.
So our distance is 2/3 miles.
"That's going to be equal to our rate, 3/8 miles per hour, times our time."
"Or we could divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, so if we divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, we'll get our time."
So divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
Divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
This cancels out.
"So time, we're going to get time is equal to this."
So we have 2/3 miles.
Let me write it this way.
2/3 miles divided by 3/8 miles per hour.
"Or another way to think of it, that's the same thing as times the inverse, times 8/3 hours per mile."
I just took the inverse of this.
We divided by this.
That's the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
And we inverted the units as well.
And so we'll see that the units cancel out.
"Mile in the numerator, mile in the denominator."
We're left with hours.
"And so this is equal to 2 times 8 is 16 over 3 times 3, 9, 16/9 hours."
"So like an hour and 7/9, or 1 and 7/9 hours to dig the 2/3 of a mile."
Welcome back.
"Now that we've hopefully, learned a little bit about"
"Newton's law, let's apply them to solve some problems."
"Let's say I have a-- I don't know-- some kind of vehicle, a car, a motorcycle or something."
"We can make buildings like trees, we can be carbon positive."
"We can look at a child and say instead of, ""Oh, shit, overpopulation"", we can say, ""Holy shit!"
"How nice!"""
Thank you very much!
The city swings and 200 dancers from 20 nations are swinging with it.
At the first Jazz festival in Heidelberg [Germany] over the weekend.
This is the first dance of my life;  I used to boycott the dance school
It is extremely multisided as you can be extremely creative and playful.
Because it is fun and you meet people; for example somebody like this.
There are nearly no rules.
You can't make mistakes.
Everything is  just a variation.
You can do what you want.
It is really the best dance that I know.
"Katja and Ali are dance partners, but also married couple."
They teach Lindy Hop all over Europe.
With the first Jazz festival here in Heidelberg they both realised themselves a dream.
"Swing is for the vice european vice champions not only a music and dance, but also an attitude towards life and limitless."
"It is like a language; first you learn the grammar in class and then everybody can ""speak"" with each other on the dance floor."
"New York, 1927:"
"Black and White, poor and rich,  meet on the dance floor in Harlem."
"At the Savoy ballroom the Lindy Hop is created, the most original way of swing dancing."
There are no written rules.
Lindy Hop thrives on improvisation.....
...to this day!
"That makes it so exciting, fun, sexy, full of energy!"
"The atmosphere is boiling in Heidelberg's town hall when the Shim Sham song comes on, one of the highlights of the evening."
But what would Swing and the 20s be without Big Band and dresscode.
"Part of it is a proper hair-do, the adequate outfit."
"It also makes you dance differently, compared to dancing in jeans and T-shirt."
"Katja and Ali met in Paris, dancing on the banks of the Seine."
And their enthusiasm is as fresh as on the first day.
The coffee will always be black with that bitter taste
"O nation, flutter away"
And clutter the hill of coffee
Melt the dead hearts and make it soulful again
Because they have dreams like young beautiful girls
"O nation, it's enough black coffee for our hope"
I long to see the coffee defeated by your sugar
"Taste it, then kiss my sweetheart"
With your dream flavor
"O nation, flutter away and include me into your swarm"
"O nation flutter, as the sweet taste is your own secret!"""
(audience clapping)
After many travels
I met someone called (Gehad)
He was Lebanese
Who adores Egypt
He visited many places in Egypt
And camping there with my knowledge
I told him that people stop asking
"People used to ask before, but now, no one cares!"
"Then he told me:"" in order to be a good traveling"
You have to lose your feelings
So that you can feel the other things that surround you carefully
"Like mountains, sands, and the signer girl from Nubba"""
"Then I wrote (El Ghorba) ""the exile"""
"That exile, which mourn on that stranger"
Its call spreads between the wind &amp;amp; echo
"Crying,"
"Stray, and the wheel of sadness loss its scope"
"O exile, why your call lose its kindness?"
Why it doesn't have any kindness?
Or being loved ?
"So, let's say that you have some data now from the, from the sets of families I mentioned."
And this is what the family unit looks
like.
"Now again, we have the genotypes, just for"
"A and B. We don't know anything about C except, by virtue of disease status."
Okay?
"So, [inaudible] are Aa, ."
"So, you know, they're heterozygous for both the A and B markers."
"416 of them were healthy, and one was diseased."
'Kay?
So most of them tend to be healthy if you're heterozygous for both.
"Those are little a, little a, little b, little b."
"Most of'em, or actually all of'em in this case, are diseased."
"If you're big A, little A, little B, little B."
"So you're homozygous for little B, but you're heterozygous A marker."
"So, you're mostly healthy, there's a couple of diseased individuals."
"And this case, little A, little A, big B, little B, most of them are diseased."
"So, look at this just a minute, and speculate whether you think marker A is closer to the disease-causing mutation or marker B is."
"Again, remember mapping is looking for an association between genotype and phenotype, okay?"
"So what you wanna do, and looking at this right now, this is just like the problem we did in a previous video."
Look and see.
Does your genotype just at A predict the disease?
Does your genotype just at B predict the disease?
"All right, let's take a look now."
"So at A, just looking at A. Well, actually let's start with B, let's start with B. Just at B, big B, little B."
"So this one is big B, little B. Most, almost all of them are healthy."
"This one down here is also big B, little B."
Almost all of them are diseased.
"This one's little b, little b."
Almost all of'em are diseased.
"This one is little b, little b and almost all of them are healthy."
So b really doesn't predict the genotype very well at all.
I'm gravely concerned that it might become public works project involving concessions.
We don't have the luxury to spare a single second considering the financial condition of the Japanese government.
We must figure out how we really do the decontamination work.

There is a new one over here.
[man speaking native language] man speaking native language:
"Oh, gosh."
You have to pull on this one.
Can you manage it? woman speaking native language:
Nope. man:
You have to pull using your dorsal muscles. woman speaking native language:
It won't budge.
[man speaking native language] woman speaking native language:
IT WON'T BUDGE. man:
"John, it is necessary to address one or two shortcomings in, uh, the physical side of marriage."
"Surely no one would argue that there are certain physical demands a wife can request of a husband, and Ann asks you that you address these issues right now."
[laughter]
Do you agree to wash the windows inside and out?
[laughter]
man speaking native language:
It's like at the gym.
"You grab here, you grip there, and you position yourself with parallel feet so you can use your dorsal muscles."
Then you pull.
[woman laughs]
woman speaking native language:
"Oh, really? man:"
"Ann, John asks if you will agree to let him do that thing you once told him you would let him do on his 40th birthday, but still not have yet done."

I told you it won't move.
columns.
So I know how to get that one.
So what's the solution?
What combination will work?
I just want one of these and none of these.
"So x should be zero, y should be zero and z should be one."
That's the combination.
One of those is obviously the right
one.
Column three is actually the same as b in this particular problem.
"I made it work that way just so we would get an answer,"
"(0,0,1), so somehow that's the point where those three planes met and I"
couldn't see it before.
"Of course, I won't always be able"
"to see it from the column picture, either."
"It's the next lecture,"
"actually, which is about elimination,"
"which is the systematic way that everybody -- every bit of software,"
"too -- production, large-scale software would solve the equations."
So the lecture that's coming up.
"If I was to add that to the syilabus,"
"will be about how to find x, y, z in all cases."
"Can I just think again, though, about the big picture?"
By the big picture I mean let's keep this same matrix on the left
but imagine that we have a different right-hand side.
"Oh, let me take a different right-hand side."
So I'll change that right-hand side to something that actually is also
pretty special.
Let me change it to --
"if I add those first two columns, that would give me a one and a one"
and a minus three.
There's a very special right-hand
"Okay as usual, are there any questions or comments about the talk this evening on emotions?"
"Yeah, okay."
Man 1: ...[difficult to hear]

"Yeah, you're talking about that one."
That's the old story.
"See three, you don't know what the thumb is doing, but one's pointed that way."
Man 1:
[difficult to hear]
Ajahn Brahm:
"Yes that's right, so if you criticise somebody else.."
This was actually a saying of the Emperor Ashoka.
"Who was a Buddhist, was it it 200 years before the birth of...about 22 hundred years ago or something."
"And he wrote in stone, we know what he said because those stone monuments are still there."
"Usually in museums now, some are in their original place."
He said this wonderful thing that anybody who criticises another person's religion thereby criticises his own faith.
"That's a wonderful thing to say 22 hundred years ago, what a beautiful way of tolerance."
"You criticise somebody else's religion, then you're showing that your own faith is not really up to scratch."
It's not just religion - if you criticise somebody else then you're showing your own understanding of life is lacking.
How can you criticise others?
"How much do you know about them, why they did that?"
How many times have you been criticised - unfairly?
So why do you go criticising others?
Give them the benefit of the doubt.
And you have a happy life.
And there's much doubt to give people the benefit of.. [laughter]
Okay thank you for that Eddy.
"We've got a question there, and then over there, yes"

And without the consent of the possessed... ...the exorcism ritual can't be performed.
Did you encourage her to eat?
"Yes, every time I saw her... ...but the few times she tried, it seemed like..."
"Seemed like she couldn't swallow, or she couldn't keep it down."
What about medical care?
I wanted her to continue.
I never said she should quit seeing her doctors.
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.
But you did suggest she stop taking the drug Gambutrol.
Yes.
"After the exorcism, she asked for my counsel."
She told me that the drugs had never helped her.
"After all, she was on Gambutrol during the exorcism... ...when her so-called symptoms were at their peak."
"Ultimately, we both felt that she was beyond medical care... ...and that she had to see this through to the end... ...by faith alone."

Now where was she living and where were you living at the time?
Sal:
"She was based in New Orleans,which is where I grew up."
But I was in Boston at the time.
"And we agreed that she would go home, and we would get on a conference cal,l and we'd figure out something."
I used Yahoo Doodle to tutor her.
"And a couple months later, that worked out."
"Then I started tutoring her brothers, a couple other cousins."
"The whole time, I still had a day job."
"And about a year later, it just became hard for me to scale myself:"
I had trouble scheduling with all my different cousins and family friends and all the rest
And I had a buddy who I was talking to over dinner.
And I said:
"""You know, I'm really enjoying this tutoring thing that I'm doing after work."
"But it is getting difficult."""
"And he said ,""Why don't you just record your lectures and put them on YouTube?"""
"And I said; ""No, YouTube is for dogs on skateboards."
"It's not for serious mathematics, """
"But I tried it out, and, long story short:"
My cousins said that they liked me better on YouTube than in person.
"And other people did too, and they just kept watching it."
"So, it's about 2.5 million people a month are watching the videos."
Tom:
And you've got about 2200 videos.
Sal:
"It is now pushing 2800 videos, on everything from basic addition to vector calculus, and biology, and chemistry, and whatever else."
Tom:
Is this a commercial enterprise?
Are you doing this just to keep the country better informed?
Sal:
No.. a lot of my buddies from the very for-profit investment world are wondering what happened to Sal.
But I decided to make it a not-for-profit.
But this is the only rivet that we found between this lentoid and the previous lentoid that was cleaned.
And you can see that the rivet is resting on top of a small silver divider and that's something that is a feature that is also present on the previous lentoid.
And I am right in thinking - you were telling me at the other side you can actually see the holes where these pins may have been?
You can.
So if I pan over the central gold foil...
You can see that there are two large rivet holes present on this side as well.
And one small rivet hole sort of tucked in the corner
looks like maybe they made a mistake!
So what are we looking at here Ellen?
You can see here the clean garnets and some of them are quite lovely and you can still see the inter play of light with the backing foils showing through.
And I'm presently working on writing up a little blog for the website about this treatment so that you can see the before and after of images.

"Just go, don't be scared My friend:"
Noooooo

Sometimes I'm playing something and I tell myself:
"""I got out of this place!"""
Nice is the water
Nice is the landscape and nice is the possibility for us to be there.
Exactly.
Sometimes we arrive at a place and we really do!
Wow!
Wow!
It was great!

"Yes, I feel it, great!"
Cool!

Alright welcome back.
A little new idea for you here and this one applies to learning and most certainly would threaten to turn our current educational system on its head.
What's unclear is whether it's good for America.
"A California school called the Khan Academy is reinventing traditional teaching by giving students lectures that they can watch at home on their own time, re-watch them if they'd like and then having them do the homework when they're in school in the classroom."
Salman:
"By removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self pace lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom."
I'm going to do one more here.
I'm going to do one more.

I surrender.
"Jill Price told Diane Sawyer she decided to share her story because of the memory of seeing a confused woman in a bank, dressed in a bathrobe, clearly suffering from Alzheimer's."

We'll be right back.
"If I ask you, apart from Violin do you know what other instrument can be played on the shoulder?"
That's Right!
Is a VlOLA~
If you have no idea what a viola is it actually doesn't matter....
"Since, most of the violists are used to it and not only viola but many other instruments or  music genres are being misunderstood or neglected."
That's why I am here making a mini series  about music knowledges that you may not know.
[ The E Symphony ]
The 1st episode of the E Symphony will be about the viola
The English name of the viola is viola.
(nice translation)
"Some people pronounce as ""viola"""
Viola with other string instruments are all evolved  from a Baroque instrument called the Viol
"You may have now notice that, compare to the violin, cello or double bass, you have less opportunity to hear the word ""viola"""
"But this is pretty normal, this already happened since long time ago"
The structure of early music is
The top part (treble) makes the melody.
The lowest part (bass) makes the basic harmony
"The light that emanates from consciousness, this is revealing the forms of the creation,  you see."
So that is also seen.
"So, the question:"
"Sri Ramana, he describes it as  self-effulgent."
Not relying  upon something else.
Not relying  upon something else.
"The moon, they say, has no light of its own."
I am told this;
I never could prove it.
"They say the moon  doesn't have a light of its own, that it is reflecting only  the light from the sun."
"This is what I'm told,  like that."
Okay?
The sun is not depending  on something else.
The moon is depending  on something; the moon is depending  on the sun's light in order to reflect  even this coolness that we enjoy.
"So, mind is like this moon and mind's light  is like this moonlight."
"It also can only reflect, also,"
"Hm? the energy that's coming  from the sun-self, it's like that."
And the light of the sun and the sun are one.
Harmony.
"Like the fragrance  of a flower and the flower, they are one, not two separate things."
They are like one.
"But the smell can come,  the flower can come."
"And this one is saying,"
'... that which is  self-effulgent.'
I don't think 'self effulgent' -
I'm not sure  about this term 'effulgent' - somebody can help me?
Effulgent means self-radiating?
Self-radiating.
"Then, if he speaks  about a light which is self-radiating, then it can only be  a metaphor for the Self, not the phenomenon  of light only."
"It must be  some metaphor for Self, because Self is beyond  light and darkness."
"In It,  light and darkness manifest, time and space manifest through  the mind and consciousness."
All of these can appear.
"a minus one and in the second equation a two,"
"and on the right-hand side, zero and three."
"You see, the"
"columns of the matrix, the columns of A are here and the"
right-hand side b is there.
And now what is the equation asking
for?
It's asking us to find -- somehow to combine that vector and
this one in the right amounts to get that one.
It's asking us to find
the right linear combination -- this is called a linear combination.
And it's the most fundamental operation in the whole course.
It's a linear combination of the columns.
That's what we're seeing
on the left side.
"Again, I don't want to write down a"
big definition.
You can see what it is.
"There's column one, there's column two."
I multiply by some numbers and I add.
That's a combination --
a linear combination and I want to make those numbers the right numbers
to produce zero three.
Okay.
Now I want to draw a picture
"that, represents what this -- this is algebra."
"What's the geometry, what's the picture that goes with it?"
Okay.
"So again, these vectors have two components,"
so I better draw a picture like that.
So can I put down these columns?
"I'll draw these columns as they are, and then I'll do a combination of"
This is my card as well.
"If you have any questions, you can come and see me."
"If you did not, print out the email on the sublime list, and you want 10 dollars off tonight, it's only for the table."
I apologize for that.
But it's for the table.
So not everybody at the table get this.

It's for two.
"So if you have a group of four people, you will get two of these."
And thank you guys for listening.
I hope you enjoyed it.
-What's happening guys?
"All right, here's the thing."
"If you're a penguin, feel free to dance around and have a good time, but don't f--k around and jump on a sea lion."
Now I don't know what that penguin was thinking or why that sea lion needed to be so melodramatic about the whole thing.
"-Oh, no he didn't."
-But I do know that that penguin is brave as hell.
"Apparently, Happy Feet plus gigantic balls equals a penguin."
"No but this video got a half million views in two weeks but it just goes to show you that even in the animal kingdom, everyone picks on the fat kid."
-Fatty fatty 2x4.
"Wake up, fatass."
-Oh!
-Now I'm honestly not sure why he didn't snatch that penguin up and eat him with a side of Nutella.
"But no, his lazy ass goes right back to sleep."
-[snores]
"-Look at him there, lazy ass."
"""Just five more minutes Mom."""
"Listen if you're a sea lion and you're way too lazy get up and eat a penguin, that's like a whole other level of lazy."
"All right, if you're a straight male, then you probably don't know much about Liza Minnelli."
"All right so here we got some footage of her in an interview and I don't know much about her,"
"I know that she sings, I know that she acts and I also know that I am like in love with her now"
'cause she did this hour-long interview and someone clipped a two-second soundbite from that interview.
I am gastronome.
I explore unique foods that are available to us all over the world.
"In 2002 I founded, as part of my work, a nonprofit organization"
"The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation,  whose goal is to plant 18 billion fruit trees  and nut trees all over the planet."
"We're at about 200,000 right now."
"And, that same year that we founded this organization, a wonderful organization  filled with amazing people,"
I ran into the most incredible fruit and nut tree in the world.
It is the source of the Earth's favorite food.
"That's right, the population of the world  has one favorite food."
"And of course, it's chocolate."
"Now, in my exploration of this I stumbled into it because I was a health food fanatic."
I never ate chocolate since I was fifteen years old.
This was about when I was maybe 32.
I stumbled into  this form of chocolate here.
This is raw chocolate.
"This is chocolate  in its unique original form, a form that is called -- by the British it is the slang word ""coco."""
But it's really cacao.
That's the real word.
"And is sometimes called a bean,  but it's really a nut."
It is the most widely eaten nut in the world that nobody actually eats.
I was in Hawaii with some friends.
We were peeling them.
They started  showing up in our smoothies.
"We'd get these coconuts,  we'd break up coconuts and make these incredible drinks."
We called them superfoods smoothies.
"And we started adding them to these smoothies and I asked my friend one day,"
"I said, ""What is this?"""
I didn't know what it was.
"And he said,  ""Oh, just peel the next one, and eat it."""
"So, I did eat it."
And that's what it looks like on the inside.
"And, at that exact moment that I ate that food,  I was touched by the spirit of chocolate."
I Kiss you sir congratulations
We want them..
We want them
Ok calm down.. they'are coming.. ok they're coming
Ok they're coming..
Ok..Ok calm down they're coming now
Applaud..
Applaud.. here comes the great artist
Thank you very much
How did we do aunty.. they liked us and who does not love a woman like me you fill the whole stage.. of course they'll love you you fill it so much that they can't even see the Kanoon player
"- Kanoon player how are you? - fine.. fine since you're ok then let's start 1, 2, 3,4"
Go ahead
Thank you you're welcome
I'll have my coffee then leave why the rush?
I'll go home and look on the internet for a home to rent since you're looking for a house for rent it means you're staying in Istanbul
No ..
Not for this reason
I don't want to be a burden on Mrs. Nesrin it's not nice
And if you see any house suitable for me just tell me
Ok .. what are you looking for?
"Not very expensive, small, doesn't have any problems no noisy neighbors.. would be enough do you have a friend for me I can share the house with her in fact there is"
Where?
Very close to here
Do you know the owner?
Yes I know him very well but is there a proper house in this area
There is
"Ok, can we go tomorrow and see it together in fact in fact we don't need to go anywhere because the house I'm talking about is this one it has many rooms Jeren"
Why don't you stay here? you mean to live together here
You said you need a friend in the house
I wish for you to live a beautiful and happy life
God willing
Now you have a big responsibility
I've missed her a lot.
"We talk on the phone, but of course that's never quite the same as hanging out with your parents in real life."
"It's such a nice togetherness, you know?"
I like it.
I like watching people walk around with their parents because I think it makes people make more sense.
I like seeing freshman run to their parents because they haven't seen them in so long.
That'll be me this year.
We're told to graph this system of equations and identify the number of solutions that it has.
And they have the system of equations here.
So they want us to graph each of these equations and think a
little bit about the solutions.
"So the first equation here-- I'll rewrite it, so I'll graph it in the same color that I write it."
"This first equation's already in slope-intercept form, y is equal to 3x plus 1."
"We see that the slope, or m, is equal to 3, and we see that the y-intercept here is equal to 1."
"So let me be clear, that is also the slope."
I just called it m because a lot of times people say y is equal to mx plus b.
So we can graph it.
"We can look at its y-intercept, the point 0, 1 must be on this graph."
"So that's the point 0, 1 right there."
"This is the y-axis, that is the x-axis."
And the slope is 3.
"That means if we move 1 in the positive x-direction, we're going to move up 3 in the positive y-direction."
"So we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3."
"If we moved 2 in the x-direction, we would move up 6."
Just like that.
Because 6 over 2 is still 3.
"Likewise, if we moved down 1, if we went negative 1 in x, we would go negative 3 in y."
"So negative 1, negative 3."
Because negative 3 divided by negative 1 is still 3.
"If we went negative 2 in x, we would go negative 6-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in y."
"So these are all points along the line, and I can connect the dots now."
"Pennycress is a winter annual, and the seeds contain a very high oil percent."
"This crop is easily grown and harvested, with minimal affect on soybean production."
"And Terry concluded that if pennycress was planted in all soybean fields, off season, at 1,000 pounds per acre yield, it could produce about 3.8 billion gallons of additional bio-diesel."
And the remaining meal can also be used as an organic fertilizer and natural weed killer for
"low-acreage, high-value crops."
It's also a source of monomer for bio-based plastics.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Hannah.
Tell me a little bit about your internship this summer with Dr. Phippen.
I understand you were working on his US Department of Agriculture grant?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I got to work at the University of illinois at Urbana-Champaign"
[Text on screen:
"Hannah, UlUC] with small grains."
So wheat and oats.
And I got to do a lot of data collection on trying to find the best variety of wheat and oats.
And lots of work out the field.
Beth Seaton:
So are you a student at the University of illinois?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I'll be transferring there in the fall."
So I'll be a junior in the fall.
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
So what kind of advice would you give to anybody who is considering this sort of agricultural internship?
Hannah:
"I would say, definitely go for it."
"Because, I didn't know anything before"
I started it.
I got to learn a lot about different crops and
I got to get some hands-on experience before I started in the fall.
Beth Seaton:
I was just upstairs talking with Win Phippen and he told me I could find you down here.
I am over here talking to him about his new USDA grant so I thought I would just ask you a couple of questions if you have a couple of minutes.
William Bailey:
Certainly do.
And welcome to our Ag Mech Lab.
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, I've never been in here before."
It smells like an Ag Mech Lab.
Tell me a little bit about what a grant like Win Phippen's means for your department.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for Win, for the"
"School of Agriculture, and for our students."
It means a lot because it puts us on the cutting-edge on a lot of the research that is going on in plant breeding.
"And, more importantly, it gives students an opportunity to work with Win, who will teach them plant- breeding techniques, and they will apply what they learn in class under his supervision."
Beth Seaton:
"He seems really exicted about his program, and when I'm talking to him about it"
[Text on screen:
"Beth Seaton, Director, WlU Office of Sponsored Projects] you can just see the enthusiasm come out."
I've talked with a lot of other ag faculty from your department in my role as the director of sponsored projects.
"You have a lot of faculty member who are involved in not only in teaching in the classroom, but also heavily involved in research projects."
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
And it is that blend of
[Text on screen:
"Dr. William Baily, Director, WlU School of Agriculture] research and teaching, which, I think, is real hallmark of the School of Agriculture here at Western. because the faculty members are doing their scientific research, bringing it into the classroom themselves."
They are the teachers and they are the researchers.
"For example, here in the Ag Mech Lab, the students put on the Ag Mech Show, under the guidance of our ag mech instructor."
Beth Seaton:
And that is every February?
William Bailey:
Every February.
But it's student run.

There is also a beautiful rainbow in between.
Everything is just as he said.
But where is he?
He is not to be seen.
"Hey rain, are you pouring down only here.. ..or even at the place where he is?"
If you do so then he will think there is no rain.. .. and will not come.
Why dont you please rain at his place too?
"My dear, my cute rain!"
Please rain at his place also.
Do you believe at least now that rain unites both of us?
I already believe that.
It seems you did not believe completely.
Because you came so close but stayed that far.
Let the distance between the hearts melt slowly
Let me slowly open the door of naughty thoughts
The sky is sending down rain threads of love
And making a garland with rain drops as flowers
At this pleasant moment when it drenched us .. .. and joined us by the rainbow of love
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me proclaim that you are mine
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me establish this bond forever.
In your twists and turns I can see the beauty of lightning
I am seeing your spectacular dance in this first rain
I can hear your voice in this thunder
And do I hear your signals through.. ..the sounds of these rain drops
I am following the track of your heart
Shall I follow your foot steps as your wife
In this wetness when your shyness went away
Can any curtain stop your eagerness
I am gifting my beauty to your eyes
Let these rain drops show me your treasures
And let me remain indebted to the god of rain
I cannot stop the anxious youth anymore

Dealing with an eye injury is probably one of the most scary things for people to deal with.
"Often people don't like touching the eyes, don't like seeing any problems with them."
Even things like watching people put contact lenses in the eye can feel quite bad.
"Also, one of the senses you'd least like to lose is your sight."
So somebody with any eye injury is gonna be very very scared.
Now you can damage your eye through different things.
"Maybe just a bit of dirt or grime in the eye, maybe a scratch, maybe an impaled object into the eye."
"Also got chemicals, and things like this can all do damage."
"All right, both teams did a good job."
"Paul, Lee, go ahead and finish up your campsite."
I'll see you guys later.

So N becomes Y. Your code lights up.
Let's write that down.
"Let's do the next letter, U. U becomes T. Let's do M. And"
I've got H this time.
B. And E is W.
"Notice here, we had Y turn up twice."
And they turned up for two different letters.
"So N became Y, and then later on, E became Y. That's unusual."
The other unusual thing you may notice is that the two E's in Numberphile have turned into two different letters.
"So here, E became Y. But the second E became W."
"Now, this is why the Germans thought they had an unbreakable code."
"Old-fashioned code in the past, pen-and-paper codes that they used to use, if you had the same letter, it would become the same letter in the code."
Enigma is different.
"Probably, each time you did it, you would get a completely different code."
"Now, if we can break this code-- and by we, I mean the"
"Polish, the British, and the Americans-- if we can break this code in World War Il, we'll be able to read those German secret messages, which is what we did."
So let me show you how this machine works.
Let me open up the machine.
So we have three things here at the top.
These things are called rotors.
"And inside those rotors, try and imagine lots of wiring."
And it's all crisscrossed wiring as well.
"Now, if I press a letter, have a look what happens."
The rotors move.
"When this rotor does a full turn, it'll kick the next rotor one place."
"And then, the right-hand rotor keeps going."
"Eventually, the middle rotor does a full turn, and it will kick the left-hand rotor one place."
"So a fast rotor, a middle rotor, and a slow rotor."
"Imagine it like it's hands on a clock, like you've got a minute hand and an hour hand and a second hand."
That's the idea.
"Brilliant machine though this is, all it is, really, is just a circuit."
Here is a battery.
We got a couple of drops out.
So this is ready to go now.
And I can hook this up.
"Now, I'm going to put my drip chamber in here and this stretchy tubing goes below."
My tubing fits in here.
"Then this stretchy tubing, I'm going to use this little blue handle to help me loop this around, and it fits right in that little port."
Okay?
And I need to attach it to my patient.
"And again, before I have done this, before I do this, I would have checked for residual, checked for placement, I opened up my stopcock so it'll flow between the patient, into the patient from the bag."
Now I'm going to set my pump for what I need to run it at.
"So we first turn it on, and it says, ""Set dose."""
And that's the total volume you're going to give.
"So if we want to give 200 cc's, hold that down until we get to 200."
Hold that down.
There we go.
I went over a little bit.
Sorry.
Went over.
Okay.
So my dose is 200.
I need to set my rate.
"And that might be 30 cc's an hour, whatever your order says is what you would set it for."
Okay.
"So, I've set my rate, I've set my dose, and I hit run."
"Again, you want to make sure your patient is not flat, while they're receiving feedings, so they don't aspirate."
"Even though you're receiving, giving tube feedings on a pump, you still need to periodically check for residual and to give some free water per the order to give the patient some extra water."
"BYU-Idaho has additional facilities at off-campus locations such as the Outdoor Learning Center at Badger Creek with ropes courses and cross-country skiing and the Sky Mountain and Quickwater Lodges in the Teton Valley near Victor, Idaho."

It's really fast.
It's really easy.
"And in fact, voice search has become an incredibly popular application."
"Just to give you an idea, out of every four searches that we receive from Android devices in the USA, one comes from voice."
"That's 25%, which is pretty amazing."
So what I wanted to do today is actually show you how we're taking the voice UI to an entirely new level; through Cloud computing innovation.
Let me ask you a question.
"Have you found yourself, say, rushing at an airport?"
"You've got one bag in one hand, you've got a jacket or maybe, you know, a baby on the other hand and you need to send a quick text message but it's just too hard."
Wouldn't it be great if you could do it with just one single click?
Let me show you how you're going to be sending your text messages very soon.
Send text to Robert Hamilton: let's meet outside terminal
five in 10 minutes.
So this is going to process on the Cloud for a couple of seconds and then it's going to come back.
"So, let's see, perfect recognition."
Just nailed it.
And... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"By the way, Hugo, the important thing is the computer was in the back room somewhere, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
The computer was in the back room somewhere. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
The computer--the computer was somewhere... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Not this back room. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Not this back room.
The computer there was in the data centers.
You shipped it all the way somewhere.
"It did all that work, all the thousands of computers and it came back and boom. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
Yes.
That's exactly right.
"So, all"
"I have to do here, of course, is just press send and I'm done."
What you saw is called a voice action and there's a bunch of them in the new Android Voice Search application.
Let me show you another one.

Does your son know he's ill?
Does he know what's wrong with him?
How..
And so the the story begins
"City dweller, successful fella"
Thought to himself oops I've got a lot of money
I'm caught in a rat race terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the centuries anxiety
"Yes, it preys on him, he's getting thin"
"He lives in a house, a very big house in the country"
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
"Oh, it's like an animal farm lot's of rural charm in the country"
"He's got morning glory, life's a different story"
"Everything's going jackanory, in touch with his own mortality"

"We'll just have to take your word, won't we?"
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Thomas.
I apologize.
"Father, as Emily's parish priest... ...are you aware that she underwent advanced catechism training?"
Yes.
Yes.
Her family is very devout.
"And in that training, did she study Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?"
"Yes, I think that's right."
"Might have even studied Aramaic, Christ and his disciples' language... ...which, according to the transcripts, we also heard on the tape, correct?"
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
It wasn't part of her training.
But it was offered as an elective at her catechism school.
I have the school's curriculum here if you'd like to see it.
No.
I'll accept that she might have been exposed to that language.
"And according to her high school records... ...German was the foreign language she studied there, yes?"
I don't know.
If you say so.
"So that covers the strange languages we heard on the tape, correct?"
Did I miss any?
- No.
- Good.
We've already established you're no medical expert.
You said it's not your field.
But are you aware of the dual sets of vocal cords every human possesses?
- No.
"- Have you heard of... ...the superior vocal cords, which are higher than the ones we use to speak?"
No.
"So you didn't know that Tibetan monks, for example... ...as part of their religious training, teach themselves... ...to activate both sets of vocal cords at once?"
"No, I didn't know that."
"You guys, we live in this world where sexuality is kind of the center of everything."
At the center of how we think about relationships.
At the center of how we think about pleasures.
The center of how we think about a lot of aspects of our lives.
"And so asexual people are, you know, when I was in high school and middle school,"
"I had no idea how to think about relationships,"
I didn't know what was going on with me.
No one was talking about the fact that-
Star:
"So, you're a young man and you're an asexual and you don't have the same sexual feelings, you feel lost."
Like you're odd man out because nobody's telling you why you're not having the feelings that everyone else is talking about.
David:
No one's telling you that it's okay.
And no one's giving kind of a space and words you can use to talk about it.
Chandra:
You said middle school.
Is that how young you were when you found out?
David:
"Yeah, I was 13, 14 when I realized that, I mean, pretty much what all my friends started being sexual, I was just kind of like, ""All right"
"I know, have no way to figure out what's going on"" [laughter]"
I had no context to understand it.
And so I kind of figured out for myself.
"Well, I'm not experiencing these things."
I must be asexual.
Joy:
"Well, maybe it's repressed sexuality."
"Rather than, you know, that you're just like a normal guy walking around."
Maybe it's repressed because you don't want to face what the sexuality might look like.
Could that be?
Lie down.
[laughter]
David:
"No soy, no rice."

Here is another example of where you can get your protein from.
This is a vegan sausage.
"It's about that big, the size of this remote."

"Again, the healthiest food you can eat is whole foods."
I don't mean the supermarket.
"I mean the fruits, the vegetables, the rice, the beans, stuff that's fresh."
That is not processed.
And the last thing I want to show you is another video.
It is a happier video.
And this is the whole idea of change in perception.
"I know I am keeping you here, longer than you probably wanted."
But this is a really beautiful story.
And I hope you enjoy it.
"On the night of September 18, 2007 a cow was spotted on the streets of Queens."
"She was tagged for slaughter, but she escaped that fate and literally ran for her life."
Police and firefighters captured her and brought her to Animal Care &amp;amp; Control in Manhattan.
"From there, Farm Sanctuary's rescue team stepped in."
Maxine's dash for freedom.
"There she is, beautiful girl."
"She was tagged for slaughter, and it would have been her fate."
But she wanted to live and so she really ran for her life. and now she'll live out her life in the Sanctuary.
It is interesting how the public responds when one individual animal makes a run for her life.
They end up making headlines on national news.
People's hearts goes out to this one individual animal.
The cruelty that happens to farm animals is largely hidden behind factory farm walls.
And people aren't aware of that.
"When you look in her eyes, everyone wants the best for her."
"Apparently, a quarter of men have a problem with premature ejaculation."
The rest of just don't think it's a problem.
"See, science isn't all progress."

Gordon Brown has got his big new idea.
He says that he wants to make children stay at school until they're eighteen.
"That's just not living in the modern world, is it?"
Seventeen year olds having to go to school.
Who's going to pick their kids up from primary?
He wants to bring in ID cards. with retina scans and 49 items of information.
"ID cards won't stop your identity being stolen, it just means that once it's stolen, you're fucked."
"""Oh, I've left my wallet in the hotel,"
"I'm going to need new eyeballs and a finger transplant."""
"Gordon Brown has seriously said, he wants listening devices put into lamposts to fight terrorism."
Is that how terrorists work?
"""Come over here, we must discuss our evil plans in this brightly-lit area."
"We'll sing them out like a f* barber shop quartet."""
Do you think George Bush even knows who Gordon Brown is?
He probably thinks Tony Blair's put on weight and has had a mild stroke.
See that bishop up North somewhere who said that the floods were God's judgement on homosexuals.
"If that were true, Brighton would be like f Atlantis by now."
I'm all for gay adoption.
Gay men would make brilliant dads.
They already know where all the best parks are.
They already know how to put talcum powder on to a sore bottom.
I'd have loved to have had a gay dad.
Remember all that stuff at school.
"""My dad will batter your dad."
"My dad could batter your dad."""
"So if you take the dot product with itself, you get 1."
If you take a dot product with some other guy in your set you're going to get 0.
Maybe I can write it this way. vi dot vj for all the members of the set is going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j.
And then if these guys are the same vector-- I'm dotting with myself-- I'm going to have length 1.
So it would equal length 1 for i is equal to j.
So I've got a special set.
All of these guys have length 1 and they're all orthogonal with each other.
They're normalized and they're all orthogonal.
And we have a special word for this.
This is called an orthonormal set.
So B is an orthonormal set.
Normal for normalized.
Everything is orthogonal.
They're all orthogonal relative to each other.
And everything has been normalized.
Everything has length 1.
"Now, the first interesting thing about an orthonormal set is that it's also going to be a linearly independent set."
"So if B is orthonormal, B is also going to be linearly independent."
And how can I show that to you?
Well let's assume that it isn't linearly independent.
"Let me take vi, let me take vj that are members of my set."
And let's assume that i does not equal j.
"Now, we already know that it's an orthonormal set."
So vi dot vj is going to be equal to 0.
They are orthogonal.
These are two vectors in my set.
"Now, let's assume that they are linearly dependent."
I want to prove that they are linearly independent and the way I'm going to prove that is by assuming they are linearly dependent and then arriving at a contradiction.
So let's assume that vi and vj are linearly dependent.
Well then that means that I can represent one of these guys as a scalar multiple the other.
And I can pick either way.
"So let's just say, for the sake of argument, that I can represent vi-- let's say that vi is equal to sum scalar c times vj."
Let's say I've got me a set of vectors.
So let me call my set B.
"And let's say I have the vectors v1, v2, all the way through vk."
Now let's say this isn't just any set of vectors.
There's some interesting things about these vectors.
The first thing is that all of these guys have length of 1.
"So we could say the length of vector vi is equal to 1 for i is equal to-- well we could say between 1 and k or i is equal to 1, 2, all the way to k."
All of these guys have length equal 1.
Or another way to say it is that the square of their
lengths are 1.
The square of a vi whose length is equal to 1.
Or vi dot vi is equal to 1 for i is any of these guys.
"Any i can be 1, 2, 3, all the way to k."
So that's the first interesting thing about it.
Let me write it in regular words.
All the vectors in B have length 1.
Or another way to say is that they've all been normalized.
That's another way to say that is that they have all been normalized.
Or they're all unit vectors.
Normalized vectors are vectors that you've made their lengths 1.
You're turned them into unit vectors.
They have all been normalized.
"So that's the first interesting thing about my set, B."
And then the next interesting thing about my set B is that all of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
"So if you dot it with itself, if you dot a vector with itself, you get length 1."
But if you take a vector and dot it with any other vector-- if you take vi and you were to dot it with vj.
"So if you took v2 and dotted it with v1, it's going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j."
All of these guys are orthogonal.
Let me write that down.
All of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
And of course they're not orthogonal to themselves because they all have length 1.
I don't want to be involved in this anymore.
"Believe me, I wouldn't ask you this if there was any other solution."
"How could you believe that this is the only solution, Yasar?"
Enough...
Stop reminding Mustafa of Narin anymore.
Isn't everybody trying to make Mustafa forget her and get out of the hospital?
"If my brother forgets Narin, he will also forget himself."
"I thought like you, I wanted him to forget Narin..."
"But, he is my brother."
"When we take Narin out of him, we see that there is nothing left."
"And, you will see it as well."
You will understand.
It is true that we gave Mustafa Bulut high dosage medicine.
But this can't be the only reason for him shutting himself off and not remembering anybody.
He refuses to eat and take a test.
"In fact, he is aware of everything."
What he went through and being here affect his situation as well.
"For every patient in this kind of situation, there is a circumstance that initiates the healing period."
A constant that attaches him to the life.
- What can it be?
- It can be anything.
"Something he hid in the deepest corner of his mind, something he didn't share with anybody,"
Something that he would never give up even though he could give up on everything else
An object...
A memory...
A person...
We honorably succeeded in every war within 10 years.
"In 10 years, we created 15 million young people at every age..."
Sahan came here from Diyarbakir Prison.
He had very difficult times there.
"Now, whenever he sees somebody with uniform, he stands at ""Attention"" and starts singing a march."
We built railroad tracks across the country...
The woman paid him no heed.
"So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her."
Then Indra disappeared.
(Clap!
Clap!)
"And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared."
He realized at once what had happened.
"So, he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice."
"So, the god Vishnu arrived."
"""Are there any witnesses?"""
"""Just a one-eyed monkey,"" said the Brahmin."
"Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice, so she retold events exactly as they had happened."
Vishnu gave his judgment.
"""The god Indra has sinned, in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin."
"May he be called to wash away his sins."""
"So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse."
"And so it transpired that a horse was killed, a god was made sin-free, a Brahmin's ego was appeased, a woman ... was ruined, and a one-eyed monkey was left ..."
very confused at what we humans call justice.
In India there is a rape every three minutes.
"In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases."
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.
And it's not only about women.
"Look around you, look at your own countries."
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
"If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail."
"If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis, our tribals, the Naxalites."
"If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks."
There is a trend here.
"And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell their truth as The Truth."
"So, have we all become one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?"
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
Good morning.
"And so, that's the exciting thing about pennycress."
It's a brand new crop.
"No one has actually done much research on this particular crop, and so the possibilities are endless on pennycress."
And it's exciting to have students involved in this type of project.
And the employment opportunities are tremendous.
You're starting to see a lot companies starting to talk about green energy and green production.
"And so these students are going to be positioned very well, in terms of getting positions at these companies,"
"looking at new crops, and breeding new varieties, and things like that."
Beth Seaton:
"It's really exciting that we have these opportunities for students here in Macomb, illinois."
And I really appreciate you showing me your lab and talking to me about your project.
Win Phippen:
That's great.
Anytime.
"You know what, later on this week, we're actually having a Field Day about pennycress."
"It will be out at the research farm, and it's opportunity for not only producers, but also, say, for potential students and other students to come out and see what we're doing out in the field."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, great!"
I would love to come out if you would be willing to show it to me.
Win Phippen:
I'd love to.
Make sure to bring your boots!
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, thanks."
Win Phippen:
It should be fun.
Win Phippen:
All right.
Thanks for coming out.
This is the field plots for the pennycress research.
We've got several studies out here.
"The one to the north here is a planting density and planting methods study, where we are trying to answer the question of how many seeds do we need to put in the ground to get a decent yield."
"You're not safe either. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your dish was confused,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bizarre.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's almost like you're trying&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to outsmart your competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"You can bamboozle every amateur &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;behind you, but you&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;cannot bamboozle us three,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
let me tell you.
"Sorry, chef."
I just didn't...
This is my first time cooking a risotto. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stay there.
Based on that risotto...
The person leaving is...
Dave Mack.
Ohh. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your time is done&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please bring your apron&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on your station&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and leave the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
Thank you.
"Thank you, chef."
"I'm disappointed, but, at the same time,"
I'm glad I got to compete at this level.
The judges did make a mistake by sending me home.
I have a lot of creativity.
Thank you very much.
What can you say?
"You know, hope for the best, plan for the worst."
Tali.
"You have dodged that bullet, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but, Tali, you are flying&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by the seat of your pants.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Back on your station. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you so much.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Whew!
That's the sigh of relief.
"I dodged the biggest bullet of my life, and..."
I don't want to be in that position again.
"(Announcer) Next time on &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; it's the first team challenge of the season..."
Yeah!
(Announcer) And the surviving home cooks are going to war. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Hit the deck!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) Each team will battle it out to feed America's heroes.
Get a grip and wake up!
(Announcer) And the losers will go head to head in a pressure test...
"A French invention, a well-known Ime brand."
"Of course it's a French invention, that is exactly what I want."
How much would you like
Let's say a bagful.
"Thank you, just a moment."
"Excuse me, before I sell you the French invisibility powder, I am obligated to ask you if you know how to use it."
I suppose you ingest it.
-That's correct!
That's not all.
Many people think that all you have to do is ingest the powder and everything will be ok.
"When taking the invisibility powder, or any other medicine, it is important to believe in it."
Do you believe -Of course.
Thank you.
"In that case, here's what you do."
Do you have the patience to listen.
"-Yes, mr apothecary"
"Do the following - ingest a pinch of invisibility powder, kick the big toe of your left foot with the heel of your right foot, and shout in your mind, through the walls!"
"In that instant, you'll be invisible."
You may also walk through walls if you feel like it.
But only in the clothes you're wearing.
"For example, if you turn invisible and steal teamster Ruuskas' hat and run away it is going to look like only the hat is running down the street."
Will I stay invisible then
"Don't worry, Mr Vinski, if you want to become visible again, you just have to do everything in the opposite order."
"Kich the big toe of your right foot with the heel of your left foot and shout in your mind, walls through!"
In that instant you'll go back to normal.
"Yes, I think I got it."
Thank you!
-It's quite simple really.
All great things are simple.
"Excuse me, considering that my shoelace came untied with all this climbing you won't mind if I tie it up."
Of course!
-Thank you!
They're all at about the same place.
And with these bubbles...
"This isn't a video, the bubbles represent figures from a database that draw this diagram."
But I can still pull everything around.
That's the genius of the program.
We can choose specific bubbles and I can go to 1964 and the hostilities between Vietnam and the United States.
If I eliminate the other countries we see only Vietnam and the US.
Al Gore grabbed me and said:
And that was Al Gore!
Then Google's founders Sergei Brin and Larry Page approached me.
They wanted to talk some more and invited Ola and Anna to Google.
Rosling 's son Ola and his wife Anna developed the animated graphics along with three others.
Now they all have jobs at Google.
Google also bought the software for millions.
The money became the basis of the non-profit Gapminder foundation.
Today eight people collect data on development and distribute it free.
For example on video.
How high do they have to be?
Can you adjust the camera?
There was a gender conference on Sunday.
"Then I flew to the US and talked in Portland and at Google's AGM, called Zeitgeist, in San Francisco."
Then I was home...
And then I talked at the world dentist convention.
Then I spoke at a gas conference in Holland...
Now everyone wants to hear the professor.
"Norwegian oil companies, pharmacists, the Swedish medical association the UN Economic and Social Council, Telenor's managers"
European web developers and Bill Gates...
On April 15 I'm going to Trinidad to lecture to foreign ministers and entrepreneurs in Latin America at their meeting on development.
Then I head for Washington for the World Philanthropy Forum.
"Headed by Bill Clinton, they donate money to global development."
"You meet a lot of people, but do you feel you influence development?"
"Yes, because people gain a greater understanding of statistics."
"No, but I know what they taste like individually, so..."
"- Okay, well, don't we all?"
- Good luck. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Get creative.
Cold pan.
Cold pan.
"Felix, what's going on?"
Are you gonna try to pan-roast this and get the fat rendered?
Yeah.
It works better when the pan's on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe) You might run out of time.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I think that's good.
- Interesting.
- Yeah.
- Definitely.
"- Very interesting indeed. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Becky, I mean,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; she's going for dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A rhubarb tart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So, look, working with both&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;hands at the same time.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- I love the way she's multitasking."
- Absolutely.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm really concerned about Samantha.
Would you put sweet potato with rhubarb?
Ugh.
That sounds disgusting.
"So Felix says she's gonna bring her, you know, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;restaurant experience.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"But her duck, I put my whole hand in the pan. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not even on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It could be good if done right.
"So, Scott, I don't know what zone &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;he's going into.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's doing a profiterole&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;with sweet potato&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and duck breast.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Profiteroles are a dessert, and they remain dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And they shouldn't be tampered with.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Absolutely.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Now, you should be working on your finesse &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and making sure everything&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you put on the plate&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;has a reason.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Okay, five minutes left, guys."
Five minutes.
"Right, Tali, how you feeling? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Helene) Fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Fire."
[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We got a fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stand back.
Just stand back.
What happened about scouting that kid I mentioned earlier?
It's me.
Did you think about what I said last time?
I want to know first why you put forth those conditions?
I thought you told me to tell you what I wanted.
"If you interfere in my private life, I can't work with you."
Are you calculating which of the two will be more profitable?
I have to leave as I have an appointment.
I will call you back.
"Fine, do that."
But I can't wait long.
"As you know, there are many places that want me."
Call me soon.
President.
What is it?
Doctor Cho called several times.
It's Kang Hwi's examination results.
He asked me to give them to you directly.
"Alright, you may leave."
What do you mean blind?
His eye...
Are you saying that he is going to become blind?
Yes.
"Depending on the degree of damage to his optical nerves, he may be able to maintain a very slight vision."
"However, even that is hard to guarantee."
What about the treatment method?
"If the optical nerves become damaged, it is impossible to recover."
There is no special treatment as of now.
"In the case of Kang Hwi, the rate of progress is very fast."
Probably it is because of the characteristics of the work.
"Fatigue and stress are problems,  but strong lights are also fatal. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; President, only you will suffer like this. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I can't wait long. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is an important time now! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Make sure not to harm the company's image and make thorough preparations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; There is no treatment."
"Look for a plane ticket, the quickest one."
Look here!
What's this?
Is this true?
I knew it.
I knew he was like that.
What is this?
His fan club must be in havoc.
The response today was really good.
All the messages were full of compliments.
Of course!
They complimented that the style was good.
As the model is good.
"But, when did you learn the drums?"
You were really good.
Did you see Won Kang Hwi's photo?
It's no joke!
That's right.
I felt he was gay.
Yes.
What is this?
What is this?
"But, did the two of them really do it?"
"All the things mentioned so far are the private affairs of our singer. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;U Entertainment has done our best to protect the privacy of Won Kang Hwi.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However, judging that it could arouse social criticism,"

"Imagine being forced to move to a remote area with no jobs, no hospitals, and no schools."
"Without clean water, adequate food, or sanitary living conditions... the fabric of your community destroyed."
And it comes up and over like that.
So this is kind of what the actin would look like.
"And, of course, I want to make sure I draw my titin."
"Titin is kind of helpful, because it helps demonstrate that there's now a little bit of space there where there wasn't any before."
And so now there is some space between the z-disc and this myosin right here.
So there is some space between these myosins and the z-discs.
"In fact, I can draw arrows all the way around."
And so there is a little bit of work to be done.
But I still wouldn't say that it's maximal force.
"Because look, you still have some overlap issues."
"Remember, these myosins, right here, they're not able to work."
"And neither are these, because of this blockage that's happening here."
This blockage.
"Because of the fact that, of course, actin has a certain polarity."
So they're getting blocked.
They can't do their work.
"And so even though you get some force of contraction, it wouldn't be maximal."
So I'll put something like this.
This will be our second spot.
This will be number two.
"Now in number three, things are going to get much better."
So you'll see very quickly now you have a much more spread out situation.
Where now these are actually-- these actins are really not going to be in the way of each other.
"You can see they're not bumping into each other, they're not in the way of each other at all."
And so all of the myosins can get to work.
So the z-discs are now out here.
"My overall sarcomere, of course, as I said, was from z-disc to z-disc."
So my sarcomere is getting longer.
"And you can also see that because now there's more titin, right?"
And there isn't actually more titin.
I shouldn't use that phrase.
But the titin is stretched out.
Let's try that again.
"Actually,"
it's right there.
"And of course, I don't have a sim card here, so it didn't place the call, but it's incredibly fast and this was a real live local search."
The number is not stored in my address book or anything.
It literally took half a second to find it and call it.
Let me show you another one.
"So, a friend of mine told me about this museum here in"
Berlin.
He said there's all this cool Egyptian arts there.
"So I want to drive there, but the name is very long, it's complicated, I forgot it."
I can't remember what the name of the museum was.
"Well, maybe I could do something like this:"
Navigate to the museum with Egyptian stuff.
And let's see what I get back here.
So it recognized what I said.
"So this is going to launch Google navigation which will figure out where I want to go and, in fact, it's right there."
It's the Pergamon Museum.
So I can just click on it and get directions.
So let's think about what happened here.
"So, first of all, my phone is with me and it knows that I'm in Berlin."
So it knows to search here.
"Secondly, there are thousands of pages on the web about the Pergamon Museum which obviously talk about the Egyptian art that's in this museum."
"So, all that Google has to do here is relate and connect all these pieces of information together and come up with a magical answer like what you just saw."
This is precisely what Eric means by Cloud Computing Innovation.
Let me show one more voice action.
This happens to be my favorite.
"Listen to Lady Gaga, Just Dance."
"So this is going to launch your favorite music application, in my case it's Spotify, and it will just going to play the song for you."
We'll stop that.
So those are voice actions.
They are
You do not eat meat?
"Where do you get your protein from?"""
"Like all of a sudden, ""Holy shit, it's all of a sudden dawned on me,"
I have been without protein in the last 8 years.
"Let 's go to McDonalds and get a Big Mac!"""
"Like, I am about to fall down or something."
Or pass out.
Have you ever heard of somebody in the U.S. suffering from a lack of protein and going to the hospital?
It's unheard of.
"It's funny, even dealing with kids, I have a kid say,"
"""I tried to go vegan for a day, and I got really sick."""
What?
It's like people they know somebody who is vegan who is sick.
Really?
I know tons of meat eaters who are sick.
"Yes, you can be an unhealthy vegan."
"What I am telling you is it does not matter if you are eating meat milk, dairy and fish or you are eating a plant based diet, you should know what you putting into your body."
"You should know how many grams of protein you are getting the amount of iron, calcium that you are getting."
"By the way, people say omega-3 from fish."
"You can get that from the seeds, the nuts."
You can get that from other things.
Flax seed is a very good example.
Think about this: these are the largest and strongest land animals on Earth.
What does their diet consists of?
Plants!
"You're in good company, if you're only eating plants."
"And what is so ironic about this is that the largest and strongest land animals not only do they just eat a plant based diet, they also live the longest."
This animal can live to 70 years.
"They can live to about 50 to 60 years, the gorilla about 50 years in the wild."
And their diet consists of nothing but plants.
Are you going to tell any of them they are missing out on protein?
This animal has 10 times the upper body strength of the average male adult.
"Now, for the most important question:"
"Is Father Richard Moore guilty... ...beyond a reasonable doubt, of negligent homicide?"
"Did he, in fact, neglect Emily's needs in such a way... ...that her death is now on his hands?"
No!
That is not a fact.
It is not a fact that Emily was epileptic.
It is not a fact that she was psychotic.
Facts... ...leave no room for possibilities.
The only fact... ...the only thing I know beyond a doubt in this case... ...is that Father Moore loved Emily with his whole heart.
He did everything in his power to help her.
He has risked his very freedom so we could hear her story.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...in my job I sometimes have to defend bad men.
Father Richard Moore is not one of them.
Don't send a good man to prison.
I'm not asking that you believe everything that Father Moore believes.
I'm simply asking that you believe in Father Moore.
"Madam Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?"
"We have, Your Honor."
Please read the verdict out loud.
"""In the case of *The People* *v. Father Richard Moore*... ...we, the jury, find the defendant... ...guilty of negligent homicide."""
The court thanks the jury for its service.
Sentencing for this case will be set for April 3rd.
"Your Honor, if it pleases the court... ...Father Moore requested at the start of trial... ...that if found guilty, he would be sentenced immediately."
"Yes, I recall that."
Does the prosecution have any objection to expedited sentencing?
Very well.
"Father Richard Moore, do you understand this sentence... ...which has been found against you?"
"- Yes, Your Honor."
And do you understand the gravity of this crime?
"That you may, under the law, be sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?"
"Yes, I do."
Are there any statements you wish to make... ...before I impose this sentence?
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
AUDlENCE:
Hi.
I have a question about lining stuff up.
"So in Android, I would try to put an image next to a text view, and then there would be this little bit of space from the top of the text view until the text actually shows up, so it does not line up."
"The top of the image does not line up with my text, and it bothers me."
"I try to fix it, but there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it."
Should I even try?
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yes.
Please try.
"I am reminded again and again that that's a little bit difficult right now because the reality is top of the text as we perceive it is the top of the caps, it's usually the place where we want to measure from."
"And in this case in a lot of the systems, it measures from the clipping bounds."
"So measuring from the very top of the text, if you're building these kinds of systems, measuring from the cap height and the baseline is where you want to measure from."
"So you may have to do some kind of-- people always hate negative margins, or I don't know how to technically achieve it."
AUDlENCE:
"I mean, I guess the next question is, if I decided to do it, how do I figure out, what is the amount to shift for my font?"
Is there a computational way to do it?
"I don't want to just trial and error, one pixel, two pixel, I do it until it lines up."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yeah.
We can talk a little bit after.
ALEX FAABORG:
It's an important limitation.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"Em height times 0.23, I think."
ALEX FAABORG:
But thank you for trying to line it up.
That's great.
AUDlENCE:
"This is something I've been really curious ever since Google started rolling out the new design, because in"
Okay.
So what have we got on this
left-hand side?
A linear combination.
"It's a linear combination now of three vectors,"
and they happen to be -- each one is a three dimensional
"vector, so we want to know what combination"
of those three vectors produces that one.
Shall I try to draw the column
"picture, then?"
"So, since these vectors have three"
components -- so it's some multiple -- let me draw in the first
column as before -- x is two and y is minus one.
Maybe there is the first column. y -- the second column has maybe a
"minus one and a two and the y is a minus three, somewhere,"
"there possibly, column two."
And the third column has --
"no zero minus one four, so how shall I draw that?"
So this was the first component.
The second component was a minus
one.
Maybe up here.
"That's column three,"
that's the column zero minus one and four.
This guy.
"So, again, what's my problem?"
What this equation is asking me to do is to combine these three vectors
with a right combination to produce this one.
"Well,"
"you can see what the right combination is, because in"
"this special problem, specially chosen by the lecturer,"
that right-hand side that I'm trying to get is actually one of these
I'm going to have to get my calculator out.
So it's going to be 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared plus 7 minus 4.2 squared.
And it's going to be all of that-- I know it looks a little bit funny-- divided by the number of data points we have-- divided by 5.
So let me take the calculator out.
All right.
Here we go.
Actually maybe I should have used the graphing calculator that I have.
Let me see if I can get this thing-- if I could get this.
There you go.
"Yeah, I think the graphing one will be better because"
I can see everything that I'm writing.
"OK, so let me clear this."
"So I want to take 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared, where I'm just taking the sum of the squared distances from the mean squared, one more, plus 7 minus 4.2 squared."
So that's the sum.
The sum is 38.8.
So the numerator is going to be equal to 38.8 divided by 5.
"So this is the sum of the squared distances, right?"
Each of these-- just so you can relate to the formula-- each of that is xi minus the mean squared.
And so if we take the sum of all of them-- this numerator is the sum of each of the xi minus the mean squared from i equals 1 to n.
And that ended up to be 38.8.
And I just calculated like that.
"I just took each to the data points minus the mean squared, add them all up, and I got 38.8."
And I went and divided by n which is 5.
So this n up here is actually also 5.
Right?
And so 38.8 divided by 5 is 7.76.
So the variance-- let me scroll down a little bit-- the variance is equal to 7.76.
"Now if this was a sample of a larger distribution, if this was a sample-- if the 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7, weren't the population-- if it was a sample from a larger population, instead of dividing by 5 we would have divided by 4."
"And we would have gotten the variance as 38.8 divided by n minus 1, which is divided by 4."
So then we would have gotten the variance-- we would have gotten the sample variance 9.7 if you divided by n minus 1 instead of n.
"But anyway, don't worry about that right now."
That's just a change of n.
And I saw something lying on the sidewalk.
*It was a gold locket... *
*... with the initials E. C.B.* *engraved on it. *
My middle name is Christine.
Erin Christine Bruner.
"And of all the people walking by that day, I found that locket."
What are the chances of that?
"I don't know, maybe it was a sign."
Or maybe it was just some incredible coincidence.
"But it made me feel... ...like no matter what mistakes I've made in the past... ...at that moment, I was exactly where I was meant to be."
Like I was on the right path.
You sound more like a mystic than an agnostic.
Are you wearing the locket now?
No.
You should.
The archdiocese doesn't want you to testify.
They're just afraid that I'll embarrass them.
Testify to some medieval-sounding supernatural nonsense.
They're expecting me to talk you out of it.
I've just decided I'm not even gonna try.
Why not?
If the archdiocese wants to avoid embarrassment... ...they need you to walk out of here a free man.
I believe a jury will find you sincere and credible... ...and when Dr. Cartwright corroborates your testimony... ...and refutes the prosecution's medical arguments... ...we'll get an acquittal.
And everyone will thank me for it.
Emily!
God help me.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?"
I do.
"Father Moore, before you could perform the exorcism... ...you had to get the sanction of the Church, correct?"
"Yes, on October the 27th of last year... ...I presented my assessment and recommendation to the archbishop... ...and he authorized the exorcism that day before I left the office."
Tell us what happened that night.
I drove home.
Dietrich stated on a note on her Facebook wall:
"""If reporting a rape only got me to the point that I'm not allowed to talk about it, then I regret it."
"I regret reporting it."""
"But, one good thing that has come out of this is that Savannah recently opened her Facebook page to the public, allowing hundreds of random friend requests from people offering financial support and petitions in her cause."
"And with her Facebook page and Twitter account,"
"Savannah Dietrich gets to control what people see of her, for once."
"It's ironic that technology, which helped humiliate her previously, is now allowing her to put her best foot forward."
"The judge behind the ruling is named Judge Deana ""Dee"" McDonald."
The defense attorneys for her rapists are
Chris Klein and David Mejia.
Oh!
"And her rapists, the boys who decided to violate this girl and spread that violation throughout her highschool, potentially ruining her youth, their names are Will Frey and uh I'll spell this for you if you want to write it down, that's Will, like Will, and then Frey."
F. R. E. Y.
"And the other rapist is Austin Zehnder, that's Z.E.H.N.D.E.R."
Please do not share this information or let anyone know that there are two rapists in Kentucky named Will Frey and Austin Zehnder.
Because Judge Deana McDonald doesn't want you to.
Nor do their lawyers David Mejia and Chris Klein.
"That's David Majia and Chris Klein, uh, Will Frey"
Austin Zehnder
Austin Zehnder and Will Frey
Perfect!
Now of course there are two sides to every story.
"For example, Will Frey and Austin Zehnder ""allegedly"" raped Savannah Dietrich."
Oh!
Wait.
Sorry.
No.
"They plead guilty, so yeah, they definitely raped her."
"The thing is it's important that we protect the identities of Will Frey and Austin Zehnder, because, like, this could look really bad for Will Frey and Austin Zehnder."
"Like, real bad."
Cuz they're rapists.
It's insane to me that a court system would allow a victim of sexual assault to be silenced.
(Laughter)
Anyway --
"When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design."
Thank you.

Connecting route through the Andes.
Farewell Argentina.
San Fancisco Pass.
Did you enjoy the ride Harry?
- Yes.
"Through the Andes, did you like it?"
"- Yes, I really did."
Did anything exciting happen during the trip.
"- Yes, Steven did some stunts."
"Dust, dust and more dust."
What is your personal experience this Dakar?
- An enormous experience
"This is Steven, our reckless pilot."
He hits the gas peddle at the right moments.
Steven wants a hummer for the next Dakar.
We flew with the Dodge for a little while.
Alle the cargo is still on the truck.
"Only one fog light is broken, that's all."
and we arrived safely in the bivouac again
"Hello and welcome to Freshly Served, the healthy vegan cooking show."
Iím Heather and tonight we are going to make some maple Dijon glazed carrots and parsnips.
This is something that I love to make as part of appetizers night.
Phil and I sometimes
like we were having a celebration to just do a whole dinner of appetizers but it is also be a nice side for other dish or whatever you like.
"So for those of you who have not seen parsnips before they look like a white carrot, they usually have a very fat end as suppose to carrots which are usually fairly uniform just getting skinnier at the tip."
So you wanna have the same amount of parsnips as carrots.
"It doesnít really matter how much youíre doing but anyway with carrots I donít peel them, I just trim off either end and give them a good scrub with a potato scrubber brush."
Three hundred and sixty three...
Yes.
[Laughter].
Ok.
"These belong to some equivalence class, and we'll give that a name."
We'll call that equivalence class one third.
Are you with me?
Ok?
"Now, once you have that, then of course you can talk about fractions, right?"
"And then everybody knows how to work with fractions, which are really disguised ways of dealing with the equivalence relation that is embedded here."
What's the equivalence relation?
Everybody learns in grade school.
When are two fractions equivalent?
"I'll have you think about that, but the set of all such classes will be called Q, which is basically the set of all such equivalence classes... of pairs... of these ordered pairs."
Right?
What ordered pairs?
The ordered pairs in Z cross Z. Ok?
"We might have to be a little careful here, maybe Z cross Z minus 0... the set containing 0... period."
Ok?
Ok.
Everybody with me?
What have we just one?
I've just defined what I mean by Q. Right?
"It's an ordered pair, and... it's equivalence classes of ordered pairs."
"Now, what we haven't said is what the equivalence relation is, so..."
What is the equivalence relation?
"By the way, before we even talk about what the equivalence relation is, what's another thing you might want to be true about Q?"
"Aside from the fact that, you know,"
"I've just said that there's a set here, but somehow... how's it related to the set that I began with?"
"I might want to delineate that, I might want to tell you how is it that Q is related to Z."
"And usually, the way you think about Q, is that it somehow extends Z, right?"
"You have a bunch of points, these are whole numbers on the number line that you grew up thinking about, and now we fill them in with a bunch of points in between, right?"
And then they feel very happy here.
And I am happy when I see they are happy.
What impresses me the most is the credit from my customers.
"Before, when we were still not ready to open the fish-watching area."
Sometimes the customers would complain about us.
"But then later, after two or three months, the customers came back again"
He said
"I would like to come back, because I appreciate your service attitude"
This made me very happy
I was so touched.
Then all what they used to complain or even scold at me is nothing to me at all.
"With their credit and appreciation, I feel I need to work harder."
I should work harder to have the people see what we own.
"Here these ""screws"" got much ""torture"" from us"
Yap......
Because sometimes we force them to learn
And also we give them much pressure
"But from all this, you can see, from the first year, the second year, to the third year......"
"Everybody has improved himself gradually, everyone"
"Little by little, they are not afraid of approaching people"
"Gradually, they become more willing to try new things"
"Before, they always said, ""No, I don't want, I can't"""
We are happy when we see they are changing their attitude gradually.
These employees have grown up.
"So, the happiness is,"
That I put emotion whenever I am cooking
That I learn what I didn't know
That a tour guide shows me a Like!
"That means, yes, you are doing better"
Welcome to Tanayiku!
Many small pieces of Happiness here Pile up a big Blessing!

This is SlSTAR
The title song is more  mass oriented song
"In one words, it's like intensity"
"I think it's wanting love, so I think it's loneliness"
I thought it had a lot  of colors to it
Every one of us has  our own part in it
It's a little bit different from the old songs
There are a lot of point  choreography on stage
"For me, I have dance with  a male dancer"
"When Bora is dancing, magic powder comes down"
"For Dasom, she uses  stick and hat to show"
Musical side of the song
We are together again after  a bit of Unit activities
And it's really great to  come back with regular album
We all have very different  colors of our own
You will get to know each members better with the song
Please love us
"This was SlSTAR, thank you!"
Would I get  married before 30
My heat is already tired  from giving love oh
Even from the raindrop sound  My heart hurts
I'm still young and delicate  Naïve and delicate
Have a lot of tears
I cry and ask for it
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
Would you come  before morning
"I only have you,  like a fool Oh"
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
I cry and ask for it
"So let's see, this is time 0, this is 5 seconds."
"So if we look at the hare's position after 5 seconds, so after time equals 5 seconds, it does indeed look like the hare's position-- the hare is just sitting there at the 90-foot marker line and is not moving at all."
The rate of change of position with respect to time for the hare at that point is 0.
"So this does seem true, it just doesn't apply to the question."
It's not the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on this interval.
This is applying to H of t.
The hare runs at a speed of 18 feet per second for the first 5 seconds.
So let's see if this is true.
"For the first 5 seconds, so this is 5 seconds going by, the hare is able to cover a distance of 90 feet."
"So the hare is able to go 90 feet in 5 seconds, so for the first 5 seconds, the hare is-- hare's rate is 90 feet."
You could say average rate of change is 90 feet in 5 seconds.
And 90 divided by 5 is indeed 18 feet per second.
"So once again, this third statement is true, it just doesn't apply to T of t."
It's not addressing the question.
Now this fourth choice is that the hare wins the race.
"Now, winning the race, they have to get to 100 feet in the shortest amount of time."
This is 100 feet right over here.
So let's see.
So it looks like only the tortoise even gets to that point.
"At 20 seconds, the tortoise gets to the 100-foot mark."
The hare is still hanging around taking a nap or something at 90 feet.
So this is actually outright false.
The tortoise wins the race.
So we will definitely go with our first choice.
"Fred:Hey, it's Fred, and today's May Day."
"Yay, May Day!"
"So, yeah I'm gonna deliver everyone in my whole entire neighborhood May baskets."
Full of love and happiness.
"I don't know if you already realised this, but, my mom got me a ""Fred"" shirt."
"She said that we can't afford to get a lot of shirts, so, I'm just gonna wear this shirt for the rest of my life."
"No offense to you guys who have a ton of shirts, but, it's more cool just to have one shirt."
I hope I didn't offend anybody.
We will all die... all will die!
No!!
What do we do!?!!?
"Let's survive from this survive, so we all can fulfill our dreams"
let's lead this war to victory it's better if the one that's going to die anyways die right?
I will go!
Injured Jun officer volunteered to take the captain's place in the plan.

Hi!
Today I am going to talk about how to create this effect; this infinite white background.
If you saw the Apple commercials;
"And when I add them, I get 0."
"That must mean that a plus minus b is equal to 0, or that a is equal to b, that we're dealing with the same number."
"We're essentially dealing with the same number, the negatives of each other."
So what can it be?
"Well, if we're doing the same number and they're negatives of each other, 64 is exactly 8 squared."
"But it's negative 64, so maybe we're dealing with one negative 8, and we're dealing with one positive 8."
"And if we add those two together, we do indeed get to 0."
So this will be x minus 8 times x plus 8.
Now you don't always have to go through this process I did here.
"You might already remember that if I have a plus b times a minus b, that that's equal to a squared minus b squared."
"So if you see something that fits the pattern, a squared minus b squared, you could immediately say, oh, that's going to be a plus b-- a is x, b is 8-- times a minus b."
Let's do a couple more of just general problems.
I won't tell you what type these are going to be.
Let me switch colors.
It's getting monotonous.
Let's say we have x squared minus 24x plus 144 is equal to 0.
"Well, 144 is conspicuously 12 squared."
And this is conspicuously 2 times negative 12.
Or this is conspicuously negative 12 squared.
So this is negative 12 times negative 12.
This is negative 12 plus negative 12.
"So this expression can be rewritten as x minus 12 times x minus 12, or x minus 12 squared."
We're going to set that equal to 0.
This is going to be 0 when x minus 12 is equal to 0.
"You can say either of these could be equal to 0, but they're the same thing."
Add 12 to both sides of that equation and you get x is equal to 12.
"And I just realized, this problem up here, I factored it, but I didn't actually solve the equation."
So this has to be equal to 0.
Let's take a step back to this equation up here.
And the only way that this thing over here will be 0 is if either x minus 8 is equal to 0 or x plus 8 is equal to 0.
So add 8 to both sides of this.
You get x could be equal to 8.
"Once they get to know her, and when people are able to identify with an individual and look her in the eye and see that she is living, feeling being who has a will to live, then people care."
I have been working here with Animal Care and Control for almost nine years.
This morning was really astonishing to me.
"All of a sudden it dawned on me, this sweet, innocent cow running away from being slaughtered."
"And I never been thought about it before, that something is actually being slaughtered, and it is my ground beef, and it is my steak, and stuff like that."
"And we have been eating this for years,"
I never pictured that face on that.
And it hurt.
I can't do that anymore.
I can't.
"So, now, we are all work on not eating meat."
Me and my entire family.
Because I am realizing that this is a life we saved today.
And with my family we will be saving a couple of more.
Thank you.
She is about a year old absolutely beautiful Hereford.
And those unfortunately are cows that are used for meat.
"She was most likely at a live market and because they have a very strong will to live,"
"like any living creature, she got loose."
"She had a will to live, and she did it."
Hello!
"When she is going now, she is gonna have cows of her own breed even."
She is gonna be so happy.
"When the trailer arrives, the cows in the herd will moo."
Yeah.
They will moo in a big line.
Everybody lines up.
They will start mooing to her to comfort her and to tell her that they are there.
And she will moo back.
"Any animal, any creature has a strong will to live."
"She is an ambassador for all animals, who are still suffering in slaughterhouses and on farms, and who don't don't have such a lucky outcome."
People love a happy ending and it's happy.
"Odysseus sends back the message, not yet."
Let's wait until nighttime.
Very interesting exchange of messages there.
"They're, they're easy enough to take on the plain surface level and may well be that all that's happened is Penelope has said, yeah, sure I'd like to talk to this stranger."
I could find out about my husband.
"And this stranger says, well let's do it later on."
It's more convenient for me.
"But, there's something also, the, the, the forwardness of Penelope may, asking to make an audience with this stranger whose nothing but a beggar."
"And then the stranger coming back and saying, rather than just sort of dropping everything and saying, oh my gosh the lady of the house is willing to speak with me."
"But rather, saying, hold off, wait."
"Let's do it at nighttime, when we can do it in a different kind of setting."
"Both those things I think are, it's possible that there's a subterranean back message being sent in the message."
"So, kind of like, metadata built into the message that's being sent that says ""I want to pay some attention to you"" on both sides."
We'll see what that attention's going to be in the coming books.
"So, things start to unfold rapidly and quickly in seventeen through twenty."
"Lots of the good stuff starts to, unpack itself here."
Looks Like her .. act like her ..
Identifies with with her ..
And might go further than that ..
"Then this famous person, starts to become the center of their lives"
"Then, it controls their lives"
In looks
In lifestyle
And even in their thoughts ..
They were Affected by her
Ane became ..
Little Monsters !
After the break ..
""" What ?"
"It has just started ? """
""" oh God hurry up -_- """
"When some is identified, with a famous character .."
And the trouble is the toilet was about 20 meters outside the hall.
[Some laughter].
In the darkness.
"So this poor little, you can imagine what he felt like, he had the pain in his bladder against the fear of that ghost getting him."
So he made a run for it - desperation.
"He ran and he got to the toilet, locked the door."
He'd only been in that toilet for about a few minutes when he heard the steps.
[Laughter].
And it came right to the toilet cubicle he was in and started scratching.
Can you get a scratch..?
[Scratches tissue box].
I tried to get some special effects.. for the tape
[Laughter].
A scratch at the door..and this poor little novice didn't come out of that toilet cubicle for about 3 hours.
[Laughter].
And when he came out he was telling us - the ghost came to get him!
The ghost!
"And he heard it, he heard it scratching."
Another monk saw that ghost..
You know what it was?
It was a civet cat.
Like a possum.
Those of you who've been to Asia know they've got squat toilets.
"The toilets are actually on the floor, and that little possum, civet cat, every evening he would go into that toilet cubicle to get some water to drink from the toilet bowl."
That was his drinking place.
And so that evening all that happened was this little possum walked to that toilet and was scratching the door
"- ""please let me in, I'm thirsty""."
[Laughter].
"But that little novice [laughs], he was a ghost coming to get me!"
"And you can actually see how because of wrong thinking, and because there was a funeral that day, thinking all day, thinking all evening, and what was just a little jungle cat, just coming for a drink, he thought it was a ghost and he was in that toilet for about 3 or 4 hours - poor little novice."
Now what about you?
What do you get afraid of?
I always had to go in there and fiddle them.
"Then another version of WOlips would come out, and I'd have to change the things again."
In ANT 1.6 they added the ability to import one build.xml file into another.
That's a really good thing to do.
"For an example of doing things like that, see the Wonder build system."
"It is really quite complex, but you can find a lot of interesting things in there."
I'm currently redoing our build system so that I have a couple of shared files that all the projects use.
This is what I've ended up for a build file for a WO framework.
"That's it, three lines and a couple properties."
It's a lot easier to maintain.
- OK.
Just one comment on that.
Look at Maven.
You can actually build some awesome tools with Maven.
I think there was a demonstration last year from Jake.
Maven is actually an extremely good tool to build Web Objects.
That's how we build Web Object every night.
We use Maven.
We've got a Maven build system for Web Objects.
It's really awesome.
It takes care of all the dependency.
"It's really reliable, in fact, you don't have to write much code if you accept two of the Maven conventions."
- I don't.
- We use some funky tools.
You can ask Mike.
"Every time I tell him one of them he goes, ""Oh, I want to die."""
"Our build files are highly customized, so I don't know how happy it would be with Maven, but I'm not going to go there."
"There was a question and answer here, I've been doing some questions."
I'm going to skip over this.
"We don't have time to go into the fun topics, but if you want something to talk about over beer tonight..."
"- They're hard to read from this distance, and we'll take that as a good thing."
- It didn't look so bad on the screen.
"People go on hunts every day, and usually no one gets killed."
"But today, one man gets charged by an elephant."
And everybody can see that he got killed by an elephant.
Why did he happened to be in the path of the elephant?
Why did the elephant go in a different way?
Why did he hunt a slightly different way?
Why didn't the elephant here him and run away?
The man would not have been in the path of that elephant if not for witchcraft.
"To put it another way, the Zande have no concept of bad luck."
"When something bad happens, when misfortune comes along, it's due to witchcraft."
"Someone, a witch, made it happen."
Why did my crops fail when everyone else's thrived?
Why did the tornado zig in set aside so it hit my house and not my neighbor's house?
Why did the mosquito bite me and not use so I got malaria but you didn't?
To these-- the answer to these questions for the Zande is witchcraft.
In Zande Land anyone could be a witch.
Children and the very old are usually not accused of witchcraft because it's rare for them to seriously offend people.
But almost any adult you meet could have witchcraft inside him or her.
So you better be nice to everyone.
Witchcraft is never random.
It's personal.
The person who causes you harm knows you and probably lives near you.
He or she is someone you've offended.
"So when something bad happens you ask yourself, who have I offended?"
Have I insulted someone?
Have I cheated someone?
Have I slept with someone's spouse?
Did I break a promise?
Those are all the kinds of things that could make someone's witchcraft heat up.
"The Zande know-- okay, now the part for the medical students in particular about how-- what witchcraft has to do with the treatment of illness."
The Zande know that people get sick.
And they usually get better.
It's the perfect color and so hip
Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
Making sure the cloth's correctly facing
I'm stitching Twilight's dress
"Yard by yard, fussing on the details"

Make her something perfect to inspire
Even though she hates formal attire
Gotta mind those intimate details
Even though she's more concerned with sales
It's Applejack's new dress
Dressmaking's easy For Pinkie Pie something pink
Fluttershy something breezy
Blend color and form...
Do you think it looks cheesy?
"Something brash, perhaps quite fetching"
Hook and eye Couldn't you just simply die?
Making sure it fits forelock and crest

That's it.
Keep them closed.
Don't look.
"Okay, you can look now!"
These are your new outfits.
"If you have ever put your head on a washing machine, that's how it felt."
That's how I heard the airplane.
It's a dream come true for me.
I wanted to be instrument rated for a long time and now I can fly blind and deaf!
(laughter)
I'm up in the clouds and it is freedom.
That's what it is.
It's all about freedom.
Announcer:
"With his high energy, warm hearted style; Stephen Hopson, a gifted story teller, unpacks the steps to overcoming adversity, which he calls the ""HEAR PRlNClPLE."""
Have a passion.
Entertain the possibilities.
Act on your intuition.
Remember the people who helped you.
Stephen:
"Without passion, you can't go anywhere."
You are stuck where you are.
"But with passion, you will be amazed at how doors of opportunity will open up for you."
Announcer:
"Along the way to becoming a pilot, Stephen's passion opened up another door of opportunity, which led him to become a successful broker on Wall Street with Merril Lynch."
But there were obstacles along that path as well.
Stephen:
"In order to overcome adversity, you need to be able to trust your instincts."
I saw an advertisement in the paper for stock brokers and I thought what a good career change that might be.
So I called up the guy for the interview.
I had an interview with the vice-president.
"I walked into his office, I was really nervous."
I was intimidated.
The office reeked of wealth.
I met with him for twenty minutes.
"He said, ""OK, you are meeting with twelve people on my floor."""
"""Each and every one of them said you're not going to make it."
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
"We've had our doubts, but now we're fine"
"And I love you, I swear that's true"
I cannot live without you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bare my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
"I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow"
"I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow"
"I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow"
"I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow"
What would you do to solve an equation with a fraction as the coefficient?
"If you are at 40 and you are imagined you are at 40, point number 40, the last PMT or C is $10,000, so at time 40, it's exactly ten, but when you look back if you were to, you have to carry past money amounts you've invested as earning money, which is good news for you, right?"
And it's earning how much?
"Eight percent and let me, let me tell you, that's not bad at all, aleight."
And we'll talk about that when we talk about risk and return in a second.
"So, do you understand the nature of the beast?"
The beast is not easy.
"It's not easy, it's like doing 39 future values and adding them up, right?"
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to now shift to using a calculator.
"Okay, Okay, so, if you notice I am on the top panel and I am going to use the formula of PMT."
"Remember, whatever you don't know, you type in here."
"So, that's yeah, PMT, alright."
"And the one thing, you have to do before you do PMT and not get excited like PM, Mr. Hyper, you have to put equal sign so that, otherwise, you will get all kinds of garbage."
"Okay, you open it up."
What is the first number that shows up?
The first number that shows up is the rate of return and we know how much are we earning.
We earning 0.08.
"Again, emphasizing this."
The only reason I'm using Excel right now is what?
"Simply, because the calculation is very difficult."
But I've explained to you what's going on.
"You're doing 40 going forwards, but actually only 39."
Because the first one is zero and the last one is just itself.
"So, so that's why, that's it, okay?"
"So, you put a comma, and what's the next one?"
40.
"Number of periods, right?"
"And, actually let me just back track a"
little bit.
"The thing that we want to figure out is FV, so put an FV and now I want rate 0.08."
You see what I was doing we will do next time.
"So, the number of periods is 40 and in this case, I know my PMT and my PMT is $ten, 000, right?"
"And what is PV, don't worry about it, it's not in there and just hit, okay?"
We used to wait.
Sometimes it never came.
We
used to wait.
Sometimes it never came.
We used to wait.
Still moving through the pain.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOKE:
"Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to Dr. Eric Schmidt."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Thank you.
I'm over here.
I'm over here.
Thank you very much. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; GÖKE:
"Mr. Schmidt, we're honored. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Thank you all, and thank you very much for having me back to this, such a gorgeous city and congratulations to this show for 50 plus years of great achievements."
"In the years that this show has been going on, there's been a lot of discussion about new ages, new eras, new ideas and I am absolutely convinced that we're about to see a new age, an age of augmented humanity."
"A time when computers will work for us, and they'll make it possible for us to do the things that we really want to do, which are mostly around people and happiness and making the world a better place."
"And when I think about the compute--the consumer electronics industry in particular, what you all have built over the years, we have an opportunity now to entertain, to inform, to educate with technology that we've never been able to do before."
And that's what I want to talk about in this show.
"Today, when you look at a consumer electronics product, think about it as a music player."
"If it's not connected to the internet, it just has what's stored on it."
It can't get the music that's nearby.
It can't get the latest music.
It has to be on the net.
The same is true of everything.
That change is very subtle.
40.
"So, please re, remember there's always one more point in time than the number of periods."
"If you remember that or if you recognize that, you'll be okay."
"So, how maNy points in time, 41."
"Zero, one through 40."
How many periods of time?
"Well, it takes two points of time to make a period, so there one less."
"One, two."
"So, what we'll do to make our life simple is we'll assume that the first $10,000 is at the end of the year."
Why did I do that?
I could always start saving at this point.
"But I'm doing it simply so that I can use the formula and, just directly, you know."
"Use the calculator, and do it, and setup."
"We can change that, so don't worry."
"You can start a payment today, and change it."
It's just a minor difference.
How much?
"Another thing that seems a little bit odd or manufactured in this formula is that you are saving at year 40 too, right, you may not be, right or actually messed up saving in between."
"So, but for convenience, we are trying to understand the problem which is got 40 of these guys, alright."
"So, the good news is even though this formula is very complicated, right, you divide this by how much?"
"I mean, you carry it forward by how much?"
One period but there's no money.
How much do you carry this forward by?
39 periods.
How much do you carry this forward by?
38.
Which is the simplest piece of this?
This guy.
Why?
"Because I'm askin g you, what is the future value at this point in time, alright."
"So, the future value of this point in time of this guy is just itself."
"That's the, that's what I mean, if you learn how to travel in time."
So weird.
"So just remember boys and girls,"
Photoshop is lying.
That's why I love video.
'Cuz you can see the ugly.
"You see so many models that  look fantastic on print but you put a camera on 'em and it's like ""AUlGHAUGHUAHF!"""
I'm sorry.
"That being said, video can lie too."
Lots of makeup and weird lighting.
I've known many a YouTuber to fame-fuck some ugly chick from Stickem.
"But internet, this Thursday I want to  leave you with a question."
Where were you 3 to 5 years ago and how has your life changed?
"Your friends, your family, job, school."
What's different?
And are ya happy about it?
"But guys, that's really all that mattered to me this Thursday."
"My name's Philip DeFranco, and you've just been Philled in."
AUlGHAUGHUAHF!
Hello and welcome of this demonstration of Simon's new dictation mode
This is by no means a finished product ... but really just a tech demo of what is currently possible ... ... with open-source speech recognition technology
"You can see it's basically the whole, same old Simon interface ... ... just this little box on the lower left will tip you off that something is different ... ... because it says active model is ""dictation demo"""
"So, let's see how it works"
Start dictation
This is a demo of Simon
New paragraph
"In this video, I want to demonstrate the current state of open-source dictation."
"As you can see, it is nowhere near perfect."
New paragraph
"Regardless, with a little bit more work, I'm sure we could turn this into something really useful."
"If you want to get involved, please do get in touch with me."
"Select ""him off"" involved"
Go to the end of the document
I reached - after Nubba &amp;amp; upper Egypt -
All over Egypt
Because in every Inch in Egypt they have Folklore
"They also have their own songs ,their own culture"
"Fortunatly,our all cultures are audible"
We have 1 million kinds of singing every person in Nubba sings in his own way
They sing in every dialect they have (el-Fonn) the oven
The first upper Egyptian poem
""" I found my Grandma before the oven"
She was looking after its flame
She caught a sight of me
"She asked:""what's the wrong with you, son?"""
Why I see concern killing you?
Why I see sadness inside your eyes full long times
And your voice...
Is missing!
"I said:"" O mommy my body is ailing"
And my heart is moaning loudly
If my scream comes out
Will makes farms forget its green color!
Then I crouched
I crouched beside her as usual
And told her everything inside my heart
I asked her many questions
The answer
The answer
The sentry makes fun of the minister
But my conscious grandma understood my words
"Then she told me ""O son"
"It was me who marched out to ""Abdel Nasser"""
When he stepped down from authority
And today it is me also who calls on the cursed
"Ocean."""
And he points out there.
(Laughter)
"But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the lower 48."
It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.
"But he looked at me, and he said, ""Son"" -- he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that -- he says, ""Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat."
My responsibility is not to get you home alive.
"My responsibility is to get you home rich."""
(Laughter)
"You want to get home alive, that's on you."
"And for the rest of that day, safety first."
I was like --
"So, the idea that we create this false -- this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own, and vice versa."
"Anyhow, a whole lot of things."
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
"But, what it all comes down to is this."
"I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds."
"It goes like this -- we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us."
It's a civil war.
"It's a cold war, really."
"We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it."
"And we've waged this war on at least four fronts, certainly in Hollywood."
The way we portray working people on TV -- it's laughable.
"If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack."
Admit it.
You see him all the time.
"That's what plumbers look like, right?"
"We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines."
That's what TV does.
"We try hard on ""Dirty Jobs"" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I don't cheat."
"But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue."
"I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message, what's really being said?"
"Now, let's emulate some waveform debugging."
The question here is in which of these cycles is the protocol being violated?
"Remember, the packet starts when the valid signal goes high."
It gets interrupted by the suspend signal.
"And then, the packet ends, when the valid goes low and the parity byte gets transmitted."
We are only
looking at the control signal here.
Please go ahead and check off the cycles from one to seven.
Which one of these is a protocol violation?
Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were doing your performance?
It's nerve-wrecking.

TURNlNG POlNTS Momentos decisivos de carreira
"So, we're back here."
First show we did here.
XXX
Somebody had suggested that maybe we wouldn't be a real band unless we played live.
We must do it now.
This was a moment to actually see if we could put off any kind of existence.
BE ACTUAL INSTEAD OF VlRTUAL.
"I was over there and I had this big, fat white speaker and you could see my showbusiness in a nice, big white speakerhead."
And I had the laptop.
I had to put it on my feet for it not to be seen.
We're not really playing with a laptop.
"It kind of felt like a weird kind of karaoke gig, didn't it?"
"- A little bit, yeah."
- Risky karaoke.
We had our friends and stuff in the audience.
It was definitely full to the back cause it was a small venue.
Those were the day when performing was the scary experience where I kind of escape from my body. to get me through the gig and then would come out the other side:
"""Oh!"
Did we do it?
It's rendered to the point of being dry.
"Yeah, you may have some crisp on the skin, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but bananas?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, it's like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is this a joke?"
"It looks like you plated it and then stepped on it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sadly, the cook&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the banana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is better than the cook on the duck."
Bananas with duck...
You've gone bananas!
That's what's happened.
You've gone [Bleep] bananas.
"The hero of the dish, in my mind, should have been the duck."
You have managed to cook the duck.
Everything else around that is dreadful.
"Samantha, the dish please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Graham)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What is it?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Samantha) Um, it's pan-seared duck breast of a sweet potato-rhubarb puree, served with a eggplant Napoleon."
You know that that's not cooked.
- Right?
"- I do, sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And you put it&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on a plate.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Raw duck and, like, the leaning tower of dryness."
This is not what we're looking for.
"This is bad on so many levels, it's kind of hard to explain. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Scott, let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, what is that?"
It's a profitol... profiterole with a mashed-up sweet potato and a slice of the duck.
Two whole duck breasts equates to three miniature slices of duck.
- Where's the rest of it?
- I honestly got scared.
"It's embarrassing, Scott."
"Well, at least after the raw duck, we have a duck that has actually seen the frying pan. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You thought&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it would impress us&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that you could put a slice of duck breast"
- in a profiterole?
- A little over-creative.
Over-creative?
Delusional.
Three embarrassing dishes.
I'm scared.
"If they call my name and they send me home,"
I'm gonna be the first person out of 18 gone.
You just find the root of P and the root of Q and if you check if they're equal.
And then the union operation is simply find the two roots I and then set the idea the first one could be the second one.
"Actually less code than for Quick Find, no fore loops."
There's this one wild loop that we have to worry about a little bit.
But that's a quick and elegant implementation of code to solve the dynamic connectivity problem called
Quick-union.
So now we're going to have to look at can this code be effective for
large problems?
Well unfortunately Quick-union is faster but it's also too slow.
"And it's a little different kind of too slow then for Quick Find, there's times when it could be fast, but there's also times when it could be too slow."
And the defect for Quick-union is that the trees can get too tall.
Which would mean that the find operation would be too expensive.
You could wind up with a long skinny tree.
Of each object just pointing to next and then to do a find operation for object at the bottom would involve going all the way through the tree.
Costing involving in the ray axises just to do the find operation and that's going to be too slow if you have a lot of operations.
"Oh, Opalescence."
Can you just picture it?
"Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!"
"Why, yes!"
I did make it myself.
Thank you so much for asking.
"Oh, Opal, of course you can help me."
Thank you.
What's that?
You wanna help me more!
"Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?"
Careful now.
Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.
"Howdy, Rarity?"
Shh...
Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
Exactly as it was the case with the letters ?
your Father has prevented you to see your mother hidLetters from you and that meansYour father is an enemyyour mother.
"My father did nothave any enemy... he didn t ,burn the letters ,just hide them ! did you he readall the letters of your mother... and nevertheless you would stillbelieve that your father did not separated you from your mother ?"
yes mr Judge!This man was reading the letters while pretendingbe a practicing lawyer in the courtand wrote a report about it...
"Since he is the witnessln this case,"
"I want to file a lawsuitagainst this man for fraud,falisfication of documentsand deceiving the court and government officials and should be immediately placedin judicial proceedings!"
The case accepted!
"I 've committedall of these errors, but please believe mewhen I say that my fathernot the enemy nor Suleimannor Kader Altun!"
"If you were, I would have known!"
My father has not committing the crime!
"Mr. Mahir, you can sit down.No further questions."
Does defense have anyquestions for the witness?
"No, Your Honor!"
"Okay, witness may goback to his place."
Your Honor...
I'm not finishedwith my declaration.
I want to tell you what happenedmy family aftermy father was charged with this murder...
"Prison officershave abused my motherwhen they brought her at night to visit my father, that my nephew was been kidnappedand my father was blackmailed over the phoneto admitt all the charges..."
I wish that all thisput in evidence...
It's already been provenand is not applicable to this case.
"Mr. Judge,please listen to me! your requestto speak has been denied!"
"Please believe me,When I explain what my family has gone throughyou'll realize that was set a trap to my father !"
Sit down
Feride
"recess for ten minutes,then we'll continue."
Come on!
"Can I come in,Mr. Neždete?"
"Come on, come on..."
Today is Miss.
"Aytenshould come for the rehersal, but... did not come to the testthat is not normal, because it is supposed tobe her first nighton stage!"
How's that?
"I called,but she does not answer. her Sister answeredbut she explained Nothing..."
They can't be p.
They only get as high as p minus 1.
This is not an option.
"So the only possibility, if a is equal to 0, for the determinant of capital A to still be divisible by p, is for bc to be equal to 0."
So let's think about how many possibilities there are over here.
So let's think about all of the combinations.
"So there's the one situation, where b and c are equal to 0. b and c is equal to 0."
Now let's think about the other ones.
There's one where b is equal to 0 and c isn't. bc will still equal 0 in this situation.
So how many possibilities are there?
How many possibilities are there for this?
"Well, b is equal to 0."
"C over here can be any value, although we've already considered the case where c is equal to 0."
"So it could be any value so that we don't double count, any value where c does not equal 0."
So it could be 1 through p minus 1.
"Or another way to think about it, there's p minus 1 possibilities."
Now let's think about c is equal to 0 and b isn't.
"Well, exact same logic."
"Once again, we don't want to double count that they're both being equal to 0."
So let me write it.
"And c isn't-- well, we're saying it isn't 0, so we are actually already putting that constraint there."
So it has p minus 1 possibilities.
So how many total possibilities do we have where the determinant of A is equal to 0 and a is equal to 0?
So we have one here.
"We have one possibility here, then p minus 1 and p minus 1."
"So our total possibilities are p minus 1 plus p minus 1 plus 1, which is 2p minus 2 plus 1, which is 2p minus 1."
2p minus 1 incremental possibilities when a is equal to 0 for the determinant of A to be divisible by p.
So that's what we just got in this video.
"In the last video, we had p minus 1 squared possibility when a does not equal 0."
"So if we want the total number of A's, where the determinant of A is divisible by 0, we can add the number that we got in the last video to the number we just got."
So let's do that.
"So if I were to rewrite this over here, this is equal to p squared minus 2p plus 1."

Episode 02 - The fellowship of the staff
Are you sure that Bandaid's staff is the reason of the bug ?
"Some Pokémon in the anime are just MONSTROUS, such as Dragonite and Tentacruel who are roughly the size of a BUlLDlNG!"
"While these Pokémon are clearly meant to give the idea that some of these monsters have the potential to become massive, it is interesting that, on the flipside, most of Game Freak's official sizes are much smaller than what you'd expect."
Let's get back to Charizard.
"In the anime, Ash's Charizard is actually a runt compared to others, but he's still big enough to give Ash a lift with plenty of space."
"But in the games, Charizard stands at just 5 foot 7 inches and just under 200 pounds."
"At 10 years old, Ash Ketchum is probably around 4 foot 3 inches, 70 pounds."
So I can believe that Charizard is still flyable at the average size of a child.
"But, a big adult like me?"
We wouldn't be flying anywhere.
The simple fact that Charizard and I can step on a scale and weigh the same is just it's just weird. . .I weigh a Charizard.
It just doesn't sound right.
But Charizard isn't the only Pokemon with a size you wouldn't expect.
Let's take a look at some of my favorites.
Nidoking and Nidoqueen are both a little over 4 feet tall.
"By the time you hit your teenage years, you'll probably already be taller than them."
Yeah. . .
"When you start picturing them like this, they're just not nearly as cool."
"And speaking of Pokémon much smaller than you think,"
"Rosalia, who's usually pictured to be around a couple feet tall, is just one."
Yeah.
It's just tiny.
It does look hilarious in colosseum though.
"Also, I get that Joltik is a bug but- 4 inches?"
He'd fit in the palm of your hand!
"At a size that small, it's pretty unbelievable that he'd ever be able to battle with well, ANYTHlNG else."
"Also joining Joltik is the recently announced, 6th generation Pokémon, Flabébé."
"Not only does it tie for the smallest size at 4 inches, but also the lightest weight too at 0.2 pounds."
"With Pokémon this small, what do you even need pokeballs for?"
"But when you look at Dunsparse, what do you think?"
I usually picture a little snake.
Just look at the guy in
Mystery Dungeon.
"First, these men steal all the pillows... ...and then the dogs steal the mattresses."
The dogs float their mattresses to the candy shop.
WOW!
CANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[music starts]
When I was a young man I carried my pack
And I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murrays green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we sailed away from the quay
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the cheers
We sailed off for Gallipoli
How well I remember that terrible day
When the blood stained the sand and the water
When how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
"Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well"
"He showered us with bullets, and he rained us with shells"
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we stopped to bury our slain
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
And it started all over again
"Now those who were living, did their best to survive"
"In that mad world of death, blood and fire"
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive
But not the animal sliding into number 2: the lungfish.
It can breathe air.
"So when the going gets tough, the lungfish digs deep."
"Three feet underground, it swallows mud to excavate a chamber."
It secretes slime that hardens into an impermeable body bag...
sealing the lungfish away from the drought.
Mud makes a time capsule.
And great bricks.
"Inside its cocoon, the lungfish shuts down."
The comatose lungfish is number 2 because it can remain in suspended animation for up to four years!
"But even in Southern Africa, the rains will come."
[thunder]
[rainfall]
Water dissolves the slime sack.
The lungfish awakes.
Withered and shrunken.
It has survived for four years by cannibalizing its own muscles.
But it has still enough strength to slither to water.
It's an extraordinary feat of endurance.
Only one animal survives longer in far worse conditions.
NARRATOR:
The ultimate survivor hides out in the forests of Canada.
"For the world's largest deer, it makes life a living hell."
Moose are bled dry.
Attacked by a plague of tiny vampires.
It's late summer.
Bloodsuckers the size of a grain of sand swarm at the optimum height to meet a moose.
Ticks.
CO2 from moose breath stimulates the swarm.
"One moose can be home to 100,000 ticks."
Over two months the ticks drink 10 gallons-- that's a moose's total volume of blood.
Infested animals are called ghosts.
I stand before you with all the might of Rome
"And I hereby declare that Queen Cleopatra, widow of Gaius Julius Caesar, was his once true and legal wife!"
"And that their child, Ptolemy Caesar, is the true,"
legitimate and only son of great Caesar!
"Come forth, young Caesar!"
Let your people see you!
"Let it be known throughout the world that I, Marcus Antonius, have renounced my false Roman marriage... and have taken as my wife Queen Cleopatra..."
and as a token of this great union...
"I hereby bequeath, to the throne of Ptolemy, the land of Syria, to the limits of its borders!"
"Not only does he proclaim an Egyptian bastard as heir to Rome, he secedes the wealth of Syria to a foreign power!"
Shame!
Shame!
"Now, far be it for me to say that Marc Antony is not an honorable man"
"Yet there he remains, in the east, wallowing in the mud with the whore of the Nile, caught by the same hook as Caesar"
"I submit to you, fellow Romans, that Marc Antony has broken the pact between us"
He has!
He has!
"For the good of the empire l, as co-consul, must do as Roman justice commands me"
I hereby declare a just and righteous war against Antony and Cleopatra!
Generals!
Come quickly!
Octavius!
"Ah, Generals Grattius, Cornelius"
Try one of these cakes
They're hard to come by in Gaul
What are you doing here?
I've come to take command
These are Antony's men
You have a letter from Antony?
Antony is no longer relevant to Roman affairs
His thoughts are only of Egypt and Cleopatra
"I will not surrender the Gallic legions, unless Antony personally instructs me to do so"
"And finally, the L here stands for Last, which means we multiply the last terms in the two binomials, so b * d."
"And the answer to this multiplication is the sum of all of these, F + O + I + L. So, let's apply this method here to see that we get the same answer that we just found."
Okay.
"So, we still have this product, (x+5y) (3x-y)."
"So, what is F here?"
This is the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 3x, which is 6x^2."
And what about O?
I is a product of the outer terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * -y, which is -2xy."
And I is the product of the inner terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y and 3x, which is equal to 15yx."
And L is the product of the last terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y *, - y, which is -5y^2."
"And therefore, this product is the sum of all of these."
"So, it's 6x^2 - 2xy + 15yx - 5y^2."
"And again, -2xy and 15yx are like terms so we can combine them, which gives us the same answer of 6x^2 + 13xy - 5y^2."
"So, FOlL is a quick way to distributive multiplication of two binomials."
Let's see another example.
Let's multiply these two binomials here.
"Well, we can apply the FOlL method we just saw."
This is equal to the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 2x, plus the product of the outer terms in the two binomials, so 2x * one."
"And then, plus the product of the inner terms of the two binomials, so -one * 2x."
"And then, plus the product of the last terms in the two binomials, so -one - one which gives us, 4x^2 + 2x - 2x - one."
"And notice the outer and the inner terms will cancel, which leaves us with our answer of 4x^2 - one."
"Now, it should be pointed out that these binomials are special and that we're multiplying together the difference and sum of the same two terms."
"We have 2x and 2x, and one and one."
And there's a special formula in this type of case.
"And the formula is that (A-b) (A+b) = A^2 - B^2, because the outer and inner terms will always cancel, which is what we just saw."
"That is, in our case, our A is 2x and our B is one."
"So our answer here is A^2 - B^2 or (2x)^2 - (one)^2, which is this 4x^2 - one."
"Hi i'm Samantha Atwell i'm a junior Social Science Education major from Olathe, Kansas."
The reason why
"I chose ESU is because being an education major, ESU is one of the top four schools in the country for education."
"Being empowered by E means a lot to me, I've been involved in alot of different organizations, meeting alot of friends have helped me to be empowered by E. Some of the things that i absolutely love to do are to scrap book and to take pictures, so at events on campus you'll see me with my camera at all times."
One thing I would advise new students when they come here is to get involved on campus we have a lot of organizations here and by getting involved you get to meet new people really quickly and when you graduate you'll have friends from those organizations.
.
Now here's the question.
Does it really matter.
Why am I making a big fuss about this?
"Whether use it two norm or a one norm, right?"
Because you know what's wrong with using the two norm.
"There is no problem, right?"
"There isn't, but at least from the surface, there would be any problem with using a one norm too."
"Okay,"
let me show you the difference.
"Today in class, you're gonna see it."
Okay.
So what
"I'm gonna do is take this data that I showed up here and we're gonna try to do an L two fit and an L one fit, and you're gonna see what happens."
"Alright, so there is our data we're gonna work with and we would like to put a nice line through that."
Okay.
"So, how do we do this."
"Well, what we gonna do is use what's called."
The
F means Search Command.
"Cuz, we find to do is minimize this a quantity."
Right.
"So, sorry."
We're trying to minimize this.
Right?
This is the idea.
When you do a
They sat by my mum's hospital bed  when my mum was in coma.
They came and get me out of jail when I get busted for stupid stuff over the weekend.
Nobody ever did that for me before.
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, that thing that Thay says  'goes in in order to go out'."
"It comes in from the staff of caring  teachers, people like yourself first, unrelentingly, fiercely,constantly pouring that love and attention and going beyond their expectations to care about them."
To care about them.
"Here is a poem,"
"(Bell) by Travis Daniels, a Youth Build student."
"He was at a conference and saw all people like you caring and talking about the program,  and how they want to help it."
"""His Hero, from being lonely and getting blunted to seeing concern and feeling wanted."
"From hating you because you stared, to loving you because you cared."
"In the pain, I am in a struggle, I need to talk, I need to hug you."
I hope that you feel my heart and its words.
"Now, picture the youth that stand on the curbs."
"They have no hope, they see no change."
They try to live but stuck in their ways.
"16 years old and suicidal,  you may not relate but trust me, I do."
"I reminisce about my cries for help,  no one noticed that I hit myself."
"As time went on, a lost soul grew and was welcomed by those who care for the youth."
I know there is more that  you want me to be.
"I am still in the dark  but the light, I can see."
"Let it be known, I love what you do,  from now till forever, I'll pray for you."""
"So, everything that everyone has said  is part of the picture, right?"
"Taking care of ourselves,  appreciating each other, knowing that we can't do it all in one step."
"Taking the step, step-by-step."
Pouring out the love.
"Mother Teresa, I want to quote her."
"She says,""Love until it hurts  and then love some more."""
"I think that's what we're called to do and the more that we take care of ourselves, the more of our natural love we have available to share with our students."
Thank you very much.
(Half bell)
More ginger people.
That's why they couldn't send Prince Harry.
"They couldn't afford the resources required to start developing factor 60,000 sun block."
"It's not always the friendliest place in the world, Scotland."
I once saw an English guy in Glasgow trying to order a pint of lager and lime.
"The barman went, ""We don't do cocktails."""
"We can't just be dour, negative bastards up there."
John Logie Baird invented the TV
And when people came up to him congratulate him.
"He went, ""Ay, but there's f* all on."""
Are you looking forward to the Olympics in London?
"I'll take that as a ""no""."
They say the Olympics is going to rekindle English national pride.
"Come on, for 9.2bn you could have written ""Fuck off Germany on to the moon""."
The Spice Girls are getting back together.
The only way we're going to see Geri Halliwell draped in a Union Jack again is if she dies in battle.
I tell you what I think they should do in Big Brother.
"You know on eviction night when someone gets sent out, the people inside, instead of hearing screaming or booing or whatever, they should just hear complete silence and then a single gunshot."
"When I was at school, I could just never work out how to get girls bras undone."
"Then eventually I realised, these girls were wearing a different type of bra from my Gran."
"If you don't like that, you'll hate this next one."
The oldest woman ever to give birth gave birth this year.
She was sixty-three.
"You could imagine at sixty three, the baby didn't have to force its way out."
It spent the last three months bungy jumping.
"Everytime she went for a s*, it had to brace itself."
Like the end of the Italian Job.
"Apparently, scientists have come up with a condom for premature ejaculation."
"Basically, it's got an anaesthetic in the lining."
It makes you numb so you can lost for longer.
Or you can wear it inside out and you don't have to wake anybody up.
"Thanks, because that one can go either way."
combination words?
"So in linear combination words,"
do the linear combinations of the columns fill three dimensional space?
Every b means all the bs in three dimensional space.
Do you see that I'm just asking the same question in different words?
Solving A x -- A x -- that's very important.
"A times x -- when I multiply a matrix by a vector,"
I get a combination of the columns.
I'll write that down in a moment.
"But in my column picture, that's really what I'm doing."
I'm taking linear combinations of these three columns and I'm trying
to find b.
"And, actually, the answer for this matrix"
will be yes.
"For this matrix A -- for these columns, the answer is yes."
This matrix -- that I chose for an example is a good matrix.
A non-singular matrix.
An invertible matrix.
Those will be the matrices that we like best.
There could be other --
"and we will see other matrices where the answer becomes,"
"no -- oh, actually, you can see when it would become no."
What could go wrong?
How could it go wrong that out of these --
out of three columns and all their combinations --
when would I not be able to produce some b off here?
When could it go wrong?
Do you see that the combinations --
let me say when it goes wrong.
If these three columns all lie in
"the same plane, then their combinations will lie in"
that same plane.
There is no problem to convert it back to the flat base.
Use a permanent black marker to draw the face.
You can do it on front side of the base or front side of the cabin.
"Two eyes, nose, big smile."
Simple drawing.
OK.
I am going to cut off funny tails from the top of the crane tower.
It would make the sculpture simpler and our crane more recognizable.
Here is the crane with one funny tail on the top.
Instead of funny tails on the top of the crane.
I am going to twist soft about one inch bubble.
Lock both ends of this bubble in one lock twist.
Cut off the rest of the balloon.
This bubble covers all the knots we have made on the top.
"Congratulations, we have made the crane."
In this instruction we used different color balloons to make the crane.
Here is an example of a crane tower made of four green balloons.
You may notice some minor differences in this sculpture.
The crane's arm has extra bubble.
The cabin is different as well.
I added extra row bubbles to the green tower and the green cabin.
Here is the side view.
Here is the top view.
The front view.
Usually I don't use black marker to make any drawings on dark color balloons.
It is just wasting of your time.
Let me show it to you.
Black is hardly visible on a dark background.
"Anyway, let's finish the face."
We can use technique described in this instruction to make large scale sculptures or parts of large sculptures.
"For example we can use it to make a torso, a leg, an arm, a cake, a vase, a hat and so on."
Have fun and happy twisting :)
She was that powerful.
One day she had a question for the class.
I'm sitting there.
Let's go back to the 1970's.
"I'm wearing bell-bottom pants (Horrible, never again!!)."
"But there I am, she had a question."
I raised my hand hoping that she wouldn't call on me.
She called on me.
"Remember, she's a larger-than-life woman with a lot of energy."
"""Stephen, that's right!!"""
"Wow, because of Mrs. Jordan, she changed my life at that moment."
Announcer:
"""That's right, Stephen,"" became a personal mantra as a reminder of the power and impact one person can have on another."
"Ivan Noble of Boston University writes,"
"""I have read over 400 student evaluations of your presentation, [with comments like]"
"'Bring him back, please!' 'The Best!' 'Truly inspiring!'"
"[and] 'he made me feel like I could achieve anything I want.' You capture the hearts and attention of every single audience member."""
Ray Hexamer:
"Most times you hire a speaker, it's the same speech that they've done 50 times in the last four months."
"Stephen's was not that way, he was different in the respect that he took the time to actually get to know what First Communications was and what they represented and tailored his presentations to fit what we were looking for."
Stephen:
"You have dreams, like me, you have ambitions, like me."
I'm just like you.
I didn't really do anything more than what you're capable of doing.
The only thing to be able to embrace change.
Howard Putnam:
This is Howard Putnam.
Stephen Hopson has faced adversity all his life and he has been successful against adversity over and over again.
"Today, he is speaking, he is writing, and he is available for your group or your team."
"If you have goals and expectations that you want to exceed, be it your management team, your supervisors in the plant, or your salesforce"
Stephen has a story to tell that will help you exceed your goals.
Stephen:
And it is possible.
You just have to splint with something else.
You splint with bamboo and gauze.
And you need several people to pull.
The most important aspect was politeness.
You explained what you were going to do and what they could expect.
Compassion was more important than the medical performance.
My medical training said the opposite.
"You could behave badly, but you had to follow the latest research."
In Africa you did the best you could.
But you could never compromise on how you treated people.
In rough deliveries you could save the mother by fetal skull decompression.
"If the fetus was dead, you had to put a hole in its head to get it out."
It could save the mother's life when it was too late to do a caesarean.
But first you had to explain to the grandmother that the baby was stuck.
"""I can get it out, but the head will be destroyed."""
"- ""No matter."
"Will she live?"""
"- ""Maybe."
"I can't promise anything."""
"You reasoned with the disciplinary board, or else things went bad."
These are the konzo patients.
It's from 21 August 1981.
That's a date that is etched into Hans Rosling's memory.
That day the request for help came on the back of a cinema ticket from a village in the country.
The Italian nun worked as a sort of district nurse.
She wrote that she had 30 crippled women and children with both legs paralyzed.
She'd been nursing for 20 years and never seen anything like it.
The first woman I examined had extremely sharp reflexes.
That means it's a spastic paralysis.
"Sort of like MS, but the symptoms developed in one day."
I saw immediately that I had never seen anything like this before.
There's a kind of a lot going on now with the online and open access.
Right.
Can you say a little bit about what's gonna happen for in the future.
[laugh].
"But you described, [laugh]."
"You know, more, less paper, more electronic, [laugh]."
Publications.
It'll appear faster.
Yeah.
"You know, like e-Pub before, before it appears."
Right.
In the paper version.
There'll be more new journal.
"I keep getting emails from journals that just started up, you know, and they'll make it sound like it's your field."
And there's probably not such great peer review with them.
They wanna.
"This time they might get some known authors and publish but the, I have had a paper."
"You know which was submitted to a journal that's supposed to be peer reviewed and, and the acceptance came back in about five days."
[laugh]
Right.
You know?
"So I don't think it was really peer reviewed I, of course you know I'm biased but I thought it was a decent paper and, but I don't think it got the kind of peer review that papers normally get from good journals."
"Do you think peer reviews going to be, gonna change somewhat in the future because of this proliferation of online journals?"
Say that again.
"Do you think that the peer review process itself is going to change them like, because of the proliferation of online journals?"
"Well, it shouldn't, but it, it might."
I'm not sure how.
Yeah.
"You know, if they're really in a hurry to publish, they might say, you know, get your review back in a week or, you know."
Yeah.
A lot of people just can't do that.
"That fast, yeah."
"USS ""New Jersey"" (BB-16) was the fourth of five Virginia-class battleships of the United States Navy. She was originally going to be named the USS Virginia. She was built at the Fore River Shipbuilding Company in Quincy, Massachusetts in May 1902. She was launched in November 1904. After sea trials she was commissioned into the fleet in May 1906. The ship was armed with an offensive battery of four guns and eight guns. She was capable of a top speed of . ""New Jersey"" was long, had 23,000 horsepower and was built at a cost of $3,405,000."
"""New Jersey"" spent her entire career in the Atlantic Fleet. In late 1906, she took part in the Second Occupation of Cuba. She participated in the Jamestown Exposition in April – May 1907. At the end of the year, she joined the Great White Fleet for its circumnavigation of the globe, which lasted into 1909. The ship spent the following five years conducting peacetime training. In April 1914, ""New Jersey"" took part in the occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution. During World War I, she was used as a training ship. After the war, she was tasked with transporting American soldiers back from Europe. ""New Jersey"" was decommissioned in 1920 and slated for destruction in bombing tests in 1923. ""New Jersey"" was sunk on 5 September 1923 off Cape Hatteras as a target ship."
Pacific Time Zone
"The Pacific Time Zone is one of the time zones in the world. It is based on the mean solar time of the 105th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory. Normally, its time is 8 hours before Coordinated Universal Time. The time zone is in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Abduction (logic)
"Abduction is the kind of practical logic which answers questions of the type ""how did this come about?"". It produces answers which are not guaranteed to be correct. Consider the observation that the lawn is wet in the morning. How did that happen? In London, the answer is most often that it rained. But in Los Angeles it is much more likely that someone left the sprinkler on."
"Abduction is logical inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation. It makes the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. Abductive reasoning is ""inference to the best explanation""."
The philosopher (1839–1914) introduced abduction into modern logic.

Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of getting coal out of the ground. It is part of the mining industry. Coal is used as a resource for making electricity.
Extraction.
Surface mining is done when the coal is near the surface. Coal miners remove the soil above the coal. The coal can then be removed without the coal miners having to go deep underground..
"Underground mining is when the coal is farther underground, making it too expensive to remove soil. In this process, coal miners and all of the coal mining equipment are brought deep underground and coal is carried up out of the ground. This is especially dangerous because of fires, explosions, and poison gas in coal mines."
Processing.
"Before coal can be used, it must be processed in a coal processing plant. It is made smaller using a sizer and crusher. Parts that might be harmful to any equipment which will use the coal later on, such as the screening for metallic parts inside the mined coal."

The Sims 4
"The Sims 4 is a life simulation video game developed by Maxis and The Sims Studio and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on September 2, 2014 and is the sequel of The Sims 3. The game is available on Microsoft Windows and OS X."
It was revealed during Gamescon via gameplay demo and release trailer.
"The game does not require an internet connection to play, but it will need an Origin account and internet access during the initial installation process."
Gameplay.
"The Sims 4 is made from the same idea of the other games in the series. The player controls their Sims' everyday lives. The game is open-ended and has barely any limits. The lots are connected with a large map. Sims can go to lots close to where they are by walking there, but can use their cell phones to go anywhere."
Create-A-Sim.
"Create-A-Sim is needed to create Sims characters. With no Sims, you can't play the game. Sims 4's Create-A-Sim is easier to use than it is in other Sims games. The Sim's body type can be changed by clicking and dragging parts of the Sim's body. There is a slider to change how muscular the Sim is and another slider to change how fat the Sim is."
"A Sim's clothing can be customized by the player. Mods can change this, but mods can also damage the game. Sims have several outfits. Each outfit is made in Create-A-Sim. They wear different outfits in different situations: an everyday outfit, a formal outfit, an athletic outfit, a sleep outfit, a party outfit, and swimwear. The player can change the Sims' outfits at any time in Live Mode."
Traits.
"Traits are what give Sims their personalities. Every trait you give a Sim will add something to their personality. For example, giving a Sim the cheerful trait will make them happy more often. When you are first creating your Sim you can give them three traits, and when you choose their aspiration you get one more. After that you can give them more traits by completing aspirations. There is no limit to the number of traits a Sim can have. The aspirations are:"
"• Active, which makes the Sim more likely to exercise (the Lazy trait cannot be used with this)"
"• Creative, the Sim is more likely to read books, paint, etc. This can link well with most traits."
"• Genius, the Sim is very intelligent. They will become upset if they have not read in a while, and can link well with the Creative trait."
"• Happy, the Sim is cheerful and optimistic. They will become tense around people with the 'Sad' trait."
"• Sad, the Sim is the opposite of the Happy trait, which means a Sim can't have both traits."
"• Playful - The Sim is more likely to have the Playful moodlet, and is the opposite of the Snob trait. It links well with the Immature trait."
Aspirations
"A Sim's aspiration is their biggest goal. You can change your Sim's aspiration whenever you want. The first aspiration you choose when you are creating your Sim will give you a special trait, but changing your Sim's aspiration after that won't change your Sim's traits. Each aspiration gives your Sims a set of tasks to complete. When you complete all these tasks you will get a second special trait. The trait you get will be different for each aspiration. These can be completed if wanted using cheat codes in the game."
Child and Toddler Sims have their own group of aspirations to complete. These aspirations cannot be given to adult and teen Sims.
Live Mode.
"Sims can only move and be controlled while the player is playing in Live Mode. In Live Mode, 1 second of real time=1 minute in in-game time. In Live Mode, the player can control one Sim in the selected household."
Relationships.
"Sims can form relationships by talking to other Sims. The way your Sims treat who they're talking to will affect their relationships. If they are nice to a sim they will have a friendly relationship, but if they are mean they will have a bad relationship. Your Sims can also have romantic relationships with other Sims."
Needs.
"The 6 needs in the game are Fun, Energy, Hunger, Bladder, Social and Hygiene.This can change with the Vampire game pack, as the needs are Vampire Energy, Thirst, Hygiene, Social and Fun."

Mis-association.

Henri IV was often known as le Grand Béarnais"
A la béarnaise.
Some recipes are called à la béarnaise even when they are not accompanied by a Béarnaise sauce. This is because the recipes themselves are linked to the Béarn region. This added to confusion over the naming of the sauce.

The franchise was re-let to Virgin Trains East Coast, ending the period of government ownership, despite contributing a lot of money to the Treasury and calls for the government to retain the franchise."
Profitability.
"East Coast paid back over £1 billion to the government over the course of its franchise, more than twice as much as rival Virgin Trains did in the same time period on the West Coast Main Line. However, it used relatively old trains and therefore had much lower leasing costs, as in 2012/13 Virgin paid £302 million for its fleet of trains, while East Coast paid £53 million."
"East Coast’s successor, Virgin Trains East Coast pays much more money back to the government than East Coast did: £3.3 billion over 8 years, compared to East Coast’s £1 billion."

The first note in the pattern is called a ‘sam’. It shows the beginnings and ends of improvisation, so it is often emphasized."

Jhor is a more elaborate version of the Raga that is included in the Alap. It forms the beginning of the performance. This comes after Alap and before Jhala.
Jhala indicates the fast-paced ending of the Raga. It is often distinguished by the overcoming of the melodic component by the rhythm.
"The Gat, or Bandish is a permanent composition set in a specific Raga. It is accompanied by the Tabla, a drone and melodic accompaniment by a sarangi , violin or harmonica."

Hypoglycemia
"Hypoglycemia is when the level of blood sugar is lower than normal. A normal blood sugar level is about 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. All of the cells in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive. When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally."
"Hypoglycemia can cause many symptoms. Some common symptoms are nausea, feeling hungry, sweating, feeling sad, and heart palpitations (feeling the heart pounding). Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are drunk or have taken drugs. Very bad hypoglycemia can look like a stroke."
"Hypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are diabetic. It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications."
"Hypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal. Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating. In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). In some cases, the liver is able to handle the issue by making glucose."
"The brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar. Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like seizures) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough."

Organolithium reagent
"Organolithium compounds contain a direct bond between a carbon atom and a lithium atom. They are an important class of organometallic compound. The bonding between the carbon and lithium is highly polar due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms, which effectively makes the carbon negatively charged and capable of acting as a strong base or nucleophile. These compounds are similar to Grignard reagents, but are much more reactive. Organolithium reagents such as butyllithium are widely commercially available. Due to their highly reactive nature, they must be handled under a protective atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon as they will catch fire in air."

Period 8 element
"A period 8 element would be an element in the eighth period (row) of the periodic table. No period 8 elements have been proven to exist. These elements are almost certainly too big to exist in nature, so they would be synthetic elements. They would probably decay very quickly, because of radioactivity, so they would have very short half-lives. However, some scientists believe that an island of stability may exist in this range, which would be more stable and have longer half-lives. Some of these elements would be part of a new category of elements, called superactinides."

"Kanata, Ontario"
"Kanata is a large suburban area in the western part of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It has a population of 90,000 and is growing very fast. It is just west of the Greenbelt. It is an important area for Hi-tech Businesses. It was an independent town from 1978 to 2000."
History.
"Kanata was originally part of the Township of March. It was settled by Europeans in the early 19th Century. It was mainly agricultural(Farms) until the 1960s when it became the site of a lot of construction. Modern Kanata is largely the creation of Bill Teron, a developer and urban planner who purchased over 3,000 acres (12 km2) of rural land and set about building a model community. It was planned to have a mix of offices, residential(Housing) area, and green area. Kanata was divided into a number of communities. Each was intended to have its own Business Center and unique culture. These include Beaverbrook, Glen Cairn, Bridlewood, Katimavik, Hazeldean, Morgan's Grant, and Kanata Lakes."
"Kanata grew Rapidly. In 1978 the Province of Ontario made Kanata a city separate from the Township of March. Kanata remained a city intil 2001 when it was merged with the city of Ottawa, along with many other cities."
"The city became an important hi-tech centre. DEC was one of the pioneer technology companies in Kanata. The DEC campus has been successively Digital, Compaq, and is now HP. Kanata remains home to many of the major hi-tech employers of Ottawa, such as Mitel, March Networks, Alcatel-Lucent, Dell Canada, Hewlett-Packard, Smart Technologies, Norpak, Nortel, MDS Nordion, Breconridge, AMCC, and Cisco Systems, Inc.. The hi-tech industry is clustered along March Road, in the Kanata North Business Park and Kanata Research Park, and along Eagleson Road, in the Kanata South Business Park."

LNWR electric units
"During 1909-1922, the London and North Western Railway embarked on a large-scale project to electrify their whole London inner-suburban network, encompassing the lines from London Euston to Watford and the North London Railway from London Broad Street to Richmond. This also included branch lines such as Watford to Croxley Green (where a depot was built to house the electric units), and links to what was to become the London Underground network. For this reason, the lines were electrified using the fourth rail 630V DC system, the electricity being generated at the LNWR's own power station in Stonebridge Park. The first electric passenger trains ran in 1914, limited to the West London line route (Willesden to Earls Court), and full services over the whole network did not begin until 1922, work having been delayed by the First World War. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway extended the network in 1927 by electrifying the branch to Rickmansworth."
Golaniad
"Golaniad was a protest in Bucharest, Romania. It started in April 1990."
LYR electric units
The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) electrified urban railway lines in Liverpool and Manchester in order to improve the service offered against the competition being put up by new electric trams.
Liverpool.
Liverpool to Southport.
The line between Liverpool and Southport began using electric multiple units (EMUs) on 22 March 1904. Power was supplied from a third rail at 625 Volts direct current.
Liverpool Overhead Railway.
Connections were built with the Liverpool Overhead Railway (LOR) at Seaforth &amp; Litherland railway station to a new station beside LOR's Seaforth Sands station. Also from the North Mersey Branch route to Aintree. From 2 July 1905 LOR trains began to run through to Seaforth and Litherland. In 1906 the L&amp;YR electrified the line to Aintree.
Liverpool to Ormskirk.
Electrification to Ormskirk was completed in 1913.
Manchester.
Bury to Holcombe Brook.
"From 1913 an experimental electric service operated between Bury and Holcombe Brook. The equipment was provided by Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. of Preston, which was developing its products for export."
"The system used was 3,500 Volts DC from overhead lines. In 1918 the line was converted to the 1,200 V DC system chosen for the Manchester to Bury line."
Manchester to Bury.
"After the Holcombe Brook service, the L&amp;YR decided to electrify the Manchester to Bury line. The system used was 1,200 V DC from a side-contact third rail. The purpose of this unusual arrangement was to prevent the service being affected by ice forming on the live rail. Sixty-six cars were built at Newton Heath works.

Schulze method
"The Schulze method is a way of voting that is used to fill a single vacant position in an election. It was developed in 1997 by Markus Schulze. It is also known as Schwartz Sequential Dropping (SSD), Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping (CSSD), Beatpath Method, Beatpath Winner, Path Voting, and Path Winner. It is used by several organizations including Wikimedia, Debian, Gentoo, BerryTube, and the KDE."
How it works.
"Voters rank the candidates in the order from the one that they most want to win to the one they least want to win. The same preference (how much the voters want the candidate to win or lose) can be given to more than one candidate, and candidates can be given no number (they are interpreted as the worst)."
"Next, for every pair of two candidates, the two are compared: ignoring all other candidates, which of the two in the pair is preferred by most voters? How many voters agree with the majority decision is noted."
"More calculations take place. Given two candidates A and K, A is said to beat K with strength ""t"" if ""t"" voters prefer A to B, ""t"" voters prefer B to C, and so on, and ""t"" voters prefer J to K. The winner W is the candidate which beats any other candidate X with strength ""t"", but X does not beat W with strength ""t""."

After a bit of conversation, the group of friends moves into John Oldman’s house. John’s friends keep asking why he decided to “run off” so quickly. John Oldman does not answer clearly at first, but gradually becomes drawn to telling his friends what is really on his mind. He begins to tell his friends about who he really is, a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon caveman who has survived until the present. His friends aren’t convinced, but rather constantly question John Oldman in order to prove him wrong. The talk goes on as John Oldman’s friends try to prove him wrong, in biological, historical, and religious terms."
The conversations are driven by John Oldman’s claims of his past. His claims include the following:

Critical thinking
"Critical thinking is ""thinking about thinking"". It is a way of deciding if a claim is true, false, or sometimes true and sometimes false, or partly true and partly false."
"To find out if someone is telling you the truth, one needs evidence. Information is found in libraries, online, and by asking people. Professional librarians can help research library sources. Cybrarians can help research using computers. Professional interviewers are good at finding people who are experts in their fields, and they know how to ask the right questions."
"To solve a problem, questions can be written as clearly and simply as possible, making certain that all terms are well understood by giving definitions if necessary. Then, this critical thinking can help one judge how true this information is. Critical thinking tools are taken from many fields of study: statistics, logistics, semantics, experimental research methodology, psychology, sociology. Research sources should be of good quality: up to date, thorough, well-informed, and impartial."

"Wit is a form of intellectual humour. A wit is someone skilled in making witty remarks. A witty remark is a smart observation, put with humor and said in the perfect moment. Forms of wit include: the quip and the repartee."
"Witty remarks may be intentionally cruel, and perhaps more ingenious than funny."
"A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of point; a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer. (Wilde: ""I wish I'd said that."" Whistler: ""You will, Oscar, you will"".)"

They can be burned before anything without limits; like in front of a door, or open window as an offering. In modern days, the burning of joss sticks can be used for any reason, like making the smell of a room better or lighting fireworks up."

"In 1951, when Blue Note Records began issuing 10 inch records, Hermansader was one of their first designers, along with Paul Bacon and Gil Melle. Looking back at this era, Michael Cuscuna of Mosaic Records said, “ What John Hermansader and Paul Bacon really did was evoke the feeling of the music. They used everything from Bauhaus designs to things that were really otherworldly.” Angelynn Grant adds, “When people think of Blue Note covers they think of Frank Wolff”s photography and Reid Miles design. But John Hermansader laid the groundwork that got them going along that path.” Richard Cook, who wrote Blue Note Records: The Biography states, “Hermansader in particular balanced the twin issues of photography and type in a way that would mirror the concerns of the Blue Note of the years ahead.”"

A snail is a common name for a kind of mollusc. The term is used for a gastropod with a coiled shell. Their fossil records extends back into the Carboniferous period.
"Land snails and slugs breathe with a kind of lung. They used to be put together in a group, the Pulmonata. This was a well-known order in traditional taxonomy. However, the Pulmonata is polyphyletic. This means the same life-style evolved in a number of different lines. This is called convergent evolution. Therefore, the Pulmonata is no longer an official term in biological classification."
"The term ""snail"" is also sometimes used for aquatic snail-like gastropods, which usually have gills. Actually, most snail species are marine snails. There are more species of them, and they are far greater in numbers. Many kinds of snails can also be found in fresh water habitats."
Most land snails and slugs are herbivorous. Aquatic snails and slugs are usually omnivores or predatory carnivores.
"In many countries around the world, people eat snails as a delicacy. In France, snails are called ""escargots"", which is also the name of the dish. In French cuisine, the snails are cooked in salt water and then served with a garlic sauce."

Shells have many different shapes, sizes, and colors. Snails do not breathe through their mouths, instead they have a breathing hole under their shells."
Foot.
"A snails ""foot"" is a muscle which allows it to move slowly across the ground. The foot puts out ('exudes') slime, which eases the snail's movement, leaving a trail. Snails can absorb mineral nutrients through their foot by simply sitting on a rock."
Head.
The head is attached to the foot. On the head there are 15 mm stalks. At the end of the stalks are snail’s eyes.
Habitat.
"Snails are found all over the world. Generally speaking, land snails live in damp habitats. They live in caves and dark places. Snails can be found in dark places such as in a garden under plant's foliage leaves. Some species live in cold places like the Arctic and a few are found in warm places like beaches and deserts."
Food.
"Land snails eat vegetables and fruits, such as lettuce, carrots, cucumber and apples. Aquatic snails are often carnivorous. Snails use their radula to cut food. The radula is a hard, rough plate in the mouth. Radula teeth are like little pieces of sandpaper. They are good for cutting up plants and if the snail eats meat they are good for tearing the meat apart."
"Many animals eat snails. Fireflies, snakes, beetles, fish, insects, turtles and people eat snails too. To defend themselves, snails pull back into their shells."

Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam. These letters were found and printed in a newspaper. A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the ""Theodore Roosevelt"" but did not fire him from the Navy entirely."
"In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the ""Theodore Roosevelt""."
Career.
"Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa, California. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994. He fought in Iraq in 2003.

Letters.
"He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020. He addressed it to senior officials in the military. He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship. The ship had more than 4000 people on it. Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper ""San Francisco Chronicle"" on March 31, 2020."
"COVID-19 is very contagious, and people can catch it from other people easily. In the letter, Crozier said that the ship was too cramped to allow for sick sailors to do what the Centers for Disease Control and the Navy's own administration said people with COVID-19 should do: Keep away from other people for 14 days. He asked for permission to let his sick sailors go ashore to Guam, where the ship was docked at the time, and go into quarantine there instead of on board the ship. He copied part of a report about the ""Diamond Princess"" cruise ship, and said that even though the ""Diamond Princess""'s passengers had private rooms, more than 100 people still became infected.

"According to Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas B. Modly, Crozier's letter caused naval crews and their families to panic: ""It undermines our efforts and the chain of command's efforts to address this problem and creates a panic. And creates a perception that the Navy's not on the job, the government's not on the job."""
"According to ""The New York Times"", ""a Navy official familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it said that the captain had repeatedly asked his superiors for speedy action to evacuate the ship."""
"Kathleen H. Hicks, who worked at the Pentagon years earlier under President Barack Obama, said that the Navy did have the legal right to fire Crozier but that it might have been a bad idea to do so because it might make sailors and leaders less willing to trust each other."

At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions. I ask all of you to wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me. Don't treat me like a criminal, because I am innocent. I have been forced to submit to a dehumanizing and humiliating examination...It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life...But if this is what I have to endure to prove my innocence, my complete innocence, so be it.'"

"Temporary abdominal closure techniques are used to postpone definite closure until predisposing factors causing pathologic elevation of intra abdominal pressure are resolved. These techniques include the Bogota bag, absorbable mesh, vacuum pack dressings, the Wittmann patch or velcro burr and the KCI VAC or Abthera dressings."
Temporary abdominal closure techniques are most commonly used in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome in which decompressive laparotomy is necessary to reduce intra abdominal pressure to restore system perfusion.
"The Bogota bag acts as a hermetic barrier that avoids evisceration and loss of fluids. Another advantage to the Bogota bag, is that the abdominal contents can be visually inspected."
"The bogota bag can be used in cases of 'burst abdomen' following laparotomies, especially those using a midline horizontal incision. Burst abdomen is usually characterized by a serosanguinous pink discharge from the wound, 6–8 days after surgery"

Slighting
"Slighting is the deliberate damage of an important building. In the Middle Ages, castles were slighted during war. Rich and powerful people built and owned castles, and were proud of them. A king or queen could use slighting as a way to punish people who rebelled against them. Sometimes the owner feared they would lose the castle in an attack, and broke parts of the castle so that it would not be useful to other people. Occasionally, a king or queen might order someone to dismantle their own castle if they did not get permission to build it."
Sublimation is how a solid becomes a gas without becoming a liquid first. It happens when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them. Most substances can sublimate only at low pressure. Many can sublimate in space.
"Sometimes snow sublimates. This is usually on sunny winter days when the air is very dry. Snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day, but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first."
"At normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth, only some compounds like dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can go through this process. CO2 changes from dry ice, a solid to a gas without being a liquid. Also diamond, graphite, iodine, ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure."

Journalism sourcing
"In journalism, a source or news source is a person, written thing, or other way of getting knowledge gives the reporter information that is new. Sources can be official records, books or other printed works, broadcasts, people who work for governments or businesses, organizations and corporations, people who saw and heard crimes, accidents, or other news, and people to whom a news event or issue is important."
"According to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), many things can make a source bona fide, or good, or bad. Reporters should build good relationships with sources so that they trust each other, especially if they write about the same kind of thing often. These reporters are called ""beat reporters."" Beat reporters should also not become close friends with their sources. Journalists should also be skeptical. That means they should wonder whether the source is telling the truth or whether they are lying or wrong. For example, the City News Bureau of Chicago wrote ""If your mother says she loves you, check it out."" Journalists should not use only one source. Instead, they should find many sources that agree with each other, especially when they are writing about a controversy, or something people might disagree or fight about."

Phase-shift keying
"Phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information. This is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave. In such a system, the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information; all information is present in the phase of the signal. In many cases, this allows to better use the bandwidth available."
"If we think of a wave as a wiggly line, (like a sine wave), wiggling a specific number of times a second, and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in. Say if it is at the top of its wiggle, and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle, this is called a phase shift. We can use that change to carry information."
"By either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle, we can send either ones or zeros. This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying. If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top, we can have this represent a 1. If we don't change it at the top, we can have this represent a 0. We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it. A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text."
"Binary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently. Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase-shift keying, which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, to get higher data rates."
Pritzker Architecture Prize
"The Pritzker Architecture Prize is given each year by the Hyatt Foundation. It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life. Jay A.

History.
"""Sim City"" was made by game maker Will Wright and first released by the company Maxis. They are now owned by Electronic Arts. The game was first officially released in 1989."
It was very popular because the game had no end. A player could not win or lose. This was the start of all simulation games.
Gameplay.
"At the start, the player has to build power plants. Power plants make power so the city can have electricity. By building power lines, power is connected to the different areas of the city. Water needs to be pumped in from a river using pipes to connect them to the city."
"Smaller areas are marked out. These are made either residential, commercial, or industrial zones. Zones are the only places where buildings can develop. Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow."
"Roads, schools and hospitals must all be built for the city to get better. Parks and libraries make more people want to move to the city. Railways and highways provide ways to connect to other neighborhoods."

Digital rights management
"Digital rights management (DRM) is a way to make it difficult to copy music, movies, and computer programs. It is used to make people follow copyright laws. It works by using computer technologies."

Caroline Herschel
Caroline Herschel (16 March 1750 – 9 January 1848) was a German astronomer who spent most of her life in England. She was the first female astronomer that we know of.
"She was the first woman to receive a salary as a scientist. She was the first woman in England to hold a government position. She was the first woman to be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1828), and to be named an Honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society (1835, with Mary Somerville). She was also named an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (1838). The King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science on the occasion of her 96th birthday (1846)."
Early life.
"Caroline was born on March 16, 1750 in Hanover, Germany. She was encouraged by her father to get an education. She learnt geometry on her own. She had a hard life because people that she loved died. After her father's death, her brother William Herschel suggested she join him in England. She left Hanover for England on August 16, 1772, with her brother."
"In England, Caroline's neighbour taught her how to cook, market, and to speak English. This expanded her horizons. William encouraged her to be independent. She signed up to learn how to sing and to play the harpsichord. This led her to being a part of William’s musical shows in small gatherings. She and William discussed astronomy in their free time. This caused her interest to grow. Caroline began including English society in her everyday life. She eventually decided to devote her time to astronomy. This helped William: he needed Caroline’s talents in copying papers."
Astronomy.
"When they were in England, Caroline helped her brother in his scientific work. She helped him to discover Uranus with a six-foot telescope. William was credited with the discovery of Uranus. He was knighted because of his discovery, and she was his assistant. She recorded and completed tasks for him. Her calculations and record keeping were always accurate. They saved her brother a lot of time. Caroline often worked on discoveries of her own. She independently discovered the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 110; NGC 205) and another, new, nebula. She also discovered eight comets in 17861795."
"She reworked Flamsteed's ""Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars"". The result was published by the Royal Society in 1798 and contained an index of every observation of every star made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of more than 560 stars that had not been included. In 1825, Caroline donated the works of Flamsteed to the Royal Academy of Göttingen."
"She was the first woman to discover a comet. She discovered seven more comets between 1789 and 1797. The comet 35P/Herschel-Rigollet is named in her honor, as well as the lunar crater C. Herschel, and the planetoid (281) Lucretia. She also is famous for her work with her brother. She aided him in his studies. She reorganized John Flamsteed's ""British Catalogue"", which listed nearly 3,000 stars."
Herschel's brother died in 1822 and left her without his financial support. She returned to Hanover after his death and received her stipend from the British Royal Family. She also helped her brother's son finish his father's work.
Awards.
Caroline Herschel was awarded a gold medal for her works in science from the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828. She was made an honorary member at the Royal Astronomical Society ten years later. Herschel also received a similar award from the Royal Irish Academy. She was awarded the gold medal for science by the King of Prussia on her ninety-sixth birthday.
Legacy.
"Toward the end of Caroline's life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances. Her nephew, John Herschel, re-examined them systematically. The list was eventually enlarged and renamed the New General Catalogue. Many non-stellar objects are still identified by their NGC number."
"Herschel died on January 9, 1848 in Germany. She died at the age of 97. Herschel was never married."
"An asteroid was discovered in 1888. It was called Lucretia, Herschel's middle name. Herschel continued to have a legacy after her death because she discovered several comets."

In most traditional Aboriginal beliefs, there is no such thing as a natural death. Every death is caused by evil spirits or spells. It is usually because of an enemy, who wants revenge for something."
"A featherfoot is so named because they are believed to have supernatural powers, including the ability to fly and move inter-dimensionaly when threatened as means of escape. He wears special shoes made of feathers (usually emu) and hair, stuck together with human blood. Scholars say that the shoes leave no tracks (footprints)."
"South-West of Western Australia, which includes the Noongar people, have a local scary story to tell at night. When the featherfoot is hunting you, it waits till you’re alone or in a small group, at night walking to a destination. The person or the group will start to get a sense of foreboding, followed by a strong sense they are being followed. The featherfoot is close behind, following. Its steps are silent and leave not tracks. The only way to survive a feathfoot attack is to never look behind you until you get back to a light source. Keep walking and don’t look back, it’s when the person looks behind them, is when it attacks. Often the reason the spirit will follow and attack someone is because they have committed a crime, or something as heinous or evil."
"All that is left behind after an attack, is a single large unknown bird feather and a small amount of the victims blood."
"One has been witnessed to live in the Western Australian, Albany Narrikup region, where many animal remains are also found near it's lair in bushland. It is threatened by dogs."

These coins are usually in the shape of a yellow diamond but according to their point value, they can also be a red diamond, a 2-point coin, or a blue diamond, a 3-point coin. Coins can be earned in game play to unlock objectives, and can also be spent at the store."
Making.
"Husband-and-wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova, along with artist Kiril Tchangov, created the hits Harbor Master and Temple Run. At first, the game was released for 99 cents, but soon enough they released Temple Run free, but with purchasable in-game coins. This made revenue multiply five times with in game coin purchasing. Both Shepherd and Luckyanova made the game, while Tchangov made the pictures."

Eureka Stockade
"The Eureka Stockade is the name given to a rebellion by gold miners at Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It took place at sunrise, on December 3, 1854. The miners came from England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Italy, Hungary, France, Germany, China and Australia. The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold. The miners said that the money for the licence was a tax, and that if they had to pay tax then they should be represented in the parliament. Irish miner Peter Lalor became the leader of the miners. They built a fort, or stockade, on Bakery Hill above the gold diggings on the Eureka gold lead. They were attacked by the British Army. More than 30 people were killed. The battle went for 20 minutes."
Flag.
"The miners made their own flag which was flown at the Eureka Stockade. The flag was torn down during the battle and taken away by one of the soldiers. It was given to the Ballarat Art Gallery in the 1890s. Pieces of the flag were sometimes given to important visitors to Ballarat. It is believed that Queen Elizabeth II has a small piece. In the 1973 the flag was restored and put on display at the Art Gallery. The display was opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. The flag has been put on the Victorian Heritage Register and was named an icon by the National Trust in 2006. In August 2010, the Ballarat Art Gallery said that the flag needed further work to keep it safe. It was sent to South Australia to be restored at a cost of more than AU$100,000. The Gallery has built a new airtight case to hold the flag."

Wire transmission.
"Scottish inventor Alexander Bain worked on chemical mechanical fax type devices and in 1846 was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments. He received the first fax patent in 1843. Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine. The Pantelegraph was invented by the Italian physicist Giovanni Caselli He introduced the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyons in 1865, some 11 years before the invention of telephones."
"In 1881, English inventor Shelford Bidwell constructed the ""scanning phototelegraph"" that was the first telefax machine to scan any two-dimensional original, not requiring manual plotting or drawing. Around 1900, German physicist Arthur Korn invented the """". It became widely used in continental Europe after a wanted-person photograph was transmitted from Paris to London in 1908. Its main competitors were the ""Bélinograf"" by Édouard Belin first, then since the 1930s the ""Hellschreiber"", invented in 1929 by German inventor Rudolf Hell, a pioneer in mechanical image scanning and transmission."
"Transmission by landline was replaced by radiotransmission, and from 1960 by satellite transmission. Digital systems are now universal. Faster, more efficient and cheaper fax machines have allowed even small companies to own a fax machine. The technology is now world-wide."

ICS Bégué
ICS Bégué is a French private business school in Paris. It was created in 1957 and is part of IONIS Education Group.
It is recognized by the French State.
Enol
An enol is an alkene that has an OH group attached to one end of the double bond. It is called an enolate if the proton on the oxygen atom is taken away.
"Enols are tautomers of ketones or aldehydes. Tautomers are molecules which are different only in the position of an hydrogen atom. Enols can be made very easily from ketones or aldehydes using a base. They are quite unstable, because the C=O bond is stronger than the C=C bond. However, they can do many interesting reactions. The best example is the aldol reaction."
"Enols of ketones can be made on two different sides. It is important to be able to choose which side to react. The side with less substituents is the easiest one to react: it can be made at low temperature with a bulky base. This is called the kinetic enolate. The other side, with more substituents, is more difficult to react. Higher temperatures are needed. This is called the thermodynamic enolate."
Steric effects
"Steric effects are the effects seen in molecules that come from the fact that atoms occupy space. When atoms are put close to each other, this costs energy. The electrons near the atoms want to stay away from each other. This can change the way molecules want to react. It can also change the shape (or conformation) of the molecule. The amount of space that a group of atoms takes is called the ""steric bulk""."
"An example of steric effects is steric hindrance. This is when a large group in a molecule makes reactions not work. For example, an SN2 reaction does not happen on carbon atoms that have three substituents. Steric hindrance however can also be a positive thing. Sometimes, chemists would like a reaction to happen in one place rather than another one. A bulky group can block a position. It can also change the shape such that only one diastereomer from a reaction is made."
"Steric effects are usually smaller than electronic effects. These affect the molecule's shape and reactivity as well, but they come from the way electrons are placed in bonds."
Motherland Party (Azerbaijan)
"The Motherland Party () is a nationalist and conservative political party in Azerbaijan. It was founded in 1990. Its members are mainly Azerbaijanis who come from Armenia. The party's leader Fazail Agamali is a former deputy minister for social protection. The party's aim is to create a ""free, powerful, democratic and entire Azerbaijan""."
"At the 2010 parliamentary elections, it won 2 out of 125 seats."
"On March 5, 2014, the Lightning traded St. Louis to the New York Rangers for New York captain Ryan Callahan, a 2015 first-round draft pick, and a conditional 2014 second-round pick."
"St. Louis is married to his wife Heather Coragol and they have three sons, Ryan, Lucas and Mason."
Campden tablets
"Campden tablets are used by people making their own beer, wine, or cider. The tablets kill yeast, making better yeast to be added later for better drinks. 5 of them in 1 pint of water makes a cleaning liquid that can be used to clean the equipment. They are made from sulfur. They were invented in Gloucestershire in the 1920s, but Boots Co. made them better. They can also be used to get rid of chlorine in tap water, making it safer to drink."
Meguro
"is one of the 23 special wards of Tokyo, Japan."
"The municipality calls itself ""Meguro City"" in English."

Wilhelm scream
"The Wilhelm scream is a movie and television sound effect first used in 1951 for the movie ""Distant Drums"". The effect became popular again (its use often becoming an in-joke) after it was used in ""Star Wars"" and many other movies as well as television shows and video games. The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion."
"The sound is named for Private Wilhelm, a character in ""The Charge at Feather River"", a 1953 western in which the character is shot with an arrow. This was believed to be the third movie to use the sound effect. It was the first use of the sound from the Warner Brothers sound library."
History.
"The sound effect comes from a series of sound effects made for the 1951 movie ""Distant Drums"". In a scene from the movie, soldiers are walking through a swamp in the Everglades. One of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator. The scream for that scene was recorded later in one take. The sound was labeled as ""man getting bit by an alligator, and he screams."""
Growing popular.
"The Wilhelm scream began to become popular when Benjamin Burtt Jr. found the original recording (which he found labeled as ""Man being eaten by alligator"") and put it into a scene in """". Burtt is credited with naming the scream after Private Wilhelm (after a soldier in ""The Charge at Feather River"" who was shot by an arrow and screamed). Over the next decade, Burtt began using the effect in other films he worked on. This included most projects with George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. It is used in all of the Indiana Jones movies. Other sound designers picked up on the effect, and use of the sound in movies became a tradition in the community of sound designers."
"Research by Burtt shows that actor and singer Sheb Wooley, best known for his song ""Flying Purple People Eater"" in 1958, is likely to have been the voice actor who first performed the scream. This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson, Wooley's widow. Burtt discovered records at Warner Brothers from the editor of ""Distant Drums"". These records include a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for roles in the movie. Wooley played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in ""Distant Drums."" He was one of the few actors used for the recording of more vocal parts for the movie. Wooley performed more sound effects, including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator. Dotson confirmed that it was Wooley's scream that had been in so many westerns, adding, ""He always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films."""
Usage.
"The Wilhelm scream has become a cinematic sound cliché. By 2008 it had been used in many works, including over 216 movies, television shows and video games . Some directors, most notably George Lucas, include it in almost every one of their productions."
"In 2010, a Wilhelm Scream App was released on the Apple iPhone. As of 2011, it is still free to download."
"The second single by British artist James Blake was called ""The Wilhelm Scream"" and was released in 2011."

"Fall Branch, Tennessee"
"Fall Branch is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washington and Greene counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The population was 1,291 at the 2010 census. Some areas in Sullivan also use the Fall Branch ZIP code."
History.
"One of the earliest settlers at Fall Branch was Isaac White. He was a Revolutionary War veteran who arrived in the area in 1781. He eventually established a farm at what is now the intersection of Interstate 81 and State Highway 93. Another early settler, Gabriel Morgan, built a grist mill at Fall Branch in the early 1800s. The mill stood until the 1930s, when it was torn down."
"By the early 1800s, Fall Branch was known as ""Crouch Town"", after a family of early settlers. The name had changed to ""James' Cross Roads"" by 1830, when a post office was established. The name ""Falls Branch"" had been adopted by 1854, and the ""s"" was dropped from ""Falls"" in 1883, giving the community its current name. The name was inspired by the waterfall the community's main creek, also called Fall Branch, spills over just before it empties into Horse Creek."
"In 1836, Fall Branch was designated as the county seat of the proposed ""Powell County"", which would have consisted of parts of Washington, Greene, Sullivan, and Hawkins counties. While voters approved of the new county, it was rejected by the Tennessee Supreme Court on the grounds that it failed to meet the minimum size required by the state constitution for new counties."
Schools.
"A school, Fall Branch Seminary, was established at Fall Branch in 1842. Fall Branch High School, initially a two-year school, was established before 1900. The high school was consolidated with several other smaller schools to form Daniel Boone High School in nearby Gray in 1971."
Buildings.
"A number of buildings dating to the 19th century still stand in Fall Branch. The Masonic Lodge, home to Johnson Lodge No. 274, was completed in 1869.

Pureiromba
Pureiromba () or Puleilompa () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion. He is the giver of rain and good luck in farming. He is one of the major Umang Lai deities. He is the Ancestor God of the Angom clan of the Meitei ethnicity.
History.
"According to the Thalon text, Pureiromba () was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill (Nongmaiching Hill). Before the Meitei King Ura Konthouba (c. 7th century CE) killed all the Selloi Langmai people, the cults of these five gods were put together into that of a single God with the name ""Langmai Ningthou"" (lit. ""King of the Langmais""). The personal names became the other names or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people became one chiefdom. This chiefdom later became the Angom clan."
Description.
"The people who worship Pureiromba () think of him as their ancestor. However, no one knows if he was a real person from history or a god that acted like a human. But the ancient texts that show his adventures in the human world show him as a strong, powerful and able founding ancestor. He was initially associated with a Loi village of Andro, Manipur. But in later times, the people of Moirang worshipped him as one of their deified ancestors."
Festival.
"The history of the British Empire has added to the spread of English. English is an important language in many places today. In Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United States, among others (like those in the Commonwealth of Nations), English is the main language. Because the United Kingdom (the country where England is) and the United States have historically been powerful in commerce and government, many people find it helpful to learn English to communicate in science, business, and diplomacy. This is called learning English as an additional language, English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL)."
"English literature has many famous stories and plays. William Shakespeare was a famous English writer of poems and plays. His English is Early Modern English, and not quite like what people speak or write today. Early Modern English sounded different, partly because the language was beginning a ""great vowel shift"". Later, many short stories and novels also used English. The novel as we know it is first seen in 18th century English. Therefore, today, many famous songs and movies (cinema films) use the English language."
Grammar.
"English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French."
Nouns.
"There are different types of nouns in English, like proper nouns and common noun. To show if a noun is plural, which means there is more than one of the noun, usually ""-s"" is added at the end of a word."
Pronouns.
Pronouns are words that take the place of a noun to avoid repetition. There are different types of pronouns in the English language. The most important ones are:
Verbs.
"Verbs in English show the action or the state of a sentence. Verbs can come in different shapes in a sentence based on the time or condition we are talking about. For example, the verb ""eat"" changes to ""ate"" in past."
Adjectives.
"Adjectives are words that describe a noun. In English they always come before a noun to give you more information about that noun. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
Spelling.
"Written English uses a range of historical spelling patterns that changed over time due to political and cultural changes. As a result, different words can use the same letters and combinations for very different sounds. For example, ""-ough"" was once a guttural but has become different in ""through"" (threw), ""rough"" (ruff), ""dough"" (doe) or ""cough"" (coff)."
Many English-speaking countries spell words differently. Some words that are spelled one way in the United Kingdom and many other countries in the British Commonwealth are spelled differently in the United States.
Alphabets.
There are 26 letters in the English alphabet:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Vocabulary.
"Nearly 60% of the vocabulary in the English language comes from Latin and its descendants, mainly French:"
"However, the most common words are more often those of Germanic origin. Also, expressions and typical short phrases are often of Germanic origin."

Stolen base
"In baseball, a stolen base is when a baserunner advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate. In baseball statistics, stolen bases are displayed as SB. It is possible to steal second base, third base, or home plate, but not to steal first base."
"If the defense does not try to put the baserunner out (for example, if the catcher does not even look his way), the play is called defensive indifference (also called fielder's indifference). No stolen base is credited to the runner in this case. Defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run. MLB Rule 10.07(g) defines defensive indifference."
Strategy.
"A player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed, but also good base-running instincts, quickness, and split-second timing. The scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the Major League Baseball rule book."
"If a player is good at stealing bases, his manager may let him try to steal a base whenever he thinks he can. A player who is allowed to try to steal whenever he wants is said to have the ""green light"". Players who do not have the green light may only be allowed to steal when a coach or manager tells him to."

"Ali Aksih was a preeminent leader of the Tatar nationalist movement in diaspora. He was born in the city of Hailar (Manchuria), where he attended a local Tatar elementary school before entering a Russian lycee. After completing the lycee in 1936, he went to study at Al-Azhar University in Cairo (Egypt), and in 1938, along with another young nationalist, Ahat Ginish, went to Poland. Akish and Ginish served as technical assistants to Ayaz Iskhaki at the Idel-Ural National Center, where the newspaper “Yanga Milli Yul"" (New National Path) was published. Their work was interrupted by the invasion of Poland by the Nazi and Soviet forces."
"Akish lived from 1940 to 1966 in Turkey where he was involved with the diaspora national movement. His pamphlet “Problems of Idel-Ural and Soviet Imperialism” printed in 1963 received great attention and provoked repercussions in the USSR in the form of two books, one ostensibly written by the President of the Tatar ASSR, Salikh Batiyev in 1977. In 1966 Ali Akish joined the Tatar-Bashkir Service of Radio Liberty, Inc. In 1983, he retired from this position and went again to Ankara.

"In 1994, after reading Vladimir Zhirinovsky's book ""Last Thrust to the South,"" he wrote an article for the Turkish newspaper ""Milliyet"" in which he denounced the Russian nationalists' imperial and anti-Turkish aspirations. The article was highly significant as one of the first published in Turkey critical of Zhirinovsky and his views."
"He was able to visit Kazan, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia. On his first visit to Kazan he brought, at his own expense, a computer that he donated to the Tatar Public Center. Akish dedicated his whole life to the liberation of the Tatar people from colonial oppression. The World Tatar League named him honorary president in recognition of his achievements. A school was named in his honor in the city of Chally (Naberezhniye Chelny) in Tatarstan."

Gold rush
"A gold rush is when a lot of miners go to a mining place full of gold. Well-known examples are the California Gold Rush of 1848, the Australian gold rush which began in 1851, or the Fraser river gold rush in British Columbia, Canada in 1858."
California Gold Rush
"The California Gold Rush started when James Wilson Marshall was building a water powered sawmill for John Sutter in 1848. When he finished building the sawmill, he went to the river to fetch some water. He saw some shiny little flakes of gold in the river. He immediately went to tell John, and they tried to keep it a secret. But word soon got out, and the gold rush started."
"It was 1849 when the Gold Rush started. People who came to California for gold were called forty-niners because they came in the year 1849. Some of them became rich but most did not. Some people started selling things. Many of them became rich, famous, and politically powerful. Sometimes a woman could earn more than her mining husband."
Men like Levi Strauss also sold things. He invented and sold jeans made from strong denim. The California Gold Rush ended in 1855. Many gold miners went back home because gold was harder to find; others found other work.
Jeans
"Jeans are a type of pants made from heavy, strong cotton material (fabric) called denim. They were invented in the United States by Levi Strauss in 1872. In the late 1800s, jeans were worn by workers. Jeans are one of the most obvious symbols of American cultural influence in the world. They are worn in many countries around the world."
"In the 1950s, jeans became a popular fashion for teenagers and young adults. In the 1950s, jeans were part of rockabilly fashion for teenagers. Now, jeans are a very popular type of pants. They are usually worn as casual fashion clothing. Jeans are made in many styles and colors."
"The word ""jeans"" came from the French name of the city in Italy where a strong cotton fabric was made. The Italian city's name, Genoa, was spelled ""jene"" in Middle English and ""Gênes"" in the French language."
Sovereignty
Sovereignty is the right of a government to have complete control over its area. The idea that this right comes from doing good things for the people under control of the government is as old as Ancient Greece if not older.
"The exact meaning of Sovereignty has changed some in the past. The present meaning of Sovereignty is said to come from the Peace of Westphalia, an agreement between the rulers of Europe in 1648 which said:"
The Past.
Ancient Rome.
"Ancient Rome was first the Roman Republic, but then when Octavian made the Roman Empire the Emperor of Rome said that he was ""Sovereign"". The meaning of this was that he could make any law he wanted, and he did not have to do what the law said himself."
Middle Ages.
"In the time of the Middle Ages many kings and rulers had to do what other leaders said, such as the leader of the Catholic Church, the Pope. Because of this, the idea of ""Sovereignty"" was not much used."
Reformation.
"In the time of the Protestant Reformation, in the 16th century, governments were breaking away from religious leaders. Also many wars were fought between different rulers inside areas that are now sovereign countries. The English Civil War is one example of a war fought in this time between leaders inside one country."
"The Peace of Westphalia was made in 1648 and the idea of ""Sovereignty"" came back. Governments were now separate from outside leaders and only one government or ruler inside a country could make laws. The divine right of kings became more widespread."
The Enlightenment and Social Contract theory.
"The English thinker Thomas Hobbes wrote a book in 1651 that said rulers and governments are ""Sovereign"" because they are good for the safety of the people. The idea that people could change rulers if they were not safe was new with Hobbes."
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote a book in 1763 that said the choice of the people is the only thing sovereignty comes from.
"Both Rousseau and Hobbes advanced a ""Social Contract"" in which people consent to a government's sovereignty just by living in the country and that people give up at least some of their liberty for security"
"In 1789 the French Revolution made an important country's government ruled by the choices of the people for the first time after the Middle Ages (some cities and small countries were democracies in the Middle Ages). There were many problems and France went back to the old way soon after, but would be ready for Democracy in 1870's. In England, many people got to vote after The Reform Act in 1832. The United States broke away from England in 1776-1783, but was not an important country at that time."

But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy officers. Hemingway was almost killed. Later he said that ""bullets are all the same. If they do not hit you, there is no story. If they do hit you, then you do not have to write it. """

The novel tells the story of an American who has chosen to fight against the fascists. He realizes that there are lies and injustice on his side. But he sees no hope except the victory of his side.

"""To stay in places and to leave. . . to trust, to distrust. . . to no longer believe and believe again. . . to watch the changes in the seasons. . . to be out in boats. . . to watch the snow come, to watch it go. . . to hear the rain. . . And to know where I can find what I want."""

"The original South Quay station opened in 1987 in Millwall, and was a standard DLR phase 1 elevated station. It was later extended to permit the use of 2 car trains. The station was constrained by sharp curves at both ends and could not be further extended on its original site. The DLR planned to operate 3 car trains on this line so the station was relocated to a new site over Millwall Dock. The new site is some distance to the east, so the relocated station is partly in Cubitt Town."

It was nominated for 2 Academy Awards in 1967."
The name 'Dodo'.
"The history of the word 'Dodo' is not clear. Dutch admiral Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 during an expedition to Indonesia. He called the bird 'walgvogel', meaning ""disgusting bird"" because he disliked the taste of the meat. Four years later, the Dutch captain, Willem van Westsanen, used the word 'Dodo' for the first time."
"The ""Encarta Dictionary"" and the ""Chambers Dictionary of Etymology"" say ""dodo"" is a Portuguese word, coming from ""doido"". It means ""fool"" or ""crazy"". Another idea is that 'dodo' was a copy of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeon like sound, ""doo-doo""."
"In 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote a description of the Dodo, and of other animal and plants on the island ."
Description.
"The dodo was a large bird and weighed about . They had grey feathers and yellow feet. Their big hooked bill was a green/yellow color. It had short wings that were only stubs. They ate fruit, seeds and nuts. Portuguese sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish. They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food. They are eaten by humans who come in the search of treasure or spouting."
Extinction.
"The dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill. Dogs, cats, rats and pigs were left on the island and also killed the dodos. Because dodos built their nests on the ground, the new animals ate their eggs. The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its habitat. Within 80 years, the dodo was extinct."
"The last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish. Only a foot and a head are left. The American Museum of Natural History in New York has a skeleton showing. It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos. The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a dodo, found in a swamp."

The age of Lord Ram precedes that of Lord Krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 BC (the ideal period of Mahabharat Yudh).
"Lord Shiva and his Son Murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the Tamil Language, probably long long time before sage Agastya could compile the same."
Great auk
"The great auk was a large bird, that could not fly. People hunted it for meat and feathers. It grew rare, because it was too easy to kill, and the ones left could not breed fast enough to make up for the lost ones. The last known great auks (there were two auks) were killed on June 3, 1844 in Iceland. It lived mostly in the water, like a duck."
"Penguins got their name from the great auk. The word ""penguin"" was the Celtic word for ""great auk"". When sailors saw penguins for the first time, they thought they looked like great auks."
"The great auk was covered in black feathers, but had white feathers on its chest and abdomen. It had very short wings, like stubs, which meant it could not fly. On land it stood upright and was about 75 cm tall. They spent most of their time at sea, coming to shore in the summer to breed. They lived in large breeding colonies on low rocky islands in the north Atlantic Ocean from Canada to Norway. Females laid one egg on bare rock. In winter they went as far south as Florida and southern Spain."

"Bilal ibn Rabah (, also called Bilal al-Habashi) was an Ethiopian born in Mecca in the late 6th century, sometime between 578 and 582.Bilal was an Ethiopian slave. Bilal's owner was Umayyah ibn Khalaf, an enemy of Islam. When Bilal learned about Muhammad and became Muslim, his master started punishing him. When Muhammad heard about this, he ordered Abu Bakr to buy Bilal's freedom and Bilal -who was now free- joined Muhammad's companions."
"Muhammad choose Bilal as the first muezzin. A muezzin is someone who leads the call to daily prayer. Sometimes Bilal walked the streets to call Muslims to come to prayer but most of the times, he said the Adhan from the top of the mosque."
"Some years later, when the Muslim army walked towards Mecca, everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Kaaba, the worship house believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: ""All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."""
"After Muhammad died, Bilal never said the Adhan again - except on two occasions. Once in Syria and the second time, in Medina, when Muhammad's grandson, Hasan ibn Ali asked him to do so."
Bilal died in Damascus between 638 and 642 (AD).
Legacy.

"In 1967, Previn became conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra and in 1968 conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. He stayed with the LSO for eleven years. His television series ""André Previn's Music Night"" helped to make classical music popular in Britain. From 1976 to 1984, Previn was conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO), with whom he made another television series called ""Previn and the Pittsburgh"". He was also principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
"In 1985 he became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, but because of disagreements he resigned in 1989."
Previn made many recordings and composed many movie scores and other musical works. He also toured and recorded as a jazz pianist. Later he concentrated on composing classical music.
"Previn received many prizes and honours. In the United Kingdom he was knighted in 1996. He is particularly remembered in Britain for a guest appearance he made on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1971 where Eric Morecambe (who called him Andrew Preview) pretended to play the Piano Concerto by Edvard Grieg with Previn conducting. When Previn told him he was playing all the wrong notes, Morecambe grabbed him by his jacket and said that he was playing ""all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order""."
Personal life.
Andre Previn was married five times. His fifth marriage was to the German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter for whom he wrote a violin concerto. They divorced in 2006.
"Previn died on February 28, 2019 at home in Manhattan aged 89."

Mitochondrial Eve
"Mitochondrial Eve is a term from genetics and human evolution. It refers to a woman, whose mitochondrial DNA is a parent of all living humans. To put this more exactly, she is the female most recent common ancestor of all humans alive at present."
How this is decided.
"Rather than use full DNA comparisons, two simpler methods are used:"
This gives haplogroups (a haplogroup is a combination of genes on different chromosomal regions that are closely linked and tend to be inherited together).
The results.
"According to current research, Mitochondrial Eve lived about 200.000 years ago. Most likely she lived in East Africa, when ""Homo sapiens sapiens"" (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species."
"Mitochondrial Eve lived later than ""Homo heidelbergensis"" and the emergence of ""Homo neanderthalensis"", but earlier than the out of Africa migration."
"The dating for 'Eve' was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis, and a boost to the hypothesis that modern humans originated relatively recently in Africa and spread from there, replacing more ""archaic"" human populations such as Neanderthals. As a result, the latter hypothesis became dominant."
King Ghidorah
"King Ghidorah is a fictional monster who appears in movies from Japan. He first appeared in ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"". Since then, he has appeared in several ""Godzilla"" movies. He is a golden three-headed dragon with no arms, large wings, and two tails. He is the strongest monster in the ""Godzilla"" movies."
Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)
"The Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331 is a piece of music for the piano. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was published in Vienna, Austria by Artaria in 1784. It is the second of a group of three piano sonatas. Mozart probably wrote the group in Salzburg in the summer of 1783. It was then that he brought his wife Constance (Weber) to his hometown to introduce her to his father Leopold. The first sonata in the group is No. 10 in C major, K. 330. The third is No. 12 in F major, K. 332. Mozart numbered this group of sonatas 1 through 3. He spent much time teaching during his early years in Vienna. It is likely that these sonatas were written for his pupils."
"The A major sonata is unique among Mozart's piano sonatas. It does not include a movement in sonata form. The first movement is a lilting theme in 6/8 followed by six variations in A major and A minor. The last variation is in 4/4 time. The second movement is a Menuetto in A major with a contrasting section (called a Trio) in D major. It is written in 3/4 time. The third and final movement is the famous ""Alla Turca"" (Turkish March or Turkish Rondo) in 2/4 time. It is considered one of the finest examples of Viennese Turkish music that was produced in the late 18th century. The rondo's rolled block bass chords suggest the drum rolls of a Turkish Janissary band. In true classical style, the rondo alternates between major and minor keys, and loud and soft dynamics. The piece is a favorite for amateur recitals."

Foreign portfolio investment
"Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) is the capital inflow from one country to another that takes the form of portfolio investment, which is more liquid and involves less control than direct investment. Foreign portfolio investment is a type of passive investing where investors purchase securities of foreign companies, but do not actively participate in the management of those companies. The term ""passive"" means that the investors are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the companies they invest in; they simply buy securities and hope that their value increases over time."
Portfolio investment is a type of investment involving a collection of assets — usually financial securities — owned by an individual or company. Portfolio investments are typically made with the expectation that they'll generate income and/or capital gains.

"but as far as influencing young people, I think that that is, uh, that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age."
You can't play football at fifty-five.
Right.
"But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle, uh,"
anything can be warped.
Yeah.
"But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity safely."
Uh-huh.
Something to stay active at for a long time.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And a lot of seniors, a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years."
"Yeah,"
and they can still get good at it.
"That's right,"
that's absolutely right.
"And it's something that,"
"Well, maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on,"
"Yeah,"
"when you're too old to do anything else go play golf,"
Yeah
yeah
"But it's, it's also something that husband and wife can participate in"
Uh-huh.
"or, you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles."
True.
"You know, you can go to the country club together."
"And we do have a very loving cat that's, you know, kind of our baby."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and we like pets."
We like them around.
We have grandchildren that run through
"and they think we should have a dog,"
and that's because they have a Great Dane
Huh.
Yes.
They're just huge
Definitely.
"Well, we, you know,"
"if it, um, if it were just more peaceful, you know, with the little ones, we would definitely have a pet."
I just think it's nice to have around.
We had a cat that had kittens.
So any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered.
"Oh, yes,"
yes.
"Because, uh, I did."
That experience was awful
"Yes,"
"I have never wanted to,"
"that's why we've never gotten a female, you know, in anything."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, uh, and our male cats, you know, we had, uh, neutered right away,"
to baby very what you doing ?
"and, of course, it, he doesn't know it."
He's still out partying.
Oh.
"But, um, you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her, have her spayed, you know."
"And, uh,"
"Well, a lot of times now when you buy them from like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying."
Uh-huh.
And we have the things that are extras.
But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist.
Yeah.
"And, well, you know, the auto budget,"
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry.
Uh-huh.
"And insurance,"
is insurance bad there?
"Um, I've got, uh, two older cars."
"There both,"
one's a seventy-seven
and one's a seventy-eight.
"Well, we've got one eighty-nine."
"And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a year."
"But when I moved to the new town I live in,"
"because it's a different county, which has less crime, and, uh, less, you know, less highways"
"and so it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned,"
"so my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year."
Wow.
"That's not bad,"
four hundred and something a year.
"That's, that's,"
It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.
That's cheaper than we pay.
"Yeah,"

Yeah.
"and, uh, I was up there last weekend,"
"and there are trees that, that still have their leaves on,"
"and they're green,"
but they're dead
"You know, the, the freeze just got them."
"They, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,"
"and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all."
"Not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all."
Really weird this year.
"I'm not sure what that, what that means."
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now."
I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
"So you, you all actually had some color, huh?"
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
It kind of crept in
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"we, we did, for a time."
"Yeah,"
it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Gorgeous.

We know what we can do
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"uh, so let's see."

That's right.
"But I have seen  lately, yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, whoops, government can't do it,"
A change?
I was going to say the same thing.
schools are not able to
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker whether, you know, uh, whether you're Christian or Jewish  or whatever, uh,"
Right.
Right.
and the family
"Are going to have to solve some of the problem, huh."
"those are the two that can, that, that have the wherewithal"
"and, of course, Judeo-Christianity, uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, uh, uh, mission by the Lord to do this very thing."
Uh-huh.
"So when another group of, of, uh, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,"
so
Oh.
"I firmly believe that, uh,"
"Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room,"
but our cat would sleep with us
and he hated that.
Did he?
Uh-huh.
"He just thought that they belong,"
and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that.
Uh-huh.
"So, I guess it's probably, probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though I love cats."
"I think it would probably be a dog,"
and it would definitely be an outdoor animal.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I think that's one of the reasons our,"
"because as I said our, our Schnauzer was old."
And so he was becoming incontinent.
"And so then I would just have messes in the house,"
"and I think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with, you know."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, and it was new carpeting"
"and, you know, it just really, you know, upset me no end."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that would, Greg, uh,"
my husband's grandparents have a dog
"and they just,"
it needs to be put to sleep
"but it's grandpa's dog,"
"and, uh, he's really getting too old to take care of it."
But the dog messes all over the carpet
and my daughter is just nine months old
I'm jealous.
"and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible,"
"it's a three eighty-six,"
"I guess it's twenty-five,"
"yeah,"
three eight six twenty-five C maybe
"I don't know,"
no we don't have the
we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
"and,"
What kind of consulting do you do?
"Um, well, I actually do some work, working at M I T and at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington,"
Uh-huh.
and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?
"Um, well, it depends,"
"it's very different in the different places,"
"but,"
Is it programming related?
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Program related, research related,"
"and I work in the speech field,"
"and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,"
Uh-huh.
"and I do that type of stuff typically for other people,"
"and we, like here we use the P C to do that."
Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.
Word processing.
"Well, more, uh,"
"do you know Latek? Word text processing,"
No I'm not familiar with that.
"really,"
especially in Texas
"Oh, I know it"
"The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful."
"It really was,"
yeah.
"So I don't know,"
"I, I,"
"it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go."
Yeah
Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
"Yeah,"
"I think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem,"
and I think it could get worse.
Yeah.
"You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude,"
"and say, huh, you know, why should we vote,"
"then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things."
Yeah.
"It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting."
Uh-huh.
"Right, uh,"
"yeah,"
"we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull."
"Yeah,"
"it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected."
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Kind of scary when you think about that.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, who's the other guy, LaRouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but"
"he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's probably a good thing.
It's probably the safest thing.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum"
Yep
and simple majority won't do.
No.
"And even like, you know, two-thirds majority, I mean, it's"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"yeah,"
quorums are to easy to get.
Yep.
"And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know."
"So it's, it's"
definitely
"but, uh, I don't know."
"I could, I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing."
Yeah.
Like Gives them a little too much power
Yeah
"I, I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently."
"But, uh,"
"Plus, you know, you may be, you know, doing, you know, a, a guilty verdict"
"but it may not be, you know, it may be for technical reasons"
Yeah.
"About the only good thing I would say about that is it that it would, uh, hurry the process up a bit"
Yeah.
"but I mean even now we've got, I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that"
and  that's what the trial by jury.
"You can play with your friends,"
"he can play with his friends,"
"but you've both been out and exercised,"
and you have enjoyed the day.
"Right,"
yeah.
"Or my favorite,"
just ride around in the cart with him
"You bet,"
you get a lot of exercise that way.
"Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just look at the golf course."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, I'll tell you what, if if they're not real good golfers, sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long."
"Oh, yeah."
"But my husband's pretty tolerant,"
so he's not too bad to watch.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, mine had a very short fuse."
"If he did something bad, he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it."
"Oh, no,"
yeah.
He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.
"I mean, just get so mad, he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal."
Gosh.
"Now my husband has a temper,"
but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course.
"He's, because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
So I guess he's real laid back about it.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, I see."
"uh, but, uh, we did a lot of fishing when we were up there."
"But down here, I have a brother that likes to go over on the east, in East Texas, and do fishing."
"I can't remember what the name of the lake is,"
and he was just here this past weekend.
"I could have,"
"I, I think he mentioned it again,"
but I couldn't remember what it was.
"Uh, I want to call it Salt Fork, or Lake Fork."
"I, I can't remember,"
but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places.
"Oh, oh, oh, uh, I think I know where, uh, Lake Caddo, or something like that."
"I, you know,"
that may be it.
That may be it.
"If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places. They hold tournaments there, and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and he said that he has never gone anywhere before,"
"and he's fished all over the United States, in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen."
So I would love to go over there.
"They were talking about going over there, and, and some time in the spring,"
"and I was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing, and, uh, and catch some bass."
"I would love to do that,"
"but they have snakes over there,"
"and I'm not too welcome around,"
"I don't, I really don't want to share a boat with a snake."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I just, I, I, I don't see it."
Yeah.
"I mean, you, you hate to be paranoid"
but there are really only so many things you can do.
"You can have the house alarm, uh neighborhood watch program, you know, uh, as a woman not go out at night"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do."
Yeah.
One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
Yeah.
"even, even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps,"
Uh-huh.
"it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know."
"They could basically, uh,"
"when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors  um, things like that like"
Uh-huh.
"That's,"
Uh-huh.
they did in Miami that time.
"But it's not, uh,"
"if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self-defense though."
That's not always true.
It isn't?
No.
"There was a, there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed"
Uh-huh.
"and essentially what he had done is set a, a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home."
Uh-huh.
Huh.
The guy came in while he was home
"and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned."
"He didn't die,"
but he was severely burned
Uh-huh.
"and the average, you know, the average, uh, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here"
"Oh, if you had it early."
but usually it's not until later
It's really strange.
"Yeah,"
I think we usually have a frost in October.
Yeah.
"Uh, but, you know. We really need the rain that we've been getting,"
"and it has not today,"
"but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day."
"Is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere?"
Flooding anywhere.
"I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere,"
"I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past,"
"but, uh, no,"
I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
"It's just kind of, uh,"
"we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather. But really it's strange."
We haven't really had an autumn.
It's like we went into winter
Yes.
"you know, the poor trees, said what"
"Yes,"
"yeah,"
we had summer lasting long
"and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day."
"Yeah,"
"uh, it's,"
"Yeah,"
"there, you, you know,"
"usually there's, uh,"
and my father works in films
"and such,"
"and I tend to, tend to be hypercritical of these things,"
"and then, perhaps, perhaps it's unfair, because I, I, I must admit I enjoy these movies"
"Yeah,"
right.
"and that's what they're for,"
"but I don't, don't remember them,"
"and I think it's, I think, I can think of movies I have less fun during"
"and then after the movie's over, I remember it so terribly well because it, it had some, some meaning to me or something."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"exactly,"
"yeah,"
"there, there, there are several movies that hit home like that."
"Of course the ones I always remember are the, the older ones"
Uh-huh.
"I always like the musicals, and uh,  those ones, that just stick in your head."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"they leave,"
"yeah,"
"they leave, they leave some songs with you,"
I don't know what it is
Uh-huh.
"but it just,"
"I mean, I don't know if this is old fart talking here or something, because I'm not that old"
"No,"
it could be.
"you know, those old movies seemed to have had something that, uh, that was memorable somehow,"
Uh-huh.
I don't know what it was.
Right
"and, and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of,  um, women don't feel like they need to get married anymore."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
I was twenty-seven when I got married
"and I just at the time, um,"
my husband actually even jokes about it.
Uh-huh.
He was twenty-three when we met
"an I was at a point where it was like, I didn't date,"
"I mean, I just, I went out to have a good time,"
Right.
but I didn't have to have male companionship.
"Right,"
right.
"Um, and a lot of the, um, friends that I had in school at that point, who had gone back and gone to law school, or M B A programs, um, which I also had done, had just, you know, they were very sad."
Uh-huh.
"But then by the time I got married, um,  it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, um, the attachments that women feel like they need to have, the dependency,  their self-identity is stronger."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's just really not there anymore."
Yeah.
"And that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and other women seeing, uh, women seeing other women, you know,  out in the corporate world."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"That's like, oh, I can do that."
"You know, maybe,  I don't need to get married."
"Yeah,"
okay.
I think Florida still uses electric chair.
Yeah
"Uh, I don't, I don't know."
In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God.
Yeah.
"And that's not,"
I don't think that's right.
"But on the other hand, there's a lot of advantages to it."
Yeah.
I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
"and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. Um,"
Yeah.
with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year.
"They,"
Yeah.
That's what's happening here.
"There is,"
"like, uh, that's,"
"in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of, uh, uh, repeat offenders being let out and doing it again."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"And it's like, you know, that's a big problem"
but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
Uh-huh.
"and it's really, you know, it's, it gets to be a a big problem."
Yeah.
"Uh, go ahead."
"I wish if they were going to do it, they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't."
Right.
"Be a little more, you know,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well, that, that was number one for the week actually, too,"
"so, so it was a little bit, uh,"
"I was thinking, Wow,"
people must be into crime movies again.
"But, but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an, um, an interesting point."
Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS.
Is that right?
I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not.
I did see GHOSTS.
"Yeah,"
"and, and, and that was, that, that helped us sort of feel good about, you know, about ourselves and about one around us, in that at least, at least, if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that, at least they're still going to see the real good movies, you know."
Yeah.
I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.
Yeah.
And it turned out to be an excellent movie.
Yeah.
"It was, it, I was absolutely enthralled by it."
"I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it, who had the lead role."
"Oh, Patrick Swayze?"
"Yeah,"
and I especially like him.
"Yeah,"
he's very good.
He's a really good guy.
"Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any,"
"Really,"
I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently.
What else have we seen recently.
"Oh, you know, what's pretty cute actually. Um,"
DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
"well, I think,"
"I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time."
"So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in."
"Yes,"
we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast.
Uh-huh.
We'll catch our news that way.
Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately?
"Lately, I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I can't remember the last time I saw it."
It's been a while.
"Yeah,"
"well, I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not"
"I don't know,"
"sometimes they come on and, and say."
"Oh, that's right."
"Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words."
"Um, yeah."
It was really interesting.
It is interesting.
"So,"
Do you work for Texas Instruments?
"No,"
"no,"
"just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church."
"Oh, that's nice."
Yes.
"Yes,"
yes.
"So,"
Which I think is a good thing.
It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It, uh,"
"plus, uh, you know the safety factor and stuff."
"Well, we enjoy having pets."
"We, uh, you know, I think they're a lot of company,"
"and, and when my mother lived with us, uh, the cat was really hers"
"and, and he was kind of wild."
"Our, our daughter found her and brought her to us,"
"and, uh, that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap."
Oh.
"And she was the only one at first that, you know, could really hold him, you know, because he was really skittish."
"But it was like he knew you know,"
uh-huh.
"and he would sleep with her,"
"and so he was a lot of company to her. You know, and, and just love her."
Yeah.
"And he's, cats are usually so independent"
"but this one you know, he comes up"
"and he crawls up next to my husband now, you know."
"He's,"
"you know, before the dog died, we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side,"
"and the cat would sleep on my husband's side, you know"
And when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row
My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us.
Uh-huh.
"and that's the other issue. Uh,"
the pitch and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well and thread,"
"Uh, I don't go to the movies a whole lot,"
"but, uh, I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie."
I haven't seen that yet.
"I, I, I hear,"
"we, a whole bunch of us were going to go see it."
"It's playing at school actually in about two weeks, I guess."
So we're going to go see that.
But you enjoyed that?
"Yeah,"
"it's, it's something that, uh,"
"my brother lives over in Fort Worth,"
"and I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago,"
"and he said, Well I'll wait until it comes out on, uh, tape and rent, rent the video."
"And I said, no,"
this is not one that you want to do that with.
"That's what I heard,"
yeah.
"It's, uh, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen."
"It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing,"
"it's just, uh, just amazing, amazing picture."
"Yeah,"
"I've heard it, it, it's not one for the videos."
"No,"
"it's one I think,"
"but, you know, every now and then you find one that you say, yeah,"
this is my favorite movie.
"Well, this is the one for me this time."
"now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,"
"but I get my kids to do that,"
"so,"
Oh
"I, I don't have to do that."
"And, um, and it really,"
and you mix it all up with
"there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,"
but it's so simple
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.
"Oh, yeah."
You serve it cold?
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah,"
that sounds good.
"Yeah,"
"it has to sit in the fridge over night,"
"but, but it's really good."
Um.
And I like that one.
Yeah.
"Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,"
Yeah.
"so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue"
Exactly.
"like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over"
"and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, that sounds good."
And it was real good.
You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way
and then people think they're eating steak or something
very definitely.
And so you've got a real balance to make there.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
"Well, I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old."
"They aren't really that old,"
"but they are, sort of wearing out."
My mamma is a dialysis patient
Uh-huh.
"and she is only about sixty-four,"
but she's had some pretty close calls
and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
and so she's phasing out ounds like
"and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when she wants to"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home,"
but my daddy keeps talking about it.
"I don't,"
"I couldn't possibly, couldn't never see him in a nursing home."
ery faint.
"And my grand daddy also doesn't like, wouldn't want to be in a nursing home."
"He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now"
Oh really.
and he's living by himself.
My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
"Oh, okay."
"so but, he's, you know,"
"as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home."
"Yeah,"
but it gets hard.
"My, my grandmother is in her mid eighties"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Gosh,"
I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area
but you're right.
Yeah.
I grew up in a real small town in Florida.
Oh.
I mean a real small town
"And, uh, I think it was just"
"of course it was back in the, in the fifties"
and I think it was real prevalent back then.
"I I think people thought more of others than they do now. You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it."
Yeah.
"Well,"
"and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back. Um, if we've lost some of that"
"and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um, that's true,"
"maybe that's a way,"
"if, if young people had to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. Um,  is helping others"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
I do to.
I do to.
"I'm not sure that, that today's kids would go for it though."
I think you would have to start younger.
Yeah.
"I, I don't know how young you'd have to go"
"but I think by the time they're, oh, early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late now. At least around here."
"Yeah,"
"I think, uh, I think it does help, um, even preschoolers, you know"
"they're, um, things even just starting around the home.  You know"
Right.
little ones can do a little bit to help the family.
"and on the water pump, it was all metric."
"And, and on, you know, the factory fittings, you know, the factory, uh  screw lock uh, uh, radiator hose clamps."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Essentially they do that though
"because if, if you look at General Motors, the size"
"and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler."
"If they all went, if they all went metric,"
"but in a sense, um, you know, it's like when a measurement though, when, when you put, uh, you know, one point four three two inches, when you're milling something, uh  you simply set your, uh, equipment,"
Yeah.
"or, or you or you got your calipers there"
"and, and you measure, you know,"
you mic it to see if it's accurate
and.
Right.
It's it's not a problem either way.
No.
"Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car."
Yeah.
And you go to look at it
"and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric."
Yeah.
"and, and, you're never quite sure,"
"well, is that a metric bolt."
"You get you a pair of metric pliers, right"
"Right,"
right.
And you beat on it
and a metric hammer
"It, it can be annoying"
"and my other concern is, is the American government going to force us to go."
"Begun in 1964 when Van Gasteren was 42 years old, ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"" finally premiered at EYE Film Institute Netherlands on the occasion of Van Gasteren's 90th birthday, 20 November 2012. Louis van Gasteren was present at the opening and afterwards was interviewed by journalist Raymond van den Boogaard. On November 30 there was a public interview with the author by television critic Hans Beerekamp from NRC Handelsblad."
"Vimeo.com called the film ""a journey in spiritual and geographical terms"" and Realtofilm.nl wrote, ""The film not only gives a peak into a fascinating era, it is a highly original autobiographical portrait."" Some reviews were negative. Yara Plasman of Filmtotaal.nl described the film as ""a veritable hotch-potch/jumble of various images, sometimes spontaneous while at other times obviously enacted, with or without a clear storyline . . ."""
"Principal photography for ""Nema"" began in 1964 in the Netherlands and lasted five years as Louis raised money as he went. Filming eventually covered ten countries. Jan de Bont was the cinematographer on the principal scenes of the film, including scenes in New York, Vancouver, San Francisco, Timothy Leary in Millbrook, and Meher Baba in India. Additional cameramen during the very long shooting period included Milek Knebel, Theo Hogers, Roeland Kerbosch, Olof Smit, Bert Spijkerman, Louis van Gasteren, and Kester Dixon (for final filming in 2012)."
"Van Gasteren worked hard to get an interview with Meher Baba for ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"". In 1967 Meher Baba was near the end of his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting. Van Gasteren told Baba, ""The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension."" The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in Bombay on September 17, and at Meherazad at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman Jan de Bont and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film. About half of this footage was released in the 1997 documentary, ""Beyond Words""."
"Filming stalled in 1969. After two attempts to complete the film in the 70s and 80s, a final attempt to edit the film was begun in 2009 by filmmaker and editor Ilja Lammers who began to gather and assemble the material. The 35mm film was digitized by EYE Film Institute Netherlands in 2010. Completion financing was received from Netherlands Film Fund and EYE Film Institute and the film was finished in 2012, 48 years after principal photography began. The film premiered at EYE on Van Gasteren's 90th birthday. Gasteren was present at the opening."
"The film is in Dutch and English, with small amounts of French, Italian, Serbian, and Spanish. Available with Dutch or English subtitles."
= = = Hello (Kelly Clarkson song) = = =
"""Hello"" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson, from her fifth studio album, ""Stronger"" (2011). Written by Clarkson, Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with production by Abraham and Oligee, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song about searching for companionship in hopes of not being lonely, in which the singer asks, ""Hello? Is anybody listening?"""
"Upon its release, ""Hello"" was received with positive reception from music critics, who regarded it as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"". Boosted by digital sales during the album's release, the song entered the South Korean Singles Chart at number 47. Clarkson has also performed it a limited live performance during her Stronger Tour in 2012."
"""Hello"" was written by Kelly Clarkson Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with Abraham and Goldstein (as Ollgee) handling the song's production. During the summer of 2011, Clarkson and McKee had collaborated on tracks such as ""Hello"" and ""Alone"", intending it to be recorded for Clarkson's fifth studio album, ""Stronger"", which was released on October of that same year. An acoustic version of the ""Hello"" was included as the opening track of her first extended play, ""The Smoakstack Sessions"" (2011)."
"Written in the key of E minor, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song with guitar chords and its hand claps. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing, Clarkson's voice range featured in the song spans from A to E. Jarett Wieselman of ""omg! Insider"" noted that its chord progression is similar to Katy Perry's single ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" (2011), a track also written by McKee."
"""Hello"" has received positive reviews from music critics. Jason Lipshutz of ""Billboard"" described it as ""a slightly more rugged track that finds its groove in the chorus. The handclaps on the bridge are a nice touch"" and added that the song ""is gonna be a killer in concert."" ""Seattle Post-Intelligencer""s Jason Scott described ""Hello"" as a ""Fun"" and ""cool"" track. He compared it to tracks recorded on ""All I Ever Wanted"" (2009) and noted that the track relies ""solely on the ""O"" vowel to tell a story. ""Ignorance isn't wise, but it beats being alone,"" Clarkson sings before asking if anybody is listening. We hear you loud and clear!"" Brian Mansfield of ""USA Today"" considered ""Hello"" as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"", he wrote in his review: ""this rock tune sounds happier than its lyrics, which depict Kelly as feeling alone even when she's not by herself."" Sam Lansky of PopCrush compared it to ""Mr. Know It All"", and described it as a '90s throwback. He wrote, definitely works, especially with the hooky chorus and heartbroken ferocity of the bridge: ""Holding onto the memories of when I, I didn't know / Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone."" Ryan Pearson of ""The Huffington Post"" noted that ""there is an undertone of loneliness and sadness coursing throughout, including some downbeat lyrics co-written by Clarkson herself. ""Hello, is anybody listening? Won't somebody show me that I'm not alone,"" she sings on ""Hello""."""

= = = Yerrapalli Formation = = =
"The Yerrapalli Formation is a Triassic rock formation consisting primarily of mudstones that outcrops in the Pranhita–Godavari Basin in southeastern India. The Yerrapalli Formation preserves fossils of freshwater and terrestrial vertebrates as well as trace fossils of invertebrates. The tetrapod fauna includes temnospondyl amphibians, archosauromorph reptiles, and dicynodonts."
Most of the Yerrapalli Formation consists of red mudstones. The mudstones were deposited across a floodplain during the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. Smaller lenses of calcareous sandstone represent ephemeral streams that branched off from the larger channels that were the source of the floodplain sediments. The climate of the region during the time is thought to have been monsoonal with both wet and dry seasons.
"The Yerrapalli Formation overlies the Kamthi Formation, underlies the Bhimaram Formation, and is conformable with both formations. Two members of the Yerrapalli Formation have been recognized; a lower member consisting of layers of red and purple clay with lenses of pale green clay and an upper member consisting of alternating layers of clay and fine-grained sandstone."
"The paleobiota of the Yerrapalli Formation is similar to that of the overlying Maleri Formation, which also preserves fossils of temnospondyls and archosauromorphs. The main difference between the Yerrapalli and the Maleri faunae is the presence of dicynodonts in the former. The discovery of dicynodont fossils in the Pranhita-Godavari Basin in 1964 was one of the earliest indications that the Yerrapalli Formation represented a distinct paleofauna. Before this discovery, Yerrapalli strata were grouped within the Maleri Formation. The dicynodonts of the Yerrapalli Formation are similar to those of the Ntavere Formation in Zambia, which also dates back to the Anisian. During the Middle Triassic, what is now India and southern Africa formed one continuous landmass as part of the supercontinent Gondwana."

Among the many luminaries Hirschhorn interviewed and profiled for the Sunday Express were Tennessee Williams, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West (who was also the subject of a biography by Hirschhorn), Noël Coward, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Judy Garland (in her very last interview), Rita Hayworth, Bing Crosby, Billy Wilder, George Burns, James Stewart, Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Rosalind Russell, Betty Grable, David Niven, Rex Harrison, Yul Brynner, Sammy Davis, Jr., Julie Andrews, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Mickey Rooney, and Ginger Rogers."
"In 1996, Hirschhorn became editor of the theater magazine ""Applause"" and since 1998 has been the theater critic of the magazine ""This Is London""."
"Beyond the many features, reviews and interviews written for the Sunday Express, Hirschhorn is the author of several well-received books about the film industry and its stars:"
"""Library Journal"" called his authorized biography of Gene Kelly ""well-researched"" and praised its ""warmth and immediacy"". Writing in the ""Chicago Tribune Book World"", Richard Christiansen named ""The Warner Bros. Story"" a ""bounteous treasure trove of information and entertainment"" while remarked that Hirschhorn's entries for the films were ""frequently witty and even critical…they are reviews as much as they are narratives"". ""Newsweek"" admired ""The Hollywood Musical"" because Hirschhorn ""aims at a kind of completeness entirely in keeping with the grandiosity of his subject"", a sentiment echoed by Seymour Peck in ""The New York Times Book Review"", who noted that Hirschhorn ""sets himself the goal of absolute completeness…and seems to have achieved it."""
"Spilsbury, descended from Mormon settlers in Mexico, spent much of his childhood in Arizona, where his father was a football coach, first in the high school ranks and then at Arizona State Teachers College (now Northern Arizona University). After his father left Northern Arizona, the family returned to Mexico, settling in Colonia Juárez. The younger Spilsbury briefly attended Brigham Young University before moving to Hollywood to attempt to break into acting."
"Using the name Max Keller in 1979, he moved to New York City, where he did a few minor bit parts on a few daytime soaps."
"Klinton Spilsbury's dialogue in ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" was dubbed by actor James Keach. Considerable controversy surrounded Spilsbury at the time of the film's release, in part because of the studio's treatment of Clayton Moore, star of the popular 1950s TV series, who was prevented through legal action from wearing his black mask during personal appearances. Controversy also was due to Spilsbury's on-set antics, which included fighting with crew members and being uncooperative and combative during the production. It was the only film Spilsbury made. For his performance in this film, Spilsbury received the 1981 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor."
"Andy Warhol interviewed Spilsbury during his promotion tour, later describing the interview as ""nutty,"" because Spilsbury was ""blowing his whole image"" during their conversation. Spilsbury told Warhol that, before making the movie, he had been an art student married to a rich woman and that they had a baby together. He went on to state that they did not spend much time together because he needed too much time with his own thoughts, a detail that Warhol found amusing. Spilsbury told Warhol that he was a friend of actor Dennis Christopher and had fallen in love with him, and that he also had later fallen in love with actor Bud Cort. Warhol described Spilsbury as ""very drunk"" during the latter part of the interview, and the latter also mentioned that ""he'd been picked up by Halston and woke up in bed with Halston."""
"An article about him in ""The Los Angeles Times"" in 1989 revealed that he had spent some time in Europe and was working as a model. He had hopes to revive his career as an actor, but admitted in the article that he was not having much luck. He has intermittently coached acting workshops at the Herpolscheimer Academy in Vancouver."
"In 2013, when a reboot film, ""The Lone Ranger"" starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer was released, Spilsbury was sought out by media sources but declined to comment. According to ""Variety"", Spilsbury was working as a photographer in Los Angeles at the time."

"""Let's Go to Bed"" is a song by English rock band the Cure, released as a stand-alone single by Fiction Records in November 1982. In the aftermath of the dark ""Pornography"", Robert Smith returned from a month-long detox in the Lake District to write the song, the antithesis to what the Cure currently represented. It was later included on the album ""Japanese Whispers""."
"The single was a minor success in the UK (peaking at No. 44) but was a top 20 hit in both Australia and New Zealand in 1983, reaching respectively No. 15 and No. 17."
"The origins of ""Let's Go to Bed"" lie in ""Temptation"", one of the demos for ""Pornography"". The song is a relatively upbeat, guitar-driven instrumental. In August 1982, soon after Simon Gallup's departure from the band, Smith demoed a vocal version of the track, entitled ""Temptation Two"", a psychedelic piece not far removed from the ""Pornography"" album but somewhat lighter in tone. At the end of the song, Smith sings a string of wordless syllables, nearly identical to the ""doo doo doo""s of the later song. The song version was debuted on Kid Jensen's radio show on 27 November 1982, as a take which was very close to the final version that appeared as a single in the same month."
"In an interview with Rolling Stone, Robert Smith discussed the initial reaction when playing the song to Fiction Records: However, the song became a success much to Smith’s surprise. Later on in the same interview he said"
"On 15 March 1983, the song was the first broadcast for the pioneering Boston-based alternative rock radio station WFNX. When WFNX was sold and ceased broadcasting on 20 July 2012, ""Let's Go to Bed"" was selected as the station's final broadcast."
"AllMusic described the song as ""antic, herky-jerky new wave pop"", while ""Pitchfork"" called it ""bratty, funky synthpop""."
"The song's music video was the band's first collaboration with Tim Pope, who would go on to direct several more videos for the group. The video features members Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst, who at that point were the only members of the Cure – the only instance in the band's history where the band officially had a two-person lineup. Pope’s video treatment displayed the band’s more whimsical side, something absent from the band’s early work. In his book, Tolhurst also recalls that he was dancing naked behind the screen as a shadowy silhouette."

"During the First World War he was commanding officer of 222nd Field Company, Royal Engineers, part of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. He was invalided home to the United Kingdom in 1915."
"He was elected at the 1918 general election as Coalition Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Tottenham North. Unusually for a Conservative, he was sponsored by a trade union, the National Association of Local Government Officers, of which he held membership."
Prescott stood down at the 1922 election. He was awarded a CBE in 1920 for his role is raising troops in Tottenham and was knighted in 1921. He was also awarded the King Albert Medal by Albert I of Belgium.
"A longtime member of Middlesex County Council where he served as an alderman and vice-chairman, he represented the authority on the Metropolitan Water Board (MWB). He was chairman of the MWB from 1928 to 1940, and two massive steam-driven pumping engines at Kempton Park Pumping Station were named ""William"" and ""Bessie"" after Prescott and his wife.

"Potter Puppet Pals is a puppet show web series parodying the ""Harry Potter"" novel series by JK Rowling, created by Neil Cicierega."
"The first two episodes were animated, both released in 2003 on Newgrounds. On September 26, 2006, the series was re-launched on YouTube under Cicierega's page as ""Potions Class"". Six more episodes were released by Cicierega between 2006 and 2009. Approximately one year after the seventh episode was released, a new video appeared on Neil's channel announcing an exclusive ""Potter Puppet Pals"" channel. On the same day, three more videos were released on this page. The ""Potter Puppet Pals"" make appearances at some Harry Potter parties, such as Yule Balls 2007 and 2010."
"Both the original animated episodes, as well as the first seven live-action episodes, have been published to the official ""Potter Puppet Pals"" webpage."
"Much of the humor derived from the series originates from Cicierega's unique interpretation of the principal Harry Potter characters. Some characters are given personalities designed to contrast completely with their attitudes in the Harry Potter books. Cicierega's Harry is portrayed as an extremely brash, arrogant, and vain teenager who is ""rife with boyish attitude,"" while Dumbledore is a nudist. Other times, an aspect of the original stories is blown out of proportion for comedic effect, such as Hermione Granger's love of reading and matter-of-fact approach to problems. In the episode ""Snape's Diary"", Hermione remarks, ""I know a thing or two about books, and that's a book!"" Later in the same episode, she excitedly shouts, ""Here's one of the quills I carry with me at all times!"""

"In the video, Severus Snape hears a strange ticking and, noticing it has a catchy rhythm, begins singing to it, followed by Dumbledore, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter. Towards the end, Ron discovers that the source of the ticking is a pipe bomb that explodes as they celebrate, letting Lord Voldemort sing his name by himself to the tune of ""Lollipop"" by The Mudlarks.

The aversive or evitative case (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case found in Australian Aboriginal languages that indicates that the marked noun is avoided or feared.
"For example, in Walmajarri:"
"The suffix ""-karrarla"" indicates that the action (running away) was carried out in order to avoid the dust storm, ""tjurtu-""."
"The aversive may also be used to mark the object of verbs of fearing. For example, in Djabugay:"
"The aversive may be used on a nominalized verb, to produce an equivalent of English ""lest"". For example, ""lest they be forgotten"" could be encoded as ""to avoid forgetting them""."
"Few languages have a distinct aversive case. Usually, a single case will be used both for the aversive and other functions."

= = = William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center = = =
"The William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center is the long-distance ground travel (rail and bus) terminal serving the Syracuse, New York area. It is served by Amtrak, Greyhound Lines, Megabus, and Trailways. Local and regional bus transportation is provided by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (CENTRO). Various taxi firms service the Center, as well. The Regional Transportation Center is located on the north side of Syracuse, adjacent to the Central New York Regional Market and near Destiny USA."
"Syracuse is served by two trains daily on the ""Lake Shore Limited"", four trains daily of the ""Empire Service"", and two trains daily on the ""Maple Leaf""."
"When the financially desperate New York Central Railroad sold off its elevated right-of-way through downtown Syracuse to the State of New York in 1962, all rail service was re-routed onto a former freight bypass to the north of the city center. The elevated line and train station had been in service for less than 30 years, having replaced tracks that ran at-grade through the center of Washington Street."
"From this time until the late 1990s, bus service remained at the former train station downtown, but with the former train route converted into Interstate 690 (a downtown freeway, in vogue among mid-century urban planners), rail passengers were forced to use a ""temporary"" structure near the freight yards in East Syracuse, opened on August 29, 1962. Both options proved decidedly unpopular, with the train station in particular becoming synonymous with Amtrak's many woes."
"Opened in 1998, the Regional Transportation Center replaced both venues, re-integrating bus and rail service for the first time since the early 1960s. There were provisions built for OnTrack, Syracuse's commuter train line built on the former Lackawanna right-of-way through Armory Square, to call at the station. However, a bridge that was intended to connect the two lines was never built after CSX claimed construction could destabilize its freight rail bridge, and the OnTrack program was axed due to low ridership. The station is named for William F. Walsh, a former mayor of Syracuse and representative in the U.S. Congress."
"The station is built at ground level, with bus loading/unloading areas in front of the main entrance, and stairs and an elevator leading up to the tracks, which are on an embankment. A central concourse with shops and a waiting room links the two areas. Trains call at a single high-level island platform serving one (nominally eastbound) track; provisions were made for cross-platform transfers with OnTrack on the other side, but the program was canceled before service ever reached the station."
"Fifteen CENTRO bus routes serve the Walsh Regional Transportation Center from Auburn, Fulton, Liverpool, Oswego, Phoenix, Skaneateles, Syracuse, and nearby areas."
"The most frequently serviced corridor is between the Regional Transportation Center and the Downtown Syracuse CENTRO Transit Hub (at Salina and Adams Streets), via Route Nos. 16, 46, 50, 116, 216, 316, and 550. Transfers to buses serving other routes may be made at Destiny USA or the Downtown Transit Hub. Standard local fares are $2.00 per person; with children aged 6-9, seniors 65+ and persons with disabilities at $1.00 per person. Children under 6 are free. Fares for the longer distance regional bus routes are on a zone basis, up to $4.00 each way per person for the Auburn (Aub36) line, and $5.00 for the Oswego (Osw46) line."

"Courthouses in New South Wales were designed by the Colonial Architect, later known as the Government Architect of New South Wales, Australia."
"The first New South Welsh Charter of Justice of 2 April 1787 created the power to convene a criminal court. This was the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction. The first Charter of Justice also created a Court of Civil Jurisdiction to hear and determine in a summary way all pleas relating to real and personal property, debts, contracts, grant of probates and to administer intestate estates. Magistrates appointed in the early years of the colony were unpaid honorary appointments. The first paid magistrate was D'Arcy Wentworth appointed in 1810."
"Local Courts were known as Courts of Petty Sessions. Such courts had originated in England in the fourteenth century. Although during the early years of the colony references are made to Courts of Petty Session sittings by Magistrates, it was not until 1832 that Courts of Petty Sessions were formally established in New South Wales."
"As of the first half of 2016, Winchester/Olin did manufactured and release for sale some WSSM ammunition. The product is only manufactured periodically, often on inconsistent intervals."
"The 243 WSSM is an addition to the Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) family of cartridges, which also include the .223 WSSM and the .25 WSSM, and the idea behind the 243 WSSM was to develop a compact, higher velocity version of the well-established and internationally popular .243 Winchester unveiled by Winchester in 1955. The 243 WSSM was first introduced in 2003."
"The 243 WSSM's case is unusually short and fat in profile, contrasting markedly with most other rifle cartridges, and is intended to take advantage of what ballisticians have shown is the more uniform and efficient burning of propellant powder when it is held in a short, fat stack by the cartridge case."
"In their ballistics tables, Winchester list a very high muzzle velocity of with a projectile for this cartridge. Based on Hodgdon reloading data typical velocities should range from approximately with a bullet to approximately with a bullet. The percentage gain in performance over the older .243 Winchester is around 10% or less."
"This cartridge is usually used for small game such as varminting, and used for animals as large as deer."
Compared to other factory 6mm sporting cartridges the 243 WSSM is capable of functioning in the AR-15. Other factory produced 6mm cartridges like the 243 Win. and 6mm Rem. are both too long for the AR-15 and require the AR-10 platform.
"The 243 WSSM is 3/8 inch shorter than the 243 Win. giving the 243 WSSM the ability to fit in a super-short action rifle. Thus 243 WSSM rifles can be lighter, have stiffer actions and have faster actions to cycle."
The 243 WSSM gives generally a 10% increase in velocity over the 243 Win.

"Bishop Chatard High School is a Catholic co-educational preparatory high school located in the Broad Ripple district of Indianapolis, Indiana in the United States. It is named after Bishop Silas Chatard, who was the first Bishop of Indianapolis, and oversaw the movement of the diocese from Vincennes to Indianapolis in 1898."
"The increase in Indiana's Catholic population that triggered the splitting of the Indianapolis diocese in 1944 also caused an increase in the need for Catholic schools. It was clear that one high school would not be sufficient to provide for Indianapolis' massively expanding Catholic population. To this end, the Archbishop of Indianapolis, Paul Clarence Schulte, ordered the construction of three new Catholic high schools in the city. The first of these, Bishop Chatard, would serve the north side of Indianapolis. The two other new schools, Roncalli High School and Cardinal Ritter High School, would serve the south and west sides of Indianapolis respectively. Scecina would continue to serve the east side of the city."
"Ground was broken for the first of the schools, Bishop Chatard, in the fall of 1960 on diocese property at the corner of Crittenden and Kessler Avenues. Construction of the school and an adjacent convent was completed in less than a year, and the first students were admitted in September 1961. Each year a class of students was added to the school, and the first graduating class was the class of 1964-65. Over the years, many improvements were made to the school facility as the number of students rose."
"Initially, classes were taught almost entirely by priests from the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and Benedictine Sisters of Beech Grove. Many sisters were housed in the convent on-site, but their numbers declined to the point that in the 1970s, their convent was converted to an annex of the school. The annex has served as classroom, office and storage space for thirty years, and was recently rededicated to the Sisters as the St. Benedict Center."
"By 1997, the school was showing its age. Paint was peeling, windows and roofs were leaky, and facilities sorely needed an upgrade. To remedy the situation and remodel the 35-year-old building, school administrators embarked on a $2 million capital campaign to pay for new windows, a new roof, electrical improvements, and other needed renovations. These were undertaken over the summer, and when students arrived to begin the 1997-1998 school year, they were in what was virtually a whole new building."
"In 1999, improvements continued with the opening of the new fine arts addition. A new band room, art studio, and library were added, as were six new classrooms and an elevator to make the building handicap-accessible. This was paid for by a $1.5 million building drive made possible by alumni donations."
"In the summer of 2005, and completed over the 2007-08 school year, a campaign involved the construction of an additional elevator to allow better access to classrooms for handicapped students and a remodeling of the cafeteria and several hallways. A new auxiliary gymnasium was paid for by alumni donations and a slight tuition increase. In 2011, President Bill Sahm announced the “Golden Opportunities Campaign,” to address several issues including the creation of a tuition assistance endowment and a teacher compensation endowment. The Campaign also addressed improvements to the academic environment including the addition of robust wireless network throughout the two buildings, new servers and expanded student and teacher access to 21st century computers in the classrooms and labs.

"Ridley Creek State Park is a Pennsylvania state park in Edgmont, Middletown and Upper Providence Townships, Delaware County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park, about north of the county seat of Media, offers many recreational activities, such as hiking, biking, fishing, and picnicking. Ridley Creek passes through the park. Highlights include a paved multi-use trail, a formal garden designed by the Olmsted Brothers, and Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, which recreates daily life on a pre-Revolutionary farm. The park is adjacent to the John J. Tyler Arboretum. Ridley Creek State Park is just over from downtown, Philadelphia between Pennsylvania Route 352 and Pennsylvania Route 252 on Gradyville Road."
"The bulk of the property was acquired in the late 1960s from the estate of well known horse breeder Walter M. Jeffords, Sr. and his wife Sarah, a niece of Samuel D. Riddle. The Jeffords had acquired the land starting about 1912 in small parcels, until they had over , which was the largest private undeveloped property in the Philadelphia area by the 1960s. By 1918 they had built a large mansion, now the park office, around a stone colonial farmhouse. Twenty-four other historic properties were located on the grounds, many farmsteads that had retained family ownership since the seventeenth century. In 1976 these properties were registered on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district."
"The area was originally settled by English Quakers and remained agrarian into the twentieth century. The oldest property is the 1683 Worrel House. In 1718 a water mill, then known as Providence Mill, began to grind corn. In the late 18th century a plaster mill was established next to the grist mill. A rolling and slitting mill replaced the plaster mill by 1812, and became known as Bishop's Mills. Workers cottages, a dam, and several outbuildings complete the mill complex, now known as Sycamore Mills. The mills operated until 1901, when they were damaged by fire."
The Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation is a living museum on the farm where the Pratt family lived from 1720 to 1820. Admission is charged and it is open to the general public on weekends from April through November.
"The location of Ridley Creek State Park, just from downtown Philadelphia, has led to its popularity. Ridley Creek is very popular with fishermen. It is stocked with trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. A portion of the creek is a designated catch and release area for fly fishing only. There is a wheelchair accessible fishing platform on a multi-use trail. The of hiking trails at Ridley Creek State Park are popular with dog owners. These trails pass through a variety of habitats. A multi use trail is open to jogging, bicycling and walking. The park also features a equestrian trail."

= = = Life Got Cold = = =
"""Life Got Cold"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. Noel Gallagher of Oasis received a writing credit due to similarities with Oasis' ""Wonderwall""."
"Released as their third single in August 2003, ""Life Got Cold"" became Girls Aloud's third consecutive top three hit on the UK Singles Chart. The song peaked at number two in Ireland and Scotland, and peaked at number 14 in Belgium."
"Set in an abandoned city, the music video suggests coldness and darkness with its blue hue. It portrays Girls Aloud moving in stunted movement. ""Life Got Cold"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on three of Girls Aloud's concert tours. Described as a ""surprisingly poignant"", the melancholic ballad received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics; however, it was criticised for its similarities with Oasis."
"""Life Got Cold"" is a ballad written in D minor. The chord progressions vary throughout the song but the different chords include B, C, Dm, Gm, and Am. Following typical verse-chorus form, the song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. The verses are ""talk-sung"", while the bridge and chorus are song over guitar strumming. The middle 8 is a slower version of the bridge. The song tells the tale of young love that ended ""when summer slipped away."" ""Life Got Cold"" was a late addition to ""Sound of the Underground"", completed by Xenomania shortly before the album's release. Producer Brian Higgins did not take the idea of a Girls Aloud version of the song seriously until he heard the group sing it, because a track working ""has always got to be based on an artist's performance, not the music itself. But they sang it, and they really nailed the melancholic aspect of it, and it sounded beautiful."" The lyrics focus on ""the directionlessness of modern life."""
"The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of ""Life Got Cold"" and that of the 1995 Oasis hit ""Wonderwall"". A BBC review stated ""part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into Wonderwall by Oasis."" A source told ""The Sun"" that Girls Aloud ""are all big Oasis fans so I'm sure they won't mind comparisons with their classic love song."" Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. Girls Aloud later made a cameo appearance in Oasis' 2007 rockumentary ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down""."
"""Life Got Cold"" was not originally the choice for Girls Aloud's third single. Polydor Records had originally chosen ""Some Kind of Miracle"" to be released, but the plan was dropped after an overwhelming fan response to ""Life Got Cold"". The single was released on 18 August 2003 in the UK. It was available on two different CD single formats and as a cassette tape. The first CD featured a cover of the Duran Duran song ""Girls on Film"" as the b-side, which would later become the title for a Girls Aloud DVD, as well as a remix of ""No Good Advice"". The disc's enhanced section features the ""Life Got Cold"" music video and a photo gallery. The second disc included both the radio edit and album version of ""Life Got Cold"", as well as the 29 Palms Remix Edit and the Stella Browne Edit. It also came with a free fold-out poster. The cassette also featured an exclusive b-side, an original track entitled ""Lights, Music, Camera, Action"". The photos featured on the single's artwork were reshot at the last minute, following the group's request."
"""Life Got Cold"" received positive reviews from music critics, although it did receive criticism due to the similarities with the song Wonderwall by Oasis. BBC called the song a ""charming ballad"" that was ""a sweet but slightly sad pop song."" RTÉ.ie thought ""Life Got Cold"" was ""surprisingly poignant."""
"However, some noted that the chorus held many similarities to that of the Oasis song ""Wonderwall"". The songwriters dismissed claims of plagiarising Oasis. Allmusic referred to it as ""a solid ballad, suggesting a less intellectual Dido."""
"The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number three, behind Blu Cantrell's ""Breathe"" and Lemar's ""Dance (With U)"". It spent a second week in the top ten, slipping to number eight. The song spent a total of nine weeks in the top 75 overall, a far cry from the fourteen weeks ""No Good Advice"" or the twenty-one weeks that ""Sound of the Underground"" spent in the chart. ""Life Got Cold"" also debuted at number three on the Irish Singles Chart, but managed to rise to number two the following week. It spent two further weeks in the top ten, then two weeks in the top twenty. The single barely missed the top ten of the Netherlands Top 40, instead peaking at number eleven. It has since become the group's 16th best selling single domestically."
"The music video for ""Life Got Cold"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed the videos for ""Sound of the Underground"" and ""No Good Advice"". The band members are seen in stunted movement, wandering around an abandoned city setting. Both group and individual shots are shown in various scenes. Nadine Coyle is seen in front of an abandoned building, while Sarah Harding is next to a car and a phone booth. Nicola Roberts is alone in a kitchen as pouring rain can be seen on the window. Cheryl Cole is shown in an alleyway, while Kimberley Walsh is alone on a street curb. The group are shown together on an abandoned bus, in an alley at night, and sat in front of the abandoned building. The video has a slightly blue hue to it, suggesting coldness and darkness. It also makes use of lens flares."
"The video can be found on two of Girls Aloud's official DVD releases, ""Girls on Film"" (2005) and ""Style"" (2007)."
"""Life Got Cold"" was first performed live by Girls Aloud at two summer festivals in 2003, Pop Beach and Live & Loud. The first televised performance occurred on """" on 19 July 2003. The group performed in black-and-white business casual attire, as seen in the music video and on the single's artwork. They performed on ""CD:UK"" once more the following month, although Cheryl was absent due to illness. Girls Aloud also appeared on ""Diggin' It"", ""Popworld"", ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Top of the Pops Saturday"" (twice)."
"Girls Aloud performed ""Life Got Cold"" on three of their concert tours. For 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say? Live, Girls Aloud were positioned at the top of a staircase as they sang the song in colourful, simple evening gowns. The song was given a reggae reworking for 2007's The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits Tour. The song was also included on the bands reunion tour, Ten - The Hits Tour 2013."
"Mediated communication is not as commonly used as face-to-face communication in the workplace, but there are different preferred media of communication for simple forms of coordination. E-mails and phone calls tend to be used for simple or complex coordination, but e-mails are also useful for retaining information and recording the exchange of information. In terms of communication solutions to certain situational factors, e-mails are used for recording the transfer of information and sending long, complex, and non-textual information, and phone calls and pagers are used for immediate communication. E-mails and phone calls are also used in knowledge sharing and information gathering. E-mails are rarely used to accomplish relationship goals, but they are used for conflict resolution. Individuals have a higher motivation to use cell-phone texting for weak-tie communication. The network effect has the most impact on e-mail, meaning that people tend to use e-mail more if their peers use it, too."
Email
"Electronic mail is digital mechanism for exchanging messages through internet or intranet communication platforms. The first message that was sent through a computer was on October 29, 1969. Raymond Tomlinson is known as the father of email, he was the first person who sent a message electronically. Email messages consist of three different components: message envelope, message header, and message body. There are also multiple benefits to using email. It is easy to use, free of charge, fast, and delivers information in a digital format. Email is one of the earliest and most basic resources on the internet and those many computers may not be able to access other internet services they are still usually able to exchange emails with machines on the internet. There are many reasons why using email is more suitable when it comes to the workforce. the first reason is because it is faster than a conventional mail so that usually reaches its destination and minutes even when it's sent from different countries. Another reason why an email is more conventional is because of the fact that there is less physical efforts .while using email you don't have to worry about buying stamps or envelopes or taking a trip to the post office. Also the use of email helps in the financial state because once you have gotten the hardware and software together it is basically free from there on. Email messaging also helps when having to send the same message to multiple people because of the fact that it allows you to send the same information simultaneously."
Text message
"A text message is defined as a short message sent electronically usually from one cellphone to another. The first text message was sent in December 3, 1992. The engineer that discovered text messaging was named Matti Makkonen. Along with the development of text messaging came a new development of dialogue when texting. As I stated in while texting people tend to exaggerate how they usually talk. An example of this or shown in blank where somebody may state that ""this homework is so hard I'm going to kill myself!!"" This dialogue is normal and texting but not entirely appropriate and other scenarios. Another thing that texting changed was a person's grammar or writing style. In it showed that 75% of friends noted that their best friends grammar or writing styles. Though only 25% of acquaintances noticed that their friends grammar or writing styles had changed. The evolution of texting is evolving and its uses it is not only being used to communicate with friends and family but it is also spreading to the workforce. According to in Zambia they are finding the results of HIV testing faster due to mobile phone texting. The turnaround time for results notifying went from health facilities reporting the results in 44.2 days pre-implementation to 26.7 days post inflammation due to texting. They developed a customized software built to deliver the test results automatically and directly from the processing laboratory to the health facilities of sample origin via short text message service text."

= = = Thomas Devin = = =
"Thomas Casimer Devin (December 10, 1822 – April 4, 1878) was a United States Army officer and general. He commanded Union cavalry during the American Civil War and during the Indian Wars."
"Born in New York City to Irish parents. Devin was a house painter and partner in a paint and varnish company with his brother John for much of his early life, while also serving as a lieutenant colonel in the New York State Militia."
"After the start of the Civil War, Devin formed his militia cavalry company into ""Captain Devin's Independent Company"" and served as its captain. Late that year, he became Colonel of the 6th New York Volunteer Cavalry, nicknamed the ""2nd Ira Harris Guards"", which he would lead for the next year."
"The regiment's first important service was in the Maryland Campaign of 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, one of its squadrons was involved in the first attacks of the day. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Devin inherited command of David McMurtrie Gregg's cavalry brigade, when the latter took charge of the brigade of George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed by Confederate artillery fire. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, his small brigade was the only cavalry not detached for Brig. Gen. George Stoneman's raid and he successfully led three Union Corps on the stealthy flanking march that preceded the battle. The men of the brigade repeatedly distinguished themselves in the heavy fighting of the battle. They suffered almost 200 casualties in the battle, higher losses than Union cavalry units had seen prior to that time. Devin also led his brigade in the Battle of Brandy Station (June 9, 1863), and took command of Brig. Gen. John Buford's division while Buford commanded the entire right wing of the two-pronged attack on Confederate cavalry. While observing the skirmish line early in the fighting, Devin had his horse shot out from under him."
"At the Battle of Gettysburg, Devin's brigade served in Brig. Gen. John Buford's cavalry division that began the battle on July 1, 1863. Devin had become a favorite of Buford's and his rugged leadership style lent him the nickname ""Buford's Hard Hitter,"" while his own men like to refer to him as ""Uncle Tommy."" As the Confederate attacks began, Devin's brigade was screening the northwest and northern road approaches to Gettysburg, and successfully delayed the arrival of Jubal A. Early's division. Friendly fire from Union artillery on Cemetery Hill caused most of his brigade to withdraw into the town of Gettysburg and they later skirmished with the Confederates as they entered the town. The two brigades of Buford's cavalry division present on the field on July 1 and 2 were withdrawn from the battlefield by Cavalry Corps commander Alfred Pleasonton on the afternoon of July 2."
"After Gettysburg, Devin continued to command a brigade and sometimes a division in the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1864, he participated in the raid on Richmond by Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry. In August he accompanied the Cavalry Corps to the Shenandoah Valley, where they fought under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Devin was wounded once during the war, a wound in the foot on August 16, 1864, at the fighting at Guard Hill, Virginia or Crooked Run, Virginia. When Wesley Merritt became the Cavalry Corps commander, Devin inherited command of his division. On November 19, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Devin brigadier general of volunteers for his part in the Battle of Cedar Creek, to rank from October 19, 1864. The President submitted the nomination on December 12, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed it on February 14, 1865."
"Devin was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866. President Johnson also appointed Devin brevet colonel in the regular army for Fisher's Hill, to rank from March 2, 1867. On March 26, 1867, President Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army for Sayler's Creek, to rank from March 2, 1867, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on April 5, 1867."
"Devin obtained a commission in the Regular Army after the Civil War under the provisions of the Army Act of 1866. This Act required that the officer ranks of the new infantry and cavalry regiments be filled by a certain percentage of officers from the Volunteer regiments raised during the Civil War. Ending the war as a Brigadier General and Brevet Major General, Devin became a Lieutenant Colonel and was assigned to the 8th U.S. Cavalry. Initially serving with part of the regiment in New Mexico, Devin assumed command of the Subdistrict of Prescott in Arizona in late 1867. He died of stomach cancer and exposure, on sick leave from active duty, as Colonel of the 3rd U.S. Cavalry. Devin was initially interred in Calvary Cemetery on Long Island, but upon his wife's death in 1897, both were interred in West Point Cemetery, West Point, New York, very near his old friend and commander John Buford."
"On June 30, 1878, the United States Army established a temporary camp in southeastern Montana Territory during the building of the Fort Keogh-Deadwood Telegraph Line. The post was named ""Camp Devin."" It served as a base for part of the 9th U.S. Infantry until being abandoned later that year."

In 2004 the company began development of packaged software products, including security for emerging devices and complete access point packages. The software was used in devices ranging from LCD projectors, televisions and digital video recorders to PDAs and SOHO access points. The company also provided software for the Wi-Fi Alliance test bed."
"Dave Fraser joined as CEO in 2004, and in 2005 the company was renamed Devicescape Software. The company continued to develop additional client security products. In 2006, Devicescape exited the access point business by licensing its ""Wireless Infrastructure Platform"" technology to LVL7, which was subsequently sold to Broadcom."
"In 2007, Devicescape introduced Connect, a client-server system which allowed embedded devices to automatically authenticate against a large number of public Wi-Fi networks. The company released a variety of consumer applications for PCs and smartphones under the Devicescape Easy Wi-Fi brand. In 2009, Devicescape launched the Easy WiFi Network."
"In 2010, Devicescape applied server-based analysis to curate Wi-Fi networks discovered by client applications, so that Wi-Fi networks could be assessed for quality, location, sharing status and other factors. The company referred to this as a ""Curated Virtual Network"" (CVN) and became a mechanism for offloading traffic from cellular networks. Late in 2010, MetroPCS (now T-Mobile) became the first major publicly-announced customer to use the Devicescape CVN."
"From 2011 through 2014, Devicescape announced several additional US mobile operator customers, including US Cellular and Cricket Wireless, as well as some Wi-Fi centric operators such as Republic Wireless. In 2012, Devicescape expanded the CVN into Europe and subsequently announced an agreement with Virgin Media (UK) in 2014."
"In addition, common Fulani were inspired by Adama's exploits and formed into bands. Adama created a new position for their leaders: The ""lamido"" (plural: ""lamibe""), who was the leader of a particular territory, as opposed to an ardo, leader of a particular people. Both groups received flags of command and shared the same status in Adama's armies. Before his death, Adama would appoint over 40 non-ardo lamibe. They would prove his most loyal lieutenants."
"Adama turned his attentions on the only major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an attractive target. It lay between Bornu to the north and Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high."
"Adama reached Guringa in 1809 with a large army in good morale. He quickly conquered the Mandara settlement at Guider and headed north, taking several more villages along the way. Outside of the Mandara capital, Dulo, Adama demanded that the king, Bukar Djiama, swear his allegiance and convert to Islam untainted with paganism. Bukar agreed to acknowledged Adama's right to rule his own subjects, but he refused to yield his own sovereignty. Adama and his men took Dulo with little fighting."
"Adama searched for someone to rule the settlement, but he found no one whom he felt adequate for the post. Meanwhile, his troops revelled in their plunder. No one expected the Mandara counterattack, which was launched from nearby Mora. Adama fled the town, and Dulo fell from his grasp forever."
"Adama and his men retreated to Yola (in present-day Nigeria). The town would become his capital by 1841. From here, he and his lieutenants continued to expand the emirate, which he named Adamawa after himself. The subordinates had to send him tribute in the form of cattle. Large settlements such as Maroua, Garoua, and Ngaoundéré fell to Adama or his lieutenants. By 1825, the Fulani had penetrated the Adamawa Plateau. Nevertheless, Adama lived in relatively moderate surroundings and never acquired great wealth."
"From Yola, Adama began the administrative tasks necessary for his nascent state. He did this with Usman's advice; he was to foster understanding between his people and their governors, facilitate communication between elders and their subordinates, and prevent the stratification of society based on class or wealth. The empire eventually took on three administrative tiers. At the centre was the ""emir al-Mu'minin"" (""commander of the faithful""), Adama himself, ruling from Yola and answering only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. A contingent of councillors and administrators directly aided him, and a household staff of non-Fulbe and slaves doubled as his bodyguard. Below him were a number of district leaders, the lamibe, who ruled key settlements. Under them were a number of villages, each headed by a village chief."
"Meanwhile, some of the older ardo'en grew powerful through their own conquests. They regarded the unconquered areas near their territories as their own private backyards and defended these zones from all comers. This sometimes surfaced in their relations with Adama, such as when Bouba Njida of Rai refused to come to Adama's aid when the emir was fighting the Namchi at Poli. Instead, Bouba waited for Adama to retreat from the area to bring in his own forces and finish the enemy off. He then sent prisoners from the battle to Adama as a gift."
"Adama died in 1847 and was laid to rest at Yola (his tomb survives to this day). Adamawa covered 103,000 km² from Lake Chad to Banyo and was inhabited by 1,500,000 people. Further expansion to the south had proved difficult and undesirable since the presence of the tsetse fly and thick jungle made cattle rearing difficult there."
"Adama's son Muhammadu Lawal succeeded him after a brief regency under Hamidu bi Adama. Eventually, three of Adama's other sons would at some point serve as Emir of Adamawa. Not until the British and German colonial periods would the emirate come to an end."
"Despite their loss of independence, the Fulani were now the preeminent ethnic group of Northern Cameroon. They spread Islam throughout the region, establishing it as the dominant religion. Education also flourished, as new converts learned Arabic writing and studied the Qur'an. Trade flourished, and communications with it. The conquests were also important ecologically. Lands that had once been used for cultivation now became part of Fulani pastureland. Herdsmen cut down trees to make way for cattle, and they burned grasses that their herds later trampled. Centuries of such behaviour have replaced the region's forest with savanna."
"Ironically, the Adamawa was more sparsely populated after Adama's conquest. Rather than fight the Fulani invaders, many peoples fled, displacing others in turn. The Adamawa Plateau, once home to many of Cameroon's ethnic groups, soon became a pastureland, and the forest zone of Cameroon became more heavily populated."

"Plum Grove Junior High School was built in 1961 for the cost of $1.1 million; the school was opened in September 1962. It started as a 28,000 square foot, one-story, K-8 school with a partial basement. The school was designed for 380 students at the time. Gene Shull was chosen to be the first principal of the school, a position he held until 1969. It was heated by a main boiler and was ventilated by opening windows and doors. Fresh air was reduced for students and staff when fire codes demanded that doors be kept closed. In 1966, a $1.9 million referendum allowed the building to double in size and add newer classrooms that were equipped with small unit ventilators. The school reopened in the fall of 1968. In 1970, it was made exclusively a junior high school."
"In 1988, the junior high's heating and ventilation systems were upgraded. In 1993, a 6.5 million dollar renovation project at Plum Grove added a second floor, cafeteria, resource center, elevator, office, and student service area. This renovation doubled the school's size, making it 98,000 square feet."
"In June 1993, asbestos contractors started to remove the asbestos insulation and tiling. About 90 students had classes in these rooms; 10 students and teachers complained of odors in them. The district consulted TurnKey Environmental Consultants of Mount Prospect, Illinois, to sample the air for contaminants. In 1993, TurnKey submitted a report stating that the levels of alkanes were 133 times lower than the permissible exposure limit set by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The floors were sealed again but odor complaints still resumed. Students and teachers were moved out of these rooms and the floors were shot blasted and sealed with latex-epoxy paint."
"In 1994, The Chicago Tribune found that five employees had died from various forms of cancer, primarily breast cancer, between 1982 and 1994, and four current staff members had been diagnosed with cancer, three of which had been working in the building for ten years. In addition to that, teachers, staff, and students complained of bronchitis, colds, flus, asthma, and allergies. Incidents of asthma were so severe for students that some decided to transfer to different schools. The teachers wrote to the school board asking for an investigation. The administration immediately agreed to investigate the concerns. At this time, media coverage was heavy, placing pressure on the school district to take immediate action."
"A team, including Northwest Community Hospital and TurnKey Environmental Consultants were chosen to investigate the concerns. While the investigation by Northwest Community Hospital and Turnkey Environmental was going on (expected to end in late June), the Classroom Teachers Council (CTC), said it would push to conduct its own tests if the district's team found no problems. This statement was largely due to the revelation that yet another Plum Grove teacher had been diagnosed with cancer."
"In late June, the district announced that the results of the much anticipated investigation would be delayed three weeks. The teachers sent a formal request to the district to get the raw data from the environmental samples to conduct their own investigation. Although ties were found between ingesting certain types of common mold aspergillus and cancer, Dr. Peter Orris, a medical director the district hired for the investigation, denied that mold at the school had any link to cancer in a letter sent to teachers. However, teachers and parents were still concerned that Orris was basing his conclusions in part on a British Medical Journal published in 1976. In late August 1994, it was found by the investigation that there were no cancer-causing agents in Plum Grove, but the air quality of the building was very poor."
"On August 6, 1994, an unknown vandal pried open the school's doors and scattered chemicals and specimens in the science lab."
"In 1997, Plum Grove was recognized by the United States Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School. The school was also recognized by the Illinois Honor Roll with its Academic Excellence Award from 2007-2012."
"Each year, Plum Grove participates in a fundraiser for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) called ""Pennies for Patients"". During the fundraiser, organized by Maura Reid, students are encouraged to bring in donations in the form of pennies and other coins; the class with the donation that weighs the most is awarded a prize. Several activities are also held during the fundraiser to support the LLS. The school has participated in the fundraiser since 2002 and has been featured on CBS and in the ""Daily Herald"" for these actions. As of 2015, Plum Grove has raised over $143,000 for the charity."
"Plum Grove is featured in the book ""Code of Silence: Living a Lie Comes With a Price"" by Plum Grove alumnus Tim Shoemaker as the school at which the main characters attend. As a result of the popularity of the book and Shoemaker's success, he visited Plum Grove during the 2014-2015 school year to talk to the students about writing as a career."

Abhay Deol took to social media and blamed T-Series for delaying the music launch of his film as well as not promoting the movie due to him and the composers not agreeing to sign the documents. This allegation was denied by T-Series who claimed that they had uploaded 3 songs from the movie on its YouTube page and claimed ""In the absence thereof [of appropriate agreements], we cannot be expected to release music when there is no clarity with respect to the rights granted to the producer"" In another statement, T-Series expressed the fact that they had been assured by the company Viacom 18 that they owned all the rights (including the music rights) and that they did not understand why they were being dragged into this dispute which should be between Mr. Deol and Viacom 18. T-Series eventually relinquished their hold on the music rights after a campaign was run by the composers and artists against the music company.

"George Emil Eminsang (ca. 1833 – May 1898) was a prominent Euro-African merchant and political leader on the Gold Coast, who played a prominent role in the last years of Dutch colonial rule on the Gold Coast. After the Dutch Gold Coast was transferred to the United Kingdom, Eminsang became a diplomat for the Netherlands and later for the United States and the Congo Free State. Together with James Bannerman Hyde and James Hutton Brew, Eminsang was one of the first so-called ""country lawyers"" on the Gold Coast."
"Eminsang was an important leader of the No. 10 Akrampafo ""asafo"" ward of Elmina and owner of the most famous hotel of Elmina, St. George's Hotel. Besides his native Twi, he spoke and wrote Dutch, English, Portuguese and German."
"Eminsang was born in Elmina to Joseph Emil Eminsang, a merchant and innkeeper, and an unknown lady from a prominent Dutch/Fanti Euro-African family. He was educated in the Netherlands and Germany, before returning to teach for several years at the Elmina Castle School, where he had completed his primary education."
"In the 1850s, Eminsang established himself as a merchant on the Gold Coast. In 1859, while doing business in Kumasi, Eminsang had a conflict with the Asante chief Kwasi Brantuo, whose porters lost five textiles from a shipment Eminsang had ordered from Anomabu. Asantehene Kwaku Dua I Panyin ruled in favour of Eminsang and ordered that Brantuo pay 15 Engels compensation to Eminsang. Eminsang still refused to pay the wages of the porters, however, leading Brantuo to complain to Asante chief Akyempon Yaw, who regulated Elmina affairs in Kumasi. The conflict became so heated that the Dutch agent in Kumasi, Pieter de Heer, offered to pay Eminsang's debt from his own pocket, but Eminsang flatly refused and swore a Coromantee oath that no payment would take place. After Eminsang started to insult the Asantehene, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Pieter de Heer managed to persuade Asantehene Kwaku Dua to release Eminsang to send him for trial by the Dutch governor in Elmina."
"Eminsang played a prominent role in colonial affairs in the last years of Dutch rule on the Gold Coast. When in 1868 the Fante Confederacy tried to take Elmina in the aftermath of the redistribution of Dutch and British forts on the Gold Coast, Eminsang was sent by the Elmina government to the Netherlands to plead the case for Elmina with Minister of the Colonies Engelbertus de Waal. After meeting with Eminsang, De Waal proceeded in replacing governor George Pieter Willem Boers with the experienced former governor Cornelis Nagtglas, who as a government commissioner was tasked with finding a solution for the conflict with the Fante."

During the 2006 campaign, he called for free community college courses and for university student tuition fees to be cut in half. He denied that this would result in a lower quality of education, pointing to the example of low tuition fees in Quebec."
"Wiechula received 455 votes (0.72%) on election, finishing fifth against Conservative candidate Dean Del Mastro. He later joked that he had fulfilled his goal of receiving more votes than his father, Marek Wiechula, who received 204 votes as a Libertarian Party candidate in the 1975 Ontario provincial election."

"Fucked Up is a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario, formed in 2001. The band consists of Damian Abraham (vocals), Mike Haliechuk (guitar, vocals), Josh Zucker (guitar), Ben Cook (guitar, vocals), Sandy Miranda (bass) and Jonah Falco (drums, vocals)."
"To date the band has released five studio albums, alongside several EPs, singles, and companion releases. The band won the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for their second studio album, ""The Chemistry of Common Life"". In 2018, the band released its fifth studio album, ""Dose Your Dreams"", after a hiatus. Driven by Haliechuk, it is a concept album focusing on the band's recurring character David, and featuring several guest lead vocalists, alongside Abraham, Falco, and Haliechuk."
"The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk, lead guitar), Concentration Camp (Josh Zucker, rhythm guitar, vocals), Mustard Gas (Sandy Miranda, bass guitar) and Chris Colohan (of Left For Dead/The Swarm fame, who was lead vocalist for Cursed). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp concentrated on guitar duties and vocal duties were taken over from Colohan by Pink Eyes (Damian Abraham, also known as Mr. Damian). Drums were played by Mr. Jo (Jonah Falco, also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco)."
"Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7"" records. The band released the """"No Pasaran"""" 7"" in May 2002. The ""Police"" 7"" was released on March 2003, quickly followed the ""Baiting the Public"" 7"" in May 2003. Two more 7""'s followed in 2004, the ""Dance of Death"" single, and the ""Litany"" 4-song ep. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004s ""Epics in Minutes"" CD. The band was the subject of a two-minute 16 mm film showing its links to the Toronto hardcore scene, a local infoshop and punk radio show."
"The band's use of imagery and symbolism (notable the use of Sigils) took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two limited 12""s, the ""Looking for Gold"" 12"", and the live ""Let Likes be Cured by Likes"" 12"". The ""Looking for Gold"" 12"" contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in two limited runs of 300 and 400 copies. The title track was 16 minutes long, used 18 guitar tracks, had a three-minute drum solo and contained 5 minutes of whistling."
"In the summer of 2004 the band released the ""Generation"" 7"" and 12"" eps. After touring for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full-time manager/promoter. In early 2006 Eliade began shopping demos of songs from the planned ""Hidden World"" album to labels, ending with the band signing to Jade Tree Records for an early fall 2006 release of the album. Jade Tree is distributed by Touch & Go which in turn has a distribution agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group). Jade Tree licensed the vinyl version to Deranged Records, which released it as a double album in November 2006."
"Several other records, such as ""Year of the Dog"" 12"" were released, before the band went on the European tour, visiting England, Germany and Spain, among other places. January 16, 2007 marked the band's live television debut on ""MTV Live"", where they were introduced as ""Effed Up"". During their performance of their song ""Baiting the Public"", the majority of the audience were moshing and causing damage to the set (also visible was a cut on Damian's forehead), resulting in a sum of $2,000 in damages. This performance sparked controversy and resulted in MTV Canada banning moshing from future ""MTV Live"" performances."
"On October 9, 2008 the band returned to MTV Live, this time performing in the men's washroom. Once again, the band (and their fans) caused a large amount of damage, destroying the ceiling, spray painting walls and knocking over amps and a motorcycle which was brought into the washroom as a prop. Fans, who were told beforehand to stay out of the washroom and to watch from outside the door, rushed the doors and joined in the destruction the band had already started. The band was supposed to play three songs, but were stopped after the first song as MTV was not aware of the destruction the band had planned and were concerned about the safety of the band, audience and crew."
"On October 10 Abraham blogged about the performance on the MTV Live website, saying the bathroom performance was ""f**king out of control terrifying."""
"In November 2007, the band played a show in New York that was filmed for the movie ""Burn"", directed by Richard Roepnack. The performance was positively reviewed in the ""New York Times"", although the Times chose not to print the band's name, referring to them instead as a string of asterisks."
"The band signed to Matador Records in Spring of 2008. That summer, Matador reissued the ""Year Of The Pig"" 12"" single. This time it came out with additional formats including a series of three 7""es, for the US, UK and Japan respectively, each with a different edit of the A-side and a new B-side. A CDEP compiled all the versions from the various vinyl versions. The band toured extensively in the UK behind this release, following it with a trip up the West Coast."
"On October 7, 2008, Matador released Fucked Up's second album, ""The Chemistry Of Common Life."" It has received near-universal critical acclaim from publications such as the NME, The New York Times, Blender, Pitchfork, Alternative Press, Q Magazine and many more. The band toured the Eastern US in October, including a much-covered 12-hour long show on the Bowery in New York on October 14. They were joined by musical guests including Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend, Moby, John Joseph of the Cro-Mags, members of Endless Boogie, Les Savy Fav, Dinosaur Jr., and others."

"Fucked Up were confirmed to play the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010. The band also confirmed they will play their annual Halloween gig in Toronto, October 31, 2010. The band had initially cancelled the event due to scheduled tour with Against Me!. ""We were going to go on this tour in the UK with this band Against Me!, but then they cancelled all their shows for some reason (they never told us) so the tour isn't happening so we'll be in Toronto so we figure what the hell."" They were joined by The Sadies at The Garrison, Toronto."
"In February 2011, the band toured Australia for the first time as a part of the Soundwave Festival. Additionally, the band played some select side-shows from the festival with artists as diverse as The Bronx, Terror, H20, Trash Talk and Polar Bear Club."
"On June 7, 2011, Fucked Up released their third studio album, ""David Comes to Life"". A self-professed ""rock opera"" set in Thatcherite Britain, it tells a story of love, loss and redemption. The story is complicated by misdirection and unreliable narrators. The record debuted at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 in the US. It has received wide critical acclaim."
"In November 2011 it was announced that the band would be going on hiatus, as Abraham is not able to handle raising a family and tour the same time."
"In December 2011, Spin magazine named ""David Comes to Life"" its No. 1 Album of 2011, and put the band on the cover, writing ""Fucked Up have synthesized 40 years of rock into what's ostensibly a hardcore record, and in doing so created its own logic."""

"Oteyboydak Tleukabyluly (1388–1478), was a Kazakh scientist, healer and author of solid medical-ethnographic works Shipagerlik Bayan. He was familiar with such historical personalities as Zhanibek khan, Zhirenshe sheshen. O. Tleukabyluly was a well-known public figure, involved in dealing with the plight of the people. The dates of his birth are taken from his book Shipagerlik Bayan. He writes that he started writing this book at the age of 70 at the request of Zhanibek khan and finished it at the age of 85; after Zhanibek khan’s death. There is also evidence that Oteyboydak died at the age of 90. He inherited his medical and healer gift from his ancestors. O.Tleukabyluly devoted his life to treatment and brought traditional (folk) medicine in the academic system. Thus, he was able to raise the medicine of his time at a high level. In this respect, he, like al-Farabi, despised thirst for fame, wealth, and devoted his life to the study of the peculiarities of healing. The book Shipagerlik Bayan has survived until today, thanks to his relatives. But only fourth part of the rich heritage, having gone through the test of time, has reached our days. The rest part was burnt by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution in China. This book gives a lot of information on traditional Kazakh medicine. The fact that he used a variety of compounds (mixture), offered over 4000 recipes, convinces us that Oteyboydak was an experienced healer and an outstanding scientist. His book mentions medical properties of 728 kinds of drugs of plant origin, 318 kind of medicine of animal origin, 52 types of medicines derived from metals and metalloids, 8 kinds of rare and precious drugs, as well as references to some 500 anatomical terms. It witnesses that the book has the historical-ethnographic importance as well as the depth and richness of the Kazakh language. The book was published in 1994 in Kazakh Cyrillic script in Urumgi, In 1996 - in the Kazakh Cyrillic script in Almaty, Kazakhstan. In 1997 the book was awarded China’s National Book award. Two public medical centers for studying O.Tleukabyluly’s heritage were created in China. The monument to O.Tleukabyluly has been erected on Shalkode Zhailau in Almaty area and one street was named after him in Almaty. O.Tleukabyluly was not only a scientist-healer but also the visionary thinker, who well knew the life, customs, the world, the spiritual culture of his people."

"Traditionally, the women of North Macedonia perform domestic work. In the field of academics, some women from North Macedonia focus in the study of Humanities. Some women in North Macedonia hold positions of authority. Women receive ""inheritance"" through the dowry system, because inheritance is traditionally transferred to male heirs. Some modern-day women receive inheritance that is divided among siblings by their parents. The traditional way women greet each other involves exchanging kisses.

"Mysterious Traveller is the fourth studio album by the jazz ensemble Weather Report and was released in 1974. This was their final recording with founding bassist Miroslav Vitouš, who left due to creative differences. Vitouš was replaced by Alphonso Johnson. Another addition to the line-up is drummer Ishmael Wilburn. Greg Errico was the drummer for the tour between the previously released ""Sweetnighter"" and this album, but declined an invitation to be a permanent member of the band."
"The record is the band's first that predominantly uses electric bass and incorporates liberal uses of funk, R&B grooves, and rock that would later be hallmarked as the band's ""signature"" sound. Also, the more restricted compositional format became evident on this album, replacing the more ""open improvisation"" formats used on the first three albums. It was voted as the album of the year by the readers of ""Down Beat"" for 1974, garnering Weather Report's second overall win in that category, also garnering a five-star review from that publication along the way."
"The album peaked at #2 in the ""Billboard"" Jazz album chart, #31 in the R&B album chart, and #46 in the ""Billboard"" 200 chart."

"Maria Taferl is an Austrian market municipality of 872 people in the District of Melk and the most important pilgrimage site in all of Lower Austria. After Mariazell, Maria Taferl is the most important pilgrimage destination in all of Austria."
"Maria Taferl is located in the Nibelungengau in Lower Austria on a bank over the Danube. 47.48 percent of the municipality is forested. As the Maria Taferl Market, which takes place on the so-called ""Taferlberg"" (""Taferl Mountain""), the remaining districts are found in the hilly surrounding area. To the south, the basilica is widely visible throughout the town."
"Little is known about the early settlement of Maria Taferl. The Celtic Kingdom of Noricum was located on the northern shore of the Danube. During Roman times, the Danube served as the border of the Province of Noricum. Even today in the church plaza, there is a stone of Celtic origin, on which heathen sacrifices were made. This attests to Maria Taferl's long tradition as a place of religious activity."
"Maria Taferl and the surrounding countryside belonged to the territory of the Ostarrichi during the time of the Bambergs in the Middle Ages. It then became part of the Habsburg holdings. For a long time, it was part of the land of the Lords of Weißenberg, whose seat lay in the nearby town of Münichreith. It is assumed that the various districts of the town were already established during the Middle Ages. The history of the modern market of Maria Taferl begins in the 17th century."
"The first church was built around a shrine to the Holy Mother, which is the origin of the name ""Maria Taferl."" The legends say that the statue of the Pietà at the shrine was an offering from Alexander Schinagel, a forester, who had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness. It replaced a crucifix there, which had also been the site of a miracle, for when local shepherd Thomas Pachmann tried to chop down the oak on which it was placed, he gravely injured both his legs. After a prayer to the Virgin Mary, his almost fatal wounds stopped bleeding. The old oak was destroyed by fire in 1755, which also damaged the statue."
The church building was built from 1660 to 1710. Its construction was begun under the imperial architect Georg Gerstenbrand and the Italian Carlo Lurago. Its famous cupola was built by Jakob Prandtauer from 1708 to 1710. He also designed the current appearance of Melk Abbey. The Maria Taferl church is built in the baroque style with ample amounts of gold leaf and a frescoed ceiling. In the center of the high altar is the namesake Marian stature. The building's rear houses its crypt.
"According to an inscription in the building's interior, the building of the church gave the local inhabitants new courage after the Plague, the Turkish Wars, and the Thirty Years' War had all taken their toll. It also supported the ideas of the Counter-Reformation in the heartland of the Catholic House of Habsburg. All this speaks to Maria Taferl as an important manifestation of the Catholic faith on the main traveling route of the Danube."
"There are many traditional stories of angelic processions here, which come from the 17th century. The tradition of pilgrimage to Maria Taferl also dates back to that time. In 1760 alone, there were 700 pilgrimage processions and over 19,000 masses said there. The church is also a kind of information treasure chest about its pilgrims, their origins, and their number. Within it are the gifts of the pilgrims, who came on account of illness and were cured. Another reason for Maria Taferl's importance as a pilgrimage destination was the stone cross, a gift from the citizens of Freistadt for pilgrims who died on the journey. It is also evidence of the exhausting nature of pilgrimage in those days. The murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his family lived in the nearby Artstetten Castle and is known to have regularly attended mass at Maria Taferl."
"Maria Taferl became a ""Basilica minor"" in 1947."
"By 2010, the basilica's interior should have undergone a complete restoration. It will then celebrate a double jubilee: 350 years since the laying of its cornerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, the domes of the two towers were re-covered."
"Besides the basilica, in Maria Taferl there is also a monument for the Fallen of both World Wars. These men are honored annually at meeting of veteran's groups."
There is a folk belief that the water from the well at Maria Taferl can help with eye complaints.
"Other landmarks in the town are the Elementary School Museum, as well as the mechanical nativity, which tells the story of Maria Taferl's origins."
The municipality of Maria Taferl is divided into seven districts:
The mayor of Maria Taferl is Herbert Gruber and the Chief Officer is Daniela Lahmer. In the Municipal Council the 15 seats went to the following parties: ÖVP 10 and SPÖ 5.

DCEThreads is an implementation of POSIX Draft 4 threads.
"DCE/RPC was under development, but the POSIX committee had not finalised POSIX threads at the time. The Open Group had to make a decision about what to stick with, and unfortunately the final POSIX threads were different from their selection."
"POSIX Draft 4 threads were limited to begin with (the final standard fixed these). Microsoft adopted DCE/RPC wholesale in Windows NT as MSRPC and also in DCOM. Most of the stability and reliability problems that programmers associate with DCOM services - especially memory leaks, exception handling problems and thread cancellation stability issues - can be traced back to the use of POSIX Draft 4 threads."
"DCE/RPC is sufficiently complex that the issue of updating it to solve and modernise the POSIX Draft 4 threading problem requires highly skilled and highly specific programming knowledge. Consequently, for all that it can accomplish, the reference implementation of DCE/RPC languishes due to a lack of information and resources."
"The key difference between POSIX Draft 4 threads and the final POSIX threads specification, aside from a number of functions being interruptible where others are not, is thread cancellation. DCE/RPC utilises thread cancellation to propagate signals across the ""Remote"" of RPC, such that for example a client application terminating a thread results in its corresponding thread on the server also being terminated in the same way. Unfortunately, the final POSIX specification does not include such sophisticated cancellation methodology, and, given the difficulties that the Unix vendors had in correctly implementing the POSIX threads specification, it is not surprising that it was removed."
"Linux, since the introduction of NPTL and the Linux 2.6 kernel, has proper support for thread cancellation."
DCEThreads now only realistically exists as an emulation layer.

"The Los Cerritos Center is a super regional shopping mall located in Cerritos, California. Since September 1971, the Los Cerritos Center has been an integral part of the city of Cerritos' tax revenue. The mall is the city's largest revenue source, producing $581 per square foot in sales ($296 million total) in 2010. The tax revenue generated from the Los Cerritos Center for its host city totals to approximately $3 million a year. The facility is owned by Macerich & GIC Private Limited."
"The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency initially invested $30 million for the development of the Los Cerritos Center area. The shopping area built at Gridley Road and South Street was developed by Ernest M. Hahn, Inc. in September 1971 with the Phase I opening of the corridor from The Broadway department store (currently Macy's) to Ohrbach's (first became a Mervyn's, currently a Forever 21) and J.W. Robinson's (became Robinsons-May in 1993) in addition to having an initial 150 specialty stores. Phase II followed in 1971 with the opening of the wing from Ohrbach's to Sears. In 1981, Phase III saw the opening of Nordstrom and its first wing. In November 1993, Phase IV was completed when the Palm Court Cafes debuted in the Center with 14 eateries."
"At its opening, the Los Cerritos Center was one of the area's first shopping malls and was noted for its high quality maintenance and complete climate-controlled environment."
"The original goal of the center was to bring thousands of dollars of sales tax revenue to the city of Cerritos. In its first four years, the city of Cerritos' retail sales grew tenfold, topping over $207 million in 1974."
"In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off its 235 properties, including the Sears at Los Cerritos Center, into Sertiage Growth Properties."
"Since the end of 2015, the center has been undergoing a large-scale renovation, which brought in new anchors such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Harkins Theatres, in-line stores, remodeled interiors, new furnishings and lighting, exterior landscaping, as well as art work and overall re-branding."
"The Macy's wing houses merchandise, confectionery, and services for the family, the main concourse holds more upscale fashion stores, restaurants and boutiques, and the Sears wing focuses on specialty shops in entertainment, younger consumers, as well as the newly renovated Dining Court."
"Forever 21, which opened in January 2010 from the old Mervyn's store, was the first flagship styled store for the retailer in the United States and opened to much acclaim."
"A brand new, relocated Nordstrom department store and wing opened in May 2010 on the site of a former Robinsons-May. The added wing made room for nine additional in-line shops and restaurants. The old Nordstrom site was demolished for redevelopment and is now the site of a 16-screen Harkins Theatres which opened in spring 2016, as well as The Cheesecake Factory, which opened in November 2015."

= = = Emperor Duzong = = =
"Emperor Duzong of Song (2 May 1240 – 12 August 1274), personal name Zhao Qi, was the 15th emperor of the Song dynasty in China and the sixth emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. He was a nephew of his predecessor, Emperor Lizong, and reigned from 1264 until his death in 1274."
"His birth name was Zhao Mengqi but his name was changed to Zhao Zi in 1251 and finally to Zhao Qi in 1253 after he was designated as Emperor Lizong's heir apparent. Duzong's reign was filled with rebellions and warfare; the court was dominated by his chancellor Jia Sidao and Duzong himself gave in into drinking and women, thus abandoning his duties. He died in 1274 leaving behind three young boys, one of whom took the throne as Emperor Gong. He is the last Emperor of the Song to issue coins; subsequent Emperors were too busy fighting the Mongols to establish mints to cast any coins and did not have enough resources."
"Emperor Duzong's mother wanted to have an abortion because she thought she was of low social status so she took drugs in an futile attempt to abort Duzong. Duzong was born anyway but the drugs affected him in many ways such as that his intelligence was lower than an average person, his hand and feet were soft; using them in an awkward fashion and he couldn't even speak until he was seven years old. He was Yurui's only son. Like his uncle Zhao Yun, he lived in Shaoxing."
"Duzong was discovered by his paternal uncle Zhao Yun, better known as Emperor Lizong in 1253, who was sonless and therefore had no heirs so to compensate, adopted Duzong and designated him crown prince in 1260, an action historians still view as confusing. Emperor Lizong died in 1264 and Emperor Duzong then ascended the throne."
"Emperor Duzong's reign was plagued with rebellions, warfare and corruption in his court; many officials accused the chancellor Jia Sidao of corruption but Duzong trusted Jia Sidao who Duzong honoured by bowing down to Jia even calling him ""teacher"" and according to anecdotes, when Jia was considering resigning, Duzong knelt down in tears begging Jia to remain in office."
"Emperor Duzong ignored his duties and instead delegated all state and military affairs to the hands of Jia Sidao; the emperor instead indulged in drinking, women, and lived in opulence. To make things even worse, Duzong’s intelligence was lower than a normal person and he was often depressed. At first, he told the officials to be straightforward and tell him the problems in the countries, but this was all an act. Soon, he completely neglected his duties. Furthermore, he had a very high sexual appetite. Under Song laws, any woman who had sexual relations with the emperor had to pay respects to the emperor every morning. At one point, there were as many as 30 women paying their respects to Emperor Duzong in one morning. Duzong also gave official documents to four of his most favored women."
"The Mongols had spent decades harassing the Song Empire's borders and were on the verge of conquering the whole of China. Emperor Duzong however, ignored this problem instead choosing to drink and indulging in sex because when Duzong heard that Xiangyang was being besieged by Mongol troops, Duzong asked Jia Sidao ""I hear that Xiangyang had been besieged by the Yuan troops for several years. Is this true?"" in which Jia said in all seriousness ""Well, I haven't heard such a thing."" Duzong replied with ""A palace maid told me this."""
"Lu Wenhuan sent a messenger to Emperor Duzong, to request immediate reinforcements to defend Xiangyang. The messenger successfully got by the Yuan forts and reached the emperor but upon hearing the effectiveness of these new trebuchets, the emperor considered Xiangyang lost and did not send reinforcements. The decisive Battle of Xiangyang was fought in 1274 when the Mongols succeeded in capturing and destroying the last Song stronghold. The loss of Xiangyang sealed the fate of the Song dynasty and the news of its capture was deliberately hidden from Emperor Duzong by Jia Sidao."
"Emperor Duzong died shortly thereafter from overindulgence in wine but Richard Davis and other sources claim that, Duzong died suddenly from a severe negligence of a Palace Doctor. In any case, he was succeeded by his sixth son, Zhao Xian (Emperor Gong), who was then only four years old. Although Emperor Duzong was technically not the last emperor of the Song dynasty, historians see him as the last Song emperor who could have made decisions that would've significantly halted or even prevented the fall of the dynasty."
Emperor Duzong was buried in the Yongshao Mausoleum on January 1275.

"It also shares its edge arrangement with the great icosihemidodecahedron (having the triangular faces in common), and with the great dodecahemidodecahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common)."
This polyhedron can be considered a rectified great icosahedron:
"The truncated ""great stellated dodecahedron"" is a degenerate polyhedron, with 20 triangular faces from the truncated vertices, and 12 (hidden) pentagonal faces as truncations of the original pentagram faces, the latter forming a great dodecahedron inscribed within and sharing the edges of the icosahedron."
"The dual of the great icosidodecahedron is the great rhombic triacontahedron; it is nonconvex, isohedral and isotoxal. It has 30 intersecting rhombic faces. It can also be called the great stellated triacontahedron."

"Rolling Thunder was a racing wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, NJ. Rolling Thunder was the park's first wooden coaster, and debuted in 1979 during the park's fifth anniversary season. It closed in 2013."
"Rolling Thunder opened in 1979. To mark the 100th anniversary of roller coasters in the USA, Rolling Thunder's Coaster 2 side was renamed ""Rednuht Gnillor,"" the backwards spelling of ""Rolling Thunder,"" in 1984. The trains were turned around so riders would view the ride while riding backwards. During this season, Rednuht Gnillor's warning signs were placed in the back of the station and on the back of the lift hill so riders could see them."
Rolling Thunder was standing but not operating in September and October 2005 and through most of the Spring of 2006 due to the construction of the Plaza del Carnival section and El Toro.
"Rolling Thunder closed on September 8, 2013, to make room for . Soon after Rolling Thunder closed, it was demolished, except for one part of the track which is still standing."
"The line for the ride began at an adjoining entrance and had separate queues for each track. The queue to the right of the entrance lead to the Coaster 1 track and Coaster 2 was reached by the queue on the left. Guests who were not tall enough for coasters with 54-inch (137 cm) minimum height would ride Rolling Thunder, which had a 44-inch (112 cm) height requirement."
"Unlike most racing coasters, Rolling Thunder's tracks were not always next to each other, they separated at several points in the ride. After the first drop, the left track traveled over a big hill, followed by a small hill, whereas the second track reversed that. On the turnaround at the back, the left track traveled up and made a level turn, while the right track traveled up and dropped while turning. The hills on the return segment were also staggered. The trains were not always raced."
"The structure and track was mostly built from 850,000 feet (259,080 m) of Douglas Fir. In the past, the Douglas Fir had been treated with pesticides which were not considered environmentally friendly and the track and supports were slowly being replaced with southern yellow pine."
"The track was made by bolting seven layers of wood. In most places on the ride, there were two layers of southern yellow pine, which sat atop five layers of Douglas-Fir. Older sections of track still had seven layers of Douglas-Fir (mostly on the lift) and there were refurbished sections of track with seven layers of southern pine. A strip of steel was bolted onto the top layer of wood track and three-inch-wide pieces of steel were bolted onto the sides."
"The women featured had a separate section from the men. There were only three women listed in the top 50. Sheikha Munira al-Qubaysi (number 21), an educator of girls and women; Queen Rania of Jordan (number 37), who promotes global education; and Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned of Qatar (number 38), who is chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development."
"The listing also includes an extensive Arts and Culture Section. The general Arts and Culture Section included the names of singers Salif Keita, Youssou N'Dour, Raihan, Yusuf Islam and Sami Yusuf, Dawud Wharnsby; musician A. R.

"In 2010, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list as the most influential Muslim in the world for the second consecutive year. Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei maintained second place. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan moved into third place. Jordanian King Abdullah II was placed fourth above Moroccan King Mohammed VI who moved down to fifth place."
"In 2011, achievements of a lifetime were given more weight than achievements within the current year. which meant that the lists of names were going to change gradually, rather than dramatically, year-on-year. The Arab Spring had no impact on Saudi King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's influence, it had boosted King Mohammed VI of Morocco's influence, who moved up to second place, and it had no effect on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who came in third place."
"Erdoğan was expected by many to receive the top spot in light of the Arab Spring. Erdoğan was credited with Turkey's ""Muslim democracy"", and was seen as the leader of a country that, as the Brookings Institution said, ""played the 'most constructive' role in the Arab events."""
"Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani influence rose during the Arab Spring, moving him to sixth place. He had driven much of the Arab Spring through the coverage given by ""Al Jazeera"", given financial support to protesters and political support to Libya, making him arguably the biggest enabler of the Arab Spring."
"In 2012, the edition was published by S. Abdallah Schleifer, Professor Emeritus and Senior Fellow Kamal Adham Center for Television & Digital Journalism, The American University in Cairo."
"There were more Muslims from America than any other country again with 41 spots on the 500 list. Countries with the next highest number of names were Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom, with 25 Muslims each, followed by Indonesia, with 24. It lists the winners according to 13 categories, including spiritual guides, Quran reciters, scholars, politicians, celebrities, sports figures, radicals, and media leaders."
"For the fourth year running, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list. He was followed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at second place. Erdoğan's advance gave him advantage over Moroccan King Mohammed VI who took the third place. Fourth place went to Dr Mohammed Badie, whose name appeared in the top 10 for the first time. He was followed by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who took the fifth place. Sheikh Al-Azhar Dr. Ahmad el-Tayeb and prominent Islamic scholar Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi who is President of Global Association of Muslim Scholars, also made it to the top 10 ranks."
"""The Clarinet Projected"" reported that they considered seven of the top ten to be ""Islamists""."
"In 2013, the list was edited once again by Professor Emeritus S. Abdallah Schleifer of the American University in Cairo."
"The top of the list went to Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Sheikh of the Al Azhar University for the prominent role played by him in Egypt's troubled democratic transition His astute decision making over the past couple of years has preserved the traditional approach of Al-Azhar which faced threats from Islamists and Salafis in the years that have followed Mubarak's fall. His public support of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's coup also gave it a strong religious grounding that was necessary for it to achieve the legitimacy needed to prevent a civil war, effectively making him a ""king-maker"" and cementing his place at the top of the list. He was followed on the listing by Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud and Iranian Grand Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei."
"Reflective of the wider trajectory of the Arab Spring, this year's list showed a decline in influence from Muslim Brotherhood associated figures Dr Mohammed Badie, Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. Coup kingpin General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who was previously unlisted now ranks at 29."
"The US dominates the list again with 41 inclusions including Muhammad Ali, Dr Mehmet Oz, Rep. Keith Ellison, Yasiin Bey (Mos Def), and Fareed Zakaria. Representing the UK are Mo Farah, Yusuf Islam, Riz Khan, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Cambridge's Dr Timothy Winter and 18 others."
"In 2014, the chief editor of the list was again Professor S Abdallah Schleifer. The top spot went back to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, due to his being the ""absolute monarch of the most powerful Arab nation."" The list accords him the place in light of Saudi Arabia being home to Islam's two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, which millions of Muslims visit throughout the year, as well as the kingdom's oil exports. Rounding out the top three are Dr Muhammad Ahmed al-Tayeb, grand sheikh of Al-Azhar University and grand imam of Al-Azhar mosque, and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The top nine are all political leaders and royals, including Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan."
"The top 50 fit into six broad categories: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are ""preachers"", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations. In total 72 Americans are among the 500 most influential Muslims, a disproportionately strong showing, but only one among the top 50, Sheikh Hamza Yusuf Hanson of Zaytuna Institute listed at number 38."
"In 2015, the top 50 was again dominated by religious scholars and heads of state. The top five, was King Abdullah of Jordan; Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheikh of Egypt's Al-Azhar University; King Salman of Saudi Arabia; Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan came in at Number eight, but surprisingly Syrian President Bashar al-Assad did not make the Top 50 this year or last, though he is still listed in the 500. The prime minister of Iraq did not make the list, but Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hussein Sistani did, coming in at number nine."
"There was 32 newcomers to the 2016 list. 22 Indians featured on the list. As in past years, there continued to be more Muslims from the United States than any other country. Since at least 2012, the U.S. has outpaced nations with a far larger Muslim population, with at least 40 notable people of influence, with Pakistan (33), Saudi Arabia (32), Egypt (27) and the UK (27)."

"Set in 18th-century South Africa, the film dramatizes the true story of Claas Blank (Rouxnet Brown) and Rijkhaart Jacobsz (Neil Sandilands)."
"Herder Claas Blank was serving 10 years for ""insulting a Dutch citizen"" and Rijkhaart, was a Dutch sailor convicted of committing ""unnatural acts"" with another man. The two men initially hostile form a secret relationship, using trips to a private water-tank to bond. The two prisoners on Robben Island who were later executed for sodomy in 1735 by drowning, after jealousy of other inmates caused problems. Their relationship also had a racial component, as Jacobsz was a white Dutchman, while Blank was a black Khoi.

= = = Soybean oil = = =
"Soybean oil is a vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the soybean (""Glycine max""). It is one of the most widely consumed cooking oils. As a drying oil, processed soybean oil is also used as a base for printing inks (soy ink) and oil paints."
Chinese records dating prior to 2000 B.C. mention use of cultivated soybeans to produce edible soy oil. Ancient Chinese literature reveals that soybeans were extensively cultivated and highly valued as a use for the soybean oil production process before written records were kept.
"To produce soybean oil, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, heated to between 60 and 88 °C (140–190 °F), rolled into flakes, and solvent-extracted with hexanes. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated are sold as ""vegetable oil,"" or are ingredients in a wide variety of processed foods. Most of the remaining residue (soybean meal) is used as animal feed."
"In the 2002–2003 growing season, 30.6 million tons (MT) of soybean oil were produced worldwide, constituting about half of worldwide edible vegetable oil production, and thirty percent of all fats and oils produced, including animal fats and oils derived from tropical plants."
"In 2018-2019, world production was at 57.4 MT with the leading producers including China (16.6 MT), US (10.9 MT), Argentina (8.4 MT), Brazil (8.2 MT), and EU (3.2 MT)."
"Per 100 g, soybean oil has 16 g of saturated fat, 23 g of monounsaturated fat, and 58 g of polyunsaturated fat. The major unsaturated fatty acids in soybean oil triglycerides are the polyunsaturates alpha-linolenic acid (C-18:3), 7-10%, and linoleic acid (C-18:2), 51%; and the monounsaturate oleic acid (C-18:1), 23%. It also contains the saturated fatty acids stearic acid (C-18:0), 4%, and palmitic acid (C-16:0), 10%."
"The high-proportion of oxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acid is undesirable for some uses, such as cooking oils. Three companies, Monsanto Company, DuPont/Bunge, and Asoyia in 2004 introduced low linolenic Roundup Ready soybeans. Hydrogenation may be used to reduce the unsaturation in linolenic acid. The resulting oil is called hydrogenated soybean oil. If the hydrogenation is only partially complete, the oil may contain small amounts of trans fat."
Soybean oil is mostly used for frying and baking. It is also used as a condiment for salads.
"Soybean oil is one of many drying oils, which means that it will slowly harden (due to free-radical based polymerization) upon exposure to air, forming a flexible, transparent, and waterproof solid. Because of this property, it is used in some printing ink and oil paint formulations. However, other oils (such as linseed oil) may be superior for some drying oil applications."

"Govenlock is an unincorporated community within Rural Municipality of Reno No. 51, Saskatchewan, Canada. Previously held the status of a village with a peak population of 151 residents, until its village status was dissolved on January 1, 1976. The former townsite of Govenlock is located on Highway 21 & Highway 13 also known as the historic Red Coat Trail, about 15 km east of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. Very little remains of the former village of Govenlock, many cement foundations and wooden sidewalks can still be found scattered around the town site, the only building that still stands as of 2010 is the old community hall and a commemorative plaque in remembrance of Govenlock's rich history."
"Govenlock, like so many other small communities throughout Saskatchewan, has struggled to maintain a sturdy population causing it to become a completely abandoned ""ghost town"" with a population of 0 citizens. Prior to January 1, 1976, Govenlock was incorporated under village status, but was dissolved into an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Reno on that date."
"In 2006, Govenlock had a population of 0 living in 0 dwellings, a 0% increase from 2001. The community had a land area of and a population density of ."
"In 1910, a Moose Jaw resident by the name of William Govenlock moved to the area with his family after applying for a homestead. They were one of the first pioneer families of Southwest Saskatchewan. In 1913, William negotiated a land deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway, starting a new town later named in his honour. That same year William established a post office for the area, with his wife Bessie as the first postmaster."
"In 1914 a pioneer named John Linder built Govenlock's first Hotel. The hotel stood two stories tall with ten rooms. Three years later a man named James Gaff stopped at the Hotel for a rest; after finding out that no rooms were available James immediately purchased the hotel for $4,500."
"Even though the liquor trade was big business during that time, Govenlock's future looked promising even without the steady stream of liquor. The town boasted its impressive CPR station, section house, a few grain elevators, two general stores, blacksmith shops, a livery barn, two machine agencies, pool room, laundromat, school, meat shop, a service station selling Model T Fords, and a hotel. Most of these businesses were connected by wooden sidewalks, a common feature in the pioneer prairie days."
"After Montana's prohibition declaration in 1919, large groups of Americans from that state frequently crossed the border by train to visit Govenlock to purchase booze."
"Indicating that Govenlock had a promising future, the pioneer town had a chamber of commerce. It was the liquor trade that fuelled Govenlock's prosperity. Four liquor warehouses were established in the centre to serve a booming liquor trade. With liquor trade and the frequent influx of imbibers, gambling and parties became common, attracting not only thirsty folks from across the border, but many bachelors from all parts of Southwestern Saskatchewan who wanted to let loose."
"Over the years a poolroom and two-story dancehall building was built and owned by Henry Buss. During the early days, Govenlock was a place for people of both countries to socialize and relax. As the American booze customers waited for their liquor orders, many would mingle with the people of Govenlock and settle down for a game of pool or a game of high-stakes poker. Revelry and good times were staples in Govenlock during their early days."
"Busy American booze traders were also a staple in Govenlock. To avoid legal problems, bootleggers would have to obtain a tourist pass at Canada border entry points. They would come to the pioneer town in their Fords, Studebakers, Packards, and Hudsons. The empty cars' rears were filled with sand bags until they filled up at the liquor houses. This was done to avoid suspicion when they rode empty of booze, light without a load. Canadian beer cost 12 cents per bottle and was said to be highly prized. Whiskey was more expensive and more lucrative. It was transported in barrels. Each barrel had three burlap sacks, with 24 four-quart bottles - wrapped in straw - in each sack. A barrel wholesaled for $24. When it reached the United States, it sold for $140. A carload of 14 barrels of beer and five cases of whiskey could fetch a profit of $2,500."
"The bootlegging trade was good business for several years and there were few legal hassles for the rumrunners. Mounties and provincial police intervened to ensure that the liquor went through the hands of locals before crossing the United States border. Even a few of the Govenlock residents tried their hand at bootlegging, but they soon found out that more of the liquor was stolen than they sold."
"When 1922 rolled around, so did the end of bootlegging that fueled Govenlock's prosperity. It was then that the Government of Saskatchewan announced it wanted better control of the liquor trade and restricted liquor export houses to cities with 10,000 people or more. This started the slow end of the once promising pioneer town of Govenlock. Over the years and one by one, stores and shops soon closed and residents left. In 1962 the only grain elevator left in Govenlock was toppled and demolished. By 1990, rural municipality officials brought in the bulldozers and demolished all but one of the remaining buildings that stood in Govenlock, including the old Govenlock Hotel."
"The only building left is the community hall, built in 1948. Also a commemorative plaque marks the area where Govenlock was located. It honors Govenlock's wild past and wild spirit of its hell-raising pioneer days."

"L'Opéra du pauvre (English: Poor's Opera) is a piece for voices and orchestra formalized by Léo Ferré as a quadruple concept album released in 1983. This dreamlike and wry plea in favor of the Night, symbol of imagination and subversiveness for Ferré, synthesizes all aspects of the French poet and musician."
"""L'Opéra du pauvre"" comes from a ""lyrical"" ballet titled ""The Night"", written in 1956 at the request of choreographer and dancer Roland Petit, within the Revue des Ballets de Paris. The piece was abandoned by Petit after a few performances (critics being severely negative). Ferré published the libretto same year at La Table Ronde Editions. This work stayed then on the shelf for twenty-six years."
"It was after the triple LP ""Ludwig - L'Imaginaire - Le Bateau ivre"" was released in 1982, that Léo Ferré decided to dedicate his upcoming year to bring ""The Night"" back to life. As time had passed, Ferré had accumulated a lot of material, and he chose to enrich his original text and score with elements from various sources, thus creating a new Baroque work of much larger scope (it would take four LP to hold this whole new version)."
Léo Ferré changes his voice and acts all parts.
"The Night is accused of having murdered the Lady Shadow, who is missing. The opera depicts Night's trial by the ""day people"", allegorized by animals. The judge is a raven, prosecutor is a cock and Night's attorney is an owl. Witnesses, all night owls for some reason of their own, are called to the bar and try to save the Night."
= = = Lucsuhin Natural Bridge = = =
"Lucsuhin Natural Bridge, locally called Cabag Cave or Lucsuhin Cave, is a natural bridge located between Brgy. Lucsuhin and Brgy. Kalubkob in Silang, Cavite province in the Philippines. The bridge, which crosses the Ylang-Ylang River, is the first large natural bridge reported in the country."
"The first American to discover and study the bridge is Paul R. Fanning from the Division of Mines during the early part of the American colonial period. He was making a geological reconnaissance in the vicinity of Silang, Cavite in July 1910 when he discovered the natural bridge of unusual size. Owing to its remoteness, Fanning believed no white men have probably visited the place before."
The natural bridge is located in the great bedded tuff area lying between Manila and Tayabas Bay where the rock is favorable for their formation.
"The opening under the bridge span is tunnel-like and has a diameter of about and a length of about . It makes a double turn that roughly approximates the shape of the letter 'S.' During low water, the stream occupies a central channel consisting of a staggered series of small falls and potholes which are the result of the action of the water upon the horizontal bedding of the tuff rock."
"The floor of the bridge, which is about above the stream, was examined by Fanning and showed evidence of once having formed the bed of the stream. Erosion had nearly obliterated this old bed, but had not been sufficient to destroy the sides of the valley. At one time, the river must have flowed at this higher elevation to a place several kilometers down stream from the present tunnel and then passed over a cliff. This cliff gradually receded upstream forming the present box canyon. As illustrated by the sketches, seepage began at a point several hundred meters above the falls and, owing to the horizontal bedding of the rock, it first took a path at right angles to the river course, then descended from bed to bed to the bottom of the falls. The porous, soft nature of the rock favored the rapid enlargement of the underground channel, and eventually the entire stream followed this course."
"Subsequent erosion and caving had greatly decreased the length of the underground channel and produced the short canyon above the present entrance portal. Owing to the thinness of the roof, the first part of the tunnel caved rapidly, whereas the erosion and caving of the lower part was much slower. A condition now has been reached where the entrance and exit portals will be eroded with about equal speed and at the same time the tunnel will be greatly enlarged in diameter by down cutting and by caving of the roof. Under these conditions the bridge eventually should assume the arch structure characteristic of famous natural bridges in other parts of the world."
"The bridge and cave is not a protected area and need preservation for future generations, as well as the areas upriver to preserve the quality of water, lest it would end up like Hinulugang Taktak falls in Rizal province."
"The bridge can be reached from Silang by following the Silang-Banaybanay Road for about west from the Aguinaldo Highway and J. Rizal Ave. junction to the barrio of Lucsuhin, past the road to the Riviera Golf & Country Club, past the bridge over Ylang-Ylang River to Brgy. Kalubkob. From here, it is about long hike to the site."
"An alternate route from Kalubkob, is to head north on Fresco Belen Drive for about to a dirt road to the right. The bridge and cave are reached by hiking east on the dirt road for ."

"The Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q) was established in the 1850s to rival the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (C&GU). The new railroad was constructed due to growing concern that the cities of Batavia and Aurora would have an economic downfall since the C&GU bypassed both settlements. The railroad station in Batavia was the first constructed by the CB&Q, and as such, the company took extra care to make it stand out architecturally."
"The wood structure stands two stories tall with red, vertical panels. Originally , a four-room extension was added to the ground floor in 1868. The main structure has a gable roof with Gothic brackets while the extension has a flat roof. The station was later abandoned by the CB&Q, who preferred to maintain only a direct route through Aurora. The station was moved to its current location in 1973 in an effort to preserve it. Renovations were made to restore the building to its 1919 appearance (which was likely very similar to the original). The building was placed on a new cinder block foundation. The new lot also had a basement for a furnace to keep the building open during the winter. The Fox River now lies to the building's east.

= = = London Underground mosquito = = =
"The London Underground mosquito is a form of mosquito in the genus ""Culex"". It is found in the London Underground railway system as its name suggests, but has a worldwide distribution and long predates the existence of the London Underground. It was first described as a distinct species from Egyptian specimens by the biologist Peter Forsskål (1732–1763). He named this mosquito ""Culex molestus"" due to its voracious biting, but later biologists renamed it ""Culex pipiens"" f. ""molestus"" because there were no morphological differences between it and ""Culex pipiens"". Notably, this mosquito assaulted Londoners sleeping in the Underground during the Blitz, although similar populations were long known."
"A study from 2004 analyzing DNA microsatellites suggested that ""Culex molestus"" is likely a distinct species from ""Culex pipiens"". However, a more recent paper from 2012 argues that it is more accurately 'a physiological and ecological variant of ""Cx. pipiens"" ' and should not be considered a distinct species."
"This mosquito, although first discovered in Egypt in the late 18th century, has been found in underground systems around the world. Some authors suggested that it adapted to human-made underground systems since the last century from local above-ground ""Culex pipiens"", but the more recent evidence suggests it is a southern mosquito variety related to ""C. pipiens"" that has adapted to the warm underground spaces of northern cities."
"Behavioral evidence for this mosquito being a different species from ""C. pipiens"" comes from research by Kate Byrne and Richard Nichols. The species have very different behaviours, are extremely difficult to mate, and with different allele frequencies consistent with genetic drift during a founder event. More specifically, this mosquito, ""C. molestus"", breeds all-year round, is cold intolerant, and bites rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the above-ground species, which is cold tolerant, hibernates in the winter, and is considered to mostly feed on bird hosts. When the two varieties were crossbred, the eggs were infertile, suggesting reproductive isolation."

= = = Competitive Tax Plan = = =
"The Competitive Tax Plan is an approach to taxation, suggested in the United States, that would impose a 10–15% value added tax (VAT) and reduce personal and corporate income taxes. The plan was created by Michael J. Graetz, professor at Columbia Law School and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy. Graetz states that the plan would generate enough revenue so that families with $100,000 of annual income or less — almost 90% of all current filers — would not have to pay income taxes or file tax returns. The Competitive Tax Plan would provide a new payroll tax offset to replace the Earned Income Tax Credit and to protect low and moderate income workers from any tax increase under the new system. Under the initial proposal, households with an annual income of more than $100,000 would be taxed at a flat 25% rate and the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 25%. Graetz argues that reducing the corporate tax rate ""would make the United States an extremely attractive nation for corporate investments for both U.S. citizens and foreign investors"". In 2013, Graetz presented an updated version of his plan for 2015."
"Michael J. Graetz is professor at Columbia Alumni of Tax Law. He was born at November 20, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is married and has five children. He is also a leading expert on national and international tax law. He has taught at University of Virginia Law School, University of Southern California, California Institute of Technology, and Yale Law School, and also worked as assistant to the secretary and special counsel for the Department of the Treasury. Graetz won the Daniel M. Holland Medal by the National Tax Association. He has written more than 80 articles on a wide range of tax, international taxation, health policy, and social insurance issues."
"In his work we can see that in comparison to OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) , he call the U.S. as a ""Low Tax Country"" , meant as the total federal, state and local tax revenues as a percentage of GDP( Gross Domestic Product) are much lower than the one of OECD. What can be interesting is that the Income Tax in the U.S. in comparison to EU27 and OECD is equal or even higher. The U.S. has according to Graetz's data from 2010 low consumption taxas a percentage of total taxation. Further he mentions that the U.S. has been the only OECD country without a VAT in comparison to more than 160 countries all over the world that has already have a VAT. This needs to change according to his work. So he came with the so called "" the five pieces of competitive tax plan"" The steps are:"
There are some basic principles in the proposal for the goods and service tax:
Proposed VAT is 12.9%.
"The next point in the competitive tax plan is to shrink the income tax. He proposed to limit the income tax only to high income earners in order to ensure federal tax progressivity. Another step is to provide a Family Allowance of $100,000 for married couples ($50,000 for singles, $75,000 for heads of households). This step will eliminate great part of income tax return( more than 120 million), and it also will resulted in fewer than 20 percent of all U.S. tax units will be required to file income tax returns. He stated specific levels of income tax rates. For example, for married couples it will be:"
"The next step of the Proposal is to ""Reduce and Reform the Corporate Income Tax"". Proposed tax rate is 15 percent. This step should solve the problem with international income taxation as it reverse current law’s incentives to locate deductions here and income abroad. It will also repeal the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. It should simplify small businesses taxation."
"Another part of the plan is to protect low and middle income families in the way that delivering new child credits through debit cards that can be used at the cash register. All children qualify for $1,500 per child( but for married couples with more than $150,000 ($75,000 singles and heads of households), these credits phase-out at a rate of 5%*). For low and moderate income workers it will be even more."
"Next to protecting low and middle income families, the plan also speaks about protecting low and moderate income workers by providing a Payroll Tax Credit of 15.3 percent for wages up to $10,000 and $1,530 per worker for all workers with earnings between $10,000 and $40,000. This credit eliminates all payroll taxes for workers with $10,000 or less of earnings, also it eliminates at least the employees’ share (half) of payroll taxes for workers with earnings below $20,000. Above $40,000 this credit phases out at a rate of 7.65 percent."
No formal bill for the Competitive Tax Plan itself is in Congress; however Senator Ben Cardin's Progressive Consumption Tax Act has many similar features.

The Royal Victorian Aero Club is an Australian aero club based at Moorabbin Airport in Melbourne. Originating in 1914 (six years before the national airline Qantas) it is amongst the world's oldest Aviation organisations.
"Founded by pioneer aviators in 1914 at Point Cook, the club is one of Australia's oldest flying training organisations."
The Australian Aero Club was formed on 28 October 1914 (and formally established on 9 April 1915) and was subsequently affiliated with the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain. The original hand-written minutes of this historic meeting establishing the club are preserved today.
"Renamed the Victorian Aero Club in October 1934, on 13 March 1935 approval to use the ""Royal"" prefix was granted and since that date the institution has been known as the Royal Victorian Aero Club."
"While originally formed at Point Cook, in 1919 the Club transferred operations to what was then the Commonwealth Aerodrome (or sometimes referred to as ""St Johns Field"") on Bulla Road in Essendon. Club operations were some of the first from St John's Field, as the aerodrome was not officially opened until 1922."
"The Civil Aviation Department provided support to the Australian Aero Club, by providing an establishment gift of six DeHavilland"
"Gypsy Moth aircraft two of which were allocated to the Victorian Chapter. The two Victorian Gypsy Moths, (G-AUAL and G-UAUG) arrived in July 1926 by ship and within a month they were taking part in a major aerial display at Essendon to celebrate the arrival of solo flyer A. J. Cobham from England. The Flying Section of the Club was officially opened by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Irvine on 21 August 1926."
In 1934 club member 28-year-old Freda Thompson flew her DH Moth Major solo from England to Australia in 19 days – the first Australian women fly the route (also notable for her record 5 hr flight from Koepang to Darwin). Freda Thompson was Club President in 1948.
"Operations were somewhat limited during the Second World War, and Essendon Airport subsequently became the primary commercial airport for Melbourne, the increased airliner traffic limiting private operations. Thus, in December 1949 the Club transferred to and became the first operator on what were once market-gardens on Centre Dandenong Road, at the newly established Moorabbin Airport, southeast of the city. A massive growth in the number of flying hours took place in the 1950s and 1960s, aided in part by a Commonwealth Government edict providing some subsidies for private flying training."
The Foundation Members of the Royal Victorian Aero Club were:
Some of those who played a vital role in Club flying operations and who have trained thousands of Australian aviators include:
"Laurie McPherson, Instructor 1950–1951. CFI 1952–1960, 1969–1970 and Manager 1961–1968 and 1978–1985. Pilot who conducted tests on behalf of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation to closely examine the spinning characteristics of the DHC Chipmunk."
"John Lindsay, Honorary Life Member, one-time CFI and manager and pre-eminent club member from 1945 to 2007."
"H Owen Jones, an employee for 42 years."

He held this position from 14 February 1943 to 7 September 1945 and was a test pilot with the RAAF, Commonwealth Aircraft Factory and Royal Flying Doctor Service. Held Commercial Pilot Licence No 511 and was an Instructor at the RVAC for 40 years and Chief Flying Instructor in 1977. Goon was a member of the well-known Chinese-Australian family from Ballarat, Victoria."
"George Campbell referred to by pioneer aviatrix Nancy Bird-Walton as """"a man who became a great trainer of pilots in the last war years."""
The Royal Victorian Aero Club provides aircraft and facilities for pilot training and private flying at Moorabbin Airport.
The Club currently trains pilots from various overseas countries and also offers an annual Scholarship as well as fly-aways and regular competitions.
"Additionally, the club (with the RAAF Roulettes as Patron) operates the Young Eagles programme for Victorians between 12 and 17 years of age, designed to introduce flying to potential aviators."
In the boom times of the 1950s much of the training and private flying was undertaken in the legendary De Havilland Moth series of aircraft (primarily the de Havilland Tiger Moth).
"The De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk and Victa Airtourer were used in the 1960s followed subsequently by a limited number of Beechcraft aircraft and in much greater numbers, the reliable Piper Aircraft and Cessna, current models of which remain the backbone of the fleet today."

"This bridge opened in 1979 and eliminated a considerable amount of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder.

= = = Rappbode Dam = = =
"The Rappbode Dam () is the largest dam in the Harz region as well as the highest dam in Germany. Together with several other dams and retention basins, it forms the flood protection system for the eastern Harz."
"The earliest discussions about building flood protection barriers took place following devastating floods at the beginning of the 20th century. These envisaged a number of masonry dams being constructed across the tributaries of the Bode river. The first concrete plan, however, was to build just one dam but this would have meant sacrificing a number of villages. The eventual project work was completed in 1938 and proposed a plan which avoided flooding any of localities by constructing a number of dams. Construction on the Rappbode Valley Dam began in 1938. Construction was halted due to the war in 1942. After 1945, the newly founded East Germany, the project got under way again and was extended by including the treatment of drinking water, the original layout being retained and the technology being adapted. The foundation stone was laid on 1 September 1952 and, on 7 October 1959, the dam went into service. It was reconstructed between 2000 and 2003 and the national emblems of East Germany on the inscriptions at the tunnel exit of the road across the dam were removed. The two inscriptions on the left and on the right read:"
"The barrier is a straight gravity dam, which holds the water back by its sheer weight. It was built in several sections and finished in 1959. It is high and long. In recent years (before 2002) the crest of the dam was renewed. The roadway and the concrete had weathered and could no longer handle the weight of traffic. The lake behind the dam acts primarily as a reserve drinking water reservoir for the towns east of the Harz. The pressure pipes go to Aschersleben, Halberstadt, Bernburg (Saale), Halle (Saale) and even Leipzig. Its water quality is particularly good; water hardness averages 3° on the German hardness scale. So the water is ideal for use for steam generation and washing. The reservoir also contributes to generation of hydro-electric power to a small extent."

= = = Sambha gompa = = =
"Kamtsang Dargye Choekhorling Monastery, known locally as Sambha (Samba, Sampa) gompa (goenpa), is situated in Mustang district, Tukuche Village development committee (VDC), in the Western Development Region, Nepal. It is about within Tukuche town on the Annapurna trekking route/ gravel road from Pokhara to Jomsom in the Dhaulagiri zone. In 2013 the local higher secondary school, Shree Yogendra HSS was being expanded, and the entrance to the gompa is within the school site; off the main Beni Jomson road, west of the Kali Gandaki river."
"The founder of Sambha gompa is understood to have come from the DoKham area of Tibet, but his name is unknown. He lived in the village of Tukuche for some time and died during a period of mediation. Seven days after his death he became a rainbow body confirming his achievement of enlightenment. In 1935 the gompa was re-established by members of the Tulachan family."
The first and second incarnations (tulku) are understood to have been born into the Kharghar caste and came from Tibet.
3rd incarnation: Bhattachan family
During the tenure of the third incarnation the location of the gompa was moved to its current location. At the time there was no bridge and the river was difficult to cross. Therefore the villagers offered land to the monks to relocate the gompa within Tukuche village to ease their access.
"4th incarnation: Was from the Tulachan family based in Tukuche, whose given name was Karma Tashi Singye, but known locally as Dr Mangal Singh, having gained a medical doctorate in Switzerland. He died aged 49."
"5th incarnation: Born 28 years after the death of the previous incarnation, also from the Tulachan family in Tukuche has the monastic name Karma Dhomchhe Norbu Tenpi Gyaltshen Palsamgpo Rinpoche. He is the nephew of current head lama (2016) of Chhairo gompa Shashi Dhoj Tulachan. He was recognised by three senior rinpoches including Tai Situpa Rinpoche. He was enthroned aged 8 in 2004 in India."
"He is currently studying at Palpung Monastery in Himachal Pradesh under Kenting Tai Situpa. In order for the young tulku to be accepted by the thakali community, he needs to be enthroned in Sambha gompa, requiring extensive reconstruction of the residential quarters of the monastery."
"Lama Chh'eon-che, of the Gtsag Bris school of painting, was responsible for paintings on the wall behind the altar c. 1994."
"Other frescoes in the gompa depicting the sixteen Arhat on the south, north and eastern walls are by Khaipa Chhogyal, a distant relative of Kamal Dhoj Tulachan, Shashi Dhoj Tulachan's late father."
"Khaipa of Lupra is believed to have painted the Sin-yeb, but this painting no longer remains."
"Damaged roof timbers mean that water ingress has damaged many paintings in recent years. Although roof repairs commenced in 2015, this has yet to be completed due to lack of funds."
In 2013 there was very limited monastic activity. Tukuche has lost much of its population due to changes in trade routes and rural urban migration suffered by many small villages. This first occurred in the 1960s when China tried to restrict movement of Tibetans and most recently during the 2008 Olympics.
"Lama Shashi Dhoj Tulachan an artist from Tukuche village, is responsible for the continued management of the gompa and is seeking support for its physical and spiritual renovation, in addition to the restoration work at Chhairo gompa which he is also responsible for."
"A nun (anim) who also takes care of Rani gompa, looks after the site."
There is a part time monk sponsored by the current Ven Gyalpo Rinpoche who undertakes monastic rituals as required.
To the south of the monastery are the historical residential quarters for the monk body.
These facilities are not currently habitable and the courtyard is used for general storage from the gompa next door.
The gompa was restored in the 2000s.
"A stupa was constructed in the courtyard in memory of a Japanese man, married to a local Nepali, who was a donor for the reconstruction works."
"In his poetic anthology ""Al A'mal Ash-Shi'riyya"" (الأعمال الشعرية) and in preface to ""Blossoming Rose"" Tawfiq stated that he does not support poetry in prose, because it does not sound like a good verse, but at the same time Tawfiq insisted that he supported existence of this genre itself. Like other specialists of Arabic literature, Tawfiq knew the poetry of al-Mutanabbi. In his own verses Tawfiq appealed to al-Mutanabbi's qasidas and biography, using a lot of inter-textual elements. Also Tawfiq gave an estimate of al-Mutanabbi's panegyrics, raising the question of engagement of poetry and politics. Tawfiq compared al-Mutanabbi's panegyrics to Sayf al-Daula, with Mohamed Hassanein Heikal's essays to late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser."

= = = Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel = = =
"Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel, also known as Frederik Karel Albert Schreuel and Jan Christian Aelbert Schreuel (14 June 1773 – 1853), was a Dutch-born painter."
"Schreuel was born in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on 14 June 1773. He joined the Dutch military at a young age. He is recorded as painting by 1788 and eventually left the military to begin studying art, first in Berlin then, in 1805, in Dresden. He spent some time studying under Josef Grassi of the Dresden Academy and soon made a name for himself by painting portrait miniatures. One of his portraits, known from an oval engraving by C. Bolt, was of Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Schreuel would also copy works held at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. By 1840 he had been appointed a professor of painting by the King of Saxony."
"Schreuel is believed to have painted the portrait of the Javanese artist Raden Saleh, who was then studying in Europe, that is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The painting dates to before 1841, because Saleh is depicted dressed as a European dandy, not as a Javanese prince, which was how he dressed beginning in that year. The painting was first recorded at the Dresden Academy exhibition, at which it was a critical success. However, it has also been attributed to Saleh himself; in 2005 the Rijksmuseum was still referring to the work as a self-portrait. The pose is one traditional in self-portraits, and no other portraits by Schreuel are known to have survived, while the style of his miniatures is different; however, this would be the only unsigned painting by Saleh, he knew Schreuel (whom he called 'Schruil'), and the brushwork is freer than is characteristic of his work. According to the Tropenmuseum, they have the only known self-portrait by Saleh."

"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (), also commonly referred to as ""the farm bill,"" is one of two United States ""farm bills"" that were introduced in the 113th United States Congress. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is the bill that was introduced into the United States Senate. A second bill, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 () was introduced into the United States House of Representatives. The two bills cover similar topics and programs, but have significantly different provisions. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 passed the Senate on June 10, 2013 and has received the support of the President."
"However, the Senate bill failed to pass in the House, so the two chambers organized a conference committee. The result is the Agriculture Act of 2014 (H.R. 2642; 113th Congress), which passed the House on January 29, 2014. The Agriculture Act of 2014 includes provisions from both the House and the Senate bills."
"One of the major provisions of the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is a $4 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a controversial provision, with some Democrats arguing that the cuts were too large, while some Republicans arguing that the cuts did not do enough to cut the deficit."
"A ""farm bill"" is one of the primary tools of the United States federal government to set policy related to agriculture in the United States. Farm bills are passed roughly every five years. The farm bills typically cover laws and policies related to supplemental nutrition, land payments, crop insurance, environmental practices, some international trade, and research."
"A similar bill to the proposed Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was also passed by the Senate in the 112th United States Congress, but never received much attention in the House and failed to become law. The current ""farm bill"" expires on September 30, 2013."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would cut spending $24 billion over 10 years. Overall, however, it would still cost nearly $955 billion over 10 years."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would reduce spending on food stamps by $4 billion over 10 years."
"""This summary is based largely on the report on S. 954, as it was reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on May 14, 2013, written by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source."""
"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that direct spending stemming from the program authorization in S. 954 would total $955 billion over the 2014-2023 period. That 10-year total reflects the bill’s authorization of expiring programs through 2018 and an extension of those authorizations through 2023, consistent with the rules governing baseline projections that are specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
"Relative to spending projected under CBO’s May 2013 baseline, the CBO estimates that enacting the bill would reduce direct spending by $17.8 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""The estimated budgetary effects of S. 954 are summarized in Table 1."" CBO estimates that section 10012 of the bill would increase revenues by $54 million over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of the changes in direct spending and revenues are displayed in Table 2."""
"Assuming appropriation of the specified and necessary amounts, the CBO also estimates that implementing the bill would cost $30.1 billion over the 2014-2018 period and $39.9 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of that estimate are displayed in Table 3."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). In general, state, local, and tribal governments would benefit from the continuation of existing agricultural assistance and the creation of new grant programs."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA, by expanding reporting requirements on manufacturers of dairy products and establishing regulations for dairy handlers that purchase milk from dairy producers participating in the Dairy Market Stabilization Program. Additionally, the bill would prohibit individuals from attending animal fighting ventures in states and U.S. territories that permit such ventures. Because the compliance cost for dairy handlers would depend on future regulations, the CBO has no basis to determine whether the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($150 million in 2013, adjusted annually for inflation)."
"The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. Enacting S. 954 would affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. ""The net change in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 4."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was introduced into the Senate on May 14, 2013 by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). The bill was considered on the Senate floor on May 21–23, and June 3–4, June 6, and June 10, 2013. On June 10, 2013, the bill passed in the Senate in Recorded Vote 145: 66-27. Only two Democrats voted against their party: Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). Eighteen Republicans voted in favor of the bill."
"As of June 24, 2013, the United States House of Representatives had not considered the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 or added it to a calendar. On June 20, 2013, Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) urged the House to take up consideration of the bill, speaking from the Senate floor. The Senator argued that because the Senate bill had received the support of many Republicans and cut spending, the House should have no objections to passing it as well. The bill was not put on the Majority Leader's calendar for the week of June 24."
Thiocyanic acid is a chemical compound with the formula HSCN which exists as a tautomer with isothiocyanic acid (HNCS). The iso- form tends to dominate with the material being about 95% isothiocyanic acid in the vapor phase.
"It is a weak acid, bordering on strong, with a p""K"" of 1.1 at 20 °C and extrapolated to zero ionic strength."
HSCN is predicted to have a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. It has been observed spectroscopically but has not been isolated as a pure substance.
"The salts and esters of thiocyanic acid are known as thiocyanates. The salts are composed of the thiocyanate ion (SCN) and a suitable metal cation (e.g., potassium thiocyanate, KSCN). The esters of thiocyanic acid have the general structure R–SCN."

"The club was founded on May 15, 1963, by the initiative of the father Vitório Galliani, vicar of Igreja Nossa Senhora da Conceição, who lead young members of Juventude Oratoriana do Trem (JOT), a movement connected to Vitório Galliani's church. Under influence of Vitório Galliani, it was established that the club's official colors would be black and blue, the same colors of Italy's Internazionale, club supported by the father. Guaracy Freitas was elected as the club's first president."
"In 1963, the club joined Federação Amapaense de Desportos. In 1964, Ypiranga disputed its first competition, the Second Division of the Amapaense Amateur Football Championship, and managed by Francisco Sales de Lima (nicknamed ""Chicão""), the club won the competition, after defeating Independente 6–3 in the final, at Augusto Antunes Stadium.

The reservers: Elcio, Horácio, Otílio, Gadelha, Lery, Trombone, Tônati, Sabá Balieiro, and Joaquim Neto."
"In 1976, Ypiranga won its first state championship, after the club and Santana drew 0–0 at Estádio Municipal Glicério de Souza Marques. The champion players were Emanuel, Buiuna, Damasceno, Waldir and Pitéo, Duranil and Dival, Ananízio, Tadeu, Jason and Dilermano, and the reserves were Odival, Paulo César, Bolinha, Orlandino, João Oliveira, Padeirinho Dewson and Nena. In 1986, after a poor campaign, Ypiranga was relegated to the Second Division of Campeonato Amapaense. However, the team won the second division in 1987, returning to the first division in 1988."
"In 1991, under the administration of the chairman Luiz Góes, Ypiranga became a professional team. In 1992, Ypiranga reached its first professional competition title, after winning the state championship. The players of that team were Maurício, Zé Preta, Ponga, Cid and Neirivaldo, Edgar, Edvaldo and Serginho, Tiaguinho, Miranda and Jorginho Macapá, managed by Dadá Maravilha, who had won the 1970 World Cup as a player."
"Ypiranga's home stadium is Estádio Milton Corrêa, usually known as Zerão, inaugurated in 1990, with a maximum capacity of 5,000 people. It is famous for having its halfway line positioned exactly over the Equator."
"Ypiranga's logo is uncommon, because it features a church's tower. This church's tower is located at Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, which is a church located in Trem neighborhood. The club's nickname, Clube da Torre, is also a reference to the church's tower, and means ""Tower Club"" in English.

"Shakespeare Santa Cruz was founded in 1981 and performed annually on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Plays by Shakespeare and other great dramatists were performed indoors on the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage and outdoors in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. Bringing in professional actors, directors and designers from throughout the country, the Company's season ran from July to early September and presented three or four plays that ran concurrently in repertory six days a week (no performance on Mondays). With a mission to “cultivate the imagination, wit, daring, and vision that the greatest playwrights demand of artists and audiences alike,"" SSC sought to present a festival of theatre which showcased contemporary approaches to directing, designing and acting. Attendance grew from 7,716 people in 1982 to 31,013 in 1992. Since its founding, the company's artistic directors have been Audrey Stanley (1982–86), Michael Edwards (1987–92), Danny Scheie (1993–95), Risa Brainin, Paul Whitworth (1996–2007), and Marco Barricelli (2008–2013). Some of the rising theatre stars who have worked at SSC are: David Aaron Baker, Bryan Cranston, Maria Dizzia, Dan Donohue, Caitlin FitzGerald, Richard Gunn, Peter Jacobson, Carrie Preston, Reg Rogers, and Michael Stuhlbarg."
"In 1997, Artistic Director Paul Whitworth introduced the SSC annual Winter Holiday season. In keeping with the tradition of Shakespeare Santa Cruz’s fresh take on the classics, the holiday shows were original musicals written for SSC by playwright Kate Hawley with music composed by Gregg Coffin, Craig Bohmler and Adam Wernick. A fusion of the traditions of the British pantomime and the American musical, ""Cinderella"", ""Gretel and Hansel"", ""The Princess and the Pea"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" were based on traditional fairy tales and appeal to audiences of all ages. The winter season performed in November and December."
"In addition to the summer repertory season and the holiday show, Shakespeare Santa Cruz had two performance programs which sought to engage student actors with Shakespearean and other classical texts---the summer Fringe show and the Shakespeare to Go program. The Fringe show was an opportunity for the summer Company's acting interns to perform their own production in the Glen two nights each summer. Past productions included ""Lysistrata"", ""The Antipodes"", ""Fools in the Forest"", and ""The Mock-Tempest"". Shakespeare to Go was an educational engagement program—and recipient of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding—featuring University of California Santa Cruz Theater Arts students who toured local schools in the spring performing one-hour versions of one of the full-length plays to be featured in the summer repertory season. Additionally, Shakespeare to Go presented a limited number of free public performances."
"The festival was responsible for supporting itself, but had recently run deficits which were paid by the University of California. In 2008, with California's budget crisis having resulted in reduced funding, the university could no longer afford to cover these debts. An agreement was reached that if the theater could raise $300,000, it could continue operation. Within 10 days of the agreement's announcement, over $400,000 was raised. Claiming continuing financial problems, however, the UCSC Arts Division dean announced several years later that Shakespeare Santa Cruz would end after its 2013 holiday production."
"Following this announcement, the theater company began a campaign to raise money to become an independent company. By February 2014, they raised over $1 million (USD) through crowdfunding to continue on without the financial support of the university. In March 2014, the new company changed its name to Santa Cruz Shakespeare."

While swimming for the Cornhuskers, Kalmikovs received a total of nine All-American honors, captured three Big 12 Conference titles, and held four school records in the 100 and 200-yard breaststroke. At the 2000 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, during his junior year, Kalmikovs posted a sixth-fastest time of 2:10.64 in the 200-yard breaststroke, where Ed Moses set a new world record. In his senior season, Kalmikovs served as an assistant volunteer coach for the team before he graduated from the University in 2001 with a bachelor of arts degree in international affairs."
"Kalmikovs made his official debut, along with his sister Margarita Kalmikova, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He failed to reach the top 16 final in two out of his three attempts, finishing twenty-first in the 200 m individual medley (2:06.16), and eighteenth in the 400 m individual medley (4:28.04). In his third attempt, 200 m breaststroke, Kalmikovs powered home with a thirteenth-place effort in the B-Final at 2:16.23."
"At the 1998 FINA World Championships in Perth, Australia, Kalmikovs placed twenty-second in the 200 m breaststroke (2:21.22), and thirty-eighth in the 200 m individual medley (2:10.28), all from the prelims."
"At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Kalmikovs decided to drop half of his medley double, and experiment instead with 100 m breaststroke. He achieved FINA B-standards of 1:04.89 (100 m breaststroke), 2:16.30 (200 m breaststroke), and 2:04.83 (200 m individual medley) from the European Championships in Helsinki. On the first day of the Games, Kalmikovs placed thirty-fourth in the 100 m breaststroke. Swimming in heat four, he enjoyed a sprint finish with Puerto Rico's Arsenio López, as they both hit the wall first in a matching time of 1:04.02. Three days later, in the 200 m breaststroke, Kalmikovs established a new Latvian record of 2:16.21 to pull off a nineteenth-place effort from the heats, but missed the semifinal cut by more than half a second (0.50). In his final event, 200 m individual medley, Kalmikovs placed twenty-fourth on the morning prelims. Swimming again in heat four, he came up short in second place by 0.11 of a second behind New Zealand's Dean Kent in a lifetime best of 2:04.18."
"At the 2001 FINA World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Kalmikovs competed only in a breaststroke double. He failed to produce best results for the semifinals in any of his individual events, finishing thirty-fifth in the 100 m breaststroke (1:05.36), and twenty-first in the 200 m breaststroke (2:19.23)."
"Kalmikovs also sought his bid for his third Olympics in Athens, but forced to drop out from the Games, because of a wrist injury. Shortly after his qualifying bid, he announced his retirement from swimming."
"Since he graduated from the University of Nebraska in 2001, Kalmikovs continued to serve as an assistant swimming coach. He completed his master's degree in sports management and athletic administration at Valparaiso University in 2003, and later moved to California to coach numerous age group swimmers for Bakersfield Swim Club. He was awarded the 2004 Central California Coach of the Year after a few of his swimmers won USA Junior National Championships."
"Since his sporting career ended in 2004, Kalmikovs has extensively traveled across the United States and Europe, working as a swimming coach. He is married to Australian swimmer Joy Symons, and currently resided together in Rockhampton, Queensland, along with their two children Jett and Cooper."

Wolfram Euler (born 5 May 1950) is a German historical linguist and Indo-Europeanist.
"Euler gained his doctorate (Ph.D.) in 1979 at Gießen university (Prof. Rolf Hiersche) with a theses on parallels in nominal formation between Indo-Iranian languages and Greek. The study was received as a contribution to the identification of Greek being part of the phylogenetic Eastern group of indoeuropean languages, despite of the Western geographic location of Greece. Up until today, Euler has published about 80 scientific articles and books covering most branches of the Indoeuropean languages; major contributions refer to the Baltic, Indo-Iranian, Greek and Germanic languages."

"The album was produced by Ed Buller at ICP Studios in Brussels, Belgium"
"On 18 August 2013, the album debuted at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart."
"In an interview with ""NME"" in January 2013, bassist Charles Cave said that the album was the band's most melodic record, but continued the definitive White Lies sound. The album follows a story of a couple who leave a provincial area for a big city and, according to Cave, the idea of equality in a relationship is a recurring theme."
"""Big TV"" was the first White Lies album to feature 12 rather than 10 tracks, two of which (""Space I"" and ""Space II"") are instrumental interludes."
"The album was released as both as a regular CD and a deluxe 2CD hardback book edition, featuring seven original demos of songs from the album and stills from the studio sessions. The Japanese version included the seven demos from the hardback book edition as well as a remix of ""There Goes Our Love Again"", all on one disc.

Wazir Mohammad (born 22 December 1929) is a former Pakistani banker and cricketer who played in 20 Test matches from 1952 to 1959.
"Wazir was a determined middle-order batsman with a strong defence. His highest Test score was 189, in the Fifth Test against West Indies at Port of Spain in 1957-58, when he batted for six and three-quarter hours and laid the foundation for Pakistan's innings victory. He was Pakistan's top-scorer with 42 not out when they won by 24 runs against England at The Oval in 1954. His first-class career extended from 1950 to 1964, when he captained Karachi Whites to a narrow defeat in the final of the 1963-64 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. He was appointed to captain the Pakistan Eaglets team of young players on their tour of England in 1963; 14 of the 18 players on the tour became Test cricketers, and four became Test captains."
"Wazir worked as a banker, mostly with the National Bank of Pakistan. His younger brothers Hanif, Mushtaq and Sadiq also played Test cricket for Pakistan. With the death of Israr Ali on 1 February 2016, Wazir became Pakistan's oldest living Test cricketer."
= = = Robert Stephenson and Company = = =
Robert Stephenson and Company was a locomotive manufacturing company founded in 1823. It was the first company set up specifically to build railway engines.
"The company was set up in 1823 in Forth Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England by George Stephenson, his son Robert, with Edward Pease and Thomas Richardson. The manager of the works between 1824 and 1825 was James Kennedy."
"The company's first engine was ""Locomotion No 1"", which opened the Stockton and Darlington, followed by three more: ""Hope"", ""Black Diamond"", and ""Diligence"". Their vertical cylinders meant these locomotives rocked excessively and at the Hetton colliery railway Stephenson had introduced ""steam springs"" which had proved unsatisfactory. In 1828 he introduced the ""Experiment"" with inclined cylinders, which improved stability, and meant that it could be mounted on springs. Originally four wheeled, it was modified for six and another example, ""Victory"", was built. Around this time, two locomotives were built for America. The first, a four coupled loco named ""America"", was ordered by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. The second, six-coupled and named ""Whistler"", was built for the Boston and Providence Rail Road in 1833."
"In 1829, the company built a new, experimental locomotive to enter in the Rainhill Trials. Rocket had two notable improvements — a multi-tube boiler and a separate firebox. Rocket won the trials and convinced the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to use steam locomotives on their railway, and to order these locomotives from Robert Stephenson & Co. Rocket's cylinder were originally angled at an angle of 45 degrees, but were later moved to be horizontal."
"The ""Invicta"" was the twentieth Robert Stephenson & Co. locomotive, and was built for the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. Its cylinders were inclined, but moved to the front end. In 1830 came the ""Planet"" class with the cylinders inside the frames, followed by the ""Patentee"", which added a pair of trailing wheels for greater stability with a larger boiler. This 2-2-2 design became the pattern for most locomotives, by a variety of manufacturers, for many years."
"The locomotive ""John Bull"", built in 1831, was originally of the ""Planet"" type, but was later modified. It survives and is now in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and is claimed to be the oldest still functional self-propelled vehicle."
"The increased distance travelled by many trains highlighted problems with the fireboxes and chimneys. With the co-operation of the North Midland Railway at their Derby works, he measured the temperature of the exhaust gases, and decided to lengthen the boilers on future engines. Initially these ""long-boiler"" engines were 2-2-2 designs, but in 1844, Stephenson moved the trailing wheel to the front in 4-2-0 formation, so that the cylinders could be mounted between the supporting wheels. It was one of these, the ""Great A"" along with another from the North Midland Railway, which was compared with Brunel's ""Ixion"" in the gauge trials in 1846. In 1846 he added a pair of trailing wheels - the first with eight wheels. Another important innovation in 1842 was the Stephenson link motion."
"Robert Stephenson and Company built a number of Crampton type locomotives for the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. These were all of 4-2-0 wheel arrangement with inside cylinders and indirect drive. The inside cylinders drove a crankshaft located in front of the firebox and the crankshaft was coupled to the driving wheels by outside rods. They were unsuccessful on the LCDR, and the five ""Echo"" class locomotives were rebuilt as conventional 4-4-0 locomotives after only four years of service."
"The first railway proposal in Egypt came about when Pasha Muhammad Ali asked the British engineer T.H. Galloway to design a railway in 1834. Instructions to make it followed in 1836. Materials were delivered but little real construction followed. No Ottoman ""firwan"" (permission) was issued and the French objected. Progress was really made when in 1849 Muhammad Ali died, and in 1851 his grandson Abbas I of Egypt contracted Robert Stephenson to build Egypt's first standard gauge railway. The first section, between Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast and Kafr el-Zayyat on the Rosetta branch of the Nile was opened in 1854. This was the first railway in the Ottoman Empire as well as Africa and the Middle East. In the same year Abbas died and was succeeded by Sa'id Pasha, in whose reign the section between Kafr el-Zayyat and Cairo was completed in 1856 followed by an extension from Cairo to Suez in 1858. This completed the first modern transport link between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, as Ferdinand de Lesseps did not complete the Suez Canal until 1869."
"At Kafr el-Zayyat the line between Cairo and Alexandria originally crossed the Nile with an 80 feet (24 m) car float. This was the single largest project of the South Street Works. However, on 15 May 1858 a special train conveying Sa'id's heir presumptive Ahmad Rifaat Pasha fell off the float into the river and the prince was drowned. Stephenson therefore replaced the car float with a swing bridge nearly long."
The Egyptian connections to Robert Stephenson were very considerable and a wealth of consequential artefacts are in Cairo Railway Museum. This includes what could well be the single most extravagant piece built by the Robert Stephenson Works. This is works number 1295 of 1862 whose artistic design was by Matthew Digby Wyatt. This 2-2-4T for the Egyptian Railways survives with all its fantastical marquetry in the Egyptian Railway Museum at Cairo. It is called the Khedive's Train.
"Over the remainder of the century, the company prospered in the face of increasing competition, supplying railways at home and abroad. By 1899 around 3000 locomotives had been built and a new limited liability company was formed, Robert Stephenson and Company Limited and the works was moved to Darlington, the first locomotive leaving the shop in 1902."
"Most railways in Britain were building their own rolling stock, so most of the output was for export, from 4-4-0's for the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway to GS (4-6-0) and HS (2-8-0) classes for the Bengal Nagpur Railway. These preceded the slightly larger BESA standard designs for the Indian railways. The works built the first British 2-10-0 for the Argentine Great Western Railway in 1905."
"During World War I, the company devoted itself to munitions work. However, between 1917 and 1920, a large batch of ROD 2-8-0 and SNCV type 18 0-6-0 tram locomotives were ordered by the War Office for use on the continent. From then on, business was slack, for various reasons. Notable were thirty 2-6-0 mixed traffic locomotives for the GWR in 1921, a batch of thirty 0-6-0 tank engines for the LNER and five 7F 2-8-0s for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. In 1936 and 1937, only forty six were built, including eleven B17 class (""Sandringham"") 4-6-0s for the LNER, and seven 2-6-4 passenger tank locomotives for the South Indian Railway Company."
"In 1937, the company merged with the locomotive interests of Hawthorn Leslie and Company to form Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns Limited. The company's shipbuilding activities continuing separately. Main line locomotives continued to be built at Darlington, while industrial engines were built at Hawthorne Leslie's works at Forth Bank, Newcastle. in 1938 the goodwill of the Kitson and Manning Wardle companies was bought."

= = = Ileocecal valve = = =
"The ileocecal valve (ileal papilla, ileocaecal valve, Tulp's valve, Tulpius valve, Bauhin's valve, ileocecal eminence, valve of Varolius or colic valve) is a sphincter muscle valve that separates the small intestine and the large intestine. Its critical function is to limit the reflux of colonic contents into the ileum. Approximately two liters of fluid enters the colon daily through the ileocecal valve."
The ileocecal valve is distinctive because it is the only site in the gastrointestinal tract that is used for vitamin B12 and bile acid absorption.
"The histology of the ileocecal valve shows an abrupt change from a villous mucosa pattern of the ileum to a more colonic mucosa. A thickening of the muscularis mucosa, which is the smooth muscle tissue found beneath the mucosal layer of the digestive tract. A thickening of the muscularis externa is also noted."
There is also a variable amount of lymphatic tissue found at the valve.
The ileocecal valve has a papillose structure.
"During colonoscopy, the ileocecal valve is used, along with the appendiceal orifice, in the identification of the cecum. This is important as it indicates that a complete colonoscopy has been performed. The ileocecal valve is typically located on the last fold before entry into the cecum, and can be located from the direction of curvature of the appendiceal orifice, in what is known as the bow and arrow sign."
"Intubation of the ileocecal valve is typically performed in colonoscopy to evaluate the distal, or lowest part of the ileum. Small bowel endoscopy can also be performed by double-balloon enteroscopy through intubation of the ileocecal valve."
"Tumors of the ileocecal valve are rare, but have been reported in the literature."
"It was described by the Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp (1593–1674), and thus it is sometimes known as Tulp's valve."
"The valve was also described in 1588 by Gaspard Bauhin—hence the name Bauhin's Valve or Valve of Bauhin—in the preface of his first writing, ""De corporis humani partibus externis tractatus, hactenus non editus."""
= = = Dino Alfieri = = =
Edoardo Alfieri (first name usually shortened to Dino; 8 December 1886 – 12 December 1966) was an Italian fascist politician and diplomat.
"Alfieri was born in Bologna. In 1911 he finished law studies and soon after joined the nationalist group formed by Enrico Corradini. A volunteer in World War I, he was critical of the merger between Corradini's group and Benito Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF). Nonetheless, he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the PNF list in 1924."
"Under Mussolini's government, Alfieri was assigned several tasks: between 1929 and 1934, he was co-director of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, deputy secretary of the ""Corporazioni"", and deputy secretary for Press and Propaganda from 1935, assuming the duties of Minister Galeazzo Ciano during the latter's mission in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. When Ciano moved on to become Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dino Alfieri found himself appointed Minister of People's Culture in 1937, and declared himself to the Antisemitical racial segregation laws passed in 1938."
"He was Italy's envoy to the Holy See starting 7 November 1939, and five months later to Nazi Germany (where he often met Adolf Hitler). While there, he was constantly helping out Italian workers and consulate staff. As the war progressed and Italy needed help, he attempted to solicit material aid from Germany but despite assurances little came of it. When the war began to deteriorate for the Axis, he wrote communiques and expressed verbally to Mussolini that the Germans simply saw Italy as a buffer state from the encroaching allies and urged the Duce to seek peace with the allies while simultaneously assuring the Germans that Italy was not betraying them. He was urgently called to Rome in 1943 by members of the Grand Council in order to participate in a meeting. It is unclear as to whether he truly realized what was being proposed at the meeting. A member of the Grand Council of Fascism, he supposedly supported Dino Grandi's coup d'état in July 1943, that led to the fall from power of the Italian Fascist government after 21 years and the arrest of Mussolini. When the Wehrmacht occupied Italy (see Operation Achse), Alfieri fled to Switzerland to save his life."
"In January 1944, he was sentenced to death ""in absentia"" by a kangaroo court during the Verona trial. The Swiss government did not give him political asylum, but tolerated his attendance in Switzerland."
"On 12 November 1946, an Italian court stated his innocence; on 6 February 1947, an inquiry of the Italian Foreign Ministry ended. Then, he was officially pensioned off."
"""Cherry, Cherry"" is a song written, composed, and recorded in February - March 1966 by American musician Neil Diamond. The song (originally intended as a demo) was arranged by Artie Butler and produced by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich. It was issued as a 45 single in 1966 and became Diamond's first big hit, reaching #6 on both the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart, in October 1966, and the ""Cash Box"" chart. Ellie Greenwich came up with the chorus and can be heard as the prominent background voice, accompanied by Jeff Barry. Neil Diamond has stated that the song was inspired by an early relationship with a significantly older woman."
"In 1973 a live recording of ""Cherry, Cherry"" was issued as a 45 single from the Neil Diamond live album ""Hot August Night"" (1972). The live version hit #24 on the ""Cash Box"" chart and #31 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart."
"""Rolling Stone"" would later label ""Cherry, Cherry"" as ""one of the greatest three-chord songs of all time."""
"Session guitarist Al Gorgoni (who later played on ""The Sound of Silence"" by Simon & Garfunkel and ""Brown Eyed Girl"" by Van Morrison) contributed to the song."
"Two versions of ""Cherry, Cherry"" have been released. The version familiar to most listeners was recorded in late January 1966 and released by Bang Records in mid-1966, and was recorded as a demo, with Butler on keyboards, and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich on backing vocals and hand-claps. The other version, with different lyrics and originally intended to be released as the single, was finally released by Diamond and Sony Music Entertainment in 1996 on the compilation album ""In My Lifetime""."

"Currently, the DPS system is used by online shops for product delivery as an alternative to regular post services. Private customers can send their packages through the system as well and pay for the delivery on the spot with a debit or credit card. The system also encompasses an SMS-based notification system notifying clients when an item has been delivered. SmartPOST's solution was implemented in April 2009."
"Unlike other similar systems (such as the Packstation solution in Germany), SmartPOST has placed its Delivery Point Solution indoors (e.g. in shopping malls), making them convenient to use even with bad weather. In July 2009, SmartPOST reported it is in negotiations with an Italian company interested in licensing SmartPOST's Delivery Point Solution for usage in Italy."
Currently SmartPOST is servicing roughly two hundred distant selling companies and online shops in Estonia.
"During its first year of operation, SmartPOST reported a 13.8 million EEK (about 1.2 million USD) turnover with an 8.3 million ($740,000 USD) profit loss. SmartPOST's member of board Antti Oolup said that the loss was expected and planned, with monthly profits planned for the end of 2009. SmartPOST reported that over 33 thousand packages were sent through its service in Estonia in December 2009."
"SmartPOST was chosen as the Logistics Deed 2009 at the annual Purchase Management and Logistics Conference. At the end of 2009, SmartPOST also reported that it will expand its business to Finland. Currently, only one-way packages can be sent from Estonia."
"In November 2010, SmartPOST's CEO position was taken over from Indrek Oolup by Risto Eelmaa."
"In October 2009, Estonia's national postal company Eesti Post filed a complaint with the Estonian Consumer Union, claiming that SmartPOST's television advertisements were damaging the reputation of Eesti Post and also ""calling viewers up to violence against elderly people"". SmartPOST responded that the claim was untrue and damaging reputation or calls for violence were not their intention."
"In July 2010, the Estonian Development Fund (majority shareholder in SmartPOST) sold its share to the Finnish postal service and logistics company Itella. Raivo Vare, Head of the Estonian Development fund commented on the sale, saying: ""Risk investment is a field where there are few success stories, but SmartPOST is definitely one of them. Sale of SmartPOST is even better than it looks."" The Estonian Development Fund reportedly earned €1.3 million from sale of SmartPOST."
"Production and intellectual rights for the Delivery Point Solution remains in the hands of Cleveron, a separate entity from SmartPOST."
