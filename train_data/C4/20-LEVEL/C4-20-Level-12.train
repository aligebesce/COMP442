Well they've switched the wa water in for a motor.
"Come on, eat it sunshine."

I thought it was the  Cup Final.
"No, that was this afternoon."
Oh!
Mum.
Mhm?
I don't want these carrots.
A after I've eaten this carrot can I give up?
"Well, eat the carrot."
And do you think you can manage some broccoli and some of those peppers please?
I can't.
You really can't?
Well drink your orange juice then.
And eat the carrot?
"Eat your carrot as well, yes."
Eat your carrot and drink your orange juice.
Please.
I've just squeezed that for you.
You need all the vitamins you can get with your cold.
And you can't manage that broccoli as well?
Alright.
"I don't mind you leaving your chicken, but I'd rather you ate your vegetables please."
As much as you can.
Why not?
Cos we were messing about.
What he say when he er heard himself?
He were killing his sides a laughing.
"Cos I, I says to Sarah go on we'll have a listen to it and we stopped it  anyway I says I'll t I'll take it off if you want, he says no leave it."
"He says you crafty pair of sods he says, Sarah knew all about that didn't she?"
"I says yeah  I says she told me to do it, I says and then  let you listen to it."
"He says nah leave it, he says any case he says this thing you get he says now you've got my voice he says  do I get some of it ?"
I says no you don't.
No I get t tape recorder.
You and that tape recorder!
"I get the Walkman, I get the Walkman, I do."
You can't have it.
Why not?
Cos it don't belong to us.
"No but I'll, if I say it on every tape she might get the hint."
It don't belong to her.
Dunnit?
No does it heck.
"It belongs to that company, that"
"Alright, when company hear it I might get the bleeding tape"
they're not frigging hard up.
All you want that tape for is cos it's got a microphone innit?
Yours ain't got a microphone.
Mine int as good.
I thought yours were same make.
Ah that's got a radio on
"It's got a radio on, yeah."
Yeah.
I'll buy you one.
"It depends where I can spend voucher, I'll buy you one with voucher, how's that?"
So I'm not having that one then?
"Crumbly, is it?"
"I got it from, I don't know, I got it from Holston's and I haven't had any from there before."
I went into that Roberses the delicatessen part
Mm.
"and er  they were queuing up there so I couldn't be bothered  standing in the queue, so I didn't."
Didn't get it from there?
I didn't stay there for that.
"Mm, that's distinctive isn't it  the smoked one!"
Mm.
Very nice!
I haven't had  this  particular one before but we used to get  a little used to be able to get it in little  about
Yeah.
"tha , that big  and er  no, I expect the"
"It's on    don't, they reckon they can make Cheshire anywhere now can't they?"
"No, it's not what it used to be."
There must be somebody who can get it?
Get what?
Cheshire cheese is not  necessarily  indigenous to Cheshire now.
"Oh  what,wha"
They make it in lots of places.
you mean it's been made in Devon
No
and called Cheshire cheese?
"Well I don't know about Devon, I'm not sure."
"No, I I do , I think it's erm"
Only made in Cheshire?
I would have thought so.
You mean they're using the recipe somewhere else?
Yes.
Oh.
Making and you
I don't think so.
I still haven't a clue of what er the
"the pamphlet, it's far too complicated for me."
She's like that.
"I mean, she's really sweet."
Mm mm.
I'm very careful never  to admire things or enthuse about things.
Because she's likely to give them to you?
Because she's likely to give them to you.
"I mean, she knows I love Gardenia"
Mm mm.
and because she was in  Mustique  and hadn't bought me a birthday present  she made sure that there were two Gardenia plants at the party that night she bought me.
Really?
She's like that.
Mm.
She knows we love the pink champagne.
Mm mm.
The brand is in.
And it's not  kind of standard champagne in the place  but she always keeps a supply.
Always has champagne.
Got any champagne at home?
Get another bottle of that.
He must be running low.
"You see I, I mean I know obviously the perks don't outweigh all that, er, at least you do get some perks."
"At least you know, she can be generous and"
Yes.
But she can be absolutely demonic  there's no doubt about that.
She really can.
Mm.
And she drives you insane!
"Well like you said last time, I think only a man can put up with her."
Mm.
That's probably why she got through so many women.
And plotting them?
Mm.
Have you been erm
Speed-type graphs.
Mhm.
Good.
"Aha, have you been asked, erm what is this?"
"Here's a graph, now guess the equation?"
No.
No.
Okay.
"You don't really need to, but it's, there usually isn't time to cover it, cos you've got other things, but it gives you a much better feel for it if you, if you see the other side of the picture all the time."
"That you're not just in isolation, looking at one little thing, because you can miss a lot."
"Erm you might think that all graphs always look like that, or bits of graphs are always like that, or where does it all tie in?"
Distance time graphs.
One of those on every exam so far.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you happy with those?
Er I think so yeah..
Okay.
"What's, what's happening here then?"
This is a good way
We do them in physics.
Oh lovely.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
I
"Right, that's erm as time goes on along there,"
Mhm.
"this is displacement, which is the distance from a fixed position."
And I ate me butty there on top.
In the pouring bloody rain and howling wind I expect.
"It was, yeah  it was horrible ."
So then I just had a drive round all the sites.
Did you find them all alright?
Yeah.
I know where I'm going now with er all of them.
"You know and getting to them, I know how to get from one to the other  without going, you know?"
All round the houses.
I've got a good idea of where everywhere is.
So I was quite pleased.
Mm.
When I got back  ooh  you know I told you about that job?
We've put a bid in for Arrow Park.
Mm.
Rob thinks we've got it.
Oh god.
Winning some bloody jobs aren't you.
"What have they done, dropped their prices?"
Well Rob's doing them isn't he?
Oh they have had to drop their prices.
"They've had to  go for the  we did them a few sort of quotes on the survey side of this Arrow Park  and er  we've gotta, you know, really stick to this tight budget because it's the only way you can get them no matter what people are telling you  erm  about the recession being over, people still want things for nothing."
So  this survey might have to be done at the beginning of April.
But it's not a big one so
"Well when's these in Caernarvon, the end of April?"
Starting the twenty seventh of April.
It's the weekend after  's wedding?
Yeah.
So I shall be enjoying myself at  the wedding
Mm.
ready for my hard slog.
Eh?
and it  ah
Ah but
"but yeah, I know but the"
well this is the
This is the way the government's gotta act now!
"Ah well, well this is it"
"Well this is it it, it has to be done!"
They won't!
Generated the
This is the trouble
It's a joke!
this is the trouble with this country  because it's has has
I mean look at Germany!
"Yeah, but I mean they will make progress, I mean this colony"
And
is  would never
Mm.
advance!
I mean that's why we lost our moto er  motorcycle industry
Yeah.
"it's why we've lost most of our industry  because they won't, they won't invest in new machinery or mo , new methods!"
Modernisation.
I mean they've
Just won't look ahead!
You see it's the same as they said on there  we've had all these inventions
and they get  by our country.
"and they get, they get  in this country  and then they go and exploit them in another country!"
Mm.
So where's the
Computer's the  finest example of that  produced
But
in Manchester!
But he looked so little.
Looked so raw round his rear end.
"But she, she's restructured his insides."
The muscle had wasted with the pressure of the double hernia.
The muscle had sort of disintegrated almost.
She's had to use what muscle she can to restructure his bowel.
She's a marvellous surgeon.
It's  of money  isn't it?
Well the bill's nearly three hundred pound.
Oh oh!
Jesus!
Now that wouldn't be feasible in your case because .
So what we'd have to do is trade him in
Ooh ah.
It's better my back.
It's in my lower back.
"I think it's where it's been, been higher up I think it's more"
Being what?
Well I've been holding it to save it.
Yes.
That's why you should have aspirin to relax it.
Cos it helps it mend.
Ooh.
I feel as if I want to  it hurts and I feel as if I want to move it.
Yes.
He's told me be very bloody careful cos it can go out just like that.
But he did tell you to move?
Oh yes but very very gently.
He said tell it you're going to move.
Don't do anything sudden.
Tell it you're gonna move.
I like the way he puts it.
Yeah.
Well people do that here though don't they?
Se sell them to Africa and places  yeah .
alright if it doesn't rain actually so it wouldn't matter if they didn't have treads on er  treads on the tyres if it's dry it doesn't really matter you just go round slicks and
I think could chop them up and use them to make road surfaces with.
Yeah but percentages is
Mm.
At least you know they can do it!
Mm that's right.
Oh they can do quite a lot of it.
"I mean even the, the su surface out of the play in playgrounds ."
Mm.
I can never quite work out why that .
most roads
"So, so far I've got two coffees here and one tea."
Anybody else for anything?
I'll have a coffee please.
Coffee?
Black please.
Black coffee.
White.
White.
White.
So we've got about six weeks in which to do this.
So how many weeks
I mean there's no  excuse I   all the jobs are quite quickly done  aren't they?
Yeah.
So what  we ought to have a deadline for collect collecting the information.
And then get together
Yeah.
to put it together.
And then decide on
Mm
that you could use
Okay.
and erm  er that's what I used if you want to borrow that you can.
Thanks.
"And do it in pencil and just, and then we can  rub it out"
yes.
"and change things and so on, yeah."
Well it's easy to change isn't it?
Because presumably Peter will need to incorporate that  in an overall programme.
When we look at the highway side.
So it's just the traffic side which I'm dealing with here?
Yes.
Cos that's all I'm dealing with.
Okay and perhaps erm  perhaps you'd also like to l would you like to look at this side of things as well?
Incorporate that into it?
"No, the, the layout plans, do, do some layout plans."
Oh yeah sure.
Marty's done them before you see haven't you?
Yep.
"So I'm, I'm just trying to look at the ones for   and then we'll go from there."
"Okay, is that alright?"
Yeah.
"Now, have I given either of you task schedules for this"
No.
stuff?
So  I need to do that don't I?
Er  in fact I never gave  telephone call  it's no good telling me to do something
"Task schedules,ooh   I'll have to get the form."
"Okay, so you want a task schedule for doing  doing the traffic report?"
Mhm.
Mm yeah?
"And Michael es , and Michael especially."
Mm mm.
But
Cos I do chicken with ginger which
Th
is really nice.
"Chicken, ginger"
Oh do you?
and cashew nuts.
Oh!
You haven't given that to me.
With root ginger or powdered ginger.
It's root ginger.
It's delicious!
Very strong.
Cos it's very subtle.
But it's in a
Oh I
packet is it?
It's actually very subtle.
Mhm.
It's delicious.
"So many people  when they eat it, they can't actually  decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger."
Yes.
It's very subtle.
I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle.
Cos she takes about two pounds of root ginger  peels it
Really?
and chops it
and puts it with a pound of  Philadelphia cheese into the cavity of the chicken  outside  it's just lightly rubbed with oil
Mm mm.
and then about two ounces of powdered ginger  sprinkled over it.
Yeah.
Ooh I put loads of weight on out there.
"And then you've got all the outskirts around that, you know?"
"Cos you're talking about thirty, forty mile."
I'm supposed to be trying to watch me weight now.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's massive.
"I've er, I've lost about a stone in  a couple of months or so, that's all, but it's er  better than gaining I suppose."
Back to where I started I think.
"Unless you've got two pictures of that same street, no"
"No, you're back to where you started."
This is
Rocetta Clive.
Mm.
Funny little place.
Ah.
Right Rocetta Now where's this?
"Oh this is the palace  this is the, the  Monte Casino This is where"
It's the abbey
The abbey at Monte Casino Do you remember
Oh I've heard about the abbey  yeah.
the war film.
You know where it all got bombed
Yeah.
and what they took all the treasures down into the  cellars so they were saved and they rebuilt it.
"In the same style as it was years ago, using some of their old bricks and everything that they could but  it's been"
Yeah.
rebuilt in the same style and all the treasures are still there.
"Yeah it's amazing, all these"
I've seen the film of this where they're trying to g and all around from outside you can see the graves  the graveyard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, it didn't give you much chance then to get used to it did it?"
I mean you know
No.
"I just, I just got seven films and I said well if they  Friday if I don't, well"
Well they worked good didn't they?
"There's some that are a bit, you know"
"No, they're, they're alright."
They're nice.
They're good photos they are.
This reminds me of when we went round Versailles.
That's all painted ceilings and
Yeah.
"This is like in a big glass case and it's  other parts , there's like a little bit there looks like the nativity and then the rest is all parts of Naples in olden times."
It shows you the
Ooh.
the .
"And you walk round this glass case, it's all different"
"But the curtains, it says please don't touch, if you touch them they'd fall to bits, they're that old."
Yeah.
"Oh yeah, Tony was saying."
They're hundreds of years old aren't they?
Yeah.
"And look this, this room, you've got the  it was all like this, all gold filigree, it was all over."
Yeah.
"The ceilings, all down the walls  furniture."
Ooh it was

"Throne room, yeah."
It was wonderful.
Mm.
And that's
You doing the bottle banks?
who's doing the bottle banks?
Yeah.
Thanks ever so much.
Because er  Caroline  once wanted one in a school and we weren't allowed to have it.
No I won't thank you.
Well there's one at erm  .
The erm wine merchant.
You know erm the one down the bottom of Thorley Hill.
"Well they were, they were sort of  advertising er  giving you money back."
. I don't know if
Down in the er
Yeah.
Can you find out more ?
And also we do
quite a few we can write at the bottom  er for more inf if you have any more information or something in small print
Mm.
please contact and then  we can do the next few hundred
"The thing is you can, you can change them very easily."
Ya.
That means you can er pay for it easier.
I wouldn't print more than three hundred for a start.
So if we get further information we can always  if not we can just get printed.
That's very impressive isn't it?
That's that   council of environment .
No sorry.
Council's environment advisory committee.
Oh that must be that must be the one  er

She's probably saying oh this is so boring this conversation but when she gets to our age that'll be the same.
Well  well she'll just she'll just go silver.
She was silver when she was little so  I suppose she'll go back to silver.
Anything else you want to look at Dinda?
No I don't think so.
It's probably about quarter to

Hello love.
We'll grab this casserole because  erm
Hopefully I won't

"So she said  quite right, she said he's done nothing but bully you lot ever since you've been children!"
"So she said and I felt very proud of my son, ah I said I wouldn't want a son of mine who said that to his father!"
No.
I wouldn't of wanted it.
"Well no, but on the other hand  you know"
"Yeah but all said and done Geoff, they are his fa , he is their father."
"Well when  and he wasn't on  he wasn't on, but he he at the  towards the end  they gave the three of them  thirty seconds to describe the go , you know, the qualities of  of the"
Of a good leader.
of of of er  their leader
Mm.
"and  the one  one for the Libs  he only used twenty seconds, twenty two seconds!"
And he finished?
"And, you know  he said  I'm sure Paddy Ashdown would think that you could of found something else  to use the other"
To say.
eight seconds up !
"But er  but  he ended up, you know  as sure as they've asked er the"
something to say
"the show of hands, like he was er  he was the one that the floating voters were"
Yeah.
But
I mean
But only
"He, he looks a very persuasive kind of character doesn't he erm  I mean he's, he's quite sort of erm  well a nice person  well he"
Yeah.

You know!
"Yeah, well"
And this is the mentality of them!
Childish!
"I mean  ha  when it comes down to it, at the end of the day  today  we we live in  er a media orientated world don't we?"
We turn on the box
Well
What's that?
I have never been in there.
You was.
"Me and, you and I was in there on  don't know when, years ago."
Dianne told me the score so  anyway you're like a friend  can go with you.
You're driving.
Ah?
"So in a way, like someone can go with you and all if you want."
Can they?
"Well, look!"
I don't think so Helen.
"I mean, they've dropped that wee girl on her own."
"No, well because I've seen it before."
You think I would do it.
"That wee girl over there, she's riding it."
"They must take two like, you know, that one round the bend there they have bars on."
"Well, well there's arm one you go for, you'll have to."
I don't see how you would learn very much.
No .
"Your first couple of lessons are half an hour take you driving anyway, and by the time you get up there you'd drive onto them."
.
"And, if you haven't been in a car before the driver drives, so you can give me what you owe."
.
Which one's Paul's ?
What?
Ooh!
"Right, we're going in there."
This is good!
Good !
It's Sly.
It is.
Sly?
Why?
Because  how does M Mark know?
"Mark right, he's got up this morning and he's gone to Tenby."
And he's gone to look around Tenby.
While he's gone those men have gone in there.
That's what I mean.
He can't be standing there watching the bloody thing all the time.
No.
But he could put a note on it.
Please leave this fire on.
Please do not touch this fire.
Well they've got to haven't they?
To disconnect the gas.
Oh I thought it was water problems.
Gas.
A gas water heater!
Oh.
They've gotta disconnect the gas to get the water heater off the wall.
And fix it to the
Well Mark will be back there tonight and he can switch it on when he comes home.
Make it his responsibility.
Oh you don't understand!
In the meantime  the men have took the water heater off the wall.
"They've put it from that wall, and they've stuck it on to this wall."
Oh let's connect it up  see if it works.
Now in the meantime there's gas seeping through that fire there with no light.
Oh.
So you've blown your caravan.
"Well then again, there's Mark and Sally."
You could take the mattresses and put them in their caravan in the spare bedroom.
Is there a spare bedroom?
Well no.
What a mistake you made.
Right what are we doing John?
Chairs we're doing today.
"There's six of those to do, now then."
"Yeah  put them in the sale, you know  I'm gonna put them in the sale  see if we can get a few bob  right, pattern first I should imagine."
many people coming to the sales.
I won't let you
"I've only put, I've put stuff in."
Yeah.
You know but
I er never actually
"I, I  I made about sixty quid last year, you know?"
"Oh yes I believe  it gets er quite a lot, it's er  well yesterday there weren't many for that open day."
"But for the sale er  it's well advertised you know and er there's a lot of people seem to know about it, you know connected with the college mainly I suppose, they get their mates to come  ooh there's good stuff  and there is some good stuff, you know?"
Yeah.
So it's er it seems to do pretty well.
"I'll er I'll try to get a few things, make a few bob you know, to"
"don't mind me asking, what would you expect to ?"
Don't know yet.
Well I'm hoping a hundred plus
you know?
Yeah.
"Well christ you've gotta be, I've paid that to be honest"
Yeah
I've paid seventy for the bloody things.
Yeah.

"Yeah, we do a  well of course we,we used to make contact with who, were having a dinner party that we went to."
That's why we do all our entertaining   one at a time.
Why do you only use Marks and Spencers' chickens.
Sheila says they're the best in England.
Really?
She won't have anything else in the hotel.
"If there's a chicken dish in the hotel  chickens don't come from our suppliers, they come from Marks and Spencers."

Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there  and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about.
Well
Yeah.
I thought a computer
"No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are  tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things  unless it's absolutely necessary."
Well
"And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can."
That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging.
I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet.

Because that was er you know  I mean it got the group together
Yeah
I thought because everybody had the same experience.
I liked the experience because I had never done it.
Mm.
what a waste of time.
The number of people I've talked to that  I definitely knew had got  and never knew they had got it.

"Well, he spends more time there than me."
"'Cos I've been this morning and I've cleared fireplace out, washed"
"No, you're not wearing your shoes in here."
"and I've 'oovered up,"
and dusted and polished.
"That kitchen floor could do with washing, I saw a mop, but didn't see no bucket."
"I don't whether she's got one, but I thought, I didn't have time to do it this morning."
Mm.
"So I just run round with 'oover and dusted and polished, then I made a cup of tea."
Who's doing the washing?
Our Margaret.
Ah.
"I can't, our Margaret's drying it on radiators, and I says to Albert, what me mum doing with the dryer."
"He says, I don't know."
It's still there.
So I'm gonna ask her if I can borrow it
It's

Yeah.
and there's a well.
He's got a well.
"And this is really deep ain't it Tone, this bit?"
That's about forty foot down
This is about forty foot down and then it drops again
Oh.
"into a well, where he gets his all, his fresh water from it."
"There's a li he puts a light on and it lights it up down the , a long way down."
But it never ever alters.
"You can draw water out, you can put water in, and the level never ever changes."
Wonderful water.
"It's really nice, ain't it Tone?"
New
No it doesn't.
new camera
"What's happened with that camera, you've"
You
"got to rewind it every time the  better ones now automatically wind, that's what I mean."
You have never sat down  and read
"You have to rewind it, it's a"
all the
problem.
"read all the instructions, the same with the video camera."
You haven't even watched the tape.
When have I had an opportunity to watch the tape?
Oh!
You must have been able to squeeze half an hour sometime or other.
"Anyway, I'm going to get ready or we'll never get the shopping done before you go to work."
Will we?
"Right, I'm ready."
Have you locked the back door?
I thought we were walking?
No.

"No, it's alright."
Are we not?
Okay.
Pardon?

Well do you want to walk or do you want to go in the car?
Well I'll have to go  to the paper shop.
Well I'll drop you at the paper shop while I go round
Oh.
That's a good idea.
"No, it's a can't be in the garden, can he."
Yeah.
Same as with these next door.
I get right upset about Paddy.
"I mean she's give his kennel away now, and he's got no kennel again."
Ar.
"And he's running streets, and you know how cold it was last week, and he's running streets."
"What she give kennel away for, then."
I don't bloody know.
I think she'd give the dog away as well.
Saw him coming.
"Don't lick, don't let him lick her, Karen."
Don't lick.
You mutt
all right.
I've been round me mums this morning.

"And then, er, I said I've just come to see if you want any cigs."
"She said, well our John's coming down tonight, she said, just get me twenty."
"I said, you might as well get forty, I said, because if he's late coming down"
"Yeah, right."
"And he can't round shop after, you'd be stuck, and I mean, he."
"I don't  Albert don't mind going for her cigs, but it's just that we don't get up early in the morning, you know, and if me mum's ringing at eight o'clock in the morning, 'cos she got no cigs."
"It's a bit unfair like, when when she could at"
I said  she said after my job at
Margaret's not very well.
she hadn't seen Margaret since Christmas Eve.
"Yeah, but she ain't been bad since Christmas Eve."
"Oh, no."

"And it's covered in a, in a  po polythene would you say?"
Plastic  or what it is covered?
Cloth.
Cos you couldn't put that by the fire.
Yeah.
It would melt.
It's a cloth cover on it.
But I bet it's plastic inside it.
It's like these cushions isn't it?
It's foam.
Yes.
Foam.
But why was it so damp and cold here then?
Because it's wet and it's damp.
Well plastic doesn't hold the damp.
"It isn't plastic, it's foam!"
"Well the foam, it doesn't"
"Oh god, yes."
Well you couldn't put them in the car could you?
What?
The mattresses.
Mm?
Well I've put the big one in but I know that the rest wouldn't go in.
Mm.
But then the little bedroom wasn't so  didn't seem so damp.
"But you didn't try it did you, really?"
"In that caravan  a caravan's a caravan, call it what you like  but in that caravan that Mark is in  there was that little  room where the w hot water heater is"
Mm.
and there was a hole er on the floor over there with a grating on it that was  you could see through to the ground.
Mm.
"Well if  through the winter months  when there's no fire in there, no nothing in there  the damp is bound to be coming through there."
Mhm.
"and four, four nights overtime."
Mm.
"I couldn't do that, not that I want to."
Do you think the conditions make people kind of like-minded in like the respective politics and things like that?
"Do you think it's sort of, you know, do you hold a lot of views in common with people you work beside or?"
"Not, no, not really."
Not really.
We've got quite a mixture.

"Yeah, it's gone round a bit now."

You're not really given any background either.
Yeah.
So
"Shakespeare always usually gives you a bit of  you know, you just got the two gentleman speaking clear and ."
Yeah.
Exactly.
And we accept those things.
"You know, give us a chance to get into the play and get comfortable on our feet and we'll have a go, well, Johnson doesn't give you that option does he?"
"It's straight in there  there's a fight between three, two men and a woman, you don't know what's going on, they're just abusing each other and  and the picture"

When you've got so much to offer.
Yeah.

That's right.
great big hospitals and forgotten about.
Whereas now
That's right.

A hundred
"A hundred and forty pound,"
"we've paid off in two years, Karen."
How much.
A hundred and forty pound.
In two years.
In two years.
"Now, if that had been a finance company, I would have paid a damn sight more."
But it cost us  thirty seven pound a month.
"But, last year, we put, no wait a minute, last year, we paid 'em four hundred and eight pound fifty two, and they put two hundred and seventy two pound fifty interest on."
"So actually all we paid, was"
"Thirty seven, per cent"
Yeah she was erm  well  necessarily  cos  that day  Blue was working on the other team as well so he had his erm  break at different time.
Yeah.
"And I er  she comes storming out of the canteen  swearing  not at anybody in particular, just at herself really!"
"And then she's seen me, oh what time does Blue finish?"
I said whenever he  about half past three  so erm  so then she come down  Geoff said you gotta finish half past three Blue  my God!.
Oh.

Well like sometimes I'll say to him everybody gonna finish about four  you know
Yeah.
"what happens, then his  she stands there, you bloody  by four  but I mean he finished when I said he was gonna finish  for a change I should think."
I didn't know Julia hadn't been in for a long while.
"No, what's the matter with her?"
"She'd erm  was erm  getting a pie out the oven  and cos some of the juice went on the floor, she wiped it up thinking she'd wiped it up properly and she didn't, she slipped, she's broken  a couple of bones in her foot."
Cor!

Has he?
Yeah  Mr  said have you seen  do it?
"I said, no I haven't."
Well I seen her at  even the other day.

By Saturday normally I see him.
"But, but"
it?
"but I query as well, whether just because you reduce the number of spa passengers in it  that you, you, you don't need  a P S V licence, or the equivalent isn't a P S V licence but it's, it's"
"Oh you do,the they've looked into that."
But it sounds  doubtful to me.
But anyway  there's the insurance point of view.
"But anyway, any  I mean  that's the easy, and I mean, if, if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving  before they take passengers out."
"I mean, I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers."
Yeah.
"I mean I  I, I  I  drove the minibus   with only somebody in with me  before I drove out with people in it."
Didn't you da drive Dancy Dags?
"Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that."
"Yeah, but  yo you drove that one"

Pardon?
"They will be forced for last Sunday, and that was"
Oh I know.

"They're prone for that,little red lights."
Oil filter
Mine is an'all.
Have you got a little red light ?
"Yeah, it keeps flickering on and off."
"On me dad's van, that's a pick-up, when she's"
Yeah.
"been running for about half an hour or so, you know when you come to a junction  flicking on and off."
I thought you were a mechanic.
I am.
Well get rid of your little red light then!
I've done it now .
It'd cost a lot of money.
"What, to get rid of a little red light?"
Yeah.
"Well I would do, I'd walk back for , me."
I'd say it's not on now.
Well me dad's needs an oil pump on it.
Er  and he won't pay out for it  cos he's a bit tight.
Er there's mine needs a few bits and bobs  I can't do it though cos I haven't got enough money.
"Me mum's  me mum's is alright, it's just me dad g keeps saying oh there's these noises  and I'll, and I'll go in it and there's no noise."
But it's
His ears are getting old.

He's supposed to be getting a hearing aid or summat.
Soon as   soon as he starts talking about cars yap yap yap yap yap yap  he doesn't stop.
"Don't worry love it's nice to hear you talk, you carry on."
You're picking on me.
I'm not picking on you.
You're picking on me again.
Picking on me again.
Right.
But they're Portakabins?
"Yeah, rather than caravans."
Yeah.
Now I don't think they sound very   to suit our needs.
Well you have to furnish them as well don't you?
Well that's it.
"And there's all separate, two pound a table  from fifty pence to one pound fifty for a chair."
There's no toilet in them
And you probably have to hire them by the week do you?
Er minimum of four weeks.
Yeah.
And how do you move them around?
"Well they would move them round  this fella himself, but it's gonna be a hell of a lot of money to get them to do that."
Mm that's what I would have thought.
Plus there's no toilet.
Exactly.
But he has a separate toilet.
Well that's all gonna be extra as well.
Mm.
And erm
So how much you talking about?
For a twelve foot one
Well you're talking
twenty two pounds?
Yeah.
So you're talking about eighty eight quid?
Yeah.
It would be cheaper to get David .
Yeah well I've spoke to David .
He's quite willing to take the caravan out there.
Erm  and then you've got the toilet on there.
No.
Definitely?
Well I'll have to check it out first.
"Why don't you just go in, sign on and then go out again?"
I know it sounds quite tempting.
Oh excuse me.
"Oh you're a fat bastard  oh you're a fat bastard  oh you're a fat bastard, oh you fat bastard"
"It's just play playing it without using, without strumming the strings."
Can you do it?
Can you do it?
The left hand   have you got a minute?
Which hand's left and which hand's right?
That's right.

"Dunno, sometimes it sounds a bit oper-ish opera-ish on it."
But like I  fits in quite well.

Dances with Wolves is coming out on video now.
"Ooh, do you think?"
"Well, it's going to be released on the twenty seventh ."
I'd love to see that .
.
It's a shame cos if they sold the video .
"Well I may not, I may not find it as good, don't, they always show you clips as trailers of the best bit's."
I think it's .
But if it's got anything about
.
"if they've got the American Indian culture in it then it will fascinate me, yeah ."
"I think it has, it's  , it's got a lot of ."
"It's basically a love story between him and a, see he's a, he's a cowboy officer, and she, she's a Indian Squaw obviously, they fall in love and they all this sort of vote of comment on ."
"Yes, yes."
"But there is a lot of erm, obviously the , the Indian ways and so on."

"well yes it's only a small amount for you, but er how many students are there?"
Well that's the thing yeah
You multiple that by
getting in a little bit
however many there are
There's about six I think
"Mm, even so I mean he, he's still got to buy it ain't he?"
"Even so, yeah"
So er
Oh they've probably got this much you know
"mm, I mean has he recommended that you use that"
"he, he got"
or are you
Oh I
just taken it in out of the book?
a vehicle from anybody else cos I think he's messed
That's right

I tell you  I think he owe  a lot of money.
But can you   him?
Well we've got a tenner to go have we?
"but I ain't had chance to say to you, but I was saying to  cos when I called in and see   you think about it  he"
He was desperate to get there  desperate!
Absolutely
Yeah.
desperate!
Now he's never ever offered to pay that fifty odd quid.
Not till today.
"Yes so   and I reckon  quite frankly cos he's living on that lay by up the end  and I reckon he was hiding, do a runner or something or he ain't up to something no good!"
Well he weren't gonna have my vehicle.
He's such a devious little tyke!
Yeah.
I even got Ken to try it on us.
Did you read them that couple in there?
He had what?
"He had Ken over by the allotments, when he used to stay in the car"
for a couple of weeks rent.
"And he went out to pay,first place."
Yeah.
That's how he was in the first place though.
So the young  he was
Jonathan!

Er  yes!
Okay.
I was gonna go to Reading but erm  Sally-Ann can't make it cos there's someone ill at work.
"So erm  the money that I was gonna  you know, use for that I'll use for the ticket."
"Yeah, but you're going off early though, what time's Neil finish work then?"
"Well no, Neil said quarter six we were going."
"But I mean, he can, he's at King's anyway tomorrow  so it won't take him long to get home."
Well you can pick him up on the way then couldn't you?
"Yeah, what time does he finish work then Jo?"
"Well about five-ish, but I mean  he'll be ready for quarter to six"
Er
or whatever time you need to go.
Well i if you  if he takes some old clothes with him love
Mm.
"And then see we , he'd probably wanna get home and then get changed properly."
Have something to eat quick.
"Or else a , or else half past at the latest, set a time."
"Yeah,, thing is, you won't be able to get ."
"Yeah, it only takes him about ten minutes to get home."
Mm.
"As he says  it, it's the biggest holiday"
And
"company in Britain  and he said er, they just keep under  their"
Yeah.
legal limit!
He said.
You can't get them to admit that.
"And, and they'll keep all the profits that they can!"
They're not gonna let you get away with a lot!
"You know, such as new curtains!"
They try to bother  them.
"And I dare say, like these he said they  they've paid for their caravan, cash!"
So that's close to ten thousand pounds!
And they thought it was an investment!
Where as now they
find it had been better for them to have left their in the bank!
"Didn't say it so many words, but that's what he meant!"
And an investment on ten thousand's about twenty pound a week!
"So it's a lot of money to , I would think."
Perhaps he can
"She said thought, she'll only only let it out about six or eight times through the year!"
Well they haven't got total control over letting it!

"Hey, Sam, Sam , come here."

"Trouble is Rocky, Rocky's knackered from his walk and so is ."

Is she your boss?
Sort of yes.
Do you get well paid for this job?

Not for all the hassle we get.
for all the time that we have to sit behind you when we're trying to drive around blowing our horns going  get out the way .
Well ninety per cent of the time you shouldn't be where we are cos it's no cars.
Absolute rubbish.
Unless you're a taxi.
Don't they know who I am?
How soon?
Oh it depends when she's going to have the builders in
Oh
She wouldn't leave by there
No

"We see , we see, have them"
You can't take your money with you.
You can't
"But it's something, something in you, you have to rush don't they?"
Why won't they wait?
Why should they?
Why should they?
"No, why should they?"
I have
Take the rest of it
pleasure spending
"No why, they've got lives of their own"
Well
"let them live it, don't want saving for the children, no, they don't want nothing"
Well
They've had far more than what we've ever had
"Yes, you're right there, yes"

"Yes, yes"
Tell her there will be half a pie for her tea otherwise she don't get none.
I mean this is ridiculous.
Yeah.
Turn that on for me will you?
Just
It's making work for everybody.
And one thing we don't want is extra work.
"I mean if we get finished now and clean the ki cooker and and clean everything  and say right, we're out of the kitchen then, nothing more tonight."
That's it.
If they want something they can get it themselves.
Yeah.
Yeah but  tell them to clean up after them.
Mm.
Don't leave it for you all the time.
Yeah.
Lynn doesn't cook any meals for any of them.

No wonder he sits in the chair and does nothing.
Because they do it at home.
Eat that food now.

You're being perfectly silly.
"Erm, I can't think what you do tomorrow when you go with Steve ."
I mean that will be three hours continuous.
I know they said it.
I heard them.
But a new caravan starts from eleven thousand eight hundred.
That's the price of a new one.
I know they're as good as a house almost.
"Well he said on that tape, I gave them a fat cheque of six thousand pounds."
Mm.
Well that isn't bloody  half of what we paid.
"Yeah I'm paying for mine monthly, but I won't disturb fourteen thousand seven hundred."
Perhaps perhaps he's got a  an agreement.

"One morning I was off up Bambury Lane and John was waiting  to catch Paul to come  some trust or, I don't know whether it's social or what, bought a detached house on Bambury Lane cos there were an uproar."
Cos Mick started all this up there.
"And it was done  through a trust then, and it was done so quietly that they hadn't time to object."
Mm.
And  mentally  handicapped live in this house.
Well they do object.
"But they've turned this  four, five bedroomed detached house, you know, it's got a ramp now up to the front door, the front door's been altered so"
Mm mm.

"Oh I mean I don't want it to be a party where everybody goes off into different rooms, you know?"
Yeah.
"And there's about three in the middle who go right, this is a good song"
"move my little finger, you know?"
"Want to have it where everybody's together, boogieing"
Don't know whether Clare's coming or not yet.

Well you'd better phone her up.
I said phone me if you're coming but don't bother if you're not so it looks like she's not.
Oh well if she turns up  does she know where you live?
She does doesn't she?
"Well yeah, she can find it."
What's this?
I Feel Fine.
"Did Jason Donovan sing this, afterwards?"
No.
Alright then.

Vernon
need to contact them.
"Yes, need to do that this week."
"But they, this, these, well he's got a copy now of the  report and he's gonna c comment back on what"
Do Welsh Office want any more
bits
copies of that?
"So that's fine, good."
erm and they should comment this week about what extra bits they think they could perhaps cover.
So maybe  a few more turning counts  the census
Mm.
Right.
And that wasn't where I well I haven't been
particularly looking for work from that particular
to know is  they raised er the question about  the er counts we're doing for the Caernarvon link
Yes.
which is part of this study.
Yes.
They want us to divorce the staff time
Yeah.
and charge it against the Caernarvon job.
Right.
The Caernarvon link job?
Yeah which is to our benefit cos we get
Mm.
What about the work for Gwyneth?
If that's extra
What do we charge that to?
That is  bypass.
They don't want us to charge it to extra to works?
We could have a two point six seven multiplier
The whole team fades at the moment.
"I, I, that's what I would do."
"I'd drop Mortimer now and er  keep, I wouldn't, I'd  keep McGoldrick up  don't have him as a sweeper."
I mean if you're gonna have McGoldrick as a sweeper then you'd have to bring Mortimer back but
Why not
I noticed it was quite odd that he didn't use McGoldrick as a sweeper did he?
"I mean we, we went out to win that game didn't we, again?"
"Well, don't you think?"
Yeah.
We didn't play a  and yet the defence played well enough.
So I think drop Mortimer and bring Colimore in for a full  ninety minutes and then and and again and again and again.
Get sort of like  half a dozen games.
I think drop Bright  Colimore.
Well.
"I mean Bright, I mean"
"Well yes, you could say, yes"
"you've got, you've got an excuse to drop Bright."
Bright's tired.
You could say Bright is absolutely tired.
He looks tired at the moment.
Just drop Bright .
There's no need to drop Mortimer.
Not when he's playing well.
Mm yes.
"Well he, he didn't play well in the second half though did he?"
I don't think.
He sort of
"Give me a player that did, outside"
"Yes, well, yes."
Coleman and Southgate.
"Well it  it was one of the, I mean when you saw"
"Oh look, that's where Fergie made those funny faces."
She'll swallow that down nice and gently and it'll coat her tummy and it will gradually work its way through into the bowel and quieten them down as well.
Is this the medicine you're giving her?
Yes.
Yes.
Ju as long as you don't overload her.
This is
Aha.
this is the one thing that
her system can't stand.
It's when they retch er
That's right.
They try to empty what it is in their stomach and it
Right.
just comes out.
That's what I was doing last night.
Yeah.
Well  just out to the shop and get some ice-cream or make a table jelly when you go home.
Mhm.
And just have a little of it every half hour?
Every hour?
If you feel like it.
Aha.
"It doesn't matter what the flavour is whether it's strawberry, orange anything."
Okay.
Er quite a good thing is this er sorbet stuff.
Yeah.
Mhm.
It's nice is that.
"It has a tang, so that youngsters particularly, quite, quite like the taste of it because they don't taste anything all their taste buds"
Mm.
if you look at her tongue.
Pure white.
There's only us who never moved.
Oh yeah.
Angie  how long's me mother been in there.
"I'm forty-eight this year, me mum must have been in there nearly fifty year."
And we've only moved into here.
"In actual fact your Pete and Margaret have moved more, in the twelve years that they were married, I know they've been married longer now, but when,th they been married twelve years and they moved four times,"
Yeah.
"we've been married twelve years, and we've moved three times, so we haven't moved as much as them, really."
No.
No.
I couldn't keep moving and
I couldn't move like that.
"I mean, a couple of moves, is fair enough, yeah, but bloody twelve."
No.
"And it's not as if they made money every time they moved, 'cos they haven't, 'cos they lost money on that 'ouse, there."
Yes.
I  won't it.
"Well, Chris said they moved because er,"
Give up.
"er, transport, you know."
"It would be difficult for 'er to get back'ards and for'ards, and she were on her own all the time."
Yeah.
That's why they moved.
"But they moved down, they moved from 'ere because he says, er,"
"Too noisy, weren't it."
Too too noisy and dogs were keeping them up all night.
Oh.
So I don't what the excuse is for moving from   Road.
"Same thing, 'cos it's noisy down there."
Yeah.
"I could scare you, Auntie June."
Could ya.
not far
I know.
Don't let it beat you.
I dunno mum.
Only a little omelette.
Yeah but it was bigger than the plate.
You had to fold it in half to get it on.
That's what I said to John I said you've got your dinner in between an omelette.
Yeah.
That's right.
I thought I could call it erm  a Spanish omelette.
What I tried to do was one of those
Did you have
ploughman's things.
did you have a surplus of eggs or something?
Pardon me.
"Well  erm, I knew you wouldn't eat sort of sliced ham on its own with erm  vegetables."
So  I knew you would eat it like that in an omelette.
Mm.
"I mean, if it had of been smaller."
"Well, I'll have a go but  I may not eat all this but  if it was smaller it's really tasty as well."
Mm.
But you liked those erm  were they countryman's or ploughman's in a packet and you just throw them into the pan and cook it for about fifteen minutes?
And that was just potatoes and eggs wasn't it?
And some cheese.
And bacon.
Don't remember.
Oh.
"What I want to do, I want to cut the shopping down as much as I possibly can."
Well I think eight pounds is a good start.
But when I go to the shops and I spend  seventy pound for a week.
We have to keep making trips back to the shop because we need  bread or milk or something else that we've forgotten.
the aerial off  the car hasn't he?
Snapped it?
Mm.
Well if he's snapped it the aerial
I don't know whereabouts it's snapped.
though innit?
probably snapped it and
If Steve's going to have electric aerial he'll be doing the same thing.
He never ever puts them down.
Or is it his C B aerial?
The C B one  says I've only just let you have it!
He's forgot it's there .
"He's not had much sleep though, poor sod."
You've got a spare bedroom you know.
He won't sleep in it cos I won't sleep in it.
What's up with you  why?
It's still got everything chucked on it.
Well
It was emptying but it's started filling up again.
Yeah.
"Now we got our drier other day, it come through."
Ah did it?
Yeah.
"We can dry  dry now, I just leave it, I leave both doors shut and it keeps kitchen warm."
Yeah they do.
Yes.
"But you've gotta watch the con mind you it won't make no difference, condensation, will it?"
Yeah they don't half make kitchen warm though.
Mm.
I used to have one but he got fed up of me using it so he cut plug off
Ah
and we ended up selling it .
Yeah.
"And what you will have to do, you will have to tell  each other what  you would like to buy or what you would think of."
"Because, if you scrub them off then I'll know that you're gonna buy them."
Cross off the health farm.
"You can buy me er  the locket, the eternity ring, the premium bonds and the weekend away at the health farm."
You'd be lucky to get one.
Good.

"Well how much, I mean"
I read the letter in the paper.

"It was summat like er  I dunno, it was summat like five hundred pound a year."
It was quite modest.
Mm.
Er
There were thirteen
But
"drakes cha er chasing one duck  er, just past the baths along the promenade."
"And then we sat  at the far side of the Old Gate bridge  and er  an old lady came along  and said, and she was counting them  but she said, just look at that thing, she counted seven  although, in actual fact, by then  th these dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down."
"And a there was a domestic one  in each group  there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was another white one  near Old Gate Bridge."
Yeah Well hubby's waiting

"Is there nobody round here listening that can erm that could bring in some Beaujolais Nouv no no little Off Licence that will do this free publicity on the B B C to come in a say, Look I'm an odd bin or something like that ?"
I I thought the B B C I thought the B B C couldn't advertise then?
No the B B C can't.
But you can?
Well.
You're the exception to the rule I suppose?
Yes you wait till you get severely beaten and then you say I'm very sorry I didn't mean to do that.

"I gave my top group your algebra homework today  they said  Pau is this Paul's homework, I said yes  that's not fair  I said why isn't it fair?"
"Well it's too hard, I said how do you know it's too hard?"
And they all did it  apart from Chris   who said  urgh she always works us too hard!
"Apart from Christopher  most of them managed it Paul  especially Richard  he's really clever  I know who that is, Lady Di."

"too bad for this time of  I bet we're doing better this year, this time of the year than we did last."
Yeah  .
"Well you see you  do that minibus want cleaning up, that blue one  or was that clean before we put it in the shed?"
"No  that's  part of the   the windows washing but I'll  quickly washed over them  just to spruce them up a bit but I thought if I put Mrs  in that, is she driving, or is she not?"
"Erm, I should imagine so."
"Yes, she is."
Is she?
Don't she like the column change?

Oh God!
Well I can't help it.

No.
nice big posh shop like  and it's got cheap
Yes.
and nasty  in it.
Yes.
Hope you're enjoying it.
follow you up
It would be real boring just listening to a load of rubbish wouldn't it?
I mean making up conversations all over the place.
Suddenly it clears  this bit.
What you're memory?
No this road.
"Oh, this road."
Why?
Dunno some go off that way
"I mean, let, some people go up go off where?"
Where is it leading to?
Don't know.
I don't really know.
"What's all this, why does Meltis always have that stand of eighty, eighty years?"
"Right, yeah."
I'm always worried that his enthusiasm is stretched to the limit
"No, no I mean the number of pe ."
I've just passed my A levels I've got loads of papers  going what can I do.
"Well I said, ring Birchanger scouts!"
And as far as I know he always .
I mean the address is on there  anyway.
"Yeah, oh right."
Is it?
Oh.
er
quite  pertinent actually if we are actually going to do one.
What?
"To ask people  sorry in my, in the letter"
Yeah.
"to the press, ask  people to er  submit any information."
Yeah.
"Oh what you mean you're gonna put at the bottom  of the of, the same letter or"
"Well, yes."
Yeah.
just write down all the information we've got now so there is  can recycling at the swimming pool and at Tesco privately run.
Swimming pool
Erm  swimming pool
who's going to get the information who runs that?
Who?
Mm?
Well I can do that I suppose.
Well who runs what?
The swimming pool
Because I know the scouts do the Tesco one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them.
"Oh they're not, they're not asking  sorting, oh I see."
"Erm  so there must be somebody responsible and I think if, if we write swimming pool and people take their cans there"
That's the only thing.
Oh yeah.
If you could work it out and see how much it would be
Yeah.
and see if it's  any
Yeah.
"cheaper because  food's no erm  problem  I'll be taking loads with me anyway, which we would do anyway."
We'd be  on anyway
Yeah.
erm
and it's then hardly anything on food.
Well food's not that expensive out there.
"It's, it's the"
"same as  here isn't it, really?"
"Yeah but I mean the fruit and veg out there, that was"
Mm.
rea I mean that was cheaper wasn't it?
Seemed to be anyway somewhat.
Well they  do it by the kilo which  works out cheaper.
"The price per pound was the  same, I think."
I worked it out.
But  I dunno!
"I just thought that it seemed to be, you know?"
"Anyway, we don't eat much when we're in heat anyway do you?"
"The hot weather it doesn't, they don't really   do mashed potatoes and"
Yeah.
like Carol's doing and    those revolting French sausages!
"Went into the supermarket and it said   and it said  pour, not it said erm  pour le animal, well any fool would have thought that was poor   the animals, and Carol said that looks nice, we'll,we'll have a pile of that!"
I said you read the sign on it ?
Did you have them?
"No, she didn't buy it!"
Oh my God there's  so much horse meat which puts me right off!
Why do they pretend not to know?
I mean they should be fully a aware of of of our
Val well this is a new guy.
is that Mr ?
Mr?
.
The recycling officer.
"Is that, is the one, I wrote to"
Hold on .
There.

Yeah .
Is that the one you spoke to?
Tom .

Only he said that they were gonna get an initiative through the schools on er
Is is
he's the one
Anyway that's that's my letter.
"Draft letter which I have not got, it's very very rough, for the press."
Sorry I've only got four.
That's alright.
"Actually some friends of mine were quite confused about what, why they shouldn't be able to throw their cooking oil away in their bin."
Because they said they'd always done it and they had nowhere else to put it.
Somebody else said oh you should throw it down the sink but I didn't think you were supposed to do that either.
What?
Cooking oil.
Cooking oil?
Yeah.
"If you have got one of those deep  fat fryers you, you have quite a bit to throw away."
Well don't put it in water.
Yes  that brown crayon you've got in your hand'll do.
"Why, why will it do?"
Well  you seem a bit desperate.
What you gonna do with it?
Right so you're going to go work
Well
after I've gone to  have you?
Yeah.
You can go to work when the tape stops  Well he's not going to watch you sticking all those on at work  what's he gonna be doing.
He's doing his homework.
"I can draw some sides   just like I can put  I could make a  just draw neatly in the teams bi on a big piece of paper  that'll make it look really good,."
And when were you going to do the map of  you can't do that map tomorrow can you?
Yeah.

Yeah.
"Say we're quite prepared to make a contribution, mm."
you put them out or  circulate them.
Yeah?
Yeah I mean don't think Rob would be interested.
Yeah.
He he ought to know about it though

that you do will make me feel alright  ta.
work all day   money
"work all day to get your  oh talk of the devil, Richard  's out there."
Ha your lover!
"Oh I, I was so frightened yesterday when he came round."
"He were just   made me laugh  come on then I'll just come out with you, in the garden."
"And I come out he goes oh it's cold I'm just gonna get me coat, I'll be back in a minute"
Ooh  he's dead creepy though isn't he?
Yeah.
He's alright though.
I know he's alright but
no problems.
"he kep I was laying there and I was just dropping off to sleep, I was oh it was , and he, in h in he waltzes  oh I, he, I, he goes what you doing in here?"
"I goes what the hell's it look like, I'm going to sleep!"
"He goes  he goes you can't go to sleep, and he sat on the edge of my bed for about quarter of an hour."
Your bed.
What do you mean your bed ?
You was on Andrew's.
Ooh ah
"Well I was only going to  sleep Jo , I wasn't doing anything, I'm just tired."
"Oh I can't put it in there, it's not going to fit."
things that you do

in their car.
What?
home
What's the matter?
I don't think    holding me tight tight
They might be symmetrical about here or here.
Or  it this way round.
What's that?
What's that?
That's a .
Erm
Well I mean what gives you that?
What gives you that?
"Well, what does that look like from the way you're looking at it?"
s
"The way you're looking at it, it looks something like erm Y equals X to"
X
the fourth plus three or something.
Mm.
Good.
So looking at it this way up I mean  it's  X equals Y to the fourth  plus three and that's all minus.
Mm.
X X equals three minus Y to the fourth.
It's a funny way of putting it.
Yeah.
But you could write your equation that way.
"Er if someone says that's not good enough, I want it in terms of Y equals"
"well okay we'll have to bring the three over to this side, and take the fourth root,."
"But you can always swap the axes, if you don't like what they give you."
Mm.
"So if, if I say  draw erm  Y equals the square root of X, and you think I haven't got a clue what that looks like."
You can square both sides.
"You can draw Y squared equals X, and all you have to do is say well, I can draw  the other way round."
Mm.
Y equals X squared.
"You draw your Y equals X squared,turn the paper round that way, and whichever way, I'm going to draw Y equals X squared."
"And erm   Y equals X squared, and that's Y and that's an X. Then turn it the other way up to get X equals Y squared, and now that's the Y and this is the X."
but when he gets
"It's not like that, no!"
"What they thought is because he's assessing them and she's, they're assessing us while he's assessing them."
If you know what I mean?
Alright!
"Now, they thought it was only gonna be two because there's only two assessing people, right?"
Yeah.
"But it turned out to be three and she was put in this  an awkward position and she doesn't know what to do, the poor girl who got picked!"
Mm.
"They a they'll have the other two, they got told in advance  but this one, she never."
And  that's all that happened.
"But she says you do,sh that you do get told."
But I'm taking no exam!
The R S A One exam!
Oh I know!
Oh!
"Mind you  if you say it's doing,yo er, started erm  writing to somebody you really like  and you've gotta get it perfect."

"Well that'll be  that'll, that will really be hard won't it?"
Why?
I don't know.
Did she say you can use a dictionary?
Yeah.
Well that'll be da that's daft in your case!

Yeah.
problems.

Right.
It's easier for

Put it in the dish.

Mm.
is that
If we came to be audited
"procedures should be  what is happening, not what our aspirations are."
No.
I'm sorry.
Particularly when they're long way .
No.

"Now with it being , we're not gonna look at a high margin straight away cos I know that's a waste of time."
Er but we can make a reasonable margin including spacers.
It's a set of three bearings with a pair of spacers.
"So you have two bearings in tandem, a pair of spacers and a third bearing."
And it's their normal machine centre range.
They use like about forty pairs a month.

Noel said  he'd hit it on the coffee table !
"Next day at school, Noel's come in and gone to Scott, you bastard!"
Why do you have go and tell your mum the truth for !
I'd never tell my mum that!
"Like, luckily they're"
Oh God!
"no , not very big but I've still got the one, I've still got, and it's right next to it as well!"
Mm.
Now it's yellow now it's going!
Yeah.

"As X becomes a very very very small number, or a large negative number, if you like to think of it that way, where X is very large."
"So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one."
Mm.
Any idea what that graph would be?
X squared.
"Erm, what would   not quite the right shape   what would that graph be?"
Y equals something  plus X squared.
"Right, there'd be some X squared in it."
"And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant"
Mm.
Yeah.
cos when X is zero still there's Y has still got a value.
So that's going to be minus something
Mm.
so it's about minus three.
X squared  cuts
the X axis in two points.
Two points.
This one
Three points.
It's
So?
X cubed.
"So this is, there's going to be an X cubed term in here somewhere, and there might be X squared and Xs and anything else, but if it cuts it three places, it's got three r three roots."
So it's X cubed.
What about this one?
I have to sketch curves  This sort of thing.
Just touches.
Y equals X squared.
"Something like, it's going to have an X squared in it somewhere."
"It's a bit lopsided, but it's"
"Where's the X, where's the Y?"
Knowing Yvonne she'll  hee hee!

"No I mean, I'm talking about the people  who are not actually  er, you know"
I i if
concerned directly but give

I went  what ?
"I went, is this this well hard bloke from Brixton, cos Ryan keeps going on about it, like we I said, is he do, I said, oh, we went to Oxford Street today, and he went, is that anywhere near Brixton?"
"I went  I don't think so, Ryan, and he went, ah, cos I wanna go up there, it's well hard up there."
"I thought, why he's saying that, and then I looked, and Victor comes through now, and he went, yeah, I wan he goes, I wanna go up London and get some clothes, get some really stylish stuff up London, I was like, yeah, Ryan."
"I said, you only get a bigger selection, that's about it."
"He said, no you don't."
Almost hardly worth their while but
If you look at the tonnage kept out of the landfill
Yeah.
it might work.
"Yeah, but I mean it it"

"She's got this erm, dinosaur, that she like, tied a, a la a bootlace round, this luminous bootlace round it."
"She dragged it, drags it around, and it's called, erm, little frog, what is it called?"
"Little froglet  dog, little my little froglet dog, that's it."
"Froglet doggie, it's called or something."
"I think that's what it's called, something really funny."
and she calls it my froglet doggie.
"And you say, who's this, she's says, my, this is my little froglet baby big doggie, or something like that."
"She puts it in, and you ask her all questions about, she tells you it about it, and it has to be, and it only drinks orange squash, cos that's wh what only Marie only drinks."
Marie only drinks orange squash.
"She goes, it only drinks orange squash."
What's it have to drink?
Orange squash.
Yeah.
And likes your light on when it goes to bed.

If you go out and switch her light off and leave her in the room.
Come back and put my light on .
Really?
I don't like it in the dark .
"You can, if you go up there."
"you've done it, she's had to get out and put it on herself."
"You put my light off, I don't like that, you put my off."
My mummy doesn't like that.

Saying that we don't
"We keep ours in the garage, the extra  two carvers"
Oh yes.
"and they come down when you know, if we've got any"
When you need them.
Mm.
Otherwise it's just a waste really.
Well that's probably what I'm gonna have to do.
"You can get, you can get sets of four can't you?"
Oh yes
But six  hard to get.
I'll just try and get two carvers to match
"Yeah, that's, that's the answer really and er if they're not quite the same you can get away with two carvers can't you?"
"But er  oh well  Yeah this is what got me, I like the er the legs you know, the the backs I, I didn't like at all because you've got this blue"
Well
"You've got no  no m no wood that's showing you see, that's the trouble."
"Yes, yes."

Nice.
This is a su survey.
finished at one point but it's veneered
Mm
But erm
"this, but this was exposed then?"
It's just how he was brought up I suppose an
"I remember reading this book  it was  partly, it was about the German Navy"
Mm?
"and er  sh , you know  the test before they could become officers  they set captain  set  the table, you see the  and  they have this  food that they know how, how to use the cutlery, this was one of the tests of being an officer."
Oh yeah!
Mm.
"You know, to er  they didn't know how to use the cutlery, and, they were, they we , yeah"
Which piece to use for which course.
"they weren't, they weren't gentlemen so they couldn't be er  they couldn't be officers."
Mm.
Oh there's a lot of that well done wasn't there?
It's called the class structure.
Yeah.
Or system.
"Well, ironically his creed was supposed to be without that wasn't it  Hitler?"
"You know, this supreme race but all  more or less equal."
"Well no, that wasn't the case!"
He wanted to create  a supreme race didn't he?
"No, but the er  the Germans  they were the supreme body weren't they?"
he's he's   and er  he wanted to create a super race.
But the army was run on the old style wasn't it?
Of course.
"You know, they were the  they were the er  the masters of the army."

and the big package
that would have meant
"then it go in , in a large"
That's correct.
dimensions then you cube it.
"We're gonna do cubing in a minute, do a few exercises on cubing."
"Yes, I mean,Je Mandy said er, if we've got any consignment which exceeds one point five cubic feet per ten kilos."
But you usually know don't you if
It's lower than that actually but  er sorry
Mm mm.
it isn't.
"I, I said, yeah a cubic foot, is se , six point six then."
"That's probably right, yeah."
One point five per ten kilos.
"You can usually tell when you get used to it and we're gonna talk about visual identity in a minute, but  when the mass seems greater overly large to the weight is what  er Jen , sorry Mandy said, and I think that's a good  er er  a good er  analogy there."
"I got if erm, if the size is greater than the weight actually."
Yes.
I got that.
I'll accept that at this stage alright?
"Next question is, what's number six?"
Who can read it out?
Er six .
Can't read that word.
Notional.
Oh!
Ha.
What notional weight is used for cubing?
Six point six per cubic foot.
Did you get that right?
"I did, yes."
Mm mm.
Yes.
"as he's kicking the ball, come on then, now, get in the goal, come on then"

"Since I said, why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was  plenty of children's things local?"
Yes.
So I asked if we wanted anything?
And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital?
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds.
Oh you mean a bed?
Well
Tt!
D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be
"Well, she just asked about a bed, so I told her that  we were"
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
But why's
"She di na she just said a bed, and so"
Yes.
"I told her there were special beds that we have  are very useful, in fact  very necessary in some, some cases, and are  painfully short of them."
Aha.
And a Nimbas bed  costs two thousand pound.
"And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of, which costs a lot more."
Mhm.
"Something like, five thousand."
But I can't remember the name.
"Anyway, I said I'd  make enquiries as to what a is wanted."
"And I said there's a, there's a new children's ward  will open at the Wandsbergh Hospital  perhaps they would like something."
"I saw Mrs , and Mrs  said  they were aiming to raise money for the scanner appeal."
Yeah.
"But, also they're going to  have a  an obstetric adult patient's department  at the College Hospital for the very first time."

An obstetric outpatients
Well how do you get through the gates?
Loads of water get up through the gates.
So.
"Yeah, so up to the gates, just push yourself off the gates"
.
"How quick can you get to the surface, must be strong ,, two, three  riding down to the  and you're gonna push it out the way, it's like, it's like the tide, it comes in and then goes back out,."
Should be two in there.

"No if, cos there seemed a  pair."

At this work experience .
In .

I asked for some once.
You did?
"No, I never pick up the phone, they do that, pick up one phone and speak for a minute, while that ones ringing they say hold on a minute, and pick up the other one."
What's it about then?
", it's only about this erm, I have to do the practice."
Huh?
Have to do the practice.
Know how to do them now?
You should  at Peter's.
I don't know Peter's .
"No, I don't actually."
Cos I don't know his  can't do it.
Quit easy though isn't it?
"All you do is, stick it through, phone your number, push the button, it's gone through."
I get fed up doing the .
"Yeah, but, even when you leave school that's what happens don't it?"
"I, I mean you usually start off with the boy  everybody has to start at the bottom,."
.
But you'll have to ring Malcolm and tell him Geoff  because he'll be on the phone to Miriam.
Yeah but she'll know  she'll know that  in fact he'll be seeing her.

Well what's so funny about mum having her head sliced off?
He just did.

Perhaps he used his wing mirror.
Like I do.
That's a quite nice little  place there.
And you don't pay over the odds prices because it's not an expensive place to  have your shop.
Oh.
That's good.
You go to these big stores and they pay so much in heating and lighting and staff .
This er pavement's quite nice  .
Isn't it attractively done?
Done like parquet.
Don't know who's paying for it all  whether  council is  or what?
So do you want to go over there first?
It's up to you.
What do you want to do?
I don't mind a bit.
"Well we've got fifteen minutes, well thirteen minutes."
Beautiful cakes.
Fruit crumble.
"And, you'd be able to get one laugh, that's the idea."
"It's a modern gag idea that  you know, Violet dressed as man or  but in, Johnson  ha there have numerous  kinds of disguises, each"
Mm.
to different effect.
Each calling different people.
Okay?
Right.
"We've got some idea as to why, why we found it difficult to read."
"Which also help us understand the kind of comedy altogether, erm  that ."
Let's see if we can refine those  like us looking at the first two lines  of the play.
Erm
okay.
"We'll read them through and pause for a while and try to think of the, also in terms of the physical, you know, erm  staging."
"Erm  okay, who's gonna be Face?"
"I'll have  Jo as Face  I'll have Monica as  Sottle, and we'll have  Mia as Don."
Okay?
Just the first
Mhm.
ten or twenty lines.
"Right, off you go."
At least I will.
How are your wits?
Why don't you run for us?
Oh don't be ridiculous!
"What to do, a little bit of pantomime."
Ro rode out of the woods tonight.
No don't keep suffering .
"Forever while she breathes I'll go and see  and fetch some water, will you come?"
Will you have the ?betrayal.
Hark!
I hear somebody.
Yeah.
The instructors
Oh.
and all the other lads.
Oh right.
"Did they record it or that, no?"
Which is a good job.
Mm.
Cos most of us were petrified anyway.
And that's a bit like that erm  the teaching skills that I had to do that time when I was on the course.
Mm?
Erm  and I had to think up  something  that I do as a hobby er to teach other people.
"I, I did those little flowers you see  and took them in."
And er  it is quite nervewracking really to sit there.
Specially when the instructors come over and they're sort of sitting watching as well.
"Well  the bad thing was, as soon as I picked my cards up I dropped them all  you know?"
Mm.
All your flash cards?
Good morning yeah.
"Good morning ladies and gentlemen pshoow and they, they went all over the place."
So I had to pick them back up  mm sorry.
Bit of nerves.
"Be back to front now, this morning yeah?"
John wants me to er  sew his trousers for him.
Oh.
I'm waiting on him  picking up the machine.
It tickles me the way they call it portable and you can hardly lift it.
"we took Patricia in to, we give her a lift as far as Longbridge today."
She was going back to get her coat changed.
And then she was going to the careers office.
And erm they were going to send her for an interview straight away.
I told her to be home reasonably early but she's not home yet.
Well
Yeah.
You have your paper  you have your  bottles
"you know alright  initially as you say  it take, it costs  but"
To set it up
"it does , to set it up,yo you have  you have, you'll have to have three, three what's his names?"
"Three, three bin men  to come and collect it."
Mm.
"Or no, you have to have three containers."
But they do it in Canada!
Well this is what I'm saying!
Yeah.
But I mean
Even even got one
you see
for plastic!
"but, but there  well yo , you could have four, you could have as many as you like"
Mm.
"but I mean  surely, in the long term"
Course!
but that co
"idea he doesn't drink beer, so you can have his for"
"Well no,but I mean like"
But that's the key word is the long term Ken!
"like you sell, you sell that back  to them  that that pays  the man's wages that is doing it!"
Mm.
Mm.
"But it's the short term isn't it, with them?"
They just thinking well we haven't got the machinery to cope with this!
It's easier for us
No the
to buy the new raw material and process it
Yeah I said
and all the  at work.
Hold on
"Well I got to work all day and I'm still   oh do you think, want me  I can get you two  I'll write you a list,."
I don't have a list from him.
No.
Just have to try and remember
Oh.
"Oh in that case this year I wouldn't mention it if I was you, you might get away with it."
"Then of course there's always, oh he left last Spring, oh."
"Exactly, yeah."
His up in Leeds.
"Well exactly, so don't bother ."
People .
"And can you do a Christmas card for so and so, because he's been, he's been delegated to help me with my machine"
Yeah
development and  mind you I like Larry  and Ken
.
"Well Larry's, I mean he's a genius, so he is a bit awkward to get along with, erm not awkward to get along his sweet, but he's"
Peculiar.
Yes.
.
"Hurry up, be a good boy."
.
No.
Said  garden.
I don't think so when I went to let him in he'd pulled himself up round the patio and looked as though he expected to be walloped for being silly  he's taken us this morning.
"The trailers, the cars there, but I can't see, can't see another ."
"Oh well now, when, when do you want to go into  on Monday, just after lunch?"
"Yeah, be great."
"Well, yeah,."
.
.
I never expected this !
I must stay with the student . '
"The little fellow thought it over , for he was a sensible Goblin ."
"Then he sighed , ` The student has no jam ! '"
And on that he went down to the grocer again .
"And it was a good thing that he did go back , for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue ."
"It had read everything that was inside it , on the one side , and was just going to turn itself round and read from the other side when the Goblin came in and returned the tongue to its owner ."
"But the whole shop , from the till down to the shavings , from that night changed their opinion of the tub , and they looked up to it , and had such faith in it that they were under the impression that when the grocer read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings , it all came from the tub ."
But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly listening to the wisdom and intellect downstairs .
"No , as soon as the light shone in the evening from the attic it seemed to him as though its beams were strong ropes dragging him up , and he had to go and peep through the key-hole ."
"There he felt the sort of feeling we have looking at the great rolling sea in a storm , and he burst into tears ."
"He could not himself say why he wept , but in spite of his tears he felt quite happy ."
"How beautiful it must be to sit under that tree with the student , but that he could not do ; he had to content himself with the key-hole and be happy there !"
"There he stood out on the cold landing , the autumn wind blowing through the cracks of the floor ."
"It was cold -- very cold , but he first found it out when the light in the attic was put out and the music in the wood died away ."
Ah !
"then it froze him , and he crept down again into his warm corner ; there it was comfortable and cosy ."
"When Christmas came , and with it the jam with the large lump of butter , ah !"
then the grocer was first with him .
"But in the middle of the night the Goblin awoke , hearing a great noise and knocking against the shutters -- people hammering from outside ."
The watchman was blowing his horn : a great fire had broken out ; the whole town was in flames .
Was it in the house ?
or was it at a neighbour 's ?
Where was it ?
The alarm increased .
The grocer 's wife was so terrified that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket in order to save something .
The grocer seized his account books .
and the maid her black silk dress .
"Everyone wanted to save his most valuable possession ; so did the Goblin , and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and in the student 's room ."
He was standing quietly by the open window looking at the fire that was burning in the neighbour 's house just opposite .
"The Goblin seized the book lying on the table , put it in his red cap , and clasped it with both hands ."
"The best treasure in the house was saved , and he climbed out on to the roof with it -- on to the chimney ."
"Only you must unfasten the halter you lead it with and bring it back , and do n't return by the high road , but through the forest . '"
"The next day , when the couple rose , they saw an enormous head looking in at their bedroom window , and behind it was a cow which was nearly as big as their hut ."
Kirsten was wild with joy to think of the money the cow would bring them .
` But how are you going to put the rope over her head ? '
asked she .
"` Wait and you 'll see , mother , ' answered her husband ."
"Then Peder took the ladder that led up to the hayloft and set it against the cow 's neck , and he climbed up and slipped the rope over her head ."
"When he had made sure that the noose was fast they started for the palace , and met the king himself walking in his grounds . '"
"I heard that the princess was going to be married , ' said Peder , ` so I 've brought your majesty a cow which is bigger than any cow that was ever seen ."
Will your majesty deign to buy it ? '
"The king had , in truth , never seen so large a beast , and he willingly paid the thousand dollars , which was the price demanded ; but Peder remembered to take off the halter before he left ."
After he was gone the king sent for the butcher and told him to kill the animal for the wedding feast .
"The butcher got ready his pole-axe ; but just as he was going to strike , the cow changed itself into a dove and flew away , and the butcher stood staring after it as if he were turned to stone ."
"However , as the dove could not be found , he was obliged to tell the king what had happened , and the king in his turn despatched messengers to capture the old man and bring him back ."
"But Peder was safe in the woods , and could not be found ."
"When at last he felt the danger was over , and he might go home , Kirsten nearly fainted with joy at the sight of all the money he brought with him ."
"` Now that we are rich people we must build a bigger house , ' cried she ; and was vexed to find that Peder only shook his head and said : ` No ; if they did that people would talk , and say they had got their wealth by ill-doing . '"
A few mornings later Hans came again .
"` Be off before you get us into trouble , ' said his father ."
"` So far the money has come right enough , but I do n't trust it . '"
"` Do n't worry over that , father , ' said Hans ."
` To-morrow you will find a horse outside by the gate .
Ride it to market and you will get a thousand dollars for it .
Only do n't forget to loosen the bridle when you sell it . '
"Well , in the morning there was the horse ; Kirsten had never seen so find an animal ."
"` Take care it does n't hurt you , Peder , ' said she ."
"` Nonsense , wife , ' answered he crossly ."
"` When I was a lad I lived with horses , and could ride anything for twenty miles round . '"
"But that was not quite the truth , for he had never mounted a horse in his life ."
"Still , the animal was quiet enough , so Peder got safely to market on its back ."
"There he met a man who offered nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars for it , but Peder would take nothing less than a thousand ."
"At last there came an old , grey-bearded man who looked at the horse and agreed to buy it ; but the moment he touched it the horse began to kick and plunge . '"
Rilla felt Carl 's going keenly .
They had always been cronies and playmates .
He was only a little older than she was and they had been children in Rainbow Valley together .
She recalled all their old pranks and escapades as she walked slowly home alone .
"The full moon peeped through the scudding clouds with sudden floods of weird illumination , the telephone wires sang a shrill weird song in the wind , and the tall spikes of withered , grey-headed golden-rod in the fence corners swayed and beckoned wildly to her like groups of old witches weaving unholy spells ."
"On such a night as this , long ago , Carl would come over to Ingleside and whistle her out to the gate ."
"`` Let 's go on a moon-spree , Rilla , '' he would say , and the two of them would scamper off to Rainbow Valley ."
"Rilla had never been afraid of his beetles and bugs , though she drew a hard and fast line at snakes ."
"They used to talk together of almost everything and were teased about each other at school ; but one evening when they were about ten years of age they had solemnly promised , by the old spring in Rainbow Valley , that they would never marry each other ."
"Alice Clow had `` crossed out '' their names on her slate in school that day , and it came out that `` both married . ''"
"They did not like the idea at all , hence the mutual vow in Rainbow Valley ."
There was nothing like an ounce of prevention .
Rilla laughed over the old memory -- and then sighed .
That very day a dispatch from some London paper had contained the cheerful announcement that `` the present moment is the darkest since the war began . ''
"It was dark enough , and Rilla wished desperately that she could do something besides waiting and serving at home , as day after day the Glen boys she had known went away ."
"If she were only a boy , speeding in khaki by Carl 's side to the Western front !"
"She had wished that in a burst of romance when Jem had gone , without , perhaps , really meaning it ."
She meant it now .
"There were moments when waiting at home , in safety and comfort , seemed an unendurable thing ."
The moon burst triumphantly through an especially dark cloud and shadow and silver chased each other in waves over the Glen .
"Rilla remembered one moonlit evening of childhood when she had said to her mother , `` The moon just looks like a sorry , sorry face . ''"
"She thought it looked like that still -- an agonised , care-worn face , as though it looked down on dreadful sights ."
What did it see on the Western front ?
In broken Serbia ?
On shell-swept Gallipoli ?
"`` I am tired , '' Miss Oliver had said that day , in a rare outburst of impatience , `` of this horrible rack of strained emotions , when every day brings a new horror or the dread of it ."
"No , do n't look reproachfully at me , Mrs. Blythe ."
There 's nothing heroic about me today .
I 've slumped .
I wish England had left Belgium to her fate -- I wish Canada had never sent a man -- I wish we 'd tied our boys to our apron strings and not let one of them go .
Oh -- I shall be ashamed of myself in half an hour -- but at this very minute I mean every word of it .
Will the Allies never strike ? ''
"`` Come aboard , Mr. Hands , '' I said ironically ."
"He rolled his eyes round heavily , but he was too far gone to express surprise ."
"All he could do was to utter one word , `` Brandy . ''"
"It occurred to me there was no time to lose , and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck , I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin ."
It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy .
All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart .
The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp .
"The bulkheads , all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt , bore a pattern of dirty hands ."
Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship .
"One of the doctor 's medical books lay open on the table , half of the leaves gutted out , I suppose , for pipelights ."
"In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow , obscure and brown as umber ."
"I went into the cellar ; all the barrels were gone , and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away ."
"Certainly , since the mutiny began , not a man of them could ever have been sober ."
"Foraging about , I found a bottle with some brandy left , for Hands ; and for myself I routed out some biscuit , some pickled fruits , a great bunch of raisins , and a piece of cheese ."
"With these I came on deck , put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain 's reach , went forward to the water-breaker , and had a good deep drink of water , and then , and not till then , gave Hands the brandy ."
He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth .
"`` Aye , '' said he , `` by thunder , but I wanted some o ' that ! ''"
I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat .
`` Much hurt ? ''
I asked him .
"He grunted , or rather , I might say , he barked ."
"`` If that doctor was aboard , '' he said , `` I 'd be right enough in a couple of turns , but I do n't have no manner of luck , you see , and that 's what 's the matter with me ."
"As for that swab , he 's good and dead , he is , '' he added , indicating the man with the red cap ."
`` He war n't no seaman anyhow .
And where mought you have come from ? ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 've come aboard to take possession of this ship , Mr. Hands ; and you 'll please regard me as your captain until further notice . ''"
He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing .
"Some of the colour had come back into his cheeks , though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about ."
"`` By the by , '' I continued , `` I ca n't have these colours , Mr. Hands ; and by your leave , I 'll strike 'em ."
Better none than these . ''
"And again dodging the boom , I ran to the colour lines , handed down their cursed black flag , and chucked it overboard ."
`` God save the king ! ''
I 'LL keel-haul him ! ''
"All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch , slapping tables with his hand , and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner ."
"My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass , and I watched the cook narrowly ."
"But he was too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver ."
"`` See here , now , Hawkins , '' said he , `` here 's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ai n't it ?"
There 's Cap'n Trelawney -- what 's he to think ?
Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum !
Here you comes and tells me of it plain ; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights !
"Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n ."
"You 're a lad , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
I see that when you first come in .
"Now , here it is : What could I do , with this old timber I hobble on ?"
"When I was an A B master mariner I 'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broached him to in a brace of old shakes , I would ; but now -- '' And then , all of a sudden , he stopped , and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something ."
`` The score ! ''
he burst out .
`` Three goes o ' rum !
"Why , shiver my timbers , if I had n't forgotten my score ! ''"
"And falling on a bench , he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks ."
"I could not help joining , and we laughed together , peal after peal , until the tavern rang again ."
"`` Why , what a precious old sea-calf I am ! ''"
"he said at last , wiping his cheeks ."
"`` You and me should get on well , Hawkins , for I 'll take my davy I should be rated ship 's boy ."
"But come now , stand by to go about ."
This wo n't do .
"Dooty is dooty , messmates ."
"I 'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney , and report this here affair ."
"For mind you , it 's serious , young Hawkins ; and neither you nor me 's come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit ."
"Nor you neither , says you ; not smart -- none of the pair of us smart ."
But dash my buttons !
That was a good un about my score . ''
"And he began to laugh again , and that so heartily , that though I did not see the joke as he did , I was again obliged to join him in his mirth ."
"On our little walk along the quays , he made himself the most interesting companion , telling me about the different ships that we passed by , their rig , tonnage , and nationality , explaining the work that was going forward -- how one was discharging , another taking in cargo , and a third making ready for sea -- and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly ."
"`` Now , if you make fun of my plan I 'll give you bad coffee for a week , and then where are you , sir ? ''"
"cried Mrs. Jo , tweaking him by the ear just as if he was one of the boys ."
`` Wo n't Daisy 's hair stand erect with horror at Nan 's wild ways ? ''
"asked Mr. Bhaer , presently , when Teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat , and Rob up his back , for they always flew at their father the minute school was done ."
"`` At first , perhaps , but it will do Posy good ."
"She is getting prim and Bettyish , and needs stirring up a bit ."
"She always has a good time when Nan comes over to play , and the two will help each other without knowing it ."
"Dear me , half the science of teaching is knowing how much children do for one another , and when to mix them . ''"
`` I only hope she wo n't turn out another firebrand . ''
`` My poor Dan !
"I never can quite forgive myself for letting him go , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer ."
"At the sound of the name , little Teddy , who had never forgotten his friend , struggled down from his father 's arms , and trotted to the door , looked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face , and then trotted back again , saying , as he always did when disappointed of the longed-for sight , `` My Danny 's tummin ' soon . ''"
"`` I really think we ought to have kept him , if only for Teddy 's sake , he was so fond of him , and perhaps baby 's love would have done for him what we failed to do . ''"
"`` I 've sometimes felt that myself ; but after keeping the boys in a ferment , and nearly burning up the whole family , I thought it safer to remove the firebrand , for a time at least , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Dinner 's ready , let me ring the bell , '' and Rob began a solo upon that instrument which made it impossible to hear one 's self speak ."
"`` Then I may have Nan , may I ? ''"
asked Mrs. Jo .
"`` A dozen Nans if you want them , my dear , '' answered Mr. Bhaer , who had room in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the world ."
"When Mrs. Bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon , before she could unpack the load of little boys , without whom she seldom moved , a small girl of ten skipped out at the back of the carry-all and ran into the house , shouting , `` Hi , Daisy !"
where are you ? ''
"Daisy came , and looked pleased to see her guest , but also a trifle alarmed , when Nan said , still prancing , as if it was impossible to keep still , `` I 'm going to stay here always , papa says I may , and my box is coming tomorrow , all my things had to be washed and mended , and your aunt came and carried me off ."
Is n't it great fun ? ''
"`` Why , yes ."
Did you bring your big doll ? ''
"asked Daisy , hoping she had , for on the last visit Nan had ravaged the baby house , and insisted on washing Blanche Matilda 's plaster face , which spoilt the poor dear 's complexion for ever ."
"`` Yes , she 's somewhere round , '' returned Nan , with most unmaternal carelessness ."
"`` I made you a ring coming along , and pulled the hairs out of Dobbin 's tail ."
Do n't you want it ? ''
"and Nan presented a horse-hair ring in token of friendship , as they had both vowed they would never speak to one another again when they last parted ."
"Won by the beauty of the offering , Daisy grew more cordial , and proposed retiring to the nursery , but Nan said , `` No , I want to see the boys , and the barn , '' and ran off , swinging her hat by one string till it broke , when she left it to its fate on the grass ."
`` Hullo !
Nan ! ''
"`` It is ten o'clock ; into bed , every man of you , '' said Mr. Bhaer , looking at his watch ."
"`` And , thank Heaven !"
"there will be no empty ones to-night , '' added Mrs. Bhaer , watching , with full eyes , Robby going up in his father 's arms , and Nan escorted by Daisy and Demi , who considered her the most interesting heroine of their collection ."
"`` Poor Aunt Jo is so tired she ought to be carried up herself , '' said gentle Franz , putting his arm round her as she paused at the stair-foot , looking quite exhausted by her fright and long walk ."
"`` Let 's make an arm-chair , '' proposed Tommy ."
"`` No , thank you , my lads ; but somebody may lend me a shoulder to lean on , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Me !
me ! ''
"and half-a-dozen jostled one another , all eager to be chosen , for there was something in the pale motherly face that touched the warm hearts under the round jackets ."
"Seeing that they considered it an honor , Mrs. Jo gave it to the one who had earned it , and nobody grumbled when she put her arm on Dan 's broad shoulder , saying , with a look that made him color up with pride and pleasure , `` He found the children ; so I think he must help me up . ''"
"Dan felt richly rewarded for his evening 's work , not only that he was chosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp , but because Mrs. Jo said heartily , `` Good-night , my boy !"
God bless you ! ''
as he left her at her door .
"`` I wish I was your boy , '' said Dan , who felt as if danger and trouble had somehow brought him nearer than ever to her ."
"`` You shall be my oldest son , '' and she sealed her promise with a kiss that made Dan hers entirely ."
"Little Rob was all right next day , but Nan had a headache , and lay on Mother Bhaer 's sofa with cold-cream upon her scratched face ."
"Her remorse was quite gone , and she evidently thought being lost rather a fine amusement ."
"Mrs. Jo was not pleased with this state of things , and had no desire to have her children led from the paths of virtue , or her pupils lying round loose in huckleberry fields ."
"So she talked soberly to Nan , and tried to impress upon her mind the difference between liberty and license , telling several tales to enforce her lecture ."
"She had not decided how to punish Nan , but one of these stories suggested a way , and as Mrs. Jo liked odd penalties , she tried it ."
"`` All children run away , '' pleaded Nan , as if it was as natural and necessary a thing as measles or hooping cough ."
"`` Not all , and some who do run away do n't get found again , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Did n't you do it yourself ? ''
"asked Nan , whose keen little eyes saw some traces of a kindred spirit in the serious lady who was sewing so morally before her ."
"Mrs. Jo laughed , and owned that she did ."
"`` Tell about it , '' demanded Nan , feeling that she was getting the upper hand in the discussion ."
"Mrs. Jo saw that , and sobered down at once , saying , with a remorseful shake of the head , `` I did it a good many times , and led my poor mother rather a hard life with my pranks , till she cured me . ''"
`` How ? ''
and Nan sat up with a face full of interest .
"`` I had a new pair of shoes once , and wanted to show them ; so , though I was told not to leave the garden , I ran away and was wandering about all day ."
"It was in the city , and why I was n't killed I do n't know ."
Such a time as I had .
"Then the dirty-handed society went off the wash , followed by the Professor , trying to calm the anxiety of Rob , who had been told by Tommy that all water was full of invisible pollywogs ."
"`` I like your plan very much , only do n't be too generous , Teddy , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , when they were left alone ."
"`` You know most of the boys have got to paddle their own canoes when they leave us , and too much sitting in the lap of luxury will unfit them for it . ''"
"`` I 'll be moderate , but do let me amuse myself ."
"I get desperately tired of business sometimes , and nothing freshens me up like a good frolic with your boys ."
"I like that Dan very much , Jo ."
"He is n't demonstrative ; but he has the eye of a hawk , and when you have tamed him a little he will do you credit . ''"
`` I 'm so glad you think so .
"Thank you very much for your kindness to him , especially for this museum affair ; it will keep him happy while he is lame , give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor , rough lad , and make him love us ."
"What did inspire you with such a beautiful , helpful idea , Teddy ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Bhaer , glancing back at the pleasant room , as she turned to leave it ."
"Laurie took both her hands in his , and answered , with a look that made her eyes fill with happy tears , `` Dear Jo !"
"I have known what it is to be a motherless boy , and I never can forget how much you and yours have done for me all these years . ''"
CHAPTER XII .
"HUCKLEBERRIES There was a great clashing of tin pails , much running to and fro , and frequent demands for something to eat , one August afternoon , for the boys were going huckleberrying , and made as much stir about it as if they were setting out to find the North West Passage ."
"`` Now , my lads , get off as quietly as you can , for Rob is safely out of the way , and wo n't see you , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , as she tied Daisy 's broad-brimmed hat , and settled the great blue pinafore in which she had enveloped Nan ."
"But the plan did not succeed , for Rob had heard the bustle , decided to go , and prepared himself , without a thought of disappointment ."
"The troop was just getting under way when the little man came marching downstairs with his best hat on , a bright tin pail in his hand , and a face beaming with satisfaction ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"now we shall have a scene , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer , who found her eldest son very hard to manage at times ."
"`` I 'm all ready , '' said Rob , and took his place in the ranks with such perfect unconsciousness of his mistake , that it really was very hard to undeceive him ."
"`` It 's too far for you , my love ; stay and take care of me , for I shall be all alone , '' began his mother ."
`` You 've got Teddy .
"I 'm a big boy , so I can go ; you said I might when I was bigger , and I am now , '' persisted Rob , with a cloud beginning to dim the brightness of his happy face ."
"`` We are going up to the great pasture , and it 's ever so far ; we do n't want you tagging on , '' cried Jack , who did not admire the little boys ."
"`` I wo n't tag , I 'll run and keep up ."
O Mamma !
let me go !
"I want to fill my new pail , and I 'll bring 'em all to you ."
"Please , please , I will be good ! ''"
"prayed Robby , looking up at his mother , so grieved and disappointed that her heart began to fail her ."
"`` But , my deary , you 'll get so tired and hot you wo n't have a good time ."
"I was dead weary , deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings ; the chill of the wind went through me , and the sound of it confused my ears ."
In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution .
"He spoke a good deal , and never without a taunt ."
`` Whig '' was the best name he had to give me .
"`` Here , '' he would say , `` here 's a dub for ye to jump , my Whiggie !"
I ken you 're a fine jumper ! ''
And so on ; all the time with a gibing voice and face .
"I knew it was my own doing , and no one else 's ; but I was too miserable to repent ."
"I felt I could drag myself but little farther ; pretty soon , I must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox , and my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast ."
"My head was light perhaps ; but I began to love the prospect , I began to glory in the thought of such a death , alone in the desert , with the wild eagles besieging my last moments ."
"Alan would repent then , I thought ; he would remember , when I was dead , how much he owed me , and the remembrance would be torture ."
"So I went like a sick , silly , and bad-hearted schoolboy , feeding my anger against a fellow-man , when I would have been better on my knees , crying on God for mercy ."
"And at each of Alan 's taunts , I hugged myself ."
`` Ah ! ''
"thinks I to myself , `` I have a better taunt in readiness ; when I lie down and die , you will feel it like a buffet in your face ; ah , what a revenge !"
"ah , how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty ! ''"
"All the while , I was growing worse and worse ."
"Once I had fallen , my leg simply doubling under me , and this had struck Alan for the moment ; but I was afoot so briskly , and set off again with such a natural manner , that he soon forgot the incident ."
"Flushes of heat went over me , and then spasms of shuddering ."
The stitch in my side was hardly bearable .
"At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther : and with that , there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan , let my anger blaze , and be done with my life in a more sudden manner ."
He had just called me `` Whig . ''
I stopped .
"`` Mr. Stewart , '' said I , in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string , `` you are older than I am , and should know your manners ."
Do you think it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth ?
"I thought , where folk differed , it was the part of gentlemen to differ civilly ; and if I did not , I may tell you I could find a better taunt than some of yours . ''"
"Alan had stopped opposite to me , his hat cocked , his hands in his breeches pockets , his head a little on one side ."
"He listened , smiling evilly , as I could see by the starlight ; and when I had done he began to whistle a Jacobite air ."
"It was the air made in mockery of General Cope 's defeat at Preston Pans : `` Hey , Johnnie Cope , are ye waukin ' yet ?"
And are your drums a-beatin ' yet ? ''
"And it came in my mind that Alan , on the day of that battle , had been engaged upon the royal side ."
"`` Why do ye take that air , Mr. Stewart ? ''"
"cried Frank , relenting ."
"`` Now , Jack , make their minds easy before they begin to weep and wail . ''"
`` Left the box outside .
"You tell while I go for it ; '' and Jack bolted , as if afraid the young ladies might be too demonstrative when the tale was told ."
"`` Tell away , '' said Frank , modestly passing the story along to Gus , who made short work of it ."
"`` We rampaged all over the country , and got only that small mess of greens ."
"Knew you 'd be disgusted , and sat down to see what we could do ."
"Then Jack piped up , and said he 'd show us a place where we could get a plenty ."
"` Come on , ' said we , and after leading us a nice tramp , he brought us out at Morse 's greenhouse ."
"So we got a few on tick , as we had but four cents among us , and there you are ."
"Pretty clever of the little chap , was n't it ? ''"
"A chorus of delight greeted Jack as he popped his head in , was promptly seized by his elders and walked up to the table , where the box was opened , displaying gay posies enough to fill most of the baskets if distributed with great economy and much green ."
`` You are the dearest boy that ever was ! ''
"began Jill , with her nose luxuriously buried in the box , though the flowers were more remarkable for color than perfume ."
"`` No , I 'm not ; there 's a much dearer one coming upstairs now , and he 's got something that will make you howl for joy , '' said Jack , ignoring his own prowess as Ed came in with a bigger box , looking as if he had done nothing but go a Maying all his days ."
`` Do n't believe it ! ''
"cried Jill , hugging her own treasure jealously ."
`` It 's only another joke .
"I wo n't look , '' said Molly , still struggling to make her cambric roses bloom again ."
`` I know what it is !
"Oh , how sweet ! ''"
"added Merry , sniffing , as Ed set the box before her , saying pleasantly , -- `` You shall see first , because you had faith . ''"
"Up went the cover , and a whiff of the freshest fragrance regaled the seven eager noses bent to inhale it , as a general murmur of pleasure greeted the nest of great , rosy mayflowers that lay before them ."
"`` The dear things , how lovely they are ! ''"
"and Merry looked as if greeting her cousins , so blooming and sweet was her own face ."
"Molly pushed her dingy garlands away , ashamed of such poor attempts beside these perfect works of nature , and Jill stretched out her hand involuntarily , as she said , forgetting her exotics , `` Give me just one to smell of , it is so woodsy and delicious . ''"
"`` Here you are , plenty for all ."
"Real Pilgrim Fathers , right from Plymouth ."
"One of our fellows lives there , and I told him to bring me a good lot ; so he did , and you can do what you like with them , '' explained Ed , passing round bunches and shaking the rest in a mossy pile upon the table ."
`` Ed always gets ahead of us in doing the right thing at the right time .
"Hope you 've got some first-class baskets ready for him , '' said Gus , refreshing the Washingtonian nose with a pink blossom or two ."
"`` Not much danger of his being forgotten , '' answered Molly ; and every one laughed , for Ed was much beloved by all the girls , and his door-steps always bloomed like a flower-bed on May eve ."
"There 's hills and heather enough between here and the two seas , David ; and I will own I 'm no very keen to stay where I 'm no wanted . ''"
"This pierced me like a sword , and seemed to lay bare my private disloyalty ."
`` Alan Breck ! ''
I cried ; and then : `` Do you think I am one to turn my back on you in your chief need ?
You durs n't say it to my face .
My whole conduct 's there to give the lie to it .
"It 's true , I fell asleep upon the muir ; but that was from weariness , and you do wrong to cast it up to me -- '' `` Which is what I never did , '' said Alan ."
"`` But aside from that , '' I continued , `` what have I done that you should even me to dogs by such a supposition ?"
"I never yet failed a friend , and it 's not likely I 'll begin with you ."
"There are things between us that I can never forget , even if you can . ''"
"`` I will only say this to ye , David , '' said Alan , very quietly , `` that I have long been owing ye my life , and now I owe ye money ."
Ye should try to make that burden light for me . ''
"This ought to have touched me , and in a manner it did , but the wrong manner ."
"I felt I was behaving badly ; and was now not only angry with Alan , but angry with myself in the bargain ; and it made me the more cruel ."
"`` You asked me to speak , '' said I. `` Well , then , I will ."
"You own yourself that you have done me a disservice ; I have had to swallow an affront : I have never reproached you , I never named the thing till you did ."
"And now you blame me , '' cried I , `` because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was glad to be affronted ."
The next thing will be that I 'm to go down upon my knees and thank you for it !
"Ye should think more of others , Alan Breck ."
"If ye thought more of others , ye would perhaps speak less about yourself ; and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an offence without a word , you would be blithe to let it lie , instead of making it a stick to break his back with ."
"By your own way of it , it was you that was to blame ; then it shouldnae be you to seek the quarrel . ''"
"`` Aweel , '' said Alan , `` say nae mair . ''"
"And we fell back into our former silence ; and came to our journey 's end , and supped , and lay down to sleep , without another word ."
"The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day , and gave us his opinion as to our best route ."
"This was to get us up at once into the tops of the mountains : to go round by a circuit , turning the heads of Glen Lyon , Glen Lochay , and Glen Dochart , and come down upon the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the Forth ."
"Alan was little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his blood-foes , the Glenorchy Campbells ."
"He objected that by turning to the east , we should come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts , a race of his own name and lineage , although following a different chief , and come besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were bound ."
"But the gillie , who was indeed the chief man of Cluny 's scouts , had good reasons to give him on all hands , naming the force of troops in every district , and alleging finally -LRB- as well as I could understand -RRB- that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the Campbells ."
"Alan gave way at last , but with only half a heart ."
"`` It 's one of the dowiest countries in Scotland , '' said he ."
"`` There 's naething there that I ken , but heath , and crows , and Campbells ."
But I see that ye 're a man of some penetration ; and be it as ye please ! ''
"It was now his business to seek out the Duke of Gloucester , who alone , in the disorder of the forces , might be able to supply him with a sufficiency of men ."
"The fighting in the main town was now practically at an end ; and as Dick ran hither and thither , seeking the commander , the streets were thick with wandering soldiers , some laden with more booty than they could well stagger under , others shouting drunk ."
"None of them , when questioned , had the least notion of the duke 's whereabouts ; and , at last , it was by sheer good fortune that Dick found him , where he sat in the saddle directing operations to dislodge the archers from the harbour side ."
"`` Sir Richard Shelton , ye are well found , '' he said ."
"`` I owe you one thing that I value little , my life ; and one that I can never pay you for , this victory ."
"Catesby , if I had ten such captains as Sir Richard , I would march forthright on London ."
"But now , sir , claim your reward . ''"
"`` Freely , my lord , '' said Dick , `` freely and loudly ."
"One hath escaped to whom I owe some grudges , and taken with him one whom I owe love and service ."
"Give me , then , fifty lances , that I may pursue ; and for any obligation that your graciousness is pleased to allow , it shall be clean discharged . ''"
`` How call ye him ? ''
inquired the duke .
"`` Sir Daniel Brackley , '' answered Richard ."
"`` Out upon him , double-face ! ''"
cried Gloucester .
"`` Here is no reward , Sir Richard ; here is fresh service offered , and , if that ye bring his head to me , a fresh debt upon my conscience ."
"Catesby , get him these lances ; and you , sir , bethink ye , in the meanwhile , what pleasure , honour , or profit it shall be mine to give you . ''"
"Just then the Yorkist skirmishers carried one of the shoreside taverns , swarming in upon it on three sides , and driving out or taking its defenders ."
"Crookback Dick was pleased to cheer the exploit , and pushing his horse a little nearer , called to see the prisoners ."
"There were four or five of them -- two men of my Lord Shoreby 's and one of Lord Risingham 's among the number , and last , but in Dick 's eyes not least , a tall , shambling , grizzled old shipman , between drunk and sober , and with a dog whimpering and jumping at his heels ."
The young duke passed them for a moment under a severe review .
"`` Good , '' he said ."
`` Hang them . ''
And he turned the other way to watch the progress of the fight .
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` so please you , I have found my reward ."
Grant me the life and liberty of yon old shipman . ''
Gloucester turned and looked the speaker in the face .
"`` Sir Richard , '' he said , `` I make not war with peacock 's feathers , but steel shafts ."
"Those that are mine enemies I slay , and that without excuse or favour ."
"For , bethink ye , in this realm of England , that is so torn in pieces , there is not a man of mine but hath a brother or a friend upon the other party ."
"If , then , I did begin to grant these pardons , I might sheathe my sword . ''"
"`` It may be so , my lord ; and yet I will be overbold , and at the risk of your disfavour , recall your lordship 's promise , '' replied Dick ."
`` What can he do ?
He hath but a handful .
"Alack , if it were but to-morrow -- could I but keep a certain tryst an hour before noon to-morrow -- all were , I think , otherwise ."
But now there is no help . ''
"`` Well , '' concluded Lawless , `` an ye will stand to it for my innocence , I will stand to it for yours , and that stoutly ."
"It shall naught avail us ; but an I be to hang , it shall not be for lack of swearing . ''"
"And then , while Dick gave himself over to his reflections , the old rogue curled himself down into a corner , pulled his monkish hood about his face , and composed himself to sleep ."
"Soon he was loudly snoring , so utterly had his long life of hardship and adventure blunted the sense of apprehension ."
"It was long after noon , and the day was already failing , before the door was opened and Dick taken forth and led up-stairs to where , in a warm cabinet , Earl Risingham sat musing over the fire ."
On his captive 's entrance he looked up .
"`` Sir , '' he said , `` I knew your father , who was a man of honour , and this inclineth me to be the more lenient ; but I may not hide from you that heavy charges lie against your character ."
"Ye do consort with murderers and robbers ; upon a clear probation ye have carried war against the king 's peace ; ye are suspected to have piratically seized upon a ship ; ye are found skulking with a counterfeit presentment in your enemy 's house ; a man is slain that very evening -- '' `` An it like you , my lord , '' Dick interposed , `` I will at once avow my guilt , such as it is ."
I slew this fellow Rutter ; and to the proof '' -- searching in his bosom -- `` here is a letter from his wallet . ''
"Lord Risingham took the letter , and opened and read it twice ."
`` Ye have read this ? ''
he inquired .
"`` I have read it , '' answered Dick ."
`` Are ye for York or Lancaster ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` My lord , it was but a little while back that I was asked that question , and knew not how to answer it , '' said Dick ; `` but having answered once , I will not vary ."
"My lord , I am for York . ''"
The earl nodded approvingly .
"`` Honestly replied , '' he said ."
"`` But wherefore , then , deliver me this letter ? ''"
"`` Nay , but against traitors , my lord , are not all sides arrayed ? ''"
cried Dick .
"`` I would they were , young gentleman , '' returned the earl ; `` and I do at least approve your saying ."
"There is more youth than guile in you , I do perceive ; and were not Sir Daniel a mighty man upon our side , I were half-tempted to espouse your quarrel ."
"For I have inquired , and it appears ye have been hardly dealt with , and have much excuse ."
"But look ye , sir , I am , before all else , a leader in the queen 's interest ; and though by nature a just man , as I believe , and leaning even to the excess of mercy , yet must I order my goings for my party 's interest , and , to keep Sir Daniel , I would go far about . ''"
"`` My lord , '' returned Dick , `` ye will think me very bold to counsel you ; but do ye count upon Sir Daniel 's faith ?"
Methought he had changed sides intolerably often . ''
"` It shall be done , ' answered the youth ; ` but you must give me two years to manage it , for my beard must grow so that he may not know me . '"
"` So be it , ' said the king ."
"And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon 's house and on the way he met a beggar , whom he persuaded to change clothes with him , and in the beggar 's garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon ."
"He found his enemy before his house , very busy making a box , and addressed him politely , ` Good morning , your worship ."
Have you a morsel of bread ? '
"` You must wait , ' replied the dragon , 'till I have finished my box , and then I will see if I can find one . '"
` What will you do with the box when it is made ? '
inquired the beggar .
"` It is for the young man who killed my wife , and stole my flying horse and my bed covering , ' said the dragon ."
"` He deserves nothing better , ' answered the beggar , ` for it was an ill deed ."
"Still that box is too small for him , for he is a big man . '"
"` You are wrong , ' said the dragon ."
` The box is large enough even for me . '
"` Well , the rogue is nearly as tall as you , ' replied the beggar , ` and , of course , if you can get in , he can ."
But I am sure you would find it a tight fit . '
"` No , there is plenty of room , ' said the dragon , tucking himself carefully inside ."
"But no sooner was he well in , than the young man clapped on the lid and called out , ` Now press hard , just to see if he will be able to get out . '"
"The dragon pressed as hard as he could , but the lid never moved ."
"` It is all right , ' he cried ; ` now you can open it . '"
"But instead of opening it , the young man drove in long nails to make it tighter still ; then he took the box on his back and brought it to the king ."
"And when the king heard that the dragon was inside , he was so excited that he would not wait one moment , but broke the lock and lifted the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there ."
"He was very careful not to leave enough space for the dragon to jump out , but unluckily there was just room for his great mouth , and with one snap the king vanished down his wide red jaws ."
"Then the young man married the king 's daughter and ruled over the land , but what he did with the dragon nobody knows ."
The Goblin and the Grocer Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
"There was once a hard-working student who lived in an attic , and he had nothing in the world of his own ."
"There was also a hard-working grocer who lived on the first floor , and he had the whole house for his own ."
"The Goblin belonged to him , for every Christmas Eve there was waiting for him at the grocer 's a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the middle ."
"The grocer could afford this , so the Goblin stayed in the grocer 's shop ; and this teaches us a good deal ."
"One evening the student came in by the back door to buy a candle and some cheese ; he had no one to send , so he came himself ."
"He got what he wanted , paid for it , and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife -LRB- she was a woman who could do more than nod ; she could talk -RRB- ."
"When the student had said good night he suddenly stood still , reading the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped ."
It was a leaf torn out of an old book -- a book of poetry ` There 's more of that over there ! '
"I turned my back , accordingly , upon the sea , and did not look again till I had counted many hundreds ."
The boat was still heading for the island .
"The next time I counted the full thousand , as slowly as I could , my heart beating so as to hurt me ."
And then it was out of all question .
She was coming straight to Earraid !
"I could no longer hold myself back , but ran to the seaside and out , from one rock to another , as far as I could go ."
"It is a marvel I was not drowned ; for when I was brought to a stand at last , my legs shook under me , and my mouth was so dry , I must wet it with the sea-water before I was able to shout ."
All this time the boat was coming on ; and now I was able to perceive it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday .
"This I knew by their hair , which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black ."
"But now there was a third man along with them , who looked to be of a better class ."
"As soon as they were come within easy speech , they let down their sail and lay quiet ."
"In spite of my supplications , they drew no nearer in , and what frightened me most of all , the new man tee-hee 'd with laughter as he talked and looked at me ."
"Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while , speaking fast and with many wavings of his hand ."
"I told him I had no Gaelic ; and at this he became very angry , and I began to suspect he thought he was talking English ."
"Listening very close , I caught the word `` whateffer '' several times ; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and Hebrew for me ."
"`` Whatever , '' said I , to show him I had caught a word ."
"`` Yes , yes -- yes , yes , '' says he , and then he looked at the other men , as much as to say , `` I told you I spoke English , '' and began again as hard as ever in the Gaelic ."
"This time I picked out another word , `` tide . ''"
Then I had a flash of hope .
I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the Ross .
`` Do you mean when the tide is out -- ? ''
"I cried , and could not finish ."
"`` Yes , yes , '' said he ."
`` Tide . ''
"At that I turned tail upon their boat -LRB- where my adviser had once more begun to tee-hee with laughter -RRB- , leaped back the way I had come , from one stone to another , and set off running across the isle as I had never run before ."
"In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the creek ; and , sure enough , it was shrunk into a little trickle of water , through which I dashed , not above my knees , and landed with a shout on the main island ."
"A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid ; which is only what they call a tidal islet , and except in the bottom of the neaps , can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours , either dry-shod , or at the most by wading ."
"Even I , who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay , and even watched for the ebbs , the better to get my shellfish -- even I -LRB- I say -RRB- if I had sat down to think , instead of raging at my fate , must have soon guessed the secret , and got free ."
It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me .
"The wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion , and taken the trouble to come back ."
I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours .
"But for the fishers , I might have left my bones there , in pure folly ."
I do n't mind as long as Grandma is all right .
"She is away to-night , or I should not be here , '' he added , as if some excuse was necessary ."
"Merry needed no hint , for her tender heart was touched by the vision of her friend in a garret , and she suddenly rejoiced that there was ham and eggs for supper , so that he might be well fed once , at least , before he went away to feed on artistic crusts ."
"`` Being here , come in and spend the evening ."
"The boys will like to hear the news , and so will father ."
"Do , now . ''"
"It was impossible to refuse the invitation he had been longing for , and in they went to the great delight of Roxy , who instantly retired to the pantry , smiling significantly , and brought out the most elaborate pie in honor of the occasion ."
"Merry touched up the table , and put a little vase of flowers in the middle to redeem the vulgarity of doughnuts ."
"Of course the boys upset it , but as there was company nothing was said , and Ralph devoured his supper with the appetite of a hungry boy , while watching Merry eat bread and cream out of an old-fashioned silver porringer , and thinking it the sweetest sight he ever beheld ."
"Then the young people gathered about the table , full of the new plans , and the elders listened as they rested after the week 's work ."
"A pleasant evening , for they all liked Ralph , but as the parents watched Merry sitting among the great lads like a little queen among her subjects , half unconscious as yet of the power in her hands , they nodded to one another , and then shook their heads as if they said , -- `` I 'm afraid the time is coming , mother . ''"
"`` No danger as long as she do n't know it , father . ''"
"At nine the boys went off to the barn , the farmer to wind up the eight-day clock , and the housewife to see how the baked beans and Indian pudding for to-morrow were getting on in the oven ."
"Ralph took up his hat to go , saying as he looked at the shade on the tall student lamp , -- `` What a good light that gives !"
"I can see it as I go home every night , and it burns up here like a beacon ."
"I always look for it , and it hardly ever fails to be burning ."
"Sort of cheers up the way , you know , when I 'm tired or low in my mind . ''"
`` Then I 'm very glad I got it .
"I liked the shape , but the boys laughed at it as they did at my bulrushes in a ginger-jar over there ."
"I 'd been reading about ` household art , ' and I thought I 'd try a little , '' answered Merry , laughing at her own whims ."
"`` You 've got a better sort of household art , I think , for you make people happy and places pretty , without fussing over it ."
"This room is ever so much improved every time I come , though I hardly see what it is except the flowers , '' said Ralph , looking from the girl to the tall calla that bent its white cup above her as if to pour its dew upon her head ."
`` Is n't that lovely ?
I tried to draw it -- the shape was so graceful I wanted to keep it .
But I could n't .
Is n't it a pity such beautiful things wo n't last forever ? ''
and Merry looked regretfully at the half-faded one that grew beside the fresh blossom .
`` I can keep it for you .
It would look well in plaster .
May I ? ''
asked Ralph .
"`` Thank you , I should like that very much ."
"The ground became more and more uneven , full of pits and hillocks ."
"And with every step of the ascent the wind still blew the shriller , and the trees bent before the gusts like fishing-rods ."
"They had just entered one of the clearings , when Dick suddenly clapped down upon his face among the brambles , and began to crawl slowly backward towards the shelter of the grove ."
"Matcham , in great bewilderment , for he could see no reason for this flight , still imitated his companion 's course ; and it was not until they had gained the harbour of a thicket that he turned and begged him to explain ."
"For all reply , Dick pointed with his finger ."
"At the far end of the clearing , a fir grew high above the neighbouring wood , and planted its black shock of foliage clear against the sky ."
For about fifty feet above the ground the trunk grew straight and solid like a column .
"At that level , it split into two massive boughs ; and in the fork , like a mast-headed seaman , there stood a man in a green tabard , spying far and wide ."
"The sun glistened upon his hair ; with one hand he shaded his eyes to look abroad , and he kept slowly rolling his head from side to side , with the regularity of a machine ."
The lads exchanged glances .
"`` Let us try to the left , '' said Dick ."
"`` We had near fallen foully , Jack . ''"
Ten minutes afterwards they struck into a beaten path .
"`` Here is a piece of forest that I know not , '' Dick remarked ."
`` Where goeth me this track ? ''
"`` Let us even try , '' said Matcham ."
"A few yards further , the path came to the top of a ridge and began to go down abruptly into a cup-shaped hollow ."
"At the foot , out of a thick wood of flowering hawthorn , two or three roofless gables , blackened as if by fire , and a single tall chimney marked the ruins of a house ."
`` What may this be ? ''
whispered Matcham .
"`` Nay , by the mass , I know not , '' answered Dick ."
`` I am all at sea .
Let us go warily . ''
"With beating hearts , they descended through the hawthorns ."
"Here and there , they passed signs of recent cultivation ; fruit trees and pot herbs ran wild among the thicket ; a sun-dial had fallen in the grass ; it seemed they were treading what once had been a garden ."
Yet a little farther and they came forth before the ruins of the house .
It had been a pleasant mansion and a strong .
"A dry ditch was dug deep about it ; but it was now choked with masonry , and bridged by a fallen rafter ."
"The two farther walls still stood , the sun shining through their empty windows ; but the remainder of the building had collapsed , and now lay in a great cairn of ruin , grimed with fire ."
Already in the interior a few plants were springing green among the chinks .
"`` Now I bethink me , '' whispered Dick , `` this must be Grimstone ."
It was a hold of one Simon Malmesbury ; Sir Daniel was his bane !
The pace was deadly : my heart seemed bursting against my ribs ; and I had neither time to think nor breath to speak with .
"Only I remember seeing with wonder , that Alan every now and then would straighten himself to his full height and look back ; and every time he did so , there came a great far-away cheering and crying of the soldiers ."
"Quarter of an hour later , Alan stopped , clapped down flat in the heather , and turned to me ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` it 's earnest ."
"Do as I do , for your life . ''"
"And at the same speed , but now with infinitely more precaution , we traced back again across the mountain-side by the same way that we had come , only perhaps higher ; till at last Alan threw himself down in the upper wood of Lettermore , where I had found him at the first , and lay , with his face in the bracken , panting like a dog ."
"My own sides so ached , my head so swam , my tongue so hung out of my mouth with heat and dryness , that I lay beside him like one dead ."
CHAPTER XVIII I TALK WITH ALAN IN THE WOOD OF LETTERMORE Alan was the first to come round .
"He rose , went to the border of the wood , peered out a little , and then returned and sat down ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` yon was a hot burst , David . ''"
"I said nothing , nor so much as lifted my face ."
"I had seen murder done , and a great , ruddy , jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment ; the pity of that sight was still sore within me , and yet that was but a part of my concern ."
"Here was murder done upon the man Alan hated ; here was Alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops ; and whether his was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered , signified but little ."
"By my way of it , my only friend in that wild country was blood-guilty in the first degree ; I held him in horror ; I could not look upon his face ; I would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold isle , than in that warm wood beside a murderer ."
`` Are ye still wearied ? ''
he asked again .
"`` No , '' said I , still with my face in the bracken ; `` no , I am not wearied now , and I can speak ."
"You and me must twine , '' * I said ."
"`` I liked you very well , Alan , but your ways are not mine , and they 're not God 's : and the short and the long of it is just that we must twine . ''"
* Part .
"`` I will hardly twine from ye , David , without some kind of reason for the same , '' said Alan , mighty gravely ."
"`` If ye ken anything against my reputation , it 's the least thing that ye should do , for old acquaintance ' sake , to let me hear the name of it ; and if ye have only taken a distaste to my society , it will be proper for me to judge if I 'm insulted . ''"
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` what is the sense of this ?"
Ye ken very well yon Campbell-man lies in his blood upon the road . ''
"He was silent for a little ; then says he , `` Did ever ye hear tell of the story of the Man and the Good People ? ''"
-- by which he meant the fairies .
"`` No , '' said I , `` nor do I want to hear it . ''"
"`` With your permission , Mr. Balfour , I will tell it you , whatever , '' says Alan ."
"`` The man , ye should ken , was cast upon a rock in the sea , where it appears the Good People were in use to come and rest as they went through to Ireland ."
"The name of this rock is called the Skerryvore , and it 's not far from where we suffered ship-wreck ."
"Well , it seems the man cried so sore , if he could just see his little bairn before he died !"
"that at last the king of the Good People took peety upon him , and sent one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke * and laid it down beside the man where he lay sleeping ."
"`` Well , I will ; but it 's too bad of Kitty-mouse to want our very nicest things , '' sighed Daisy ."
"`` A sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of , so we must , '' explained Demi , to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing Uncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the big boys who were reading about them in school ."
"`` Is Rob coming too , '' asked Daisy ."
"`` Yes , and he is going to bring his toy village ; it is all made of wood , you know , and will burn nicely ."
"We 'll have a grand bonfire , and see them blaze up , wo n't we ? ''"
"This brilliant prospect consoled Daisy , and she ate her dinner with a row of paper dolls before her , as a sort of farewell banquet ."
"At the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth , each child bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kitty-mouse ."
"Teddy insisted on going also , and seeing that all the others had toys , he tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm , and old Annabella under the other , little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him ."
"`` Where are you going , my chickens ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , as the flock passed her door ."
`` To play by the big rock ; ca n't we ? ''
"`` Yes , only do n't do near the pond , and take good care of baby . ''"
"`` I always do , '' said Daisy , leading forth her charge with a capable air ."
"`` Now , you must all sit round , and not move till I tell you ."
"This flat stone is an altar , and I am going to make a fire on it . ''"
"Demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze , as he had seen the boys do at picnics ."
"When the flame burned well , he ordered the company to march round it three times and then stand in a circle ."
"`` I shall begin , and as fast as my things are burnt , you must bring yours . ''"
"With that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures , pasted in by himself ; this was followed by a dilapidated boat , and then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death ."
"Not one faltered or hung back , from the splendid red and yellow captain to the small drummer who had lost his legs ; all vanished in the flames and mingled in one common pool of melted lead ."
"`` Now , Daisy ! ''"
"called the high priest of Kitty-mouse , when his rich offerings had been consumed , to the great satisfaction of the children ."
"`` My dear dollies , how can I let them go ? ''"
"moaned Daisy , hugging the entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe ."
"`` You must , '' commanded Demi ; and with a farewell kiss to each , Daisy laid her blooming dolls upon the coals ."
"`` Let me keep one , the dear blue thing , she is so sweet , '' besought the poor little mamma , clutching her last in despair ."
`` More !
more ! ''
"growled an awful voice , and Demi cried , `` that 's the Kitty-mouse !"
"she must have every one , quick , or she will scratch us . ''"
"In went the precious blue belle , flounces , rosy hat , and all , and nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band ."
"`` Stand the houses and trees round , and let them catch themselves ; it will be like a real fire then , '' said Demi , who liked variety even in his `` sackerryfices . ''"
"About a mile from Kettley , Dick came to one such break in the plain line of causeway , where the reeds and willows grew dispersedly like little islands and confused the eye ."
"The gap , besides , was more than usually long ; it was a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief ; and Dick bethought him , with something like a pang , of the lad whom he had so imperfectly directed ."
"As for himself , one look backward to where the windmill sails were turning black against the blue of heaven -- one look forward to the high ground of Tunstall Forest , and he was sufficiently directed and held straight on , the water washing to his horse 's knees , as safe as on a highway ."
"Half-way across , and when he had already sighted the path rising high and dry upon the farther side , he was aware of a great splashing on his right , and saw a grey horse , sunk to its belly in the mud , and still spasmodically struggling ."
"Instantly , as though it had divined the neighbourhood of help , the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly ."
"It rolled , meanwhile , a blood-shot eye , insane with terror ; and as it sprawled wallowing in the quag , clouds of stinging insects rose and buzzed about it in the air ."
`` Alack ! ''
"thought Dick , `` can the poor lad have perished ?"
"There is his horse , for certain -- a brave grey !"
"Nay , comrade , if thou criest to me so piteously , I will do all man can to help thee ."
Shalt not lie there to drown by inches ! ''
"And he made ready his crossbow , and put a quarrel through the creature 's head ."
"Dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy , somewhat sobered in spirit , and looking closely about him for any sign of his less happy predecessor in the way ."
"`` I would I had dared to tell him further , '' he thought ; `` for I fear he has miscarried in the slough . ''"
"And just as he was so thinking , a voice cried upon his name from the causeway side , and , looking over his shoulder , he saw the lad 's face peering from a clump of reeds ."
`` Are ye there ? ''
"he said , reining in ."
`` Ye lay so close among the reeds that I had passed you by .
"I saw your horse bemired , and put him from his agony ; which , by my sooth !"
"an ye had been a more merciful rider , ye had done yourself ."
But come forth out of your hiding .
Here be none to trouble you . ''
"`` Nay , good boy , I have no arms , nor skill to use them if I had , '' replied the other , stepping forth upon the pathway ."
`` Why call me ` boy ' ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` Y ' are not , I trow , the elder of us twain . ''"
"`` Good Master Shelton , '' said the other , `` prithee forgive me ."
I have none the least intention to offend .
"Rather I would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour , for I am now worse bested than ever , having lost my way , my cloak , and my poor horse ."
"To have a riding-rod and spurs , and never a horse to sit upon !"
"And before all , '' he added , looking ruefully upon his clothes -- `` before all , to be so sorrily besmirched ! ''"
`` Tut ! ''
I fondly expected it would turn my hair black -- and it turned it green .
So it had to be cut off . ''
"`` You had a narrow escape , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' exclaimed Susan ."
`` Of course you were too young then to know what a German was .
It was a special mercy of Providence that it was only green dye and not poison . ''
"`` It seems hundreds of years since those Green Gables days , '' sighed Mrs. Blythe ."
`` They belonged to another world altogether .
Life has been cut in two by the chasm of war .
What is ahead I do n't know -- but it ca n't be a bit like the past .
I wonder if those of us who have lived half our lives in the old world will ever feel wholly at home in the new . ''
"`` Have you noticed , '' asked Miss Oliver , glancing up from her book , `` how everything written before the war seems so far away now , too ?"
One feels as if one was reading something as ancient as the Iliad .
This poem of Wordsworth 's -- the Senior class have it in their entrance work -- I 've been glancing over it .
"Its classic calm and repose and the beauty of the lines seem to belong to another planet , and to have as little to do with the present world-welter as the evening star . ''"
"`` The only thing that I find much comfort in reading nowadays is the Bible , '' remarked Susan , whisking her biscuits into the oven ."
`` There are so many passages in it that seem to me exactly descriptive of the Huns .
"Old Highland Sandy declares that there is no doubt that the Kaiser is the Anti-Christ spoken of in Revelations , but I do not go as far as that ."
"It would , in my humble opinion , Mrs. Dr. dear , be too great an honour for him . ''"
"Early one morning , several days later , Miranda Pryor slipped up to Ingleside , ostensibly to get some Red Cross sewing , but in reality to talk over with sympathetic Rilla troubles that were past bearing alone ."
"She brought her dog with her -- an over-fed , bandy-legged little animal very dear to her heart because Joe Milgrave had given it to her when it was a puppy ."
Mr. Pryor regarded all dogs with disfavour ; but in those days he had looked kindly upon Joe as a suitor for Miranda 's hand and so he had allowed her to keep the puppy .
"Miranda was so grateful that she endeavoured to please her father by naming her dog after his political idol , the great Liberal chieftain , Sir Wilfrid Laurier -- though his title was soon abbreviated to Wilfy ."
Sir Wilfrid grew and flourished and waxed fat ; but Miranda spoiled him absurdly and nobody else liked him .
Rilla especially hated him because of his detestable trick of lying flat on his back and entreating you with waving paws to tickle his sleek stomach .
"When she saw that Miranda 's pale eyes bore unmistakable testimony of her having cried all night , Rilla asked her to come up to her room , knowing Miranda had a tale of woe to tell , but she ordered Sir Wilfrid to remain below ."
"`` Oh , ca n't he come , too ? ''"
said Miranda wistfully .
`` Poor Wilfy wo n't be any bother -- and I wiped his paws so carefully before I brought him in .
He is always so lonesome in a strange place without me -- and very soon he 'll be -- all -- I 'll have left -- to remind me -- of Joe . ''
"Rilla yielded , and Sir Wilfrid , with his tail curled at a saucy angle over his brindled back , trotted triumphantly up the stairs before them ."
"`` Oh , Rilla , '' sobbed Miranda , when they had reached sanctuary ."
`` I 'm so unhappy .
"`` It is easy to try that , '' says Alan ."
"Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal possession , and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose , and which is made of old whiskey , strained honey and sweet cream , slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion ."
"The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel ; but down they sat , one upon each side of the peat fire , with a mighty show of politeness ."
"Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and `` the wife 's brose , '' reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection ."
But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath .
"`` I would have ye to remark , sir , '' said Alan , `` that I havenae broken bread for near upon ten hours , which will be worse for the breath than any brose in Scotland . ''"
"`` I will take no advantages , Mr. Stewart , '' replied Robin ."
`` Eat and drink ; I 'll follow you . ''
"Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to Mrs. Maclaren ; and then after a great number of civilities , Robin took the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner ."
"`` Ay , ye can blow '' said Alan ; and taking the instrument from his rival , he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin 's ; and then wandered into variations , which , as he went on , he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes , such as pipers love , and call the `` warblers . ''"
"I had been pleased with Robin 's playing , Alan 's ravished me ."
"`` That 's no very bad , Mr. Stewart , '' said the rival , `` but ye show a poor device in your warblers . ''"
`` Me ! ''
"cried Alan , the blood starting to his face ."
`` I give ye the lie . ''
"`` Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes , then , '' said Robin , `` that ye seek to change them for the sword ? ''"
"`` And that 's very well said , Mr. Macgregor , '' returned Alan ; `` and in the meantime '' -LRB- laying a strong accent on the word -RRB- `` I take back the lie ."
I appeal to Duncan . ''
"`` Indeed , ye need appeal to naebody , '' said Robin ."
`` Ye 're a far better judge than any Maclaren in Balquhidder : for it 's a God 's truth that you 're a very creditable piper for a Stewart .
Hand me the pipes . ''
"Alan did as he asked ; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of Alan 's variations , which it seemed that he remembered perfectly ."
"`` Ay , ye have music , '' said Alan , gloomily ."
"`` And now be the judge yourself , Mr. Stewart , '' said Robin ; and taking up the variations from the beginning , he worked them throughout to so new a purpose , with such ingenuity and sentiment , and with so odd a fancy and so quick a knack in the grace-notes , that I was amazed to hear him ."
"As for Alan , his face grew dark and hot , and he sat and gnawed his fingers , like a man under some deep affront ."
`` Enough ! ''
he cried .
`` Ye can blow the pipes -- make the most of that . ''
And he made as if to rise .
"But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence , and struck into the slow measure of a pibroch ."
"It was a fine piece of music in itself , and nobly played ; but it seems , besides , it was a piece peculiar to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan ."
"The first notes were scarce out , before there came a change in his face ; when the time quickened , he seemed to grow restless in his seat ; and long before that piece was at an end , the last signs of his anger died from him , and he had no thought but for the music ."
"Mrs. Milton White says she never met a perfect person , but she 's heard enough about one ... her husband 's first wife ."
Do n't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect ? ''
"`` It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife , '' declared Mr. Harrison , with a sudden and inexplicable warmth ."
"When tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes , although Mr. Harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks yet ."
"She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also , but no broom was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there was n't one at all ."
"`` You might run across and talk to me once in a while , '' suggested Mr. Harrison when she was leaving . ''"
'T is n't far and folks ought to be neighborly .
I 'm kind of interested in that society of yours .
Seems to me there 'll be some fun in it .
Who are you going to tackle first ? ''
"`` We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE ... it is only PLACES we mean to improve , '' said Anne , in a dignified tone ."
She rather suspected that Mr. Harrison was making fun of the project .
"When she had gone Mr. Harrison watched her from the window ... a lithe , girlish shape , tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset afterglow ."
"`` I 'm a crusty , lonesome , crabbed old chap , '' he said aloud , `` but there 's something about that little girl makes me feel young again ... and it 's such a pleasant sensation I 'd like to have it repeated once in a while . ''"
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' croaked Ginger mockingly ."
Mr. Harrison shook his fist at the parrot .
"`` You ornery bird , '' he muttered , `` I almost wish I 'd wrung your neck when my brother the sailor brought you home ."
Will you never be done getting me into trouble ? ''
"Anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla , who had been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of starting out to look for her ."
"`` It 's a pretty good world , after all , is n't it , Marilla ? ''"
concluded Anne happily .
`` Mrs. Lynde was complaining the other day that it was n't much of a world .
She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed ... perhaps that is true .
But there is a good side to it too .
The bad things do n't always come up to your expectations either ... they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think .
I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant experience when I went over to Mr. Harrison 's tonight ; and instead he was quite kind and I had almost a nice time .
"I think we 're going to be real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other , and everything has turned out for the best ."
"But all the same , Marilla , I shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she belongs ."
And I do NOT like parrots ! ''
"IV Different Opinions One evening at sunset , Jane Andrews , Gilbert Blythe , and Anne Shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs , where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road ."
"Jane had been up to spend the afternoon with Anne , who walked part of the way home with her ; at the fence they met Gilbert , and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow ; for that morrow was the first of September and the schools would open ."
Jane would go to Newbridge and Gilbert to White Sands .
"`` Come on , Nat , '' he said , and slouched out again ."
"`` Thank you , ma'am , '' added Nat , as he followed him , feeling without quite understanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his ungracious friend ."
`` The fellows are having a circus out in the barn ; do n't you want to come and see it ? ''
"he asked , as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn ."
`` Are they big fellows ? ''
said Dan .
`` No ; the big ones are gone fishing . ''
"`` Fire away , then , '' said Dan ."
"Nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set , who were disporting themselves among the half-empty lofts ."
"A large circle was marked out with hay on the wide floor , and in the middle stood Demi with a long whip , while Tommy , mounted on the much-enduring Toby , pranced about the circle playing being a monkey ."
"`` You must pay a pin apiece , or you ca n't see the show , '' said Stuffy , who stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band , consisting of a pocket-comb blown upon by Ned , and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by Rob ."
"`` He 's company , so I 'll pay for both , '' said Nat , handsomely , as he stuck two crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as money-box ."
"With a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards , and the performance went on ."
"After the monkey act , Ned gave them a fine specimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair , and running up and down ladders , sailor fashion ."
Then Demi danced a jig with a gravity beautiful to behold .
"Nat was called upon to wrestle with Stuffy , and speedily laid that stout youth upon the ground ."
"After this , Tommy proudly advanced to turn a somersault , an accomplishment which he had acquired by painful perseverance , practising in private till every joint of his little frame was black and blue ."
"His feats were received with great applause , and he was about to retire , flushed with pride and a rush of blood to the head , when a scornful voice in the audience was heard to say , `` Ho !"
that ai n't any thing ! ''
"`` Say that again , will you ? ''"
and Tommy bristled up like an angry turkey-cock .
`` Do you want to fight ? ''
"said Dan , promptly descending from the barrel and doubling up his fists in a business-like manner ."
"`` No , I do n't ; '' and the candid Thomas retired a step , rather taken aback by the proposition ."
`` Fighting is n't allowed ! ''
"cried the others , much excited ."
"`` You 're a nice lot , '' sneered Dan ."
"`` Come , if you do n't behave , you sha n't stay , '' said Nat , firing up at that insult to his friends ."
"`` I 'd like to see him do better than I did , that 's all , '' observed Tommy , with a swagger ."
"`` Clear the way , then , '' and without the slightest preparation Dan turned three somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet ."
"`` You ca n't beat that , Tom ; you always hit your head and tumble flat , '' said Nat , pleased at his friend 's success ."
"Before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more somersaults backwards , and a short promenade on the hands , head down , feet up ."
"We promised Ed to stand by Bob , so I did as well as I knew how ; '' and Jack seemed to think that was about all there was to say ."
`` I never saw such a fellow for keeping a promise !
"You stick to it through thick and thin , no matter how silly or hard it is ."
"You remember , mother , last summer , how you told him not to go in a boat and he promised , the day we went on the picnic ."
"We rode up , but the horse ran off home , so we had to come back by way of the river , all but Jack , and he walked every step of five miles because he would n't go near a boat , though Mr. Burton was there to take care of him ."
I call that rather overdoing the matter ; '' and Frank looked as if he thought moderation even in virtue a good thing .
`` And I call it a fine sample of entire obedience .
"He obeyed orders , and that is what we all must do , without always seeing why , or daring to use our own judgment ."
"It is a great safeguard to Jack , and a very great comfort to me ; for I know that if he promises he will keep his word , no matter what it costs him , '' said Mamma warmly , as she tumbled up the quirls with an irrepressible caress , remembering how the boy came wearily in after all the others , without seeming for a moment to think that he could have done anything else ."
`` Like Casabianca ! ''
"cried Jill , much impressed , for obedience was her hardest trial ."
"`` I think he was a fool to burn up , '' said Frank , bound not to give in ."
`` I do n't .
"It 's a splendid piece , and every one likes to speak it , and it was true , and it would n't be in all the books if he was a fool ."
"Grown people know what is good , '' declared Jill , who liked heroic actions , and was always hoping for a chance to distinguish herself in that way ."
"`` You admire ` The Charge of the Light Brigade , ' and glow all over as you thunder it out ."
Yet they went gallantly to their death rather than disobey orders .
"A mistake , perhaps , but it makes us thrill to hear of it ; and the same spirit keeps my Jack true as steel when once his word is passed , or he thinks it is his duty ."
"Do n't be laughed out of it , my son , for faithfulness in little things fits one for heroism when the great trials come ."
One 's conscience can hardly be too tender when honor and honesty are concerned . ''
"`` You are right , mother , and I am wrong ."
"I beg your pardon , Jack , and you sha 'n' t get ahead of me next time . ''"
"Frank made his mother a little bow , gave his brother a shake of the hand , and nodded to Jill , as if anxious to show that he was not too proud to own up when he made a mistake ."
"`` Please tell on , Jack ."
"This is very nice , but I do want to know all about the other , '' said Jill , after a short pause ."
`` Let me see .
"Oh , I saw Bob at church , and he looked rather blue ; so , after Sunday School , I asked what the matter was ."
"He said Jerry bothered him for some money he lent him at different times when they were loafing round together , before we took him up ."
He would n't get any wages for some time .
"The Captain keeps him short on purpose , I guess , and wo n't let him come down town except on Sundays ."
"He did n't want any one to know about it , for fear he 'd lose his place ."
So I promised I would n't tell .
"It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation ; some time that night , or at latest before noon of the morrow , we should sight the Treasure Island ."
We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea .
"The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily , dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray ."
All was drawing alow and aloft ; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure .
"Now , just after sundown , when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth , it occurred to me that I should like an apple ."
I ran on deck .
The watch was all forward looking out for the island .
"The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself , and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship ."
"In I got bodily into the apple barrel , and found there was scarce an apple left ; but sitting down there in the dark , what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship , I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by ."
"The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it , and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak ."
"It was Silver 's voice , and before I had heard a dozen words , I would not have shown myself for all the world , but lay there , trembling and listening , in the extreme of fear and curiosity , for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone ."
"11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel `` NO , not I , '' said Silver ."
"`` Flint was cap'n ; I was quartermaster , along of my timber leg ."
"The same broadside I lost my leg , old Pew lost his deadlights ."
"It was a master surgeon , him that ampytated me -- out of college and all -- Latin by the bucket , and what not ; but he was hanged like a dog , and sun-dried like the rest , at Corso Castle ."
"That was Roberts ' men , that was , and comed of changing names to their ships -- ROYAL FORTUNE and so on ."
"Now , what a ship was christened , so let her stay , I says ."
"So it was with the CASSANDRA , as brought us all safe home from Malabar , after England took the viceroy of the Indies ; so it was with the old WALRUS , Flint 's old ship , as I 've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"cried another voice , that of the youngest hand on board , and evidently full of admiration ."
"`` He was the flower of the flock , was Flint ! ''"
"`` Davis was a man too , by all accounts , '' said Silver ."
"`` I never sailed along of him ; first with England , then with Flint , that 's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking ."
"I laid by nine hundred safe , from England , and two thousand after Flint ."
That ai n't bad for a man before the mast -- all safe in bank .
"` Tai n't earning now , it 's saving does it , you may lay to that ."
Where 's all England 's men now ?
I dunno .
Where 's Flint 's ?
"Why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duff -- been begging before that , some on 'em ."
"Old Pew , as had lost his sight , and might have thought shame , spends twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in Parliament ."
Where is he now ?
"Three days and three nights they swam through the sea , and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home ."
"The turtle bade him farewell , and was gone in a moment ."
Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps .
"He saw the smoke curling through the roof , and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted ."
"He heard the children shouting and calling , and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto , and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return ."
Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street .
"After all , everything was changed ."
Neither men nor houses were those he once knew .
"Quickly he saw his old home ; yes , it was still there , but it had a strange look ."
"Anxiously he knocked at the door , and asked the woman who opened it after his parents ."
"But she did not know their names , and could give him no news of them ."
"Still more disturbed , he rushed to the burying ground , the only place that could tell him what he wished to know ."
Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant .
And he was right .
"In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents , and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son , and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea ."
"And so he found that since he had deft his home , three hundred years had passed by ."
"Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street , hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old ."
"But when the man spoke , he knew he was not dreaming , though he felt as if he had lost his senses ."
In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess .
Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true .
"He might be the victim of some enchanter 's spell , and in his hand lay the counter-charm ."
"Almost unconsciously he opened it , and a purple vapour came pouring out ."
"He held the empty box in his hand , and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled , like the hand of an old , old man ."
"He ran to the brook , which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain ."
and saw himself reflected as in a mirror .
It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him .
"Wounded to death , he crept back through the village , and no man knew the old , old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before ."
"So he toiled wearily back , till he reached the shore , and here he sat sadly on a rock , and called loudly on the turtle ."
"But she never came back any more , but instead , death came soon , and set him free ."
"But before that happened , the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story , and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea , and the most beautiful woman in the world besides ."
The Slaying of the Tanuki From the Japanische Murchen und Sagen .
"Near a big river , and between two high mountains , a man and his wife lived in a cottage a long , long time ago ."
Mr. Pryor 's once ruddy face was ashen .
But he turned at bay .
"`` I 'll have the law on you for this , '' he gasped ."
"`` Do -- do , '' roared Norman , making another rush ."
But Mr. Pryor was gone .
He had no desire to fall a second time into the hands of an avenging militarist .
"Norman turned to the platform for one graceless , triumphant moment ."
"`` Do n't look so flabbergasted , parsons , '' he boomed ."
`` You could n't do it -- nobody would expect it of the cloth -- but somebody had to do it .
You know you 're glad I threw him out -- he could n't be let go on yammering and yodelling and yawping sedition and treason .
Sedition and treason -- somebody had to deal with it .
I was born for this hour -- I 've had my innings in church at last .
I can sit quiet for another sixty years now !
"Go ahead with your meeting , parsons ."
I reckon you wo n't be troubled with any more pacifist prayers . ''
But the spirit of devotion and reverence had fled .
Both ministers realized it and realized that the only thing to do was to close the meeting quietly and let the excited people go .
"Mr. Meredith addressed a few earnest words to the boys in khaki -- which probably saved Mr. Pryor 's windows from a second onslaught -- and Mr. Arnold pronounced an incongruous benediction , at least he felt it was incongruous , for he could not at once banish from his memory the sight of gigantic Norman Douglas shaking the fat , pompous little Whiskers-on-the-moon as a huge mastiff might shake an overgrown puppy ."
And he knew that the same picture was in everybody 's mind .
Altogether the union prayer-meeting could hardly be called an unqualified success .
But it was remembered in Glen St. Mary when scores of orthodox and undisturbed assemblies were totally forgotten .
"`` You will never , no , never , Mrs. Dr. dear , hear me call Norman Douglas a pagan again , '' said Susan when she reached home ."
`` If Ellen Douglas is not a proud woman this night she should be . ''
"`` Norman Douglas did a wholly indefensible thing , '' said the doctor ."
`` Pryor should have been let severely alone until the meeting was over .
"Then later on , his own minister and session should deal with him ."
That would have been the proper procedure .
"Norman 's performance was utterly improper and scandalous and outrageous ; but , by George , '' -- the doctor threw back his head and chuckled , `` by George , Anne-girl , it was satisfying . ''"
"CHAPTER XXI `` LOVE AFFAIRS ARE HORRIBLE '' Ingleside 20th June 1916 `` We have been so busy , and day after day has brought such exciting news , good and bad , that I have n't had time and composure to write in my diary for weeks ."
"I like to keep it up regularly , for father says a diary of the years of the war should be a very interesting thing to hand down to one 's children ."
"The trouble is , I like to write a few personal things in this blessed old book that might not be exactly what I 'd want my children to read ."
I feel that I shall be a far greater stickler for propriety in regard to them than I am for myself !
Did you ever see such a rookery ?
And perched right close to the road too .
An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out . ''
"`` I think an old , deserted house is such a sad sight , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its old-time joys .
"Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago , and that it was a real pretty place , with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it ."
"It was full of little children and laughter and songs ; and now it is empty , and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind ."
How lonely and sorrowful it must feel !
Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights ... the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs ... and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again . ''
Diana shook her head .
"`` I never imagine things like that about places now , Anne ."
Do n't you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the Haunted Wood ?
To this day I ca n't go through that bush comfortably after dark ; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter house I 'd be frightened to pass it too .
"Besides , those children are n't dead ."
They 're all grown up and doing well ... and one of them is a butcher .
And flowers and songs could n't have ghosts anyhow . ''
Anne smothered a little sigh .
She loved Diana dearly and they had always been good comrades .
But she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone .
The way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her .
"A thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody ; it did not last long , however , and the drive home , through lanes where the raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the drenched ferns gave out spicy odors , was delightful ."
But just as they turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty of the landscape for her .
"Before them on the right extended Mr. Harrison 's broad , gray-green field of late oats , wet and luxuriant ; and there , standing squarely in the middle of it , up to her sleek sides in the lush growth , and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels , was a Jersey cow !"
Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that boded no good to the predatory quadruped .
"Not a word said she , but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels , and whisked across the fence before Diana understood what had happened ."
"`` Anne , come back , '' shrieked the latter , as soon as she found her voice ."
`` You 'll ruin your dress in that wet grain ... ruin it .
She does n't hear me !
"Well , she 'll never get that cow out by herself ."
"I must go and help her , of course . ''"
Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing .
"Diana hopped briskly down , tied the horse securely to a post , turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders , mounted the fence , and started in pursuit of her frantic friend ."
cried his daughter .
"` Well , that is not worth much , my dear , ' said he ."
"` Besides , you have rings enough , I should think . '"
"` Never mind , I like it , ' replied the princess ."
"But as soon as she was alone , to her amazement , the ring suddenly left her finger and became a man ."
"You can imagine how frightened she was , as , indeed , anybody would have been ; but in an instant the man became a ring again , and then turned back to a man , and so it went on for some time until she began to get used to these sudden changes . '"
"I am sorry I frightened you , ' said Hans , when he thought he could safely speak to the princess without making her scream . '"
"I took refuge with you because the old hill-man , whom I have offended , was trying to kill me , and here I am safe . '"
"` You had better stay here then , ' said the princess ."
"So Hans stayed , and he and she became good friends ; though , of course , he only became a man when no one else was present ."
"This was all very well ; but , one day , as they were talking together , the king happened to enter the room , and although Hans quickly changed himself into a ring again it was too late ."
The king was terribly angry .
` So this is why you have refused to marry all the kings and princes who have sought your hand ? '
he cried .
"And , without waiting for her to speak , he commanded that his daughter should be walled up in the summer-house and starved to death with her lover ."
"That evening the poor princess , still wearing her ring , was put into the summer-house with enough food to last for three days , and the door was bricked up ."
"But at the end of a week or two the king thought it was time to give her a grand funeral , in spite of her bad behaviour , and he had the summer-house opened ."
"He could hardly believe his eyes when he found that the princess was not there , nor Hans either ."
"Instead , there lay at his feet a large hole , big enough for two people to pass through ."
Now what had happened was this .
"When the princess and Hans had given up hope , and cast themselves down on the ground to die , they fell down this hole , and right through the earth as well , and at last they tumbled into a castle built of pure gold at the other side of the world , and there they lived happily ."
"But of this , of course , the king knew nothing ."
` Will anyone go down and see where the passage leads to ? '
"he asked , turning to his guards and courtiers . '"
I will reward splendidly the man who is brave enough to explore it . '
For a long time nobody answered .
"The hole was dark and deep , and if it had a bottom no one could see it ."
"At length a soldier , who was a careless sort of fellow , offered himself for the service , and cautiously lowered himself into the darkness ."
"But in a moment he , too , fell down , down , down ."
"Was he going to fall for ever , he wondered !"
"Oh , how thankful he was in the end to reach the castle , and to meet the princess and Hans , looking quite well and not at all as if they had been starved ."
"They began to talk , and the soldier told them that the king was very sorry for the way he had treated his daughter , and wished day and night that he could have her back again ."
"Here 's Dan now , full of stories about birds , and bugs , and so on ; let him take care of the museum , and once a week the rest of you take turns to read a composition , or tell about some animal , mineral , or vegetable ."
"We should all like that , and I think it would put considerable useful knowledge into our heads ."
"What do you say , Professor ? ''"
"`` I like it much , and will give the lads all the help I can ."
"But they will need books to read up these new subjects , and we have not many , I fear , '' began Mr. Bhaer , looking much pleased , planning many fine lectures on geology , which he liked ."
`` We should have a library for the special purpose . ''
"`` Is that a useful sort of book , Dan ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , pointing to the volume that lay open by the cabinet ."
"`` Oh , yes !"
it tells all I want to know about insects .
I had it here to see how to fix the butterflies right .
"I covered it , so it is not hurt ; '' and Dan caught it up , fearing the lender might think him careless ."
"`` Give it here a minute ; '' and , pulling out his pencil , Mr. Laurie wrote Dan 's name in it , saying , as he set the book up on one of the corner shelves , where nothing stood but a stuffed bird without a tail , `` There , that is the beginning of the museum library ."
"I 'll hunt up some more books , and Demi shall keep them in order ."
"Where are those jolly little books we used to read , Jo ?"
"` Insect Architecture ' or some such name , all about ants having battles , and bees having queens , and crickets eating holes in our clothes and stealing milk , and larks of that sort . ''"
`` In the garret at home .
"I 'll have them sent out , and we will plunge into Natural History with a will , '' said Mrs. Jo , ready for any thing ."
`` Wo n't it be hard to write about such things ? ''
"asked Nat , who hated compositions ."
"`` At first , perhaps ; but you will soon like it ."
"If you think that hard , how would you like to have this subject given to you , as it was to a girl of thirteen : A conversation between Themistocles , Aristides , and Pericles on the proposed appropriation of funds of the confederacy of Delos for the ornamentation of Athens ? ''"
said Mrs. Jo .
"The boys groaned at the mere sound of the long names , and the gentlemen laughed at the absurdity of the lesson ."
`` Did she write it ? ''
"asked Demi , in an awe-stricken tone ."
"`` Yes , but you can imagine what a piece of work she make of it , though she was rather a bright child . ''"
"`` I 'd like to have seen it , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Perhaps I can find it for you ; I went to school with her , '' and Mrs. Jo looked so wicked that every one knew who the little girl was ."
Hearing of this fearful subject for a composition quite reconciled the boys to the thought of writing about familiar things .
"Wednesday afternoon was appointed for the lectures , as they preferred to call them , for some chose to talk instead of write ."
"Mr. Bhaer promised a portfolio in which the written productions should be kept , and Mrs. Bhaer said she would attend the course with great pleasure ."
"`` Put up your swords , boys , '' cried the newcomer , `` this man is mine . ''"
Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter .
The others drew back and formed a ring around them .
"For long the two enemies looked at one another , Hook shuddering slightly , and Peter with the strange smile upon his face ."
"`` So , Pan , '' said Hook at last , `` this is all your doing . ''"
"`` Ay , James Hook , '' came the stern answer , `` it is all my doing . ''"
"`` Proud and insolent youth , '' said Hook , `` prepare to meet thy doom . ''"
"`` Dark and sinister man , '' Peter answered , `` have at thee . ''"
"Without more words they fell to , and for a space there was no advantage to either blade ."
"Peter was a superb swordsman , and parried with dazzling rapidity ; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe 's defence , but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead , and he could not drive the steel home ."
"Hook , scarcely his inferior in brilliancy , but not quite so nimble in wrist play , forced him back by the weight of his onset , hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust , taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio ; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again ."
"Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook , which all this time had been pawing the air ; but Peter doubled under it and , lunging fiercely , pierced him in the ribs ."
"At the sight of his own blood , whose peculiar colour , you remember , was offensive to him , the sword fell from Hook 's hand , and he was at Peter 's mercy ."
`` Now ! ''
"cried all the boys , but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword ."
"Hook did so instantly , but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form ."
"Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him , but darker suspicions assailed him now ."
"`` Pan , who and what art thou ? ''"
he cried huskily .
"`` I 'm youth , I 'm joy , '' Peter answered at a venture , `` I 'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg . ''"
"This , of course , was nonsense ; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was , which is the very pinnacle of good form ."
"`` To ' t again , '' he cried despairingly ."
"He fought now like a human flail , and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it ; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone ."
And again and again he darted in and pricked .
Hook was fighting now without hope .
That passionate breast no longer asked for life ; but for one boon it craved : to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever .
Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it .
"`` In two minutes , '' he cried , `` the ship will be blown to pieces . ''"
"Now , now , he thought , true form will show ."
"But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands , and calmly flung it overboard ."
What sort of form was Hook himself showing ?
"Misguided man though he was , we may be glad , without sympathising with him , that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race ."
"The doctor and his wife went to the Manse , Shirley and Miss Oliver went they alone knew where , Susan went to the store for household supplies , and Jims went to Dreamland ."
"Rilla put on her georgette gown , knotted up her hair and bound a little double string of pearls around it ."
Then she tucked a cluster of pale pink baby roses at her belt .
Would Ken ask her for a rose for a keepsake ?
She knew that Jem had carried to the trenches in Flanders a faded rose that Faith Meredith had kissed and given him the night before he left .
Rilla looked very sweet when she met Ken in the mingled moonlight and vine shadows of the big veranda .
The hand she gave him was cold and she was so desperately anxious not to lisp that her greeting was prim and precise .
How handsome and tall Kenneth looked in his lieutenant 's uniform !
"It made him seem older , too -- so much so that Rilla felt rather foolish ."
"Had n't it been the height of absurdity for her to suppose that this splendid young officer had anything special to say to her , little Rilla Blythe of Glen St. Mary ?"
"Likely she had n't understood him after all -- he had only meant that he did n't want a mob of folks around making a fuss over him and trying to lionize him , as they had probably done over-harbour ."
"Yes , of course , that was all he meant -- and she , little idiot , had gone and vainly imagined that he did n't want anybody but her ."
"And he would think she had manoeuvred everybody away so that they could be alone together , and he would laugh to himself at her ."
"`` This is better luck than I hoped for , '' said Ken , leaning back in his chair and looking at her with very unconcealed admiration in his eloquent eyes ."
"`` I was sure someone would be hanging about and it was just you I wanted to see , Rilla-my-Rilla . ''"
Rilla 's dream castle flashed into the landscape again .
This was unmistakable enough certainly -- not much doubt as to his meaning here .
"`` There are n't -- so many of us -- to poke around as there used to be , '' she said softly ."
"`` No , that 's so , '' said Ken gently ."
"`` Jem and Walter and the girls away -- it makes a big blank , does n't it ?"
But -- '' he leaned forward until his dark curls almost brushed her hair -- `` does n't Fred Arnold try to fill the blank occasionally .
I 've been told so . ''
"At this moment , before Rilla could make any reply , Jims began to cry at the top of his voice in the room whose open window was just above them -- Jims , who hardly ever cried in the evening ."
"Moreover , he was crying , as Rilla knew from experience , with a vim and energy that betokened that he had been already whimpering softly unheard for some time and was thoroughly exasperated ."
When Jims started in crying like that he made a thorough job of it .
Rilla knew that there was no use to sit still and pretend to ignore him .
He would n't stop ; and conversation of any kind was out of the question when such shrieks and howls were floating over your head .
"Besides , she was afraid Kenneth would think she was utterly unfeeling if she sat still and let a baby cry like that ."
He was not likely acquainted with Morgan 's invaluable volume .
She got up .
"`` Jims has had a nightmare , I think ."
He sometimes has one and he is always badly frightened by it .
"Now , alas !"
it was absolutely finished .
"Oh , dear no !"
` Gracious me ! '
"cried a brass manufacturer , ` there 's no handle on the door , ' and he put one on ."
"An ironmonger added a scraper , and an old lady ran up with a door-mat ."
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
` Finished !
"how can it be finished , ' the plumber demanded scornfully , ` before hot and cold are put in ? '"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower-garden to the right of the verandah , and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Shook his bald head and murmured , ` Cold , quite cold ' -RSB- Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished , and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , ` Tony , ' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
"As Tony made no answer , she sat up , whereupon her head hit the roof , and it opened like the lid of a box , and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow ."
"As she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself , so she pinched her cheeks , and then she knew it was herself , and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure ."
"She remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies , but how ever , she asked herself , had she got into this funny place ?"
"She stepped out by the roof , right over the garden , and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night ."
It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else . '
O you darling !
O you sweet !
O you love ! '
she cried .
"Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house , or maybe it now knew that its work was done , for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller ; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking , yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now ."
"It always remained as complete as ever , but it became smaller and smaller , and the garden dwindled at the same time , and the snow crept closer , lapping house and garden up ."
"Now the house was the size of a little dog 's kennel , and now of a Noah 's Ark , but still you could see the smoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall , every one complete ."
"The glow-worm light was waning too , but it was still there ."
"` Darling , loveliest , do n't go ! '"
"But she shook her head and I heard her telling mother later that , in her opinion , ` cooties ' and ` sarks ' were not proper subjects for young girls to talk about ."
"She was especially horrified when Jem wrote in his last letter to mother , ` Tell Susan I had a fine cootie hunt this morning and caught fifty-three ! '"
Susan positively turned pea-green .
"` Mrs. Dr. dear , ' she said , ` when I was young , if decent people were so unfortunate as to get -- those insects -- they kept it a secret if possible ."
"I do not want to be narrow-minded , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I still think it is better not to mention such things . '"
`` Miranda grew confidential over our vermin shirts and told me all her troubles .
She is desperately unhappy .
She is engaged to Joe Milgrave and Joe joined up in October and has been training in Charlottetown ever since .
Her father was furious when he joined and forbade Miranda ever to have any dealing or communication with him again .
"Poor Joe expects to go overseas any day and wants Miranda to marry him before he goes , which shows that there have been ` communications ' in spite of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"Miranda wants to marry him but can not , and she declares it will break her heart . ''"
` Why do n't you run away and marry him ? '
I said .
It did n't go against my conscience in the least to give her such advice .
"Joe Milgrave is a splendid fellow and Mr. Pryor fairly beamed on him until the war broke out and I know Mr. Pryor would forgive Miranda very quickly , once it was over and he wanted his housekeeper back ."
But Miranda shook her silvery head dolefully . ''
` Joe wants me to but I ca n't .
"Mother 's last words to me , as she lay on her dying-bed , were , `` Never , never run away , Miranda , '' and I promised . '"
"`` Miranda 's mother died two years ago , and it seems , according to Miranda , that her mother and father actually ran away to be married themselves ."
To picture Whiskers-on-the-moon as the hero of an elopement is beyond my power .
But such was the case and Mrs. Pryor at least lived to repent it .
"She had a hard life of it with Mr. Pryor , and she thought it was a punishment on her for running away ."
"So she made Miranda promise she would never , for any reason whatever , do it ."
"`` Of course , you can not urge a girl to break a promise made to a dying mother , so I did not see what Miranda could do unless she got Joe to come to the house when her father was away and marry her there ."
But Miranda said that could n't be managed .
"Her father seemed to suspect she might be up to something of the sort and he never went away for long at a time , and , of course , Joe could n't get leave of absence at an hour 's notice . ''"
"` No , I shall just have to let Joe go , and he will be killed -- I know he will be killed -- and my heart will break , ' said Miranda , her tears running down and copiously bedewing the vermin shirts !"
`` I am not writing like this for lack of any real sympathy with poor Miranda .
"I 've just got into the habit of giving things a comical twist if I can , when I 'm writing to Jem and Walter and Ken , to make them laugh ."
I really felt sorry for Miranda who is as much in love with Joe as a china-blue girl can be with anyone and who is dreadfully ashamed of her father 's pro-German sentiments .
"I think she understood that I did , for she said she had wanted to tell me all about her worries because I had grown so sympathetic this past year ."
I wonder if I have .
"` We must rest here as best we can , ' spoke Covan to the cows ."
And they bowed their heads and lay down in the place where they stood .
"Then came the black raven of Corri-nan-creag , whose eyes never closed , and whose wings never tired ; and he fluttered before the face of Covan and told him that he knew of a cranny in the rock where there was food in plenty , and soft moss for a bed ."
"` Go with me thither , ' he said to Covan , ` and you shall lay aside three-thirds of your weariness , and depart in the morning refreshed , ' and Covan listened thankfully to his words , and at dawn he rose up to seek his cows ."
` Farewell ! '
cried the black raven .
"` You trusted me , and took all I had to offer in return for the food you once gave me ."
"So if in time to come you need a friend , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"As before , the cows were standing in the spot where he had left them , ready to set out ."
"All that day they walked , on and on , and on , Covan son of Gorla walking behind them , till night fell while they were on the banks of a river ."
"` We can go no further , ' spake Covan to the cows ."
"And they began to eat the grass by the side of the stream , while Covan listened to them and longed for some supper also , for they had travelled far , and his limbs were weak under him ."
"Then there was a swish of water at his feet , and out peeped the head of the famous otter Doran-donn of the stream ."
"` Trust to me and I will find you warmth and shelter , ' said Doran-donn ; ` and for food fish in plenty . '"
"And Covan went with him thankfully , and ate and rested , and laid aside three-thirds of his weariness ."
"At sunrise he left his bed of dried sea-weed , which had floated up with the tide , and with a grateful heart bade farewell to Doran-donn ."
"` Because you trusted me and took what I had to offer , you have made me your friend , Covan , ' said Doran-donn ."
"` And if you should be in danger , and need help from one who can swim a river or dive beneath a wave , call to me and I will come to you . '"
"Then he plunged into the stream , and was seen no more ."
"The cows were standing ready in the place where Covan had left them , and they journeyed on all that day , till , when night fell , they reached the cottage ."
"Joyful indeed was the old man as the cows went into their stables , and he beheld the rich milk that flowed into the pail of the golden-haired maiden with the silver comb ."
"` You have done well indeed , ' he said to Covan son of Gorla ."
"` And now , what would you have as a reward ? ' '"
"I want nothing for myself , ' answered Covan the Brown-haired ; ` but I ask you to give me back my brothers and my sister who have been lost to us for three years past ."
"You are wise and know the lore of fairies and of witches ; tell me where I can find them , and what I must do to bring them to life again . '"
The old man looked grave at the words of Covan .
"` Yes , truly I know where they are , ' answered he , ` and I say not that they may not be brought to life again ."
But the perils are great -- too great for you to overcome . '
"` Tell me what they are , ' said Covan again , ` and I shall know better if I may overcome them . '"
"` Listen , then , and judge ."
"In the mountain yonder there dwells a roe , white of foot , with horns that branch like the antlers of a deer ."
On the lake that leads to the land of the Sun floats a duck whose body is green and whose neck is of gold .
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed ."
"`` Oh , Tony , '' she would say , with awful respect , `` but the fairies will be so angry ! ''"
"`` I daresay , '' replied Tony , carelessly ."
"`` Perhaps , '' she said , thrilling , `` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ''"
"`` I shall make him , '' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , `` Just some day ; '' he was quite vague about which day except when she asked `` Will it be today ? ''"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond , not thick enough to skate on but at least you could spoil it for tomorrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , `` Is it to-day ? ''"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him !
"`` In case you should feel cold , '' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , `` I 'm afraid Nurse would see me , so I sha 'n' t be able to do it . ''"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , `` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , '' and in a whisper , `` Then you can hide , '' and off they ran ."
The name is DONnell and always has been .
"The woman is crazy , that 's what ."
"She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family , eating off a china plate ."
I 'd be afraid of a judgment if I was her .
"Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible , hard-working man , but he had n't much gumption when he picked out a wife , that 's what . ''"
"VI All Sorts and Conditions of Men ... and women A September day on Prince Edward Island hills ; a crisp wind blowing up over the sand dunes from the sea ; a long red road , winding through fields and woods , now looping itself about a corner of thick set spruces , now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery sheets of ferns beneath them , now dipping down into a hollow where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again , now basking in open sunshine between ribbons of golden-rod and smoke-blue asters ; air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets , those glad little pensioners of the summer hills ; a plump brown pony ambling along the road ; two girls behind him , full to the lips with the simple , priceless joy of youth and life ."
"`` Oh , this is a day left over from Eden , is n't it , Diana ? ''"
... and Anne sighed for sheer happiness .
`` The air has magic in it .
"Look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley , Diana ."
"And oh , do smell the dying fir !"
It 's coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr. Eben Wright has been cutting fence poles .
Bliss is it on such a day to be alive ; but to smell dying fir is very heaven .
That 's two thirds Wordsworth and one third Anne Shirley .
"It does n't seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven , does it ?"
And yet it does n't seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you could n't get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods .
Perhaps we 'll have the odor there without the death .
"Yes , I think that will be the way ."
That delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs ... and of course it will be just souls in heaven . ''
"`` Trees have n't souls , '' said practical Diana , `` but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely ."
I 'm going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles .
"You 'd better make one too , Anne . ''"
`` I think I shall ... and use it for my naps .
I 'd be certain to dream I was a dryad or a woodnymph then .
"But just this minute I 'm well content to be Anne Shirley , Avonlea schoolma'am , driving over a road like this on such a sweet , friendly day . ''"
"`` It 's a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us , '' sighed Diana ."
"`` Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road , Anne ?"
"Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it , and we 'll probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves ."
It 's the very worst road of all . ''
`` That is why I chose it .
Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken this road if we had asked them .
"But you see , Diana , I feel myself responsible for the A.V.I.S. , since I was the first to suggest it , and it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things ."
Let 's have a go of the rum . ''
"`` Dick , '' said Silver , `` I trust you ."
"I 've a gauge on the keg , mind ."
There 's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up . ''
"Terrified as I was , I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him ."
"Dick was gone but a little while , and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook 's ear ."
"It was but a word or two that I could catch , and yet I gathered some important news , for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose , this whole clause was audible : `` Not another man of them 'll jine . ''"
Hence there were still faithful men on board .
"When Dick returned , one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank -- one `` To luck , '' another with a `` Here 's to old Flint , '' and Silver himself saying , in a kind of song , `` Here 's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff . ''"
"Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel , and looking up , I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail ; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted , `` Land ho ! ''"
12 Council of War THERE was a great rush of feet across the deck .
"I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle , and slipping in an instant outside my barrel , I dived behind the fore-sail , made a double towards the stern , and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow ."
There all hands were already congregated .
A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon .
"Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills , about a couple of miles apart , and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill , whose peak was still buried in the fog ."
All three seemed sharp and conical in figure .
"So much I saw , almost in a dream , for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before ."
And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders .
The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east .
"`` And now , men , '' said the captain , when all was sheeted home , `` has any one of you ever seen that land ahead ? ''"
"`` I have , sir , '' said Silver ."
`` I 've watered there with a trader I was cook in . ''
"`` The anchorage is on the south , behind an islet , I fancy ? ''"
asked the captain .
"`` Yes , sir ; Skeleton Island they calls it ."
"It were a main place for pirates once , and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it ."
"That hill to the nor ` ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill ; there are three hills in a row running south ` ard -- fore , main , and mizzen , sir ."
"But the main -- that 's the big un , with the cloud on it -- they usually calls the Spy-glass , by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning , for it 's there they cleaned their ships , sir , asking your pardon . ''"
"`` I have a chart here , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` See if that 's the place . ''
"Long John 's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart , but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment ."
"This was not the map we found in Billy Bones 's chest , but an accurate copy , complete in all things -- names and heights and soundings -- with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes ."
`` I knew it !
"Bring the child to me , and do n't fret ."
"I 'll see to him , and next time you do as I say , '' was the consoling welcome she received as the old lady popped up a sleepy but anxious face in a large flannel cap , and shook the bottle with the air of a general who had routed the foe before and meant to do it again ."
"Leaving her little responsibility in Miss Bat 's arms , Molly retired to wet her pillow with a few remorseful tears , and to fall asleep , wondering if real missionaries ever killed their pupils in the process of conversion ."
"So the girls all failed in the beginning ; but they did not give up , and succeeded better next time , as we shall see ."
Chapter IX .
"The Debating Club `` Look here , old man , we ought to have a meeting ."
"Holidays are over , and we must brace up and attend to business , '' said Frank to Gus , as they strolled out of the schoolyard one afternoon in January , apparently absorbed in conversation , but in reality waiting for a blue cloud and a scarlet feather to appear on the steps ."
`` All right .
"When , where , and what ? ''"
"asked Gus , who was a man of few words ."
"`` To-night , our house , subject , ` Shall girls go to college with us ? '"
"Mother said we had better be making up our minds , because every one is talking about it , and we shall have to be on one side or the other , so we may as well settle it now , '' answered Frank , for there was an impression among the members that all vexed questions would be much helped by the united eloquence and wisdom of the club ."
`` Very good ; I 'll pass the word and be there .
"Hullo , Neddy !"
"The D.C. meets to-night , at Minot 's , seven sharp ."
"Co-ed , & c. , '' added Gus , losing no time , as a third boy came briskly round the corner , with a little bag in his hand ."
`` I 'll come .
"Got home an hour earlier to-night , and thought I 'd look you up as I went by , '' responded Ed Devlin , as he took possession of the third post , with a glance toward the schoolhouse to see if a seal-skin cap , with a long , yellow braid depending therefrom , was anywhere in sight ."
"`` Very good of you , I 'm sure , '' said Gus , ironically , not a bit deceived by this polite attention ."
"`` The longest way round is sometimes the shortest way home , hey , Ed ? ''"
and Frank gave him a playful poke that nearly sent him off his perch .
"Then they all laughed at some joke of their own , and Gus added , `` No girls coming to hear us to-night ."
"Do n't think it , my son ."
"`` More 's the pity , '' and Ed shook his head regretfully over the downfall of his hopes ."
"`` Ca n't help it ; the other fellows say they spoil the fun , so we have to give in , sometimes , for the sake of peace and quietness ."
"Do n't mind having them a bit myself , '' said Frank , in such a tone of cheerful resignation that they laughed again , for the `` Triangle , '' as the three chums were called , always made merry music ."
`` We must have a game party next week .
"The girls like that , and so do I , '' candidly observed Gus , whose pleasant parlors were the scene of many such frolics ."
"`` And so do your sisters and your cousins and your aunts , '' hummed Ed , for Gus was often called Admiral because he really did possess three sisters , two cousins , and four aunts , besides mother and grandmother , all living in the big house together ."
"The boys promptly joined in the popular chorus , and other voices all about the yard took it up , for the `` Pinafore '' epidemic raged fearfully in Harmony Village that winter ."
`` How 's business ? ''
"Boston ladies gave up tea and used the dried leaves of the raspberry, and the girls of 1777 graduated in homespun. Could the iron heel of despotism crunch such a spirit of liberty as that? Scarcely. In one family at Newport four hundred and eighty-seven yards of cloth and thirty-six pairs of stockings were spun and made in eighteen months."
"When the war broke out it is estimated that each Colonial soldier had twenty-seven pairs of blue woollen socks with white double heels and toes. Does the intelligent reader believe that ""Tommy Atkins,"" with two pairs of socks ""and hit a-rainin',"" could whip men with twenty-seven pairs each? Not without restoratives."
"Troops were now sent to restore order. They were clothed by the British government, but boarded around with the Colonists. This was irritating to the people, because they had never met or called on the British troops. Again, they did not know the troops were coming, and had made no provision for them."
"Boston was considered the hot-bed of the rebellion, and General Gage was ordered to send two regiments of troops there. He did so, and a fight ensued, in which three citizens were killed."
"In looking over this incident, we must not forget that in those days three citizens went a good deal farther than they do now."
"The fight, however, was brief. General Gage, getting into a side street, separated from his command, and, coming out on the Common abruptly, he tried eight or nine more streets, but he came out each time on the Common, until, torn with conflicting emotions, he hired a Herdic, which took him around the corner to his quarters."
"On December 16, 1773, occurred the tea-party at Boston, which must have been a good deal livelier than those of to-day. The historian regrets that he was not there; he would have tried to be the life of the party."
"England had finally so arranged the price of tea that, including the tax, it was cheaper in America than in the old country. This exasperated the patriots, who claimed that they were confronted by a theory and not a condition. At Charleston this tea was stored in damp cellars, where it spoiled. New York and Philadelphia returned their ships, but the British would not allow any shenanegin', as George III. so tersely termed it, in Boston."
"Therefore a large party met in Faneuil Hall and decided that the tea should not be landed. A party made up as Indians, and, going on board, threw the tea overboard. Boston Harbor, as far out as the Bug Light, even to-day, is said to be carpeted with tea-grounds."
"George III. now closed Boston harbor and made General Gage Governor of Massachusetts. The Virginia Assembly murmured at this, and was dissolved and sent home without its mileage."
"Those opposed to royalty were termed Whigs, those in favor were called Tories. Now they are called Chappies or Authors."
"On the 5th of September, 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia and was entertained by the Clover Club. Congress acted slowly even then, and after considerable delay resolved that the conduct of Great Britain was, under the circumstances, uncalled for. It also voted to hold no intercourse with Great Britain, and decided not to visit Shakespeare's grave unless the mother-country should apologize."
"In 1775, on the 19th of April, General Gage sent out troops to see about some military stores at Concord, but at Lexington he met with a company of minute-men gathering on the village green. Major Pitcairn, who was in command of the Tommies, rode up to the minute-men, and, drawing his bright new Sheffield sword, exclaimed, ""Disperse, you rebels! throw down your arms and disperse!"" or some such remark as that."
"The Americans hated to do that, so they did not. In the skirmish that ensued, seven of their number were killed."
"Thus opened the Revolutionary War, a contest which but for the earnestness and irritability of the Americans would have been extremely brief. It showed the relative difference between the fighting qualities of soldiers who fight for two pounds ten shillings per month and those who fight because they have lost their temper."
"The regulars destroyed the stores, but on the way home they found every rock-pile hid an old-fashioned gun and minute-man. This shows that there must have been an enormous number of minute-men then. All the English who got back to Boston were those who went out to reinforce the original command."
"The news went over the country like wildfire. These are the words of the historian. Really, that is a poor comparison, for wildfire doesn't jump rivers and bays, or get up and eat breakfast by candle-light in order to be on the road and spread the news."
"General Putnam left a pair of tired steers standing in the furrow, and rode one hundred miles without feed or water to Boston."
"Twenty thousand men were soon at work building intrenchments around Boston, so that the English troops could not get out to the suburbs where many of them resided."
I will now speak of the battle of Bunker Hill.
"This battle occurred June 17. The Americans heard that their enemy intended to fortify Bunker Hill, and so they determined to do it themselves, in order to have it done in a way that would be a credit to the town."
"A body of men under Colonel Prescott, after prayer by the President of Harvard University, marched to Charlestown Neck. They decided to fortify Breed's Hill, as it was more commanding, and all night long they kept on fortifying. The surprise of the English at daylight was well worth going from Lowell to witness."
"Howe sent three thousand men across and formed them on the landing. He marched them up the hill to within ten rods of the earth-works, when it occurred to Prescott that it would now be the appropriate thing to fire."
"He made a statement of that kind to his troops, and those of the enemy who were alive went back to Charlestown. But that was no place for them, as they had previously set it afire, so they came back up the hill, where they were once more well received and tendered the freedom of a future state."
"Three times the English did this, when the ammunition in the fortifications gave out, and they charged with fixed bayonets and reinforcements."
"The Americans were driven from the field, but it was a victory after all. It united the Colonies and made them so vexed at the English that it took some time to bring on an era of good feeling."
"Lord Howe, referring afterwards to this battle, said that the Americans did not stand up and fight like the regulars, suggesting that thereafter the Colonial army should arrange itself in the following manner before a battle!"
"""Hurry up,"" he said. ""Come down and lie still, can't you?"""
"So the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the sea, and the point of the rock went into a hole that just fitted it in the stony sea bottom, and there it spun around the wrong way seven times and then lay still. And that round piece of land became, after millions of years, the Kingdom of Rotundia."
"This is the end of the geography lesson. And now for just a little natural history, so that we may not feel that we are quite wasting our time. Of course, the consequence of the island having spun around the wrong way was that when the animals began to grow on the island they all grew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as big as our elephants, and the elephant dear little pet was the size of the silly, tiny, black-and-tan dogs that ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The rabbits were about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild parts of the island they had made their burrows as big as railway tunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest of all the creatures."
"I can't tell you how big he was. Even if you think of elephants it will not help you at all. Luckily there was only one of him, and he was always asleep. Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne with him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved the expense of a brass band, because no band could possibly have been heard when the dormouse was talking in his sleep."
"The men and women and children in this wonderful island were quite the right size, because their ancestors had come over with the Conqueror long after the island had settled down and the animals grown on it."
"Now the natural history lesson is over, and if you have been attending, you know more about Rotundia than anyone there did, except three people:"
"the Lord Chief Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle who was a magician, and knew everything without learning it and Tom, the gardener's son."
"Tom had learned more at school than anyone else, because he wished to take a prize. The prize offered by the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the back. But after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry Tom, the gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided that the best prize in the world would be the Princess, and this was the prize Tom meant to take; and when you are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a Princess, you will find that the more you learn at school the better."
"The Princess always played with Tom on the days when the little dukes and marquises did not come to tea and when he told her he was almost sure of the first prize, she clapped her hands and said: ""Dear Tom, dear good, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet elephant and you can keep him till we're married."""
"The pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's son took him away in his coat pocket. He was the dearest little elephant you ever saw about six inches long. But he was very, very wise he could not have been wiser if he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in Tom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled his little trunk around Tom's fingers with an affectionate confidence that made the boy's heart warm to his new little pet. What with the elephant, and the Princess's affection, and the knowledge that the very next day he would receive the History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a wink. And, besides, the dog did bark so terribly. There was only one dog in Rotundia the kingdom could not afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of the kind that in most parts of the world only measures seven inches from the end of his dear nose to the tip of his darling tail but in Rotundia he was bigger than I can possibly expect you to believe. And when he barked, his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left no room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything else at all. He never barked at things that went on in the island he was too large-minded for that; but when ships went blundering by in the dark, tumbling over the rocks at the end of the island, he would bark once or twice, just to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing about there just as they liked."
"But on this particular night he barked and barked and barked and the Princess said, ""Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy."""
"And Tom said to himself, ""I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as it's light I'll go and see."""
"So when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight, Tom got up and went out. And all the time the Mexican lapdog barked so that the houses shook, and the tiles on the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in a cart whose horse is frisky."
"""I'll go to the pillar,"" thought Tom, as he went through the town. The pillar, of course, was the top of the piece of rock that had stuck itself through Rotundia millions of years before, and made it spin around the wrong way. It was quite in the middle of the island, and stuck up ever so far, and when you were at the top you could see a great deal farther than when you were not."
"As Tom went out from the town and across the downs, he thought what a pretty sight it was to see the rabbits in the bright, dewy morning, frisking with their young ones by the mouths of their burrows. He did not go very near the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that size is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it might easily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it would have been very sorry afterward. And Tom was a kind boy, and would not have liked to make even a rabbit unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the way when they think you are going to walk on them. They too have kind hearts, and they would not like you to be sorry afterward."
"So Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow more and more red and golden. And the Mexican lapdog barked all the time, till the church bells tinkled, and the chimney of the apple factory rocked again."
"But when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would not need to climb to the top to find out what the dog was barking at."
"For there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon. His wings were like old purple umbrellas that have been very much rained on, and his head was large and bald, like the top of a purple toadstool, and his tail, which was purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and tight, like the lash of a carriage whip."
"It was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and every now and then it moaned and leaned its head back against the rocky pillar as though it felt faint. Tom saw at once what had happened. A flight of purple dragons must have crossed the island in the night, and this poor one must have knocked its wing and broken it against the pillar."
"Everyone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was not afraid of the dragon, although he had never spoken to one before. He had often watched them flying across the sea, but he had never expected to get to know one personally."
"So now he said: ""I am afraid you don't feel quite well."""
"The dragon shook his large purple head. He could not speak, but like all other animals, he could understand well enough when he liked."
"""Can I get you anything?"" asked Tom, politely."
The dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile.
"""A bun or two, now,"" said Tom, coaxingly. ""There's a beautiful bun tree quite close."""
"The dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his purple lips, so Tom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon came back with an armful of fresh currant buns, and as he came he picked a few of the Bath kind, which grow on the low bushes near the pillar."
"Because, of course, another consequence of the island's having spun the wrong way is that all the things we have to make buns and cakes and shortbread grow on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make their cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples and onions, just as our cooks make puddings and turnovers."
"Tom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: ""Here, try to eat a little."
"You'll soon feel better then."""
"The dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously, and began to lick his wing again. So Tom left him and went back to the town with the news, and everyone was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the island a thing that had never happened before that they all went out to look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving, and the Lord Chief Schoolmaster went with the rest. Now, he had Tom's prize, the History of Rotundia, in his pocket the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms on the cover and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate it, so Tom never got the prize after all. But the dragon, when he had gotten it, did not like it."
"""Perhaps it's all for the best,"" said Tom. ""I might not have liked that prize either, if I had gotten it."""
"It happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's friends were asked what they would like to do, all the little dukes and marquises and earls said, ""Let's go and see the dragon."" But the little duchesses and marchionesses and countesses said they were afraid."
"But there after a while, Halvor went about, and was so strange and dull and silent. Then the Princesses asked him what he lacked, and if he didn't like to live with them any longer? Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see."
"Well, they thought that might be done easily enough."
"""You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and unscathed, if you will only follow our advice,"" said the Princesses."
"Yes, he'd be sure to mind all they said. So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king's son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure and not take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he'd never see them more."
"""If I only stood at home I'd be glad,"" said Halvor; and it was done as he had wished. Then stood Halvor at his father's cottage door before he knew a word about it. Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got so afraid they began to bow and scrape. Then Halvor asked if he couldn't stay there, and have a lodging there that night. No; that he couldn't."
"""We can't do it at all,"" they said, ""for we haven't this thing or that thing which such a lord is used to have; 'twere best your lordship went up to the farm, no long way off, for you can see the chimneys, and there they have lots of everything."""
"Halvor wouldn't hear of it he wanted to stop; but the old couple stuck to their own, that he had better go to the farmer's; there he would get both meat and drink; as for them, they hadn't even a chair to offer him to sit down on."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go up there till to-morrow early, but let me just stay here to-night; worst come to the worst, I can sit in the chimney corner."""
"Well, they couldn't say anything against that; so Halvor sat down by the ingle, and began to poke about in the ashes, just as he used to do when he lay at home in old days, and stretched his lazy bones."
"Well, they chattered and talked about many things; and they told Halvor about this thing and that; and so he asked them if they had never had any children."
"Yes, yes, they had once a lad whose name was Halvor, but they didn't know whither he had wandered; they couldn't even tell whether he were dead or alive."
"""Couldn't it be me, now?"" said Halvor."
"""Let me see; I could tell him well enough,"" said the old wife, and rose up. ""Our Halvor was so lazy and dull, he never did a thing; and besides, he was so ragged, that one tatter took hold of the next tatter on him. No; there never was the making of such a fine fellow in him as you are, master."""
"A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on Halvor's face, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once."
"""Ah! but it is you after all, Halvor?"" she cried; and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared, and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing would do but he must go up at once to the farmer's, and show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down on him. And off she went first, and Halvor followed after. So, when she got up there, she told them all how Halvor had come home again, and now they should only just see how grand he was, for, said she, ""he looks like nothing but a King's son."""
"""All very fine,"" said the lassies, and tossed up their heads. ""We'll be bound he's just the same beggarly ragged boy he always was."""
"Just then in walked Halvor, and then the lassies were all so taken aback, they forgot their sarks in the ingle, where they were sitting darning their clothes, and ran out in their smocks. Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at Halvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""you always thought yourselves so pretty and neat, no one could come near you; but now you should just see the eldest Princess I have set free; against her you look just like milkmaids, and the midmost is prettier still; but the youngest, who is my sweetheart, she's fairer than both sun and moon. Would to Heaven they were only here,"" said Halvor, ""then you'd see what you would see."""
"He had scarce uttered these words before there they stood, but then he felt so sorry, for now what they had said came into his mind. Up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the Princesses, and much was made of them, but they wouldn't stop there."
"""No, we want to go down to your father and mother,"" they said to Halvor; ""and so we'll go out now and look about us."""
"So he went down with them, and they came to a great lake just outside the farm. Close by the water was such a lovely green bank; here the Princesses said they would sit and rest a while; they thought it so sweet to sit down and look over the water."
"So they sat down there, and when they had sat a while the youngest Princess said:"
"""I may as well comb your hair a little, Halvor."""
"Well, Halvor laid his head on her lap, and she combed his bonny locks, and it wasn't long before Halvor fell fast asleep. Then she took the ring from his finger, and put another in its stead; and she said:"
"""Now hold me all together! and now would we were all in Soria Moria Castle."""
"So when Halvor woke up, he could very well tell that he had lost the Princesses, and began to weep and wail; and he was so downcast, they couldn't comfort him at all. In spite of all his father and mother said, he wouldn't stop there, but took farewell of them, and said he was safe not to see them again; for if he couldn't find the Princesses again, he thought it not worth while to live."
"Well, he had still about sixty pounds left, so he put them into his pocket, and set out on his way. So, when he had walked a while, he met a man with a tidy horse, and he wanted to buy it, and began to chaffer with the man."
"""Aye,"" said the man, ""to tell the truth, I never thought of selling him; but if we could strike a bargain perhaps """
"""What do you want for him?"" asked Halvor."
"""I didn't give much for him, nor is he worth much; he's a brave horse to ride, but he can't draw at all; still he's strong enough to carry your knapsack and you too, turn and turn about,"" said the man."
"At last they agreed on the price, and Halvor laid the knapsack on him, and so he walked a bit, and rode a bit, turn and turn about. At night he came to a green plain where stood a great tree, at the roots of which he sat down. There he let the horse loose, but he didn't lie down to sleep, but opened his knapsack and took a meal. At peep of day off he set again, for he could take no rest. So he rode and walked and walked and rode the whole day through the wide wood, where there were so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and lovely between the trees. He didn't know at all where he was or whither he was going, but he gave himself no more time to rest than when his horse cropped a bit of grass, and he took a snack out of his knapsack when they came to one of those green glades. So he went on walking and riding by turns, and as for the wood there seemed to be no end to it."
But at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming away through the trees.
"His rallying cry was, ""I am a Democrat."""
"The Mexican War now came on. General Taylor's army met the enemy first at Palo Alto, where he ran across the Mexicans six thousand strong, and, though he had but two thousand men, drove them back, only losing nine men. This was the most economical battle of the war."
"The next afternoon he met the enemy at Resaca de la Palma, and whipped him in the time usually required to ejaculate the word ""scat!"""
"Next General Taylor proceeded against Monterey, September 24, and with six thousand men attacked the strongly-fortified city, which held ten thousand troops. The Americans avoided the heavy fire as well as possible by entering the city and securing rooms at the best hotel, leaving word at the office that they did not wish to be disturbed by the enemy. In fact, the soldiers did dig their way through from house to house to avoid the volleys from the windows, and thus fought to within a square of the Grand Plaza, when the city surrendered. The Grand Plaza is generally a sandy vacant lot, where Mexicans sell tamales made of the highly-peppered but tempting cutlets of the Mexican hairless dog."
"The battle of Buena Vista took place February 23, 1847, General Santa Anna commanding the Mexicans. He had twenty thousand men, and General Taylor's troops were reduced in numbers. The fight was a hot one, lasting all day, and the Americans were saved by Bragg's artillery."
Bragg used the old Colonial method of rolling his guns up to the nose of the enemy and then discharging an iron-foundry into his midst. This disgusted the enemy so that General Santa Anna that evening took the shreds of his army and went away.
"General Kearney was sent to take New Mexico and California. His work consisted mainly in marching for General Frémont, who had been surveying a new route to Oregon, and had with sixty men been so successful that on the arrival of Kearney, with the aid of Commodores Sloat and Stockton, California was captured, and has given general satisfaction to every one."
"In March, 1847, General Scott, with twelve thousand men, bombarded Vera Cruz four days, and at the end of that time the city was surrendered."
"At Cerro Gordo, a week later, Scott overtook the enemy under General Santa Anna, and made such a fierce attack that the Mexicans were completely routed. Santa Anna left his leg on the field of battle and rode away on a pet mule named Charlotte Corday. The leg was preserved and taken to the Smithsonian Institute. It is made of second-growth hickory, and has a brass ferrule and a rubber eraser on the end. General Taylor afterwards taunted him with this incident, and, though greatly irritated, Santa Anna said there was no use trying to kick."
"Puebla resisted not, and the army marched into the city of Mexico August 7. The road was rendered disagreeable by strong fortifications and thirty thousand men who were not on good terms with Scott. The environments and suburbs one after another were taken, and a parley for peace ensued, during which the Mexicans were busy fortifying some more on the quiet."
"September 8 the Americans made their assault, and carried the outworks one by one. Then the castle of Chapultepec was stormed. First the outer works were scaled, which made them much more desirable, and the moat was removed by means of a stomach-pump and blotting-pad, and then the escarpment was up-ended, the Don John tower was knocked silly by a solid shot, and the castle capitulated."
"Thus on the 14th of September the old flag floated over the court-house of Mexico, and General Scott ate his tea in the palace of the Montezumas. Peace was declared February 2, 1848, and the United States owned the vast country southward to the Gila (pronounced Heeler) and west to the Pacific Ocean."
"The Wilmot Proviso was invented by David Wilmot, a poor, struggling member of Congress, who moved that in any territory acquired by the United States slavery should be prohibited except upon the advice of a physician. The motion was lost."
"Gold was discovered in the Sacramento Valley in August, 1848, by a workman who was building a mill-race. A struggle ensued over this ground as to who should own the race. It threatened to terminate in a race war, but was settled amicably."
In eighteen months one hundred thousand people went to the scene.
"Thousands left their skeletons with the red brother, and other thousands left theirs on the Isthmus of Panama or on the cruel desert. Many married men went who had been looking a long time for some good place to go to. Leaving their wives with ill-concealed relief, they started away through a country filled with death, to reach a country they knew not of. Some died en route, others were hanged, and still others became the heads of new families. Some came back and carried water for their wives to wash clothing for their neighbors."
"It was a long hard trip then across the plains. One of the author's friends at the age of thirteen years drove a little band of cows from the State of Indiana to Sacramento. He says he would not do it again for anything. He is now a man, and owns a large prune-orchard in California, and people tell him he is getting too stout, and that he ought to exercise more, and that he ought to walk every day several miles; but he shakes his head, and says, ""No, I will not walk any to-day, and possibly not to-morrow or the day following. Do not come to me and refer to taking a walk: I have tried that. Possibly you take me for a dromedary; but you are wrong. I am a fat man, and may die suddenly some day while lacing up my shoes, but when I go anywhere I ride."""
"When he got to Sacramento, where gold was said to be so plentiful, he was glad to wash dishes for his board, and he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into the fields for to feed swine, and he would fain have filled his system with the California peaches which the swine did eat, and he began to be in want, and no man gave unto him, and if he had spent his substance in riotous living, he said, it would have been different."
"About thirty years after that he arose and went unto his father, and carried his dinner with him, also a government bond and a new suit of raiment for the old gentleman."
I do not know what we should learn from this.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE WEBSTERS.
"Daniel Webster, together with Mr. Clay, had much to do with the Compromise measures of 1850. These consisted in the admission of California as a free State, the organizing of the Territories of Utah and New Mexico without any provision regarding slavery pro or con, the payment to Texas of one hundred million dollars for New Mexico, which was a good trade for Texas, the prohibition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and the enactment of a Fugitive Slave Law permitting owners of slaves to follow them into the free States and take them back in irons, if necessary. The officials and farmers of the free States were also expected to turn out, call the dog, leave their work, and help catch these chattels and carry them to the south-bound train."
"Daniel Webster was born in 1782, and Noah in 1758. Daniel was educated at Dartmouth College, where he was admitted in 1797. He taught school winters and studied summers, as many other great men have done since, until he knew about everything that anybody could. What Dan did not know, Noah did."
"Strange to say, Daniel was frightened to death when first called upon to speak a piece. He says he committed dozens of pieces to memory and recited them to the woods and crags and cows and stone abutments of the New England farms, but could not stand up before a school and utter a word."
"In 1801 he studied law with Thomas W. Thompson, afterwards United States Senator. He read then for the first time that ""Law is a rule of action prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong."""
"In 1812 he was elected to Congress, and in 1813 made his maiden speech."
"One of his most masterly speeches was made on economical and financial subjects; and yet in order to get his blue broadcloth coat with brass buttons from the tailor-shop to wear while making the speech, he had to borrow twenty-five dollars."
"When the country has wanted a man to talk well on these subjects it has generally been compelled to advance money to him before he could make a speech. Sometimes he has to be taken from the pawn-shop. Webster, it is said, was the most successful lawyer, after he returned to Boston, that the State of Massachusetts has ever known; and yet his mail was full of notices from banks down East, announcing that he had overdrawn his account."
"Washington decided that he must strike a daring blow while his troops had any hope or vitality left; and so on Christmas night, after crossing the Delaware as shown elsewhere, he fell on the Hessians at Trenton in the midst of their festivities, captured one thousand prisoners, and slew the leader."
"The Hessians were having a symposium at the time, and though the commander received an important note of warning during the Christmas dinner, he thrust it into his pocket and bade joy be unconfined."
"When daylight came, the Hessians were mostly moving in alcoholic circles trying to find their guns. Washington lost only four men, and two of those were frozen to death."
The result of this fight gave the Colonists courage and taught them at the same time that it would be best to avoid New Jersey symposiums till after the war was over.
"Having made such a hit in crossing the Delaware, Washington decided to repeat the performance on the 3d of January. He was attacked at Trenton by Cornwallis, who is known in history for his justly celebrated surrender. He waited till morning, having been repulsed at sundown."
"Washington left his camp-fires burning, surrounded the British, captured two hundred prisoners, and got away to Morristown Heights in safety. If the ground had not frozen, General Washington could not have moved his forty cannon; but, fortunately, the thermometer was again on his side, and he never lost a gun."
"September 11 the English got into the Chesapeake, and Washington announced in the papers that he would now fight the battle of the Brandywine, which he did."
"Marie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, fought bravely with the Americans in this battle, twice having his name shot from under him."
"The patriots were routed, scoring a goose-egg and losing Philadelphia."
"October 4, Washington attacked the enemy at Germantown, and was beaten back just as victory was arranging to perch on his banner. Poor Washington now retired to Valley Forge, where he put in about the dullest winter of his life."
"The English had not been so successful in the North. At first the Americans could only delay Burgoyne by felling trees in the path of his eight thousand men, which is a very unsatisfactory sort of warfare, but at last Schuyler, who had borne the burden and heat of the day, was succeeded by Gates, and good luck seemed to come slowly his way."
"A foolish boy with bullet-holes cut in his clothes ran into St. Leger's troops, and out of breath told them to turn back or they would fill a drunkard's grave. Officers asked him about the numbers of the enemy, and he pointed to the leaves of the trees, shrieked, and ran for his life."
"He ran several days, and was barely able to keep ahead of St. Leger's troops by a neck."
"Burgoyne at another time sent a detachment under Colonel Baum to take the stores at Bennington, Vermont. He was met by General Stark and the militia. Stark said, ""Here come the redcoats, and we must beat them to-day, or Molly Stark is a widow."" This neat little remark made an instantaneous hit, and when they counted up their string of prisoners at night they found they had six hundred souls and a Hessian."
"Burgoyne now felt blue and unhappy. Besides, his troops were covered with wood-ticks and had had no washing done for three weeks."
"He moved southward and attacked Gates at Bemis Heights, or, as a British wit had it, ""gave Gates ajar,"" near Saratoga. A wavering fight occupied the day, and then both armies turned in and fortified for two weeks."
"Burgoyne saw that he was running out of food, and so was first to open fire."
"Arnold, who had been deprived of his command since the last battle, probably to prevent his wiping out the entire enemy and getting promoted, was so maddened by the conflict that he dashed in before Gates could put him in the guard-house, and at the head of his old command, and without authority or hat, led the attack. Gates did not dare to come where Arnold was, to order him back, for it was a very warm place where Arnold was at the time. The enemy was thus driven to camp."
"Arnold was shot in the same leg that was wounded at Quebec; so he was borne back to the extreme rear, where he found Gates eating a doughnut and speaking disrespectfully of Arnold."
"A council was now held in Burgoyne's tent, and on the question of renewing the fight stood six to six, when an eighteen-pound hot shot went through the tent, knocking a stylographic pen out of General Burgoyne's hand. Almost at once he decided to surrender, and the entire army of six thousand men was surrendered, together with arms, portable bath-tubs, and leather hat-boxes. The Americans marched into their camp to the tune of Yankee Doodle, which is one of the most impudent compositions ever composed."
During the Valley Forge winter (1777-78) Continental currency depreciated in value so that an officer's pay would not buy his clothes.
"Many, having also spent their private funds for the prosecution of the war, were obliged to resign and hire out in the lumber woods in order to get food for their families. Troops had no blankets, and straw was not to be had. It was extremely sad; but there was no wavering. Officers were approached by the enemy with from one hundred to one thousand pounds if they would accept and use their influence to effect a reconciliation; but, with blazing eye and unfaltering attitude, each stated that he was not for sale, and returned to his frozen mud-hole to rest and dream of food and freedom."
Those were the untitled nobility from whom we sprung. Let us look over our personal record and see if we are living lives that are worthy of such heroic sires.
Five minutes will now be given the reader to make a careful examination of his personal record.
"In the spring the joyful news came across the sea that, through the efforts of Benjamin Franklin, France had acknowledged the independence of the United States, and a fleet was on the way to assist the struggling troops."
"The battle of Monmouth occurred June 28. Clinton succeeded Howe, and, alarmed by the news of the French fleet, the government ordered Clinton to concentrate his troops near New York, where there were better facilities for getting home."
"Washington followed the enemy across New Jersey, overtaking them at Monmouth. Lee was in command, and got his men tangled in a swamp where the mosquitoes were quite plenty, and, losing courage, ordered a retreat."
"Washington arrived at that moment, and bitterly upbraided Lee. He used the Flanders method of upbraiding, it is said, and Lee could not stand it. He started towards the enemy in preference to being there with Washington, who was still rebuking him. The fight was renewed, and all day long they fought. When night came, Clinton took his troops with him and went away where they could be by themselves."
"The clerk, however, was standing behind the altar and heard that, so he cried in a very gruff voice, “Thou shalt not have him! Thou shalt not have him!” The maiden thought that the child Mary who stood by her mother Anne had called out that to her, and was angry, and cried, “Fiddle de dee, conceited thing, hold your tongue, and let your mother speak!”"
140 Domestic Servants
"“Whither goest thou?” “To Walpe.” “I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
"“Hast thou a man? What is his name?” “Cham.” “My man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a child; how is he styled?” “Wild.” “My child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a cradle? How callest thou thy cradle?”"
"“Hippodadle.” “My cradle Hippodadle, my child Wild, thy child Wild, my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
“Hast thou also a drudge? what name has thy drudge?”
"“From-thy-work-do-not-budge.” “My drudge, From-thy-work-do-not-budge:"
"my child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.”"
141 The Lambkin and the Little Fish
"There were once a little brother and a little sister, who loved each other with all their hearts. Their own mother was, however, dead, and they had a step-mother, who was not kind to them, and secretly did everything she could to hurt them. It so happened that the two were playing with other children in a meadow before the house, and there was a pond in the meadow which came up to one side of the house. The children ran about it, and caught each other, and played at counting out."
"“Eneke Beneke, let me live, And I to thee my bird will give."
"The little bird, it straw shall seek, The straw I’ll give to the cow to eat."
"The pretty cow shall give me milk, The milk I’ll to the baker take."
"The baker he shall bake a cake, The cake I’ll give unto the cat."
"The cat shall catch some mice for that, The mice I’ll hang up in the smoke, And then you’ll see the snow.”"
"They stood in a circle while they played this, and the one to whom the word snow fell, had to run away and all the others ran after him and caught him. As they were running about so merrily the step-mother watched them from the window, and grew angry. And as she understood arts of witchcraft she bewitched them both, and changed the little brother into a fish, and the little sister into a lamb. Then the fish swam here and there about the pond and was very sad, and the lambkin walked up and down the meadow, and was miserable, and could not eat or touch one blade of grass. Thus passed a long time, and then strangers came as visitors to the castle. The false step-mother thought, “This is a good opportunity,” and called the cook and said to him, “Go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and kill it, we have nothing else for the visitors.” Then the cook went away and got the lamb, and took it into the kitchen and tied its feet, and all this it bore patiently. When he had drawn out his knife and was whetting it on the door-step to kill the lamb, he noticed a little fish swimming backwards and forwards in the water, in front of the kitchen-sink and looking up at him. This, however, was the brother, for when the fish saw the cook take the lamb away, it followed them and swam along the pond to the house; then the lamb cried down to it,"
"“Ah, brother, in the pond so deep, How sad is my poor heart!"
Even now the cook he whets his knife To take away my tender life.”
"The little fish answered,"
"“Ah, little sister, up on high How sad is my poor heart While in this pond I lie.”"
"When the cook heard that the lambkin could speak and said such sad words to the fish down below, he was terrified and thought this could be no common lamb, but must be bewitched by the wicked woman in the house. Then said he, “Be easy, I will not kill thee,” and took another sheep and made it ready for the guests, and conveyed the lambkin to a good peasant woman, to whom he related all that he had seen and heard."
"The peasant was, however, the very woman who had been foster-mother to the little sister, and she suspected at once who the lamb was, and went with it to a wise woman. Then the wise woman pronounced a blessing over the lambkin and the little fish, by means of which they regained their human forms, and after this she took them both into a little hut in a great forest, where they lived alone, but were contented and happy."
142 Simeli Mountain
"There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor. The rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he gained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so badly that he had no bread for his wife and children. Once when he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on one side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he had never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with amazement."
"While he was thus standing he saw twelve great, wild men coming towards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his barrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen. The twelve men, however, went to the mountain and cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and the twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it shut. After a short time, however, it opened again, and the men came forth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they were all once more in the daylight they said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” then the mountain closed together, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it, and the twelve went away."
"When they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree, and was curious to know what really was secretly hidden in the mountain. So he went up to it and said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and the mountain opened to him also. The he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn. The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not; but at last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. When he came out again he also said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow."
"And now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain. He lived joyously and uprightly, gave help to the poor, and did good to every one. When, however, the money came to an end he went to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel, and brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the most valuable things. When for the third time he wanted to fetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother. The rich man had, however, long been envious of his brother’s possessions, and of the handsome way of living which he had set on foot, and could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his brother wanted with the measure. Then he thought of a cunning trick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when he got the measure back a piece of money was sticking in it. He at once went to his brother and asked him, “What hast thou been measuring in the bushel measure?” “Corn and barley,” said the other. Then he showed him the piece of money, and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would accuse him before a court of justice. The poor man then told him everything, just as it happened. The rich man, however, ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away, resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures."
"When he came to the mountain he cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open.” The mountain opened, and he went inside it. There lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he did not know which to clutch at first. At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry. He wished to carry his burden outside, but, as his heart and soul were entirely full of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried, “Simeli mountain, Simeli mountain, open.” That, however, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred, but remained shut. Then he was alarmed, but the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and his treasures were no more of any use to him. In the evening the mountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they saw him they laughed, and cried out, “Bird, have we caught thee at last! Didst thou think we had never noticed that thou hadst been in here twice? We could not catch thee then; this third time thou shalt not get out again!” Then he cried, “It was not I, it was my brother,” but let him beg for his life and say what he would, they cut his head off."
143 Going A-Travelling
"There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel, but his mother said, “How canst thou travel? We have no money at all for thee to take away with thee.” Then said the son, “I will manage very well for myself; I will always say, Not much, not much, not much.”"
"So he walked for a long time and always said, “Not much, not much, not much.” Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, “God speed you! not much, not much, not much.” “What sayst thou churl, ‘not much?’” And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish."
"So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, “Hast thou never seen me threshing?” “What ought I to say, then?” asked the youth."
"But at that moment a dark shadow fell on them, and they saw that it was a dragon exactly the size of the dining room at home."
"So then they knew that all was lost. The dragon swooped down and caught the two children in his claws; he caught Effie by her green silk sash, and Harry by the little point at the back of his Eton jacket and then, spreading his great yellow wings, he rose into the air, rattling like a third-class carriage when the brake is hard on."
"""Oh, Harry,"" said Effie, ""I wonder when he will eat us!"" The dragon was flying across woods and fields with great flaps of his wings that carried him a quarter of a mile at each flap."
"Harry and Effie could see the country below, hedges and rivers and churches and farmhouses flowing away from under them, much faster than you see them running away from the sides of the fastest express train."
"And still the dragon flew on. The children saw other dragons in the air as they went, but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never stopped to speak to any of them, but just flew on quite steadily."
"""He knows where he wants to go,"" said Harry. ""Oh, if he would only drop us before he gets there!"""
"But the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and flew until at last, when the children were quite giddy, he settled down, with a rattling of all his scales, on the top of a mountain. And he lay there on his great green scaly side, panting, and very much out of breath, because he had come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's sash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket."
"Then Effie took out the knife Harry had given her on her birthday. It had cost only sixpence to begin with, and she had had it a month, and it never could sharpen anything but slate-pencils; but somehow she managed to make that knife cut her sash in front, and crept out of it, leaving the dragon with only a green silk bow in one of his claws. That knife would never have cut Harry's jacket-tail off, though, and when Effie had tried for some time she saw that this was so and gave it up. But with her help Harry managed to wriggle quietly out of his sleeves, so that the dragon had only an Eton jacket in his other claw. Then the children crept on tiptoe to a crack in the rocks and got in. It was much too narrow for the dragon to get in also, so they stayed in there and waited to make faces at the dragon when he felt rested enough to sit up and begin to think about eating them. He was very angry, indeed, when they made faces at him, and blew out fire and smoke at them, but they ran farther into the cave so that he could not reach them, and when he was tired of blowing he went away."
"But they were afraid to come out of the cave, so they went farther in, and presently the cave opened out and grew bigger, and the floor was soft sand, and when they had come to the very end of the cave there was a door, and on it was written: UNIVERSAL TAPROOM. PRIVATE. NO ONE ALLOWED INSIDE."
"So they opened the door at once just to peep in, and then they remembered what St. George had said."
"""We can't be worse off than we are,"" said Harry, ""with a dragon waiting for us outside. Let's go in."""
"They went boldly into the taproom, and shut the door behind them."
"And now they were in a sort of room cut out of the solid rock, and all along one side of the room were taps, and all the taps were labeled with china labels like you see in baths. And as they could both read words of two syllables or even three sometimes, they understood at once that they had gotten to the place where the weather is turned on from. There were six big taps labeled ""Sunshine,"" ""Wind,"" ""Rain,"" ""Snow,"" ""Hail,"" ""Ice,"""
"and a lot of little ones, labeled ""Fair to moderate,"" ""Showery,"" ""South breeze,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" ""Skating,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""South wind,"" ""East wind,"" and so on. And the big tap labeled ""Sunshine"" was turned full on. They could not see any sunshine the cave was lighted by a skylight of blue glass so they supposed the sunlight was pouring out by some other way, as it does with the tap that washes out the underneath parts of patent sinks in kitchens."
"Then they saw that one side of the room was just a big looking glass, and when you looked in it you could see everything that was going on in the world and all at once, too, which is not like most looking glasses."
"They saw the carts delivering the dead dragons at the County Council offices, and they saw St. George asleep under the dragonproof veil. And they saw their mother at home crying because her children had gone out in the dreadful, dangerous daylight, and she was afraid a dragon had eaten them. And they saw the whole of England, like a great puzzle map green in the field parts and brown in the towns, and black in the places where they make coal and crockery and cutlery and chemicals. All over it, on the black parts, and on the brown, and on the green, there was a network of green dragons. And they could see that it was still broad daylight, and no dragons had gone to bed yet."
"Effie said, ""Dragons do not like cold."" And she tried to turn off the sunshine, but the tap was out of order, and that was why there had been so much hot weather, and why the dragons had been able to be hatched. So they left the sunshine tap alone, and they turned on the snow and left the tap full on while they went to look in the glass. There they saw the dragons running all sorts of ways like ants if you are cruel enough to pour water into an ant-heap, which, of course, you never are. And the snow fell more and more."
"Then Effie turned the rain tap quite full on, and presently the dragons began to wriggle less, and by-and-by some of them lay quite still, so the children knew the water had put out the fires inside them, and they were dead. So then they turned on the hail only half on, for fear of breaking people's windows and after a while there were no more dragons to be seen moving."
Then the children knew that they were indeed the deliverers of their country.
"""They will put up a monument to us,"" said Harry, ""as high as Nelson's!"
"All the dragons are dead."""
"""I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead!"" said Effie."
"""And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so sure. What can they do with such a lot of dead dragons? It would take years and years to bury them, and they could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish the rain would wash them off into the sea."""
"But this did not happen, and the children began to feel that they had not been so frightfully clever after all."
"""I wonder what this old thing's for,"" said Harry. He had found a rusty old tap, which seemed as though it had not been used for ages. Its china label was quite coated over with dirt and cobwebs. When Effie had cleaned it with a bit of her skirt for curiously enough both the children had come out without pocket handkerchiefs she found that the label said ""Waste."""
"""Let's turn it on,"" she said. ""It might carry off the dragons."""
"The tap was very stiff from not having been used for such a long time, but together they managed to turn it on, and then ran to the mirror to see what happened."
"Already a great, round black hole had opened in the very middle of the map of England, and the sides of the map were tilting themselves up, so that the rain ran down toward the hole."
"""Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"" cried Effie, and she hurried back to the taps and turned on everything that seemed wet. ""Showery,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" and even ""South"" and ""South-West,"" because she had heard her father say that those winds brought rain."
"And now the floods of rain were pouring down on the country, and great sheets of water flowed toward the center of the map, and cataracts of water poured into the great round hole in the middle of the map, and the dragons were being washed away and disappearing down the waste pipe in great green masses and scattered green shoals single dragons and dragons by the dozen; of all sizes, from the ones that carry off elephants down to the ones that get in your tea."
"Presently there was not a dragon left. So then they turned off the tap named ""Waste,"" and they half-turned off the one labeled ""Sunshine"" it was broken, so that they could not turn it off altogether and they turned on ""Fair to moderate"" and ""Showery"" and both taps stuck, so that they could not be turned off, which accounts for our climate."
"""Theirs not to make reply,    Theirs not to reason why,    Theirs but to do and die:"
"Into the valley of Death    Rode the six hundred."""
"On every side thundered the enemy's guns, and shot and shell fell thick and fast, but on through all rode the brave horsemen, on till they reached the cannon at the end of the valley. The smoke of the enemy's fire closed round and hid them from their watching comrades, but now and again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those who tried to stop their charge."
"""Flashed all their sabres bare,    Flashed as they turned in air,    Sabring the gunners there,    Charging an army, while    All the world wonder'd."""
"And then only, when the strange order had been obeyed, when their duty had been nobly done in the face of death, did the Light Brigade all that was left of it turn to ride back. Alas! there were not then six hundred. Barely two hundred brave men, wounded, and blackened by smoke and powder, reached the British camp. The rest of the noble band lay dead or dying in the valley of Death."
"""When can their glory fade?"
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder'd.
Honour the charge they made!
"Honour the Light Brigade,    Noble six hundred!"""
The Coronation of King Edward VII
"Never had a country a more popular king than King Edward VII, nor a more gracious queen than Queen Alexandra, and never was a happier day for the English people than that on which King Edward was crowned. A few days before the date fixed for the Coronation the king suddenly became ill, and a great gloom fell over the country, for it was feared that he might never be crowned. But though his illness was severe he soon began to get better, and when he was out of danger the hearts of his subjects were filled with joy and thankfulness. Guns were fired, church-bells pealed, and glad shouts and cheers rang out from the happy crowds which lined the streets of London, through which the king and queen, in the midst of their gay procession, drove to Westminster Abbey."
"Inside the gray old Abbey was one of the most brilliant gatherings the world has ever seen. Princes and princesses from other lands were there, in their robes of state; peers and peeresses, in velvet, and ermine, and glittering diamonds; grave statesmen; and soldiers in their gay uniforms."
"It was a grand and solemn scene when, before them all, the aged Archbishop of Canterbury drew near to the King, and with trembling hands placed the crown upon his head."
"""The Lord give you a fruitful country, and healthful seasons, victorious fleets and armies, and a quiet Empire."" These are the words that the old man said when he had crowned the king, and each one of us will pray that all these blessings may indeed rest upon King Edward VII, and the great Empire over which he rules."
WAR.
"Over the broad, fair valley,     Filling the heart with fear,   Comes the sound of tramping horses,     And the news of danger near."
"'Tis the enemy approaching,     One can hear the muffled drum,   And the marching of the soldiers,     As on and on they come."
"Soon the air is rent in sunder,     Bullets flying sharp and fast,   Many stout hearts fail and tremble,     Every moment seems their last."
"On the ground lie dead and dying,     Young and old alike must fall;   None to come and aid the sufferer,     Fight they must for freedom's call."
"Many are the anxious loved ones     Praying for the war to cease,   Waiting for the right to conquer,     Bringing freedom, rest, and peace."
E.S.
A BOY'S HEROIC DEEDS.
"May 31st, 1889, is a day that will long be remembered with horror by the people in the beautiful valley of the Conemaugh, in Pennsylvania. On that date occurred the terrible disaster which is known to the world and will be named in history as the ""Johnstown Flood."""
"For many days previous to that date it had been raining hard, and great floods extended over a vast region of country in Pennsylvania, New York and the District of Columbia. Never before had there been such a fall of rain in that region within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. The waters in the river and creeks of that beautiful valley rose rapidly and overflowed their banks, while the people looked on in wonder, but seemingly not in fear. Suddenly there appeared to their wondering gaze a great bay horse galloping at break-neck speed and bearing a rider who waved his hands to them and cried: ""South Fork dam will burst. To the hills for your lives."" Only a few heeded his words of warning, while many mocked and jeered. On dashed the rider to warn still others of the impending danger, and, alas, to be himself and horse dashed to death by the massive timbers of a falling bridge. South Fork dam did break, and the mighty waters of Conemaugh Lake were hurled with resistless force upon the doomed people of that beautiful valley. The terrible details of the appalling disaster would fill several volumes larger than this. On rushed the mighty waters, sweeping onward in their flood dwellings, churches and buildings of every description, whether of wood, brick or stone, until Johnstown was reached and destroyed. The town was literally lifted from its foundations. Thousands of men, women and children were caught up and swirled away in the pitiless flood, and their agonizing but vain appeals for help could be heard amidst the mighty roar of the waters. Many acts of heroism were performed by brave men and women yes, and boys in rescuing victims of the flood. Only one of them concerns us here. Charles Hepenthal, a schoolboy, seventeen years of age, who was on his way to Bellefonte from his home at East Liberty, Pa., on the evening of the flood, stood quietly among the passengers on the express train, as they crowded to view the terrible havoc done by the flood. As the flood reached the train, at Sang Hollow, a small frame house came pitching down the mad tide, an eddy floated it in, near to the train, so close that the wailing cries of an infant were heard, piercing their way through the roar. Charles Hepenthal's heart was touched and his courage was equal to the emergency. He determined to rescue that little wailing waif from a watery grave. Strong men urged him to desist, insisting that he would only sacrifice his own life for nothing that it was impossible for any one to survive in the surging waters. But the boy was resolved."
"He cut the bell cord from the cars, tied it fast to his body, and out into the whirling gulf he went; he gained the house, secured the infant and returned through the maddened waters with the rescued babe in his arms. A shout went up from the passengers on the train. ""Wait!"" he cried; ""there is still another in the house, I must save her!"" and, seizing a plank to use as a support, he plunged again into the surging waters. Ah! his struggle this time was harder, for his precious load was heavy. In the floating house on his first visit he found a little girl, apparently ten years old, disrobed and kneeling beside her bed, on which lay the screaming infant, praying to her Father in heaven to save her and her baby brother from the fury of the flood. ""God has heard my prayer,"" she cried, as Charles entered the door. ""Oh, save the baby, quick,"" and then fainted away on the floor. When Charles had landed the babe in safety and returned again for the girl, he found her still unconscious on the floor, and the water was fast flowing in at the door."
"In another minute she would have been drowned. But the brave boy's manly arms were soon around her, and with his precious load the young hero fought his way back to land and was given three times three cheers and a ""tiger"" by the passengers of the day express."
A CAT'S EXTRAORDINARY LEAP.
"""Behold him then, O excellent by strength!"
"And speak wise words, not out of season."
"You see how, by his talking overmuch,     The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!"""
"The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, ""O Teacher!"
"are you speaking of us?"""
"And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, ""O great king! be it thou, or be it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap like this."""
"And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few words."
A Lac of Rupees for a Bit of Advice
"A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for their subsistence. Every day the young fellow used to go out and get what he could by begging. This continued for some time, till at last he became quite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go and try his luck in another country. He informed his wife of his intention, and ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old people during the few months that he would be absent. He begged her to be industrious, lest his parents should be angry and curse him."
"One morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day after day, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country."
"Here he went and sat down by a merchant's shop and asked alms. The merchant inquired whence he had come, why he had come, and what was his caste; to which he replied that he was a Brahman, and was wandering hither and thither begging a livelihood for himself and wife and parents. Moved with pity for the man, the merchant advised him to visit the kind and generous king of that country, and offered to accompany him to the court. Now at that time it happened that the king was seeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just had built. His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the Brahman and heard that he was good and honest. He at once deputed him to the charge of this temple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and one hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages."
"Two months after this, the Brahman's wife, not having heard any news of her husband, left the house and went in quest of him. By a happy fate she arrived at the very place that he had reached, where she heard that every morning at the golden temple a golden rupee was given in the king's name to any beggar who chose to go for it. Accordingly, on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband."
"""Why have you come here?"" he asked. ""Why have you left my parents?"
"Care you not whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and await my return."""
"""No, no,"" said the woman. ""I cannot go back to starve and see your old father and mother die. There is not a grain of rice left in the house."""
"""O Bhagawant!"" exclaimed the Brahman. ""Here, take this,"" he continued, scribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, ""and give it to the king. You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it."" Thus saying he dismissed her, and the woman left."
"On this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice First, If a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him be careful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he close them in death. Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and visits her in great pomp, she will receive him for the sake of what she can obtain from him; but if he comes to her in poverty, she will frown on him and disown him. Thirdly, If a man has to do any work, he must do it himself, and do it with might and without fear."
"On reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with her husband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but not liking to go before the king herself, she sent one of her relations. The king read the paper, and ordering the man to be flogged, dismissed him. The next morning the Brahmani took the paper, and while she was going along the road to the darbar reading it, the king's son met her, and asked what she was reading, whereupon she replied that she held in her hands a paper containing certain bits of advice, for which she wanted a lac of rupees. The prince asked her to show it to him, and when he had read it gave her a parwana for the amount, and rode on. The poor Brahmani was very thankful. That day she laid in a great store of provisions, sufficient to last them all for a long time."
"In the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the woman, and the purchase of the piece of paper. He thought his father would applaud the act. But it was not so. The king was more angry than before, and banished his son from the country."
"So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations and friends, and rode off on his horse, whither he did not know. At nightfall he arrived at some place, where a man met him, and invited him to lodge at his house. The prince accepted the invitation, and was treated like a prince. Matting was spread for him to squat on, and the best provisions set before him."
"""Ah!"" thought he, as he lay down to rest, ""here is a case for the first piece of advice that the Brahmani gave me. I will not sleep to-night."""
"It was well that he thus resolved, for in the middle of the night the man rose up, and taking a sword in his hand, rushed to the prince with the intention of killing him. But he rose up and spoke."
"""Do not slay me,"" he said. ""What profit would you get from my death?"
"If you killed me you would be sorry afterwards, like that man who killed his dog."""
"""What man? What dog?"" he asked."
"""I will tell you,"" said the prince, ""if you will give me that sword."""
"So he gave him the sword, and the prince began his story:"
"""Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant who had a pet dog. He was suddenly reduced to poverty, and had to part with his dog. He got a loan of five thousand rupees from a brother merchant, leaving the dog as a pledge, and with the money began business again. Not long after this the other merchant's shop was broken into by thieves and completely sacked. There was hardly ten rupees' worth left in the place. The faithful dog, however, knew what was going on, and went and followed the thieves, and saw where they deposited the things, and then returned."
"""In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the merchant's house when it was known what had happened. The merchant himself nearly went mad. Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the door, and pulling at his master's shirt and paijamas, as though wishing him to go outside. At last a friend suggested that, perhaps, the dog knew something of the whereabouts of the things, and advised the merchant to follow its leadings. The merchant consented, and went after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves had hidden the goods. Here the animal scraped and barked, and showed in various ways that the things were underneath. So the merchant and his friends dug about the place, and soon came upon all the stolen property."
Nothing was missing. There was everything just as the thieves had taken them.
"""The merchant was very glad. On returning to his house, he at once sent the dog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the collar, wherein he had written about the sagacity of the beast, and begged his friend to forget the loan and to accept another five thousand rupees as a present. When this merchant saw his dog coming back again, he thought, 'Alas! my friend is wanting the money. How can I pay him? I have not had sufficient time to recover myself from my recent losses. I will slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold, and say that another must have slain it. Thus there will be an end of my debt. No dog, no loan.' Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor dog, when the letter fell out of its collar. The merchant picked it up and read it. How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts of the case!"
"""I shall just see the elections through, and Perry well started--at"
"least, I suppose it'll be Perry--and then we'll be off. Shan't you be"
"glad to see the old home again, Al?"""
"""It's so sudden,"" she said. ""I shall be sorry to leave here."""
"""Oh, so shall I--very sorry to leave some of the people too. Still, it's"
"a good thing. Where's Eleanor? I must tell her. I say, Dick gets here"
"to-morrow."""
"""Oh, I'm so glad."""
"The Governor hurried out again, and Alicia returned to the sofa. The"
knot of her troubles had been rudely cut. Perhaps this summary ending
"was best. She herself would not, she knew, have had the strength to tear"
"herself away from that place, but if fate tore her--perhaps well and"
good. Nothing but unhappiness waited there for her; it seemed to her
"that nothing but unhappiness waited anywhere now; but at least, over at"
"home, she would not have to fear the discovery of her secret, the secret"
"she herself kept so badly, nor to endure the torture of gossip, hints,"
"and clumsy pity. No one, over at home, would think of Medland; they"
"might just know his name, might perhaps have heard him rumoured for a"
dangerous man and a vexatious opponent of good Sir Robert. Certainly
they would never think of him as the cause of bruising of heart to a
young lady in fashionable society. So he would pass out of her life; she
"would leave him to his busy, strenuous, happy-unhappy life, so full of"
"triumphs and defeats, of ups and downs, of the love of many and the hate"
"of many. Perhaps she, like the rest, would read his name in the _Times_"
"now and then, unless indeed he were utterly vanquished. No, he was not"
finally beaten. Of that she was sure. His name would be read often in
"cold print, but the glow of the life he lived would be henceforth"
"""'Anything that I should ask,' I replied."
"""'Ah, I see, I see! Should ask? I take it there are certain sacrifices"
"you would not ask,' returned the king. 'We here in France would say that"
"your position was Quixotic. However, your King Charles is a weak fool,"
"easily imposed upon. Is the lady quick and resourceful in expedients,"
"calm and thoughtful in emergencies, and silent on great occasions?'"
"""To all of which I answered, 'Yes.'"
"""'Surely the lady is not La Belle Jennings?' asked the king."
"""'Yes,' I replied."
"""'In that case you are the very man I want, and your lady-love can help"
"me buy Dunkirk. It is easy to lead a fool to do the wrong thing, and I'm"
"sure La Belle Jennings will find a way to gain her end and ours. If,"
"through her, you induce King Charles to sell Dunkirk to me on my own"
"terms, I'll make you its governor and a rich man. I'll put you in a"
"position to marry this paragon, Mam'selle Jennings, if, as I take it,"
lack of fortune is all that stands between you. I do not mind telling you
now that De Grammont had given me full information concerning the king's
view of La Belle Jennings and your relations to her before I wrote my
"first letter, inviting you to visit me.'"
"""I am loath to undertake so mean an office as that of inducing King"
"Charles to sell an English city, but I cannot save Dunkirk, and I may"
profit by helping what I cannot prevent. So I beg you broach the subject
"to Frances, cautioning her for me to take no risk, and if she is willing"
"to use and to hoodwink the man who would not hesitate to take her life,"
"let me know, and I shall write to you again with further instructions."

coincidence of subjective and objective change.' In dreams of flying we
"have this coincidence, the real subjective rhythm being transformed in"
consciousness to an objective rhythm.]

"that dreams of falling have an aural origin, and are caused by contraction"
"of the stapedius muscle, leading to a change in the ampullae which might"

caught the sound of the muscular contraction. The opinion of so acute an

"make the most of her remaining time. Sophia Wilmington, for whom she"
"had called, had already gone out. The Canon, who was engaged over his"
"correspondence, she was to meet later at the Kursaal. It was a lovely"
"morning. The line of white hotels, with their al fresco breakfast tables"
"spread temptingly on the terraces, gleamed in the sun. The _digue_ was"
"bright with summer dresses. The sands below alive with tennis players,"
"children making sand-castles, and loungers, and bathers, and horses"
moving among the bathing-machines. Yvonne tripped along with careless
tread. Her heart was in harmony with the brightness and movement and
"the glint of the sun on the sea. Once a man, meeting her smiling glance,"
"hesitated as if to speak to her, but seeing that the smile was addressed"
"to the happy world in general, he passed on his way. It was easy to"
kill time. She went down the Rue Flammande and looked at the shops. The
jewelry and the models of Paris dresses delighted her. The display
of sweets at Nopenny’s allured her within. When she returned to the
"_digue_, it was time to seek the Canon at the Kursaal."
The liveried attendants lifted their hats as she ran up the steps and
passed the barrier. She gave them a smiling “_bonjour_.” Neither the
"Canon nor any of the friends being visible on the verandah, she entered"
"the great hall, where the morning instrumental concert was going on."
"She scanned the talking, laughing crowd as she passed through. Many eyes"
"followed her. For Yvonne, when happy, was sweet to look upon. She was"
"turning back to retrace her steps, when, suddenly, a man started up from"
a group of three who were playing cards and drinking absinthe at a small
"table, and placed himself before her."
“_Tiens! c’est Yvonne!_”
She stared at him with dilated eyes and parted lips and uttered a little
gasping cry. Seeing her grow deadly white and thinking she was going to
"faint, the man put out his arm. But Yvonne was mistress of herself."
girl anyway--so much for Pola's education. And culture--what benefited
all the culture of Europe if Pola found enjoyment only in the company
of youths her mother would not permit in the house?
"Pola mistook Sidney's silence for hurt. ""You goose, I'm not saying I"
think I'm any better than _you_ are! But you must see that neither of
"us are a bit like that native girl!"" Which admission Pola considered"
most generous.
"""I wasn't thinking about whether you are any better than I am or not."
"I've been brought up, you see,"" with a rueful laugh, ""to believe that"
my father being a poet set _me_ a little apart from everyone else. And
I've hated it. What I was thinking was that there really isn't any
"class difference in people--except what we make ourselves, like the"
League building a barrier around me and you thinking you're in another
class from Mart because you're rich. Maybe it isn't really the outside
"things that count, maybe it's the big things we have got or haven't got"
"inside us--"""
"""Like what?"" demanded Pola."
Sidney was thinking of Lav's self-effacing ambition to serve the world
"from the seclusion of a laboratory, of Mart's cheerfulness in the face"
of her lot and her loyal affection for her exacting and rheumatic
"grandmother; of the courage of Mart's grandfather, Ambrose Calkins, who"
had lost his own life in going back to his sinking schooner for the
"cook who could not swim; of her own ancestor, Priscilla Ellis. _Those_"
"were the things which set people apart from their fellows, Sidney"
"thought, but the understanding was too new in her own heart for her to"
"find words in which she could tell Pola of it. ""Like what?"" Pola"
demanded again and this time her voice was a little haughty.
carrying Government food supplies for our scattered posts along the
frontier. These posts were already in difficulties owing to the
Raiders' interference with their commissariat.
"As can be imagined there was a great deal of noise, the native"
drivers gesticulating and talking in a way which proved that
something was afoot. I got out of the car and asked who was in charge
"of the caravan. A huge native contractor was pointed out to me, and,"
summoning him to my side I asked him what all the hubbub was about.
He was in a state of great agitation and told me that he had received
information from several reliable sources that the whole of the
"countryside ahead of them was in the hands of the Raiders, and that,"
"therefore, it was useless to go a step further."
"I expostulated with the man, pointing out that, by the terms of his"
"contract, he must go on, and that if he did not the soldiers for whom"
he was bringing supplies would die of starvation.
But he was dogged. He knew too well the methods of the Raiders with
the men they captured.
"""It's no use, Sahib,"" he said, respectfully but firmly. ""My men will"
"not go on as they are unarmed, and a single armed Raider is enough to"
"hold up the whole caravan."""
"I knew the man was right, but persisted in my efforts to persuade him"
"to chance it, pointing out that he might be lucky enough to elude the"
Raiders and to win through.
"""If the Government will give me a military escort I will go, but not"
"without,"" was his final word."
"Charing Cross, and he surprised me with an invitation to his house"
that night to meet Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise at supper.
"""The king and a dozen other gentlemen will be present,"" he said, ""but"
"there will be no ladies. Monsieur l'Abbé, being of the church, is not a"
"ladies' man, and besides, ladies have sharper eyes than men, and might"
"see much that is intended to remain unseen."""
"The count's remark seemed to settle the question of the Abbé's identity,"
and I hastened to Frances with the news. She assured me that she was
"ready to die of fright, but showed no outward sign of dissolution, and"
"when I complimented her on her power of self-control, said:--"
"""Fortunately, I am part hypocrite, and can easily act a part."""
"""You have a hard one ahead of you,"" I returned, ""and will need all your"
"strength before it is played to the end."""

"I was on hand early at De Grammont's supper, but found several gentlemen"
"ahead of me, awaiting, with the count in his parlor, the arrival of the"
"king. Soon after I entered the room, De Grammont presented me to the"
"Abbé. I was convinced at once that he was not George Hamilton. His beard,"
"worn à la Richelieu,--a mustache and a tuft on the chin,--was snow white,"
"and his hair, which was thin, hung in long white waves almost to his"
"shoulders. He walked with a stoop and wore spectacles, the glasses of"
"which were slightly colored. Being an ecclesiastic, though not a priest,"
"he wore no wig; but he was of the Order of the Cordon Bleu, and wore, in"
"addition to his badge and blue ribbon, a sword beneath his long coat. It"
"was the first time I had ever seen an ecclesiastic wearing a sword,"
"though it has since become common in France, where there are many ""Abbés"""
exclaimed aloud and covered their eyes for a moment to shut out the
hideous sight of them. Now they examined them closely.
Manlike they were: and yet like no human being conceivable to an Earth
mind. They were tremendously tall--twelve feet at least--but as thin
as so many animated poles. Their two legs were scarce four inches
"through, taper-less, boneless, like lengths of pipe; and like two"
flexible pipes they were joined to a slightly larger pipe of a torso
that could not have been more than a foot in diameter. There were four
"arms, a pair on each side of the cylindrical body, that weaved feebly"
about like lengths of rubber hose.
"Set directly on the pipe-like body, as a pumpkin might be balanced on"
"a pole, was a perfectly round cranium in which were glassy, staring"
"eyes, with dull pupils like those of a sick dog. The nose was but a"
"tab of flesh. The mouth was a minute, circular thing, soft and flabby"
"looking, which opened and shut regularly with the creature's"
"breathing. It resembled the snout-like mouth of a fish, of the sucker"
"variety; and fish-like, too, was the smooth and slimy skin that"
covered the beanpole body.
*       *       *       *       *
"Hundreds of the repulsive things, there were. And all of them shoved"
"and crowded, as a disorderly mob on Earth might do, to get close to"
the Earthmen's ship. Their big dull eyes peered in through the glass
"panels, and their hands--mere round blobs of gristle in the palms of"
which were set single sucker disks--pattered against the metal hull of
the shell.

"your body...."""
were on the other side of the invisible screen.
"Determined however, to remove this invisible screen, I said"
"Good-evening, and it was very cold. They muttered Good-evening, and yes,"
it was fresh. An Italian never says it is cold: it is never more than
_fresco_. But this hint that it was cold they took as a hint at their
"caps, and they became very silent, till the woman came in with the"
"soup-bowl. Then they clamoured at her, particularly the _maialino_, what"
was there to eat. She told them--beef-steaks of pork. Whereat they
"pulled faces. Or bits of boiled pork. They sighed, looked gloomy,"
"cheered up, and said beef-steaks, then."
"And they fell on their soup. And never, from among the steam, have I"
heard a more joyful trio of soup-swilkering. They sucked it in from
"their spoons with long, gusto-rich sucks. The _maialino_ was the"
"treble--he trilled his soup into his mouth with a swift, sucking"
"vibration, interrupted by bits of cabbage, which made the lamp start to"
"dither again. Black-cap was the baritone; good, rolling spoon-sucks. And"
the one in spectacles was the bass: he gave sudden deep gulps. All was
"led by the long trilling of the _maialino_. Then suddenly, to vary"
"matters, he cocked up his spoon in one hand, chewed a huge mouthful of"
"bread, and swallowed it down with a smack-smack-smack! of his tongue"
"against his palate. As children we used to call this ""clapping""."
"""Mother, she's clapping!"" I would yell with anger, against my sister."
The German word is schmatzen.
"So the _maialino_ clapped like a pair of cymbals, while baritone and"
bass rolled on. Then in chimed the swift bright treble.
"At this rate however, the soup did not last long. Arrived the"
beef-steaks of pork. And now the trio was a trio of castanet smacks and
"who don't worry about Tom, Dick, or Harry, but choose an Orestes at"
"least for their tormenting; so that, when they give up their pursuit"
"of a Risca, he may excusably regard it as a personal slight. It was the"
morose and gloomy nature of the man.
"“I know I 'm a fool,” he said to Herold, when every one had gone to bed,"
“but I can't help it. Any normal person would regard me as insane if
I told him I was stopped from saving the wreck of my career by
consideration for the temporary comfort of a bedridden chit of a girl
"half my age, who is absolutely nothing to me in the world (her uncle"
"married my first cousin. If that is anything of a family tie, I'm weak"
on family feeling); but that's God's truth. I'm tied by her to this
"accursed country. She just holds me down in the hell of London, and I"
"can't wriggle away. It's senseless, I know it is. Sometimes when I 'm"
"away from her, walking on the beach, I feel I 'd like to throw the whole"
of this confounded house into the sea; and then I look up and see the
"light in her room, and--I--I just begin to wonder whether she 's asleep"
and what she's dreaming of. There 's some infernal witchcraft about the
child.”
"“There is,” said Herold."
"“Rot!” said Risca, his pugnacious instincts awakened by the check on"
his dithyrambics. “The whole truth of the matter is that I'm simply a
sentimental fool.”
"“All honour to you, John,” said Herold."
"“If you talk like that, I 'll wring your neck,” said Risca, pausing for"
"à second in his walk up and down Sir Oliver's library, and glaring down"
"at his friend, who reclined on the sofa and regarded him with a smile"
"exasperatingly wise. “You know I'm a fool, and why can't you say it? A"
"I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on"
the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the
"ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like"
the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in
case of emergency. I looked for the _important_ things.
"As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't"
"decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,"
I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity
underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf
"of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make"
"faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do."
"Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the"
wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block
the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed
into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits
"standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the"
Middle Ages.
"""In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of"
"companionway,"" they had the words etched into the glass, ""break glass"
"with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the"
"following fashion."""
"I read the ""following fashion"" until I knew it by heart. _Boy_, I said"
"to myself, _I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get"
into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits
back in Undersea!_
And all the time I was alone. That was the best part.
a translation of an account of the payments for kaloma making.
ACCOUNT OF THE KALOMA MAKING
Supposing some man from inland lives in Kiriwina or in Luba
or in one of the villages nearby; he wants a katudababile. He
would request an expert fisherman who knows how to dive for
"kaloma. This man agrees; he dives, he dives ... till it is"
"sufficient; his vataga (large folding basket) is already full,"
"this man (the inlander) hears the rumour; he, the master of the"
"kaloma (that is, the man for whom the necklace will be made) says:"
"""Good! I shall just have a look!"" He would come, he would see,"
he would not give any vakapula payment. He (here the Sinaketan
"diver is meant) would say: ""Go, tomorrow, I shall break the shell,"
"come here, give me vakapula."" Next day, he (the inlander) would"
"cook food, he would bring, he would give vakapula; he (the diver)"
"would break the shell. Next day, the same. He (the inlander) would"
"give the vakapula, he (the diver) would break the shell. Supposing"
"the breaking is already finished, he (the diver) would say:"
"""Good! already the breaking is finished, I shall polish."" Next"
"day, he (the inlander) would cook food, would bring bananas,"
"coco-nut, betel-nut, sugar cane, would give it as vakapula;"
"this man (the diver) polishes. The polishing already finished,"
"he would speak: ""Good! To-morrow I shall drill."" This man (the"
"inlander) would bring food, bananas, coco-nuts, sugar cane,"
"he would give it as vakapula: it would be abundant, for soon"
"already the necklace will be finished. The same, he would give a"
"big vakapula on the occasion of the rounding up of the cylinder,"
"for soon everything will be finished. When finished, we thread it"
"on a string, we wash it. (Note the change from the third singular"
"into the first plural). We give it to our wife, we blow the conch"
description. The name awoke in me a recollection of a painful incident
"within my experience. I saw before me the puffed, degraded face of one"
to whom I had given chance after chance of redeeming himself from
"thraldom to the whisky bottle, one who had promised again and again to"
"amend his ways. At last, wearied, I had cast him out. He had been"
"looking after an important shipbuilding district, had conspicuous"
"ability and knowledge, the support of a faithful wife. But nothing"
"availed to save him from himself. ""Give me five minutes alone with"
"your prisoner,"" I said to Dawson, ""and I will give you the spy you"
"seek."""
"I had asked for five minutes, but two were sufficient for my purpose."
"The draughtsman had been obstinate with Dawson, seeking loyally to"
"shield his wretched brother-in-law, but when he found that I had the"
"missing thread in my hands, he gave in at once. ""What relation is ----"
"to your wife?"" I asked. He had risen at my entrance, but the question"
"went through him like a bullet; his pale face flushed, he staggered"
"pitifully, and, sitting down, buried his face in his hands. ""You may"
"tell the truth now,"" I said gently. ""We can easily find out what we"
"must know, but the information will come better from you."""
"""He is my wife's brother,"" murmured the man."
"""You knew that he was no longer in my service?"""
"""Yes, I knew."""
"I might fairly have asked why he had used my name, but refrained. One"
"can readily pardon the lapses of an honest man, terrified at finding"
"himself in the coils of the police, clinging to the good name of his"
"wife and her family, clutching at any device to throw the"
sleuth-hounds of the law off the real scent. He had given his
"directed to the political aspect of the situation, he acknowledged the"
gravity of the disclosure. But honestly he could not pretend to think it
a thing which should alter or lessen the esteem or love in which
Medland's friends held him. And even if the original act were seriously
"worthy of blame, the lapse of years made present severity as"
"unreasonable as it would be unkind. In vain Medland reminded him that,"
"let the act be as old and long past as it would, the consequences"
remained.
"""What!"" Norburn cried, ""would any one think the worse of Daisy? The more"
"fools they!"" and he laughed cheerfully, adding, ""I only wish she'd let"
"me show her I think none the worse of her. Why, it's preposterous, sir!"""
"""Preposterous or not,"" answered Medland, ""half the people in the place"
will let her know the difference. I may agree with you--God knows how I
"should like to be able to!--but there's no blinking the fact. Well, I"
"must tell her."""
"He recollected telling the same story to the other woman he loved, and"
"he shrank in sudden dread, lest his daughter should say what Alicia had"
"said, ""To me it is--horrible!"" The words echoed in his brain. ""Ah, I"
"can't speak of it,"" she had cried, and the gesture of her hand as she"
repelled him lived before his eyes again. Surely Daisy would not do that
to him!
"""I should be like Lear--without a grievance,"" he said to himself, with"
"a wry smile. ""The very height of tragedy!"""
It was near midnight before he put away his work. Norburn had left him
"alone two hours before, and he rose now, laid down his pipe, and went to"
look for his daughter in her little sitting-room. His heart was very
heavy; he must make her understand now why a man who made love to her
CHAPTER XXVI
DEEP ROMANY
The news which Sergeant Cardono had to communicate was indeed fitted to
"shake the strongest nerves. If true, it took away from Rollo at once all"
hope of the success of his mission. He saw himself returning disgraced
"and impotent to the camp of Cabrera, either to be shot out of hand, or"
"worse still, to be sent over the frontier as something too useless and"
feeble to be further employed.
"Briefly, the boy's news as repeated by La Giralda to the Sergeant,"
informed Rollo that though the court was presently at La Granja and many
"courtiers in the village of San Ildefonso, the royal guards through fear"
"and hunger had mutinied and marched back to Madrid, and that the gipsies"
were gathering among the mountains in order to make a night attack upon
the stranded and forsaken court of Spain.
In the sergeant's opinion not a moment was to be lost. The object of the
"hill Gitanos was pure plunder, but they would think nothing of"
"bloodshed, and would doubtless give the whole palace and town over to"
"rapine and pillage. Themselves desperate with hunger and isolation, they"
had resolved to strike a blow which would ring from one end of Spain to
the other.
It was their intention (so the imp said) to kill the Queen-Regent and
"her daughter, to slaughter the ministers and courtiers in attendance, to"
"leave her lying in Genoa!"""
"""I'll attend to my own end of the business,"" said Captain Dove with"
"angry decision. ""If you're going to London by train to-night, so am I."
"If you like to come back on board with me, I'll sail you round. But I'm"
"not the only man on the _Olive Branch_ who can sail a ship. Why, I've"
half a dozen broken captains--and most of 'em with extra masters'
"certificates, too--among my crew."
"""I've left Brasse and Da Costa in charge, and they'll work her across"
the Bay if I tell them to. I've only to send them a wire. And all you
have to do now is to say which way you want to travel--with me; for I'm
"going to stick to you like a leech till the day you pay me off."""
"Slyne walked to the window, humming a tune. But it was obviously costing"
him all of his refreshed fortitude to refrain from expressing his real
"sentiments toward Captain Dove. His face, as he stood glaring blindly"
"out at the beautiful scene before him, was like that of a wild beast"
"balked of its fair prey. But from between his bared, set teeth the"
careless hum came unbroken.
"""I think you're foolish,"" was all he said when he turned again,"
convinced that it would be a waste of time to argue the matter with the
"old man, ""but--suit yourself. Jobling and I _must_ get to London with"
Sal--Lady Josceline at the earliest possible moment. If you insist on
travelling with us to-night--so be it. All I want you to understand is
"that there's to be no more drinking, and that you must be advised by me"
in every other particular. This isn't really the sort of game you're
liable to shine in. It would be far better for all of us if you'd stay
"on board your ship."""
Captain Dove's weather-beaten countenance was turning slowly purple. He
the right to make his own terms at private houses upon the two remaining
nights of the working week. The costumes were to be provided by the
"managers, but were to be the property of the actors, who would undertake"
to replace them should any harm befall them at private representations.
"When these matters had been satisfactorily settled, and certain other"
"details arranged, the great men took their leave in high good humour;"
"and the Old Lion, shaking back his mane of shaggy hair, grasped Grey by"
"the hands, his eyes sparkling in his head."
"""Your fortune is made, young man! your fortune is made!  You will never"
need to fear poverty again. What life so grand as that of the man who
"can sway the multitude, make men laugh or weep at his bidding, hold them"
"suspended breathless upon his lips, move them to mirth, or rouse them to"
"the highest realm of passion?  Ah, that is life! that is life! Have I"
"not tasted it?  Do I not know?  And that life lies before you, my son."
"What the principles of Wycliffe have done for England, the principles"
"of Savonarola may yet do for Italy. At any rate, his work for Italy is"
not done yet.

[Sidenote: Pisa's Four Monuments.]
The four chief objects of interest at Pisa are all in a group at the
"northern end of the town, and a wonderfully effective group it is: the"
"cloistered cemetery, or Camp Santo, with its fifty-five shiploads of"
"earth from the Holy Land; the Baptistery, with its remarkable echo;"
"the Cathedral, with the pendent lamp in the nave which suggested to"
"Galileo the idea of the pendulum; and that wonder of the world, the"
"white marble Tower, which leans thirteen feet out of the perpendicular."
came to be known as the “Old Version.”
"d. _The Bay Psalm Book_, Boston, 1640. This was the first book printed"
in English-speaking America. It was made to obtain greater literalness
to the Hebrew original than was found in the versions then in use. The
book reigned supreme among the English churches in New England for over
"a century. Seventy editions of it were printed in America, the last in"
"1773. Eighteen editions appeared in England, and twenty-two in Scotland."
"There were no tunes given it until 1698, then only 13, with the air in"
the bass.
"e. _The Scottish Psalter_, completed 1650. Special mention is made of"
this version of the Psalms because it is the source of nearly all the
selections of metrical psalms which constitute Book Five of the
_Hymnary_. The number of versions and editions of psalms which appeared
"on the Continent and in England were numerous and confusing, each"
"claiming its own special merits. Finally, in the interests of better"
literary diction and greater unity in singing in the Scottish
"Presbyterian churches, the General Assembly authorized a new version."
"The result, after many years’ work, was the famous _Scottish Psalter_ of"
1650 which remains the standard work in Scotland today.
There is a certain “dignified crudeness” in some of the literary
expressions but the psalms have long been learned in this version and
have become an important part of the religious training and experience
"of millions of English speaking people, especially in Scotland."
The Scottish Psalter first appeared with words only. There were no notes
and no suggestions for melodies. The succeeding one hundred years were a
"time of confusion. The tunes used were few in number, such as the"
"leaders had learned from various sources, and passed on to succeeding"
generations by rote. The time came when better singing and better tunes

Mrs. Warren at least died with the reputation of one who promptly
"paid her bills; and the whole _assistance_, as it walked slowly back"
"to Brussels, recalled many a deed of kindness and jovial charity on"
the part of the dead Englishwoman.

"Vivie, on sizing up her affairs, got Monsieur Walcker, the Baptist"
"pasteur, to convey a letter to the American Consulate General."
"Walcker was used to such missions as these, of which the German"
"Government was more or less cognizant. The Germans, among their many"
"contradictory features, had a great respect for religion, a great"
tolerance as to its forms. They not only appreciated the difference
"between Jews and Christians, Catholics and Lutherans, but between"
the Church of England and the various Free Churches of Britain and
America. The many people whom they sentenced to death must all have
their appropriate religious consolation before facing the firing
"party. Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists were all provided for;"
there was a Church of England chaplain for the avowed Anglicans; but
what was to be done for the Free Churches and Nonconformist sects of
the Anglo-Saxons? They were not represented by any captive pastor;
"so in default this much respected Monsieur Walcker, the Belgian"
"Baptist, was called in to minister to the Nonconformist mind in its"
last agony. He therefore held a quasi-official position and was
often entrusted with missions which would have been dealt with
punitorily on the part of any one else. Consequently he was able to
deliver Vivie's communication to the American Consul-General with
some probability of its being sent on. It contained no further
appeal to American intervention than this: that the Consul-General
would try to convey to England the news of her mother's death to

The q-b spies some of the blue-and-red stripe-and-line cotton stuff of
which the peasants make their dress: a large roll in the doorway of a
"dark shop. In we go, and begin to feel it. It is just soft, thickish"
"cotton stuff--twelve francs a metre. Like most peasant patterns, it is"
much more complicated and subtle than appears: the curious placing of
"the stripes, the subtle proportion, and a white thread left down one"
"side only of each broad blue block. The stripes, moreover, run _across_"
"the cloth, not lengthwise with it. But the width would be just long"
enough for a skirt--though the peasant skirts have almost all a band at
the bottom with the stripes running round-ways.
"The man--he is the esquimo type, simple, frank and aimiable--says the"

"THE CRYSTALLINE SCHISTS, representing the finer types of"
"foliation, consist of thin, parallel, crystalline leaves, which"
are often remarkably crumpled. These folia can be distinguished
from the laminae of sedimentary rocks by their lenticular form and

"Many children, the Burmese will tell you, remember their former lives."
"As they grow older the memories die away and they forget, but to the"

About fifty years ago in a village named Okshitgon were born two
"children, a boy and a girl. They were born on the same day in"
"neighbouring houses, and they grew up together, and played together, and"
"loved each other. And in due course they married and started a family,"
"and maintained themselves by cultivating their dry, barren fields about"
"the village. They were always known as devoted to each other, and they"
died as they had lived--together. The same death took them on the same
day; so they were buried without the village and were forgotten; for the
times were serious.
"It was the year after the English army had taken Mandalay, and all Burma"
"was in a fury of insurrection. The country was full of armed men, the"
"roads were unsafe, and the nights were lighted with the flames of"
"burning villages. It was a bad time for peace-loving men, and many such,"
"fleeing from their villages, took refuge in larger places nearer the"
centres of administration.
Okshitgon was in the midst of one of the worst of all the distressed
"districts, and many of its people fled, and one of them, a man named"
"Maung Kan, with his young wife went to the village of Kabyu and lived"
there.
A suite of rooms received them in the quiet West End hotel where the
"Canon always stayed. They dined alone, the discreet butler waiting on"
"them, for the Canon was an honoured guest. When the cloth was removed,"
the Canon said in his even voice:--
"“Are you sufficiently recovered, Yvonne, to discuss this painful"
subject?”
"“I am quite ready, Everard.”"
“We will make it as short as possible. What I said last night must
"remain, whatever be the suffering. I have loved you deeply--like a young"
"man--in a way perhaps ill befitting my years. The memories, for they are"
"innocent, will always be there, Yvonne. If I did not seek strength from"
"Elsewhere, it might wreck my life to part from you.”"
A young teacher was telling her pupils the story of the emotional lady
"who, to put her lover to the test, bade him pick up the glove which"
she had thrown down into the arena between the tiger and the lion. The
"lover does her bidding, in order to vindicate his character as a brave"
"knight. One boy, after hearing the story, at once states his contempt"
"for the knight's acquiescence, which he declares to be unworthy."
"“But,” says the teacher, “you see he really did it to show the lady how"
foolish she was.” The answer of the boy sums up what I have been trying
"to show: “There was no sense in _his_ being sillier than _she_ was, to"
show her _she_ was silly.”
"If the boy had stopped there, we might have concluded that he was"
"lacking in imagination or romance, but his next remark proves what a"
"balanced and discriminating person he was, for he added: “Now, if _she_"
"had fallen in, and he had leapt after her to rescue her, that would"
to the exclusion of all other duties. This telegram informs me that a
"parcel has been handed in at Carlisle and the bearer arrested."""
"""Excellent!"" I cried. ""My time is at your disposal, Dawson. We shall"
"now get full light."""
He sat down and scribbled a reply wire directing the parcel and its
"bearer to be brought to him with all speed. ""They should arrive in two"
"or three hours,"" said he, ""and in the meantime we will tackle the"
draughtsman who made that plan of the battleship. Good-bye Mrs.
"Copplestone, and thank you very much for your hospitality. Your"
"husband goes with me."" My wife shook hands with Dawson, and politely"
saw him off the premises. She has said little to me since about his
"visit, but I do not think that she wishes ever to meet with him again."

the memory of her colonel.

"Dawson led me to the private office at the Central Police Station,"
"which was his temporary headquarters, and sent for the dossier of the"
"locked up draughtsman. ""I have here full particulars of him,"" said he,"
"""and a verbatim note of my examination."" I examined the photograph"
"attached, which represented a bearded citizen of harmless aspect; over"
"his features had spread a scared, puzzled look, with a suggestion in"
it of pathetic appeal. He looked like a human rabbit caught in an
unexpected and uncomprehended trap. It was a police photograph. Then I
"began to read the dossier, but got no farther than the first"
"paragraph. In it was set out the man's name, those of his wife and"
"children, his employment, record of service, and so on. What arrested"
"my researches was the maiden name of the wife, which, in accordance"
"with the northern custom, had been entered as a part of her legal"
clinging to hope.
"But when another quarter had gone by, doubt became conviction. I had"
been fooled! Either some one who had seen me loitering at Krapp's in
"the morning and heard my tale had gone straight off, and played me"
this trick; or--Gott im Himmel!--or I had been lured here that I might
be out of the way at home.
"That thought, which should have entered my thick head an hour before,"
"sped me from the street, as if it had been a very catapult. Before I"
reached the corner I was running; and I ran through street after
"street, sweating with fear. But quickly as I went, my thoughts"
outpaced me. My lady was alone save for her women. The men were
"drilling, the Waldgrave was in the camp. The crowded state of the"
"streets at sunset, and the number of strangers who thronged the city"
"favoured certain kinds of crime; in a great crowd, as in a great"
"solitude, everything is possible."
"I had this in my mind. Judge, then, of my horror, when, as I"
"approached the Ritter Strasse, I became aware of a dull, roaring"
"sound; and hastening to turn the corner, saw a large mob gathered in"
"front of our house, and filling the street from wall to wall. The"
"glare of torches shone on a thousand upturned faces, and flamed from a"
"hundred casements. At the windows, on the roofs, peering over"
"balconies and coping-stones and gables, and looking out of doorways"
"were more faces, all red in the torchlight. And all the time as the"
"smoking light rose and fell, the yelling, as it seemed to me, rose and"
"fell with it--now swelling into a stern roar of exultation, now"
"sinking into an ugly, snarling noise, above which a man might hear his"
neighbour speak.
"I seized the first I came to--a man standing on the skirts of the mob,"
The patient arrived at the Base on the sixth day; he said he
expectorated some blood at the end of about ten minutes after
"being shot, and experienced a 'half-choking sensation.' A small"
quantity of phlegm and occasional clots had been expectorated
since. He had walked about a good deal; movement occasioned
"cough, and he became 'blown' very rapidly."
On admission there were signs of fluid in the lower third of
"the pleural cavity, but no general symptoms beyond an evening"
rise of temperature to an average of 99°. About the twentieth
"day the temperature commenced to rise, and on the twenty-third"
and four following evenings reached 102°. The fever was
"accompanied by some distress, and a well-marked increase in the"
physical signs of the presence of fluid in the chest. The pulse
"rose to 96, and the respirations considerably above the average"
"of 24, which was at first noted. A strictly expectant attitude"
"was maintained, and the temperature steadily fell in a curve"
"corresponding to the rise, gradually reaching the normal at the"
end of a week. The physical signs at the base steadily cleared
"up, and at the end of six weeks the patient returned to England"
convalescent.

INJURIES TO THE ABDOMEN
Perhaps no chapter of military surgery was looked forward to with more

"The authorities of Panama estimate that there are about 36,000 tribal"
"Indians, that is to say aborigines, still holding their tribal"
organizations and acknowledging fealty to no other government now in the
"Isthmus. The estimate is of course largely guesswork, for few of the"
wild Indians leave the jungle and fewer still of the census enumerators
enter it. Most of these Indians live in the mountains of the provinces
"of Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veragua, or in the Darien. Their tribes"
are many and the sources of information concerning them but few. The
most accessible and complete record of the various tribes is in a
"pamphlet issued by the Smithsonian Institution, and now obtainable only"
"through public libraries, as the edition for distribution has been"
"exhausted. The author, Miss Eleanor Yorke Bell, beside studies made at"
first hand has diligently examined the authorities on the subject and
has presented the only considerable treatise on the subject of which I
have knowledge.

Of life among the more civilized natives she says:
"“The natives of the Isthmus in general, even in the larger towns, live"
"together without any marriage ceremony, separating at will and dividing"
"the children. As there is little or no personal property, this is"
"accomplished amicably as a rule, though should disputes arise the"
"the glass; shuddered, turned her back on herself, and sat down again.  In"
her own house!  Why not here--in this room?  Why not before her eyes?
Not yet a year married! It was almost funny--almost funny!  And she had
her first calm thought: 'I am free.'
"But it did not seem to mean anything, had no value to a spirit so"
bitterly stricken in its pride.  She moved her chair closer to the fire
again.  Why had she not tapped on the window?  To have seen that girl's
face ashy with fright!  To have seen him--caught--caught in the room she
"had made beautiful for him, the room where she had played for him so many"
"hours, the room that was part of the house that she paid for!  How long"
had they used it for their meetings--sneaking in by that door from the
back lane?  Perhaps even before she went away--to bear his child!  And
there began in her a struggle between mother instinct and her sense of
"outrage--a spiritual tug-of-war so deep that it was dumb, unconscious--to"
"decide whether her baby would be all hers, or would have slipped away"
"from her heart, and be a thing almost abhorrent."
"She huddled nearer the fire, feeling cold and physically sick.  And"
suddenly the thought came to her: 'If I don't let the servants know I'm
"here, they might go out and see what I saw!'  Had she shut the"
drawing-room window when she returned so blindly?  Perhaps already--! In
"a fever, she rang the bell, and unlocked the door.  The maid came up."
"""Please shut the drawing-room, window, Ellen; and tell Betty I'm afraid I"
got a little chill travelling.  I'm going to bed.  Ask her if she can
"manage with baby.""  And she looked straight into the girl's face.  It"
"wore an expression of concern, even of commiseration, but not that"
fluttered look which must have been there if she had known.
"""Yes, m'm; I'll get you a hot-water bottle, m'm.  Would you like a hot"
"bath and a cup of hot tea at once?"""

It was not much after seven when we came to Mandas. Mandas is a junction
where these little trains sit and have a long happy chat after their
arduous scramble over the downs. It had taken us somewhere about five
hours to do our fifty miles. No wonder then that when the junction at
last heaves in sight everybody bursts out of the train like seeds from
"an exploding pod, and rushes somewhere for something. To the station"
"restaurant, of course. Hence there is a little station restaurant that"
"does a brisk trade, and where one can have a bed."
A quite pleasant woman behind the little bar: a brown woman with brown
"parted hair and brownish eyes and brownish, tanned complexion and tight"
"brown velveteen bodice. She led us up a narrow winding stone stair, as"
"up a fortress, leading on with her candle, and ushered us into the"
"bedroom. It smelled horrid and sourish, as shutup bedrooms do. We threw"
open the window. There were big frosty stars snapping ferociously in
heaven.
"The room contained a huge bed, big enough for eight people, and quite"
clean. And the table on which stood the candle actually had a cloth. But
"imagine that cloth! I think it had been originally white: now, however,"
it was such a web of time-eaten holes and mournful black inkstains and
poor dead wine stains that it was like some 2000 B.C. mummy-cloth. I
wonder if it could have been lifted from that table: or if it was
mummified on to it! I for one made no attempt to try. But that
"table-cover impressed me, as showing degrees I had not imagined.--A"
table-cloth.
"""The Señor, the tall stranger, had a mission to the Lady Superior of the"
"Convent,"" she began. ""From Don Baltasar Varela it was, Prior of the"
great Carlist Monastery of Montblanch. He trusted his papers into her
"hands as a guarantee of his loyalty and good faith, and here they are!"""
Concha flashed them from her bosom and laid them in the general's hands.
"Usually Cabrera was blind to female charms, but upon this occasion his"
eye rested with pleasure on the quick and subtle grace of the Andaluse.
"""Then you are a nun?"" he queried, looking sharply at her figure and"
dress.
"""Ah, no,"" replied Concha, thinking with some hopefulness that she was to"
"have at least a hearing, ""I am not even a lay sister. The good Lady"
Superior had need of a housekeeper--one who should be free of the
convent and yet able to transact business without the walls. It is a
serious thing (as your honour knows) to provision even a hundred men who
can live rough and eat sparely--how much harder to please a
convent-school filled from end to end with the best blood in Spain! And
"good blood needs good feeding----"""
"""As I well knew when I was a butcher in Tortosa!"" quoth Cabrera,"
"smiling. ""There were a couple of ducal families within the range of my"
"custom, and they consumed more beef and mutton than a whole _barrio_ of"
"poor pottage-eaters!"""
To make Cabrera smile was more than half the battle.
"""You are sure they had nothing to do with the slayers of my mother?"" He"
"was fierce again in a moment, and pulled the left flange of his"
moustache into his mouth with a quick nervous movement of the fingers.
"ago, eyed his profile, without daring to ask questions. Before he reached"
"home, Winton stopped at a post-office, and sent this telegram:"
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
It salved a conscience on which that fellow's figure in the doorway
"weighed; besides, it was necessary, lest Fiorsen should go to the police."
The rest must wait till he had talked with Gyp.
"There was much to do, and it was late before they dined, and not till"
Markey had withdrawn could they begin their talk.
Close to the open windows where Markey had placed two hydrangea
"plants--just bought on his own responsibility, in token of silent"
"satisfaction--Gyp began.  She kept nothing back, recounting the whole"
miserable fiasco of her marriage.  When she came to Daphne Wing and her
"discovery in the music-room, she could see the glowing end of her"
father's cigar move convulsively.  That insult to his adored one seemed
"to Winton so inconceivable that, for a moment, he stopped her recital by"
getting up to pace the room.  In her own house--her own house!
"And--after that, she had gone on with him! He came back to his chair and"
"did not interrupt again, but his stillness almost frightened her."
"Coming to the incidents of the day itself, she hesitated.  Must she tell"
"him, too, of Rosek--was it wise, or necessary?  The all-or-nothing"
"candour that was part of her nature prevailed, and she went straight on,"
"and, save for the feverish jerking of his evening shoe, Winton made no"
"sign.  When she had finished, he got up and slowly extinguished the end"
of his cigar against the window-sill; then looking at her lying back in
"her chair as if exhausted, he said: ""By God!"" and turned his face away to"
the window.
agitation which had by that time attained its end. So when Vivie had
come out of prison and had promised to write to all the wardresses
and to meet them some day on non-professional ground; had found
Rossiter waiting for her in his motor and Honoria in hers; had
"thanked them both for their never-to-be-forgotten kindness, and had"
insisted on walking away in her rather creased and rumpled clothes
of the previous year with Bertie Adams; she sought the hospitality
"of Praddy at Hans Place. The parlour-maid received her sumptuously,"
and Praddy's eyes watered with senile tears.
"But Vivie would have no melancholy. ""Oh Praddy! If you only knew."
It's worth going to prison to know the joy of coming out of it! I'm
so happy at thinking this is my last day in England for ever so
"long. When the War is over, I think I shall settle in Switzerland"
"with mother--or perhaps all three of us--you with us, I mean--in"
Italy. We'll only come back here when the Women have got the Vote.
Now to-night you shall take me to the theatre--or rather I'll take
"_you_. I've thought it all out beforehand, and Bertie Adams has"
"secured the seats. It's _The Chocolate Soldier_ at the Adelphi, the"
only war piece they had ready; there are two stalls for us and
Bertie and his wife are going to the Dress Circle. My Cook's ticket
"is taken for Brussels and I leave to-morrow by the Ostende route."""
"""To-morrow"" was the 12th of August, and Dora was not yet in being to"
interpose every possible obstacle in the way of the civilian
"traveller. Down to the Battle of the Marne in September, 1914, very"
"little difficulty was made about crossing the Channel, especially"
off the main Dover-Calais route.
So in the radiant noon of that August day Vivie looked her last on
"the brown-white promontories, cliffs and grey castle of Dover,"
"scarcely troubling about any anticipations one way or the other, and"
friends and forget all about the army and the war. I would be gay and
"frivolous and go to theatres, music-halls and cafés. And one day I would"
spend in the British Museum and lose myself in books--that would be
"just like old times! Of course, our leave would not last for ever and"
the return journey would be terrible. No doubt the fortnight would pass
"very quickly, but I determined to enjoy every single hour with"
"deliberation and understanding, and to squeeze every drop of pleasure"
out of it. How many hours were there in a fortnight? More than three
"hundred! Many would be wasted in sleep, but still, there would be many"
"left and by dwelling upon each one, the fortnight would seem an age."

An afternoon and an evening in a train that travelled all too slowly. A
night and half a day at Calais Rest Camp. How terrible was the rankling
impatience that gnawed our hearts as the hours dragged on.
"But at last we were on the leave boat. There was another long delay, and"
"then, with a feeling of immense relief, we heard the engines throb and"
the paddle-wheels begin to turn. I looked overboard and saw white foam
hissing along the surface of water rapidly widening between us and the
quay.
Seventeen months of exile and slavery had come to an end and before us
lay a wonderful fortnight of freedom and happiness. And at the end of
the fortnight? There was no need to think of that now.
The sea was blue and smooth and a cool breeze was blowing. We saw the
cliffs of England grow larger and larger. Soon we were able to
"distinguish the town of Dover, the houses clustered round the harbour,"
and the Castle up on the cliff. It was there that I had begun my career
as a soldier more than two years before. How much had happened since
it has notable antiseptic and antipyretic effects. Useful in carbolic
"acid poisoning, alcohol, or alcoholic liquors, act as a chemical"
antidote besides overcoming the shock produced by the acid. It may also
be used locally for carbolic acid burns.
The effects of alcohol are noticed in ten or fifteen minutes after
"administration and will be shown by a better condition of the pulse, the"
"weak pulse becoming stronger and firmer; the quick pulse slower, the"
"breathing becomes more natural, eyes brighten up and in fact a general"
improvement is shown.
Externally alcohol is used alone as a strengthening application to weak
"tendons and muscles; or after a race, is used to rub on the legs,"
"combined with other drugs as a liniment, as alcohol, soap-liniment and"
witch hazel; can be used in surgery as an antiseptic.
To toughen the skin of tender or thin skinned horses who gall or chafe
"easily under the collar and saddle, alcohol will be found a most"
satisfactory application.
ALOE BARBADENSIS--BARBADOES ALOES
"The thickened juice of the leaves of Aloe vera, Linn., Aloe chinensis,"
"Bak., and probably other species, evaporated to dryness."
HABITAT.--The Barbadoes Island.
"PROPERTIES.--In hard masses, orange, brown, opaque, translucent on the"
"infection, absorption taking place from the large foul cavity"
behind the colon. As the cavity in part surrounded the
"descending duodenum, this possibly accounted for the attack of"
vomiting which preceded death.
(181*) _Ascending colon._--Wounded at Graspan while lying in
"prone position. _Entry_ (Mauser), over ninth rib in line of"
"right linea semilunaris; _exit_, in right buttock, just below"
and behind the top of the great trochanter.
"The injury was followed by little abdominal pain, but a strange"
sensation of local gurgling was noted. The bowels acted as soon
"as the patient reached camp, some hours after being wounded."
There was no sickness and nothing abnormal was noted in the
"motions, except that they were loose and light-coloured."
On the evening of the third day the patient came under
observation in the ambulance train for Capetown. He looked
"somewhat anxious and ill, but he complained of little pain; the"
"temperature was 102°, pulse 88, fair strength, soft and"
"regular. There was local dulness, tenderness, and deficiency of"
"movement in the right iliac region. As it was night, he was"
removed from the train and an operation was performed the next

"Prior to operation the condition was as follows: Pulse 84,"
"temperature 100°; respiration easy, 20. Tongue moist, but"
"thickly coated in centre. Abdomen moves fairly, and is"
"resonant, except in right lower quadrant. No distension."
"Dulness, tenderness, and rigidity in right iliac region, marked"
to outer side of cæcum. Entry wound nearly and exit quite
healed. Cannot flex right thigh. The following operation was
"Several voices muttered ""Thank God,"" but one man's teeth were still"
chattering as though he was so absorbed by his own fear that he had not
noticed the disappearance of its cause. Soon there was complete silence
and one by one we fell asleep.
Another clear day and another clear night. We lay awake listening
anxiously to the bursting of bombs and the muttering of anti-aircraft
fire. But we went to sleep in the end and felt drowsy all the following
day--a clear day. Casualties came in from a camp that had been bombed
"overnight, and we saw shattered limbs, smashed heads, and lacerated"
flesh. Several of our men were looking pale through lack of sleep and
had dark rings round their eyes.
"Another clear night. The agonizing vigil began again, but I was so weary"
that I went to sleep a few minutes after lights out. Sullen thunders
mingled with my dreams and did not wake me up.
Another clear day. Would the fine weather never end? Late in the
"afternoon, however, a few clouds collected on the horizon. In the"
evening the entire sky was overcast and not a star was to be seen. And
as we went to bed we heard the rain swishing down upon the canvas roof.
The unspeakable joy we all felt at the prospect of an untroubled night!
"""Bloody fine, this rain: we'll get some proper sleep now, thank God. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life, and I've been out here"
"since '15 and in some pretty hot places too."""
"""I reckon the longer yer out 'ere the windier yer get. I joined up in"
'14 like a bloody fool. At first I didn't care a damn for anything. Then
I was wounded on the Somme an' sent across to Blighty. I dreaded comin'
"back agin. I only 'ad a little wound in me 'and, an' I used ter plug it"
"wi' dubbin' an' boot-polish ter keep it raw. It didn't 'alf 'urt, but it"
"""He is come to do evil to--to Rollo!"" she said to herself, with a slight"
hesitation even in thought when she came for the first time upon the
Christian name.
But there was no hesitation in the swift assurance with which she set
"the rifle-stock to her shoulder, and no mistake as the keen and"
practised eye glanced along the barrel.
"She fired, and with a groan of pain the man fell back outside the"
enclosure.
The sound of Concha's shot was the first tidings to the besieged that
"the gipsies had really arrived. Rollo, stealing lightfoot from post to"
"post, pistol in hand, the Sergeant erect behind the vine-trellis on the"
"balcony between the rearward doors, Etienne and John Mortimer a little"
"farther along on the same side of the château, all redoubled their"
vigilance at the sound. But for the space of an hour or more nothing
"farther was seen or heard north, south, east, or west of the beleaguered"
palace of La Granja.
The gipsies had not had the least idea that their intention was known.
They expected no obstacles till the discharge of Concha's piece put them
"on their guard, and set them to concerting other and more subtle modes"
of attack. It was too dark for those in the château to see whether the
wounded man lay where he had fallen or whether he had been removed by
his comrades.
Rollo hastened back to Concha and inquired in a low voice what it was
she had fired at. Whereupon she told him the story of the man climbing
the railings and how she had stayed his course so suddenly. Rollo made
"no remark, save that she had done entirely right. Then he inquired if"

THE PLATES
The process of electrotyping is one of the most interesting steps in
"the making of a book, and authors will find it well worth while to"
brave the grime of the black-lead in order to become familiar with the
"detail. In brief, the type form is pressed down into a tablet made of"
"wax or similar substance, in which it leaves an impression. This wax"
"tablet is then allowed to remain in a galvanic bath, through which it"
"becomes covered with a coating of copper. When separated from the wax,"
"the thin, copper replica of the composed type is backed up by an alloy,"
"and, after passing through various stages in finishing, finally becomes"
an electrotype plate.[39]
COVER DESIGN AND ILLUSTRATIONS
While the printer has been engaged in putting the manuscript into
“I went to work in a millinery shop.” She shrugged her slender
"shoulders. “They starved me too,” she said--“just like the widow"
Snacheur. So----”
"She slipped her hand through his arm, laid her head against his"
"shoulder, and smiled:"
“But do not let us think of these things--it is so warm here.”
"The touch of the affectionate hands, the childlike caress of the girl,"
"the confidence and the clinging of her warm body to him, thrilled him."
She was in all the fresh beauty of her young womanhood; and the simple
"black gown, threadbare and worn as it was, only enhanced the beauty of"
her skin and pronounced the delicacy of her colour and the richness of
her splendid hair.
The girl increased the restlessness that had possessed the youth all
day. She brought to him the sweet whiteness and the subtle grace of
Betty--filled his senses with the atmosphere of the handsome girl who
had filled all his dreams from boyhood. It brought to him the most
"importunate craving of man, the love of woman."
Noll sat brooding for awhile. Yet even in the vigorous lust of life
"that held his young years, even as he sat there in the thrill of his"
"sweetest memories, he vaguely felt the gentle presence of these simple"
faded artistic folk about him; and he realized how indelibly the word
"Failure was written across them all. The coats were, if anything, more"
faded; the shoes more worn; the eyes alone lit up with the wonted glow
of delight in art. A little praise was their rich barmecidal feast.
"The greybeards, and the youths, and those between, they were all still"
"hoping to create the masterpiece--there was not, amongst them all,"
labour. In the telegram from London Mr. Chamberlain states that the
Viceroy has informed him that Indians will be eligible for commissions
in the New Defence of India Army.
MARCH OF WORLD TRAGEDY
In the meantime the Embodiment of World Tragedy is marching with giant
strides. Brief will be his hesitation whether he will choose to step
"first to the East or to the West. Already across the Atlantic, they are"
preparing for the dreaded visitation. In the farthest East they have
long been prepared. We alone are not ready. Pity for our helplessness
"will not stay the impending disaster, rather provoke it. When that"
"comes, as assuredly it will unless we are prepared to resist, havoc will"
be let loose and horrors perpetrated before which the imagination quails
back in dismay.
I have tried to lay before you as dispassionately as I could the issues
"involved. But some of you may cry out and say, we can not live in cold"
scientific and philosophic abstractions. Emotion is more to us than pure
reasoning. We cannot stay in this indecision which is paralysing our
wills and crushing the soul out of us. The world is offering their best
and behold them marching to be immolated so that by the supreme offering
of death they might win safety and honor for their motherland. There is
no time for wavering. We too will throw in our lot with those who are
fighting. They say that by our lives we shall win for our birth-land an
honoured place in their federation. We shall trust them. We shall stand
by their side and fight for our home and homeland. And let Providence
shape the Issue.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
The demand for this work so far exceeded my expectations that I was
"unable to make any considerable changes in the second edition, issued"
"in March, 1902; and circumstances again make it impossible for me to"
"give the work that thorough recension which I should desire. I have,"
"however, carefully considered the suggestions offered by critics, and"
have adopted them in some cases. Professor Fournier of Vienna has most
kindly furnished me with details which seem to relegate to the domain
of legend the famous ice catastrophe at Austerlitz; and I have added a
"note to this effect on p. 50 of vol. ii. On the other hand, I may"
justly claim that the publication of Count Balmain's reports relating
"to St. Helena has served to corroborate, in all important details, my"
account of Napoleon's captivity.
It only remains to add that I much regret the omission of Mr. Oman's
"name from II. 12-13 of page viii of the Preface, an omission rendered"
all the more conspicuous by the appearance of the first volume of his
"""History of the Peninsular War"" in the spring of this year."
"inevitable, the conviction of the uselessness of sorrow, the vanity and"
selfishness of grief.
There is no meeting again with the dead. Nowhere in the recurring
"centuries shall we meet again those whom we have loved, whom we love,"
"who seem to us to be parts of our very soul. That which survives of us,"
"the part which is incarnated again and again, until it be fit for"
"heaven, has nothing to do with love and hate."
Even if in the whirlpool of life our paths should cross again the paths
"of those whom we have loved, we are never told that we shall know them"
again and love them.
"A friend of mine has just lost his mother, and he is very much"
"distressed. He must have been very fond of her, for although he has a"
"wife and children, and is happy in his family, he is in great sorrow. He"
"proposes even to build a pagoda over her remains, a testimony of respect"
which in strict Buddhism is reserved to saints. He has been telling me
"about this, and how he is trying to get a sacred relic to put in the"
"pagoda, and I asked him if he never hoped again to meet the soul of his"
"mother on earth or in heaven, and he answered:"
"'No. It is very hard, but so are many things, and they have to be borne."
Far better it is to face the truth than to escape by a pleasant
falsehood. There is a Burmese proverb that tells us that all the world
is one vast burial-ground; there are dead men everywhere.'
"'One of our great men has said the same,' I answered."
He was not surprised.
"'As it is true,' he said, 'I suppose all great men would see it.'"
inhuman as a fiend.
"The Girl clenched her hands, heedless of the nails cutting into her"
"palms: ""Won't you wait a moment,--please, wait, Jack!"""
"""Wait? What for?"" the Sheriff flung at her brutally, his finger"
twitching on the trigger.
"The Girl's lips parted to answer, then closed again dumbly,--for it was"
"then that she saw the boots, then the legs of the road agent slide"
"uncertainly through the open trap, fumble clumsily for the rungs of the"
"ladder, then slip and stumble as the weight of the following body came"
upon them while the weak fingers strained desperately for a hold. The
whole heart and soul and mind of the Girl seemed to be reaching out
"impotently to give her lover strength, to hurry him down fast enough to"
forestall a shot from the Sheriff. It seemed hours until the road agent
"reached the bottom of the ladder, then lurched with unseeing eyes to a"
"chair and, finally, fell forward limply, with his arms and head resting"
"on the table. Still dumb with dread, the Girl watched Rance slowly"
circle round the wounded man; it was not until the Sheriff returned his
pistol to its holster that she breathed freely again.
"""So, you dropped into The Polka to-night to play a little game of poker?"
"Funny how things change about in an hour or two!"" Rance chuckled"
mirthlessly; it seemed to suit his sardonic humour to taunt his helpless
"rival. ""You think you can play poker,--that's your conviction, is it?"
"Well, you can play freeze-out as to your chances, Mr. Johnson of"
"Sacramento. Come, speak up,--it's shooting or the tree,--which shall it"
"be?"""
"Goaded beyond endurance by Rance's taunting of the unconscious man, the"
"Girl, fumbling in her bosom for her pistol, turned upon him in a sudden,"

"""So you've turned into a hotelkeeper,"" I said."
"""Well, you can joke about it,"" he returned, ""but all I do is to give"
shelter to the people who come here. That's all the hotel there is to it.
"My neighbor Olaus can't do any more either, even if he builds a place"
that's ten times as big. Look over there--now he's building another
"house--a shed, I'd call it--and he's got three grown men working on it so"
he can get it done by next summer. But it won't be much bigger than my
"place at that, and anyhow, the gentry don't want to be bothered walking"
all that distance to his place when here's my house right at the car stop.
"And besides it was me that started it, and if I was Olaus I wouldn't have"
wanted to imitate me like a regular monkey and started keeping boarders
which I didn't know the first thing about. But he can't make himself any
"different from what he is, so he puts up a few old bits of canvas and rugs"
and cardboard inside his barn and gets people to sleep there. But I'd
"never ask the gentry to sleep in a barn, a storehouse for fodder and hay"
"for dumb beasts, if you'll excuse my mentioning it! But of course if"
"you've no shame in you and don't know how to behave in company--"""
"""Lucky I've met you,"" I said. ""Why, I might have gone on down the road to"
"his place!"""
"We walked on together, with Eilert talking and explaining all the way, and"
assuring me over and over again that Olaus was a good-for-nothing for
copying him as he did.
"If I had known what was awaiting me, I should certainly have passed by"
"Eilert's house. But I did not know. I was innocent, though I may not have"
appeared so. It cannot be helped.
Tervueren road they met numbers of peasant refugees in carts and on
"foot, driving cattle, geese or pigs towards the capital; urging on"
the tugging dogs with small carts and barrows loaded with personal
"effects, trade-goods, farm produce, or crying children. All of them"
"had a distraught, haggard appearance and were constantly looking"
"behind them. From the east, indeed, came the distant sounds of"
explosions and intermittent rifle firing. Mrs. Warren was blanched
"with fear, her cheeks a dull peach colour. She questioned the people"
"in French and Flemish, but they only answered vaguely in raucous"
"voices: ""Les Allemands!"" ""De Duitscher."""
"One old woman, however, had flung herself down by the roadside,"
while her patient dog lay between the shafts of the little cart till
she should be pleased to go on. She was more communicative and told
"Mrs. Warren a tale too horrible to be believed, about husband, son,"
"son-in-law all killed, daughter violated and killed too, cottage in"
"flames, livestock driven off. Recovering from her exhaustion she"
"rose and shook herself. ""I've no business to be here. I should be"
with _them_. I was just packing this cart for the market when it
happened. Why did I go away? Oh for shame! I'll go back--to
"_them_..."" And forthwith she turned the dog round and trudged the"
same way they were going.
At last they came opposite the courtyard of the Villa and saw the
lawn and gravel sweep full of helmeted soldiers in green-grey
"uniform, their bodies hung with equipment--bags, great-coats,"
"rolled-up blankets, trench spades, cartridge bandoliers. Vivie"
"jumped down quickly, said to her mother in a low firm voice: ""Leave"
"everything to me. Say as little as possible."" Then to the farmer:"

have been not a whit more perplexed at the prospect. As for John he had
the sensation of living in a fantastic dream. A child of six would have
"been a more practical ally. In the course of befogged conversation,"
"however, it was arranged that Miss Lindon should transfer to the new"
"house her worldly belongings, of which she was to give him an inventory,"
"including Dandy and Dickie and her maid Phoebe, a most respectable"
"girl of Baptist upbringing, who had been cruelly jilted by a prosperous"
"undertaker in the neighborhood, whom, if you had seen him conducting a"
"funeral, you would have thought as serious and God-fearing a man as the"
"clergyman himself; which showed how hypocritical men could be, and how"
"you ought never to trust to appearances. It was also settled that, as"
soon as Unity could be rescued from the guardianship of the orphanage
authorities and comfortably installed in a convalescent home by the
"seaside, Miss Lindon would journey thither in order to make her ward's"
acquaintance. In the meanwhile John would go house-hunting.
"“Walter Herold will help me,” said John."
"“That's your friend who acts, is n't it?” said Miss Lindon. “I have n't"
"any objection to theatres myself. In fact, I often used to go to see"
Irving when I was young. You meet quite a nice class of people in the
dress-circle. But I don't think ladies ought to go on the stage. I hope
Mr. Herold won't put such an idea into Unity's head.”
"“I don't think he will,” said John."
“Young girls are sometimes so flighty. My old friend Mrs. Willcox had
"a daughter who went on the stage, and she married an actor, and now has"
"twelve children, and lives in Cheshire. I was hearing about her only the"
other day. I suppose Unity will have to be taught music and drawing and
French like any other young lady.”
"Captain Johnson, in his ""Lives of the Pirates,"" when Porter and his friend"
"""addressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of Sheba did Solomon, to wit, That"
"having heard of his Fame and Achievements, they had put in there to learn"
"his Art and Wisdom in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same"
honourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his
"Knowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of"
Necessaries for such Adventures. Roberts was won upon by the Peculiarity
"and Bluntness of these two Men and gave them Powder, Arms, and what ever"
"else they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and"
"at parting, said, he hoped the L---- would Prosper their handy Works."""
"POUND, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"On August 8th, 1689, this pirate, with five men and a boy, sailed out of"
"Boston Harbour as passengers in a small vessel. When off Lovell's Island,"
five other armed men joined them. Pound now seized the craft and took
"command, and declared his intention of going on a piratical cruise. The"
first vessel they met with they decided to take. It was a fishing boat.
"Pound ran his craft alongside, but at the last moment his heart failed"
"him, and he merely bought eight penn'o'th of mackerel from the surprised"
fishermen.
"He then sailed to Falmouth, Maine, where the corporal and soldiers of the"
guard at the fort deserted in the night and sailed off with Pound and his
"crew. Fortified by this addition to his crew, the pirate attacked a sloop,"
"the _Good Speed_, off Cape Cod, and a brigantine, the _Merrimack_, and"
"several other prizes. By this time, the Governor at Boston had heard of"
"Pound's escapades, and sent an armed sloop, the _Mary_, to search for him."
"The pirate was discovered in Tarpaulin Cove, and a fierce and bloody fight"
"took place before the pirates struck their ""Red flagg."" The prisoners were"
"cast into Boston Gaol to await their trial. Pound had been wounded, being"
Presently the monkey had another disappointment. The intact tin
"baffled him. He tried his teeth upon it--but unavailingly, so he"
began to batter it upon the metal eye of a band encircling the spar.
"""There'll be an unholy mess, by Jove!"" ejaculated the commander, who"
"had now reappeared upon the scene, for the tin showed signs of"
capitulating to the strenuous frontal attacks on the part of
Mephisto.
"""Bring up another tin--and take care to open it this time,"" ordered"
"the staff-paymaster recklessly, who had now taken the precaution of"
covering the pay-tables with a green baize cloth.
"""Bang, bang, bang!"" went the tin under the muscular efforts of"
Mephisto. Already large drops of the viscous fluid were descending
"upon the hallowed quarter-deck, bespattering officers and men"
"indiscriminately, for owing to the ship's speed a strong current of"
air was drifting aft and spraying the stuff far and wide.
"""Clear the quarter-deck,"" ordered the commander. ""Up aloft a couple"
of hands and collar the brute. By Jove! if it gives much more
"trouble, I'll have it shot."""
"Suddenly, above the scuffling of feet as the men doubled for'ard,"
"came the shout: ""Submarine on the port quarter."""
"Sharply the bugle sounded ""Action,"" and as the ""Sunderland"" began to"
"circle to starboard in answer to a quick movement of her helm, the"
quick-firers began to bark at a pole-like object four hundred yards
off.
"The unexpected detonation, as a gun was discharged fifty feet under"
that he would come to her--that his soul would enter the body of the
"little baby soon about to be born, so that they two might be together in"
life once more.
"And in the dream the lover consented. He would come, he said, into the"
child of the woman he loved.
"When the woman awoke she remembered it all, and the desire of life"
"returned to her again, and all the world was changed because of the new"
life she felt within her. But she told no one then of the dream or of
what was to happen.
"Only she took the greatest care of herself; she ate well, and went"
"frequently to the pagoda with flowers, praying that the body in which"
"her lover was about to dwell might be fair and strong, worthy of him who"
"took it, worthy of her who gave it."
In due time the baby was born. But alas and alas for all her hopes! The
"baby came but for a moment, to breathe a few short breaths, to cry, and"
to die; and a few hours later the woman died also. But before she went
"she told someone all about it, all about the dream and the baby, and"
that she was glad to go and follow her lover. She said that her baby's
"soul was her lover's soul, and that as he could not stay, neither would"
she; and with these words on her lips she followed him out into the
void.
"The story was kept a secret until the husband died, not long"
afterwards; but when I came to the village all the people knew it.
"I must confess that this story is to me full of the deepest reality,"
full of pathos. It seems to me to be the unconscious protestation of
humanity against the dogmas of religion and of the learned. However it

PLAN
The indexer should decide definitely in his mind just what his
"procedure is to be before actually beginning work. At first, it is well"
"to make the index too full rather than the reverse, as it is easier to"
"cut out than to fill in. Most important of all, he must be sure that"
the matter to be indexed is clearly understood before he attempts to
transcribe the idea. The character of the book to be indexed must be
"carefully considered, taking into account the class of people who will"
"probably consult it, and the lines on which they will probably seek"
information.
Judgment is required in deciding whether it is wise to choose the
exact words of the author or to condense the idea into other words.
"In technical books, the exact wording is sometimes essential, but"
otherwise it is more important to express the _idea_ than the exact
terms in which it is expressed.
Always prefer simple words and expressions to those which are unusual
and cumbersome.
Omit every unessential word.
"When the book being indexed is one written upon a specific subject,"
this main subject should not be indexed unless necessary to indicate
"some reference for which a searcher would look. Ordinarily, the"
Contents covers this point rather than the Index.
Bear in mind particularly the two extremes: the importance of
Of course I ought to be old enough to understand what all sensible
"Norwegians know, that our country is once more on the right road. The"
papers are all writing about the splendid progress the tourist traffic has
made in Stordalen since the motor road was opened--ought I not to go there
and feel gratified?
"From old habit, I still take an interest in the few of us who are left;"
Miss Torsen is still here.
"Miss Torsen--what more is there to be said about her? Well, she does not"
"leave; she stays here to complete the picture of the woman Torsen, child"
of the middle class who has read schoolbooks all through her formative
"years, who has learned all about _Artemis cotula_, but undernourished"
her soul. That is what she is doing here.
"I remember a few weeks ago, when we were infested with Englishmen, a young"
sprout coming down from the mountain top with a bloodstained rag which he
"threw on the ground, saying, ""Here's what's left of your lawyer that fell"
"off!"" Miss Torsen heard it, and never moved a muscle. No, she never"
"mourned the death of the lawyer very keenly; on the contrary, she wrote"
"off at once to ask another friend to come. When he came, he turned out to"
"be a swaggering scatterbrain--a ""free lance,"" he called himself in the"
visitors' book. I have not mentioned him before because he was less
"important than she; less important, in fact, than any of us. He was"
beardless and wore his collar open; heaven knows if he wasn't employed at
"a theater or in the films. Miss Torsen went to meet him when he came, and"
"said, ""Welcome to our mountains,"" and ""Thanks for coming."" So evidently"
she had sent for him. But why did she not leave? Why did she seem to
"strike root in the place, and even ask others to come here? Yet she had"
been the first to want to leave last summer! There was something behind
this.
Eilert and I followed to my room.

"As a matter of fact, I went out again with Eilert at once. He had a great"
"deal to tell me and explain to me, and I was not unwilling to listen to"
"him then. Really, Eilert was not too bad, a fine fellow with four ragged,"
"magnificent youngsters by his first wife, who had died two years before,"
"and another child by his second wife. He must have forgotten, as he told"
"me this, the yarn about the sick wife and the ailing children that he had"
spun for me last winter. The girl who had come down the stairs with the
"message from the ""missis"" was no servant, but Eilert's young wife. And"
"she, too, was all right--strong and good, handy about the stables, and"
pregnant again.
"It all looks good to me, Eilert: your wife and everything you tell me"
about your family.
"No one will understand my strange contentment, then; I had been full of an"
obscure happiness from the moment I came to this house. Probably a mere
"coincidence, but that did not detract from my satisfactory state of mind;"
"I was pleased with everything, and all things added to my cheerful frame"
"of mind. There were some pigs by the barn, very affectionate pigs, because"
they were used to the children playing with them and kissing them and
"riding on their backs. And there was one of the goats, up on the roof of"
"course, standing so far out along the edge that it was a wonder he didn't"
"grow dizzy. Seagulls flew criss-cross over the fields, screaming their"
"own language to one another, and being friends or enemies to the best of"
"their ability. Down by the mouth of the river, just beneath the sunset,"
began the great road that winds up through the woods and the valley. There
is something of the friendliness of a living being about such a forest

"was no sickness, the bowels were confined three days, and there"
was pain across the back and down the thigh.
"On the tenth day he arrived at the Base, when he was lying on"
his back suffering considerable pain. The temperature ranged to
"101°. There was diarrhoea and cystitis, with a considerable"

"fluctuating spot existed on the back, just to the right of the"
original exit wound which was firmly healed. The abdomen moved
"fairly with respiration in its upper part, but was motionless"
"below, especially in the right iliac fossa; some induration was"
to be felt here. The right thigh was kept flexed.
"During the next few days the pus disappeared from the urine,"
and with this change the induration in the right iliac fossa
increased. An incision (Mr. Gairdner) was made into the

recovered.

morphia injection. Prior to the accident the patient was
"suffering from diarrhoea, but afterwards the bowels were"
"cut, with a ring of everted mucous membrane, and the wall of"
the bowel in the neighbourhood was thickened. All three
openings were included within a length of 2-1/2 inches. There
was no surrounding ecchymosis of the bowel wall. Very little
escaped intestinal contents were found in the situation of the
"bowel. The latter had apparently been retracted upwards, and"
lay to the left of the lumbar spine. The wounds were readily
"closed by five Lembert's sutures, three crossing the openings,"
and one at each end. The belly was then washed out with boiled
water and closed. The delay in finding the wounds due to the
mistaken impression that they would be found in the pelvis
"materially prolonged the operation, which lasted an hour and a"
"half. The patient never rallied, and died seventeen hours"
later. It is possible that a wound in the sigmoid flexure was
present which had already closed at the time of operation.
"(166*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), opposite"
"central point of left ilium; _exit_, 1-1/2 inch above the"
centre of the right Poupart's ligament. Vomiting commenced soon
"after the injury, and this was continuous until the patient's"
"arrival in the Stationary hospital on the fourth day, when the"
condition was as follows:--
"Face extremely anxious in expression. Temperature 101°,"
"sweating freely. Pulse 110, fair strength. Tongue moist."
"Abdomen much distended, rigid, motionless, tympanitic"
throughout. Bowels confined. No urine had been passed for
"twenty-four hours, [Symbol: ounce]ij in bladder on"
"catheterisation, clear, and containing no blood."
Abdominal section. Median incision. A considerable quantity of
bloody effusion was evacuated. Intestine generally congested
asked.
"""Nay,"" said Sergeant Cardono; ""but when I am required to guide a party"
"secretly to San Ildefonso, where the court of the Queen-Regent is"
"sojourning, it does not require great penetration to see the general"
"nature of the service upon which I am engaged!"""
Rollo recovered himself.
"""You have not yet told me what you have discovered,"" he said,"
expectantly.
"""No,"" replied the Sergeant with great composure--""that can wait."""
For little Concha was approaching; and though he had limitless
expectations of the good influence of that young lady upon the military
"career of his officer, he did not judge it prudent to communicate"
"intelligence of moment in her presence. Wherein for once he was wrong,"
"since that pretty head of the Andalucian beauty, for all its clustering"
"curls, was full of the wisest and most far-seeing counsel--indeed, more"
to be trusted in a pinch than the _juntas_ of half-a-dozen provinces.
"But the Sergeant considered that when a girl was pretty and aware of it,"
she had fulfilled her destiny--save as it might be in the making of
military geniuses. Therefore he remained silent as the grave so long as
"Concha stayed. Observing this, the girl asked a simple question and then"
"moved off a little scornfully, only remarking to herself: ""As if I could"
"not make him tell me whenever I get him by himself!"""
"She referred (it is needless to state) not to Sergeant Cardono, but to"
"his commanding officer, Señor Don Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the"
self-sufficient shire of Fife.

_Yuri Andreevich Androv stood facing the bulkhead that sealed the
"forward avionics bays, feeling almost as though he were looking at a"
"bank vault. As in all high-security facilities, the access doors were"
controlled electronically.
"Since the final retrofits were now completed, the Japanese maintenance"
crews were only working two shifts; nobody was around at this hour
except the security guards. He'd told them he'd thought of something
and wanted to go up and take a look at the heavy-duty EN-15 turbo
"pumps, which transferred hydrogen to the scramjets after it was"
converted from liquid to gaseous phase for combustion. He'd been
worrying about their pulse rating and couldn't sleep.
He'd gone on to explain that although static testing had shown they
would achieve operating pressure in twenty milliseconds if they were
"fully primed in advance, that was static testing, not flight testing,"
and he'd been unable to sleep wondering about the adhesive around the
seals.
"It was just technical mumbo-jumbo, although maybe he should be checking"
"them, he thought grimly. But he trusted the engineering team. He had"
"to. Besides, the pumps had been developed specially for the massive"
"Energia booster, and they'd functioned flawlessly in routine launchings"
of those vehicles at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
"Of course, at Baikonur they always were initiated while the Energia was"
"on the launch pad, at full atmospheric pressure. On the _Daedalus_"
"they'd have to be powered in during flight, at sixty thousand feet and"
"2,700 miles per hour. But still . . ."
"""Mistakes be blowed--'e knows what's what, you take my word for it ..."""
"We gathered idly round the disputants, glad of a distraction that would"
help to pass the time. A third person joined in the argument:
"""If 'e bombs 'orspitals an' C.C.S.'s it's our own bloody fault. Look at"
our C.C.S. 'ere. There's a ordnance park and a R.E. dump up the road.
There's a railway in front an' a sidin' where troops is always
detrainin'. Then there's a gas dump over yonder. An' if we're bloody
"fools an' leave the lights on at night, 'ow can 'e tell what's what when"
everything's mixed up together? Why the bloody 'ell don't they put
C.C.S.'s away from dumps an' railways? Why don't they stick 'em right in
"the fields somewhere? I bet we'll cop it one o' these nights, an' serve"
"us right too."""
German aeroplanes had passed overhead almost every clear windless
"night, but the buzz of propellers, that often went on for hours, and the"
dull boom of bombs exploding far away had never caused anything more
than slight uneasiness and apprehension.
"One night, after we had been at the C.C.S. for about a month, we heard"
the uproar of a distant air-raid. Early the next morning a number of
"motor-ambulances arrived with their loads of wounded men. A camp, a mile"
"or two from the station, had been bombed and fifty men had been killed"
"and many more wounded. One of the ""cases"" brought into the theatre had"
been hit on the forehead. The bomb-fragment had not penetrated the
"skull, but had passed along its surface. The scalp hung over the"
"forehead loosely like an enormous flap, the red, jagged edge nearly"
touching the eyebrows. Since then I thought of this man every time there
was an air-raid.
"drunk complete their service by swinging their hammocks, sprinkling them"
with cold water and fanning them as they lie in a stupor. Smoking is
"another social custom, but the cigars are mere hollow rolls of tobacco"
and the lighted end is held in the mouth. Among some of the tribes in
"Comagre the bodies of the caciques, or chief men, were preserved after"
death by surrounding them with a ring of fire built at a sufficient
distance to gradually dry the body until skin and bone alone remained.
The Indians with whom the visitor to Panama most frequently comes into
contact are those of the San Blas or Manzanillo country. These Indians
"hover curiously about the bounds of civilization, and approach without"
"actually crossing them. They are fishermen and sailors, and many of"
"their young men ship on the vessels touching at Colon, and, after"
"visiting the chief seaports of the United States, and even of France and"
"England, are swallowed up again in their tribe without affecting its"
customs to any appreciable degree. If in their wanderings they gain new
ideas or new desires they are not apparent. The man who silently offers
"you fish, fruits or vegetables from his cayuca on the beach at Colon may"
"have trod the docks at Havre or Liverpool, the levee at New Orleans or"
wandered along South Street in New York. Not a word of that can you coax
from him. Even in proffering his wares he does so with the fewest
"possible words, and an air of lofty indifference. Uncas of the"
Leather-Stocking Tales was no more silent and self-possessed a red-skin
than he.

A CHOCO INDIAN IN FULL COSTUME
His cuffs are silver; his head adorned with flowers]
"""Hurt, old man?"" asked Terence."
"""Not a bit,"" replied Waynsford coolly. ""They clipped a couple of"
"stays just as I was getting out of range. But we did the trick, by"
"Jove! Blew the railway station to Jericho."""
"""Hurry up,"" interposed Terence. ""She's going."""
The young airman methodically gathered together several important
"instruments, and giving a final look round at the aircraft that had"
"served him so faithfully, stepped into the waiting ""Carley."""
Before the men had pulled five yards the wrecked machine gave a lurch
and capsized completely. Supported by trapped air in the partially
"intact float the seaplane sank slowly, and with hardly a ripple"
disappeared from view.
With the least possible delay rescuers and rescued were taken on
"board the cruiser. Gathering way the ""Sunderland"" steamed in a"
westerly direction in order to baffle the range of the shore
"batteries, using her after guns with terrific speed."
Somewhat unceremoniously leaving his friend Terence hastened towards
the bridge. Just as he was abreast of the wreckage of the shattered
"funnel a deafening detonation, that completely surpassed the roar of"
"the cruiser's guns, seemed to burst over his head. Staggering under"
the blast of the explosion and temporarily blinded by the pungent
"smoke, the lieutenant groped his way until his progress was checked"
by a jagged mass of plating rendered almost red-hot by the impact of
a huge shell.
"Recoiling, he stood stock still for quite thirty seconds, his senses"
"of the purpose you have in view concerning him, he would not feel so"
"much flattered as you seem to imagine, but rather insulted! Excuse my"
"frankness,--you have spoken plainly,--I must speak plainly too."
Provision dealers and sensational story writers may find that it serves
"their purpose to be interviewed, if only as a means of gaining extra"
"advertisement, but a truly great and conscientious author like Theos"
"Alwyn is quite above all that sort of thing."""
The lady raised her pale eyebrows with an expression of interrogative
scorn.
"""ABOVE all that sort of thing!"" she echoed incredulously--""Dear me! How"
very extraordinary! I have always found all our celebrities so
exceedingly pleased to be given a little additional notoriety! ... and
"I should have thought a POET,"" this with much depreciative"
"emphasis--""would have been particularly glad of the chance! Because, of"
"course you know that unless a very astonishing success is made, as in"
"the case of Mr. Alwyn's 'Nourhalma,' people really take such slight"
"interest in writers of verse, that it is hardly ever worth while"
"interviewing them!"""
"""Precisely!"" agreed Villiers ironically,--""The private history of a"
"prize-fighter would naturally be much more thrilling!"" He paused,--his"
"temper was fast rising, but, quickly reflecting that, after all, the"
indignation he felt was not so much against his visitor as against the
"system she represented, he resumed quietly, ""May I ask you, madam,"
"whether you have ever 'interviewed' Her Majesty the Queen?"""
Her glance swept slightingly over him.
"""Certainly not! Such a thing would be impossible!"""
"aroused within me a deep sympathy, which had, within an hour, developed"
into that great and tender love of old.  With men this return to the old
"love is of no infrequent occurrence, but with women it seldom happens."
Perhaps this is because man is more fickle and more easily influenced by
"woman's voice, woman's glances, and woman's tears."
The reader will probably accuse me of injustice and of fickleness of
"heart.  Well, I cannot deny it; indeed, I seek to deny nothing in this"
"narrative of strange facts and diplomatic wiles, but would only ask of"
those who read to withhold their verdict until they have ascertained the
"truth yet to be revealed, and have read to the conclusion, this strange"
chapter of the secret history of a nation.
"My friend the doctor was holding one hand, while I imprinted a last kiss"
"upon the other.  A lump was in my throat, my eyes were filled with"
"tears, my thoughts were all of the past, my anguish of heart"
"unspeakable.  That small chill hand with the cold, glittering ring--one"
that I had given her in Brussels long ago--seemed to be the only reality
in all that hideous phantasmagoria of events.
"""Do not despair,"" murmured the kind voice of my old friend, standing"
"opposite me on the other side of the bed.  ""You loved her once, but it"
"is all over--surely it is!"""
"""No, Dick!""  I answered brokenly.  ""I thought I did not love her.  I"
"have held her from me these three years--until now."""
"""Ah!"" he sighed, ""I understand.  Man always longs for the unattainable."""
"""Yes, always,"" I responded."
In that moment the memory of the day when we had parted arose gaunt and
"The description did fit Gates like an old glove, yet his most dominant"
characteristic was an unfailing loyalty to our family and an honest
"bluntness, both of which had become as generally recognized as his skill"
"in handling the _Whim_--""the smartest schooner yacht,"" he would have"
"told you on a two-minute acquaintanceship, ""that ever tasted salt."""
"""We might open the cottage for a few days, Gates,"" I said, as we were"
getting into the motor.
"""Bless you, sir,"" he replied, caressing a weather-beaten chin with thumb"
"and finger, ""the _Whim_'s been tugging at her cable mighty fretful this"
"parst fortnight! The crew hoped you'd be coming aboard at once, sir."
"Fact is, we're wanting to be told how you and Mr. Thomas, here, licked"
"those Germans."""
"""Angels of the Marne protect me,"" Tommy groaned. ""Gates, I wouldn't"
"resurrect those scraps for the Kaiser's scalp!"""
"""Yes, he will,"" I promised, smiling at the old fellow's look of"
"disappointment. ""He'll probably talk you to death, though; that's the"
"only trouble."""
"""I'll tell you what,"" Tommy said, ""we'll chuck the cottage idea and go"
"aboard; then tonight, Gates, you pipe the crew--if that's the nautical"
"term--whereupon I'll hold a two-hour inquest over our deceased war, on"
condition that we bury the subject forever more. We came down here to
"lose the last eighteen months of our lives, Gates, not keep 'em green."
"Maybe you don't know it, but we're after the big adventure!"""
"His eyes twinkled as he said this, and his face was lighted by a rare"
smile that no one possessed more engagingly than Tommy. While he treated
"struck the water almost under the cruiser's bows, and a waft of"
"evil-smelling gas drifted across the navigation bridge, causing"
officers and men to cough and gasp for breath.
"The captain tried to give an order, but was unable to utter a sound."
Mutely he signed for the helm to be put hard over.
Terence understood. Literally groping his way through the thick
"vapour, that even in the darkness showed an unmistakable greenish"
"hue, he found the quartermaster, who was clutching his throat and"
struggling for breath.
Pushing the man aside Aubyn rapidly revolved the steam steering-gear.
"Obediently the cruiser swung round, narrowly escaping a high"
"explosive missile that, had she maintained her course, would have"
played havoc with her fo'c'sle.
"All around the ""Sunderland"" the destroyers were dodging hither and"
thither in order to attempt to avoid the hail of bombs that rained
from the sky. It was little short of a miracle that collisions did
"not take place, for owing to the darkness, the suffocating fumes from"
"the missiles, and to the fact that most of the helmsmen were"
"temporarily blinded and choked, all attempt at formation was out of"
the question.
From the after-bridge of the cruiser a searchlight flashed skywards.
For a few seconds even its powerful rays failed to penetrate the pall
"of smoke, till an eddying gust freed the ""Sunderland"" from the"
noxious fumes.
Then the source of the mysterious missiles was revealed. At a height
of over two thousand feet were a couple of Zeppelins. Taking
Sheldon at the time—and there was a fair on the common.
"“Now, Ellen,” she said, “I want you to take the two young ladies for a"
ride on the donkeys.” Off we went; solemn little loves they were; each
had a hand. But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go on.
So we stood and watched instead. Beautiful those donkeys were! They
were the first I’d seen out of a cart—for pleasure as you might say.
"They were a lovely silver-grey, with little red saddles and blue"
bridles and bells jing-a-jingling on their ears. And quite big
"girls—older than me, even—were riding them, ever so gay. Not at all"
"common, I don’t mean, madam, just enjoying themselves. And I don’t know"
"what it was, but the way the little feet went, and the eyes—so"
gentle—and the soft ears—made me want to go on a donkey more than
anything in the world!
"... Of course, I couldn’t. I had my young ladies. And what would I have"
looked like perched up there in my uniform? But all the rest of the day
it was donkeys—donkeys on the brain with me. I felt I should have burst
if I didn’t tell some one; and who was there to tell? But when I went
"to bed—I was sleeping in Mrs. James’s bedroom, our cook that was, at"
"the time—as soon as the lights was out, there they were, my donkeys,"
"jingling along, with their neat little feet and sad eyes.... Well,"
"madam, would you believe it, I waited for a long time and pretended to"
"be asleep, and then suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I"
"could, “_I do want to go on a donkey. I do want a donkey-ride!_” You"
"see, I had to say it, and I thought they wouldn’t laugh at me if they"
knew I was only dreaming. Artful—wasn’t it? Just what a silly child
would think....
"... No, madam, never now. Of course, I did think of it at one time. But"
it wasn’t to be. He had a little flower-shop just down the road and
across from where we was living. Funny—wasn’t it? And me such a one for
"the present Premier of Italy, who says:"
"""The church appears better than it once was. I no longer see in Rome"
"what I used often to see in my young days, ladies driving about its"
streets with their coachmen and footmen in the liveries of their
respective cardinals. Has this improvement come about because the
church is really growing better? Nothing of the kind. It is because the
"strong arm of the law checks the villainy of the priests."" That is the"
testimony of the Prime Minister of Italy.
*       *       *       *       *
[Sidenote: Do American Roman Catholics Believe in the Relics?]
"A few weeks after my return from Italy, while driving one afternoon"
"with a friend of mine, a lawyer of high intelligence and wide"
"information, our conversation turned to the subject of the recent death"
"of Pope Leo XIII., and from that drifted to the alleged liquefaction"
"of the blood of St. Januarius, and from that to relics in general. I"
mentioned some of the facts above stated concerning the numerous pieces
of the true cross and the miracle-working bones and oils to be seen in
"Roman Catholic churches in Europe. ""But,"" he said, ""surely the Roman"
"Catholics in America do not believe in such mediæval superstitions."""
"I happened to have in hand a couple of copies of a daily newspaper,"
"published in one of our Southern towns, dated August 9, 1903, and"
"August 17, 1903, respectively, containing extracts from the letters of"
"a Roman Catholic bishop, the highest dignitary of his church in that"
"State; and, for answer to my friend's remark, I cited the following"
"passage from the bishop's letter of July 10th, written from Munich,"
concerning the abbey church of Scheyern:
"""The chapel of the Holy Cross is specially sacred, as within is"
any serious commiseration.
"When he did come to death-grapple with the absolute, the beasts above"
"mentioned, he stood out a tragic young figure, fiercely alone in the"
"arena, save for Herold."
"His name, uncommon and arresting, had one connotation in London--the"
"Case, the appalling and abominable Case. Even Ferguson of the “Daily"
"Herald,” who had evinced such sympathy for him at first, shrank from the"
name at the head of the weekly column and suggested the temporary use of
"a pseudonym. Had it not been for Herold's intervention, Risca would have"
told Ferguson to go to the devil and would have refused to work for his
"Philistine paper. He swallowed the insult, which did him no good. He"
refused to carry the accursed name into the haunts of men.
"“Come to the club, at any rate,” Herold urged. “Every man there is loyal"
to you.”
“And every man as he looks at me will have on his retina not a picture
"of me, but a picture of what went on in that house in Smith Street.”"
"“Oh, go and buy a serviceable epidermis,” cried Herold. Argument was"
useless.
So Risca worked like a mole at anonymous journalism in his shabby
lodgings where Lilias and Niphetos were suggested only by a mangy tabby
"who occasionally prowled into his sitting-room, and Arachne presided,"
"indeed, but in the cobwebs about the ceiling in the guise which she had"
been compelled to take by the angry god when the world was young. Only
"when his attendance at the office of the weekly review was necessary,"
"such as on the day when it went to press, did he mingle with the busy"
world.
"He gave way to much emotion. Vivie, though still dazed with the"
"reverberating horror of Edith Cavell's execution, tried to regain"
her mind balance and thank him for the kindness he had shown them.
But it was now necessary to see her mother who might also be
undergoing a shock. As she walked up to their bedroom she reflected
that the departure of von Giesselin would have to be followed by
their own exile to some other lodging. They would share in his
disgrace.
The next morning in fact the Belgian manager of the hotel with many
regrets gave them a month's warning. The hotel would be required for
some undefined need of the German Government and he had been told no
one could be lodged there who was not furnished with a permit from
the Kommandantur.
For three weeks Vivie sought in vain for rooms. Every suitable place
was either full or else for reasons not given they were refused. She
"was reduced to eating humble pie, to writing once more to Gräfin von"
Stachelberg and imparting the dilemma in which they were placed. Did
this kind lady know where a lodging could be obtained? She herself
"could put up with any discomfort, but her mother was ill. If she"
"could help them, Vivie would humbly beg her pardon for her angry"
letter of three weeks ago and resume her hospital work. Minna von
Stachelberg made haste to reply that there were some things better
not discussed in writing: if Vivie could come and see her at six one
"evening, when she had a slight remission from work--"
"Vivie went. Out of hearing, Gräfin von Stachelberg--who, however, to"
"facilitate intercourse, begged Vivie to call her ""Minna,""--""We may"
"all be dead, my dear, before long of blood-poisoning, bombs from"
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. The heavy near-shore formations of the
Silurian in the Appalachian region thin out toward the west. The
"Medina and the Clinton sandstones are not found west of Ohio,"
where the first passes into a shale and the second into a
"limestone. The Niagara limestone, however, spreads from the Hudson"
"River to beyond the Mississippi, a distance of more than a"
thousand miles. During the Silurian period the Mississippi valley
"region was covered with a quiet, shallow, limestone-making sea,"
which received little waste from the low lands which bordered it.
The probable distribution of land and sea in eastern North America
and western Europe is shown in Figure 287. The fauna of the
interior region and of eastern Canada are closely allied with that
"of western Europe, and several species are identical. We can"
hardly account for this except by a shallow-water connection
between the two ancient epicontinental seas. It was perhaps along
the coastal shelves of a northern land connecting America and
Europe by way of Greenland and Iceland that the migration took
"place, so that the same species came to live in Iowa and in"
Sweden.
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. So little is found of the rocks of the
system west of the Missouri River that it is quite probable that
the western part of the United States had for the most part
emerged from the sea at the close of the Ordovician and remained
land during the Silurian. At the same time the western land was
perhaps connected with the eastern land of Appalachia across
Arkansas and Mississippi; for toward the south the Silurian
sediments indicate an approach to shore.
LIFE OF THE SILURIAN
"coquetry showing through her grave demeanour, ""a secret mission from the"
Mother Superior of the Convent of the Holy Innocents. Do not attempt to
penetrate the secret. I assure you it will be quite useless. And pray do
"not suppose that only you can adventure forth on perilous quests!"""
"""I assure you,"" began Rollo, eagerly, ""that I suppose no such thing. At"
the moment when you came up I was wishing with all my heart that the
responsibility of the present undertaking had been laid on any other
"shoulders than mine!"""
"Yet in spite of his modesty, certain it is that from that moment Rollo"
rode no longer with his head hanging down like a willow blown by the
wind. The reins lay no more lax and abandoned on his horse's neck. On
"the contrary, he sat erect and looked abroad with the air of a"
"commander, and his hand rested oftener on the hilt of Killiecrankie,"
with the air of pride which Concha privately thought most becoming.
"""And in what case left you my wife and babe?"" suddenly demanded El"
"Sarria, riding up, and inquiring somewhat imperiously of the new"
recruit concerning the matter which touched him most nearly.
"""The Señora Dolóres is safe with the good sisters, and as in former"
"times I was known to have been her companion, it was judged safest that"
I should not longer be seen in the neighbourhood. Likewise I was charged
with the tidings that Luis Fernandez with a company of Cristino
"Migueletes has been seen riding southward to cut you off from Madrid,"
"whither it is supposed you are bound!"""
Rollo turned quickly upon her with some anger in his eye.
"""Why did you not tell me that at first?"" he said."

GUAYMI INDIAN MAN
Note the tattoed marking of face and the negroid lips]
The Choco Indians are one of the smaller and least known tribes of the
Darien. Prof. Pittier--who may without disrespect be described as the
most seasoned “tropical tramp” of all Central America--described them so
vividly that extracts from his article in the National Geographic
Magazine will be of interest:
"“Never, in our twenty-five years of tropical experience, have we met"
"with such a sun-loving, bright and trusting people, living nearest to"
nature and ignoring the most elementary wiles of so-called civilization.
They are several hundred in number and their dwellings are scattered
"along the meandrous Sambu and its main reaches, always at short"
"distance, but never near enough to each other to form real villages."
"Like their houses, their small plantations are close to the river, but"
mostly far enough to escape the eye of the casual passer-by.
“Dugouts drawn up on the beach and a narrow trail breaking the reed wall
"at the edge of the bank are the only visible signs of human presence,"
"except at the morning hours and near sunset, when a crowd of women and"
"children will be seen playing in the water, and the men, armed with"
"their bows and long harpooned arrows, scrutinizing the deeper places for"
also against other powers active in the Orient.
MONROE DOCTRINE OF THE PAST
'America's relation to this problem is more difficult. Monroeism is
thought to stand in the way. I appreciate the delicacy of venturing to
"discuss the policy of a nation other than my own, but I feel that"
Americans are too sensible to resent an honest expression of opinion.
"Monroeism is not part of the constitution, but the dictum of a"
"statesman. This dictum was made when our planet was very large, before"
the development of steam and electricity. The nations were isolated and
insulated by distance and non-communication.
'At that time American theory and practice relative to foreign affairs
"were in harmony. America was actually self-contained, but to-day the"
world is a tiny ball and America's flag and America's interests are on
"every sea. America is sovereign in Hawaii and the Philippines, and yet"
the American people cling to the idea of leaving distant matters alone.
Nevertheless the state department is widely and intelligently active.
AMERICAN INTEREST WORLD-WIDE
"'Theoretically you do not participate, actually your participation bears"
upon international events everywhere. Witness Secretary Hay's initiative
"respecting the Jews, as well as despatch after despatch aimed at Russian"
aggression in Manchuria. The world's interests are becoming woven into a
solid fabric. Great nations cannot escape the responsibility this
"involves. American theory and practice, in my judgment, will go on"
diverging until the notion of non-participation will be merely an
antiquated abstraction.
"there was one new thing, essentially Stella, which he had not noticed"
before. Surely it had been put there since his last visit.
In her own bedroom had hung since her imprisonment a fine reproduction
"of Watt's “Hope,” and, child though she was, she had divined, in a"
"child's unformulative way, the simple yet poignant symbolism of the"
"blindfold figure seated on this orb of land and sea, with meek head"
"bowed over a broken lyre, and with ear strained to the vibration of"
"the one remaining string. She loved the picture, and with unconscious"
"intuition and without consultation with Wratislaw, who would have"
"been horrified at its domination of his Adam room, had ordained that a"
similar copy should be hung on the wall facing the pillow of her Great
High Belovedest's bed.
The application of the allegory to his present state of being was
startlingly obvious. Risca knitted a puzzled brow. The new thing was
"essentially Stella, yet why had she caused it to be put in his room this"
day of all disastrous days? Was it not rather his cousin Julia's doing?
But such delicate conveyance of sympathy was scarcely Julia's way.
A sudden dread stabbed him. Had Stella herself heard rumours of the
"tragedy? He summoned Herold, who had a prescriptive right to the"
adjoining room.
"“If any senseless fools have told her, I 'll murder them,” he cried."
“The creatures of the sunset told her--at least as much as it was good
"for her to know,” said Herold."
“Do you mean that she did it in pure ignorance?”
"“In the vulgar acceptance of the word, yes,” smiled Herold. “Do you"
think that the human brain is always aware of the working of the divine
"on the one side, and accuracy on the other. The true Fairy Tale should"
be unhampered by any compromise of probability even--the scientific
representation should be sufficiently marvellous along its own lines to
need no supernatural aid. Both appeal to the imagination in different
ways.
"As an exception to this kind of mixture, I should quote “The Honey Bee,"
"and Other Stories,” translated from the Danish of Evald by C. G. Moore"
Smith. There is a certain robustness in these stories dealing with the
"inexorable laws of Nature, though some of them will appear hard to the"
child; but they will be of interest to all teachers.
Perhaps the worst element in choice of stories is that which insists
upon the moral detaching itself and explaining the story. In “Alice in
"Wonderland” the Duchess says, “‘And the moral of _that_ is: Take care"
of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.’ ‘How fond
"she is of finding morals in things,’ thought Alice to herself.” (This"
gives the point of view of the child.)
"The following is a case in point, found in a rare old print in the"
British Museum:
“Jane S. came home with her clothes soiled and hands badly torn. ‘Where
"have you been?’ asked her mother. ‘I fell down the bank near the mill,’"
"said Jane, ‘and I should have been drowned if Mr. M. had not seen me"
and pulled me out.’ 'Why did you go so near the edge of the brink?‘
"'There was a pretty flower there that I wanted, and I only meant to"
"take one step, but I slipped and fell down.’ Moral: Young people often"
"take but one step in sinful indulgence (Poor Jane!), but they fall"
into soul-destroying sins. There is a sinful pleasure which they wish
to enjoy. They can do it by a single act of sin (the heinous act of
"picking a flower!). They do it; but that act leads to another, and they"
has left me or been dismissed--probably dismissed. When a British
"subject, of decent education and once respectable surroundings, gets"
"into the hands of German agents, you may be certain of one thing,"
"Dawson, that he has become a rotter through drink."""
"""That's it,"" cried Dawson. ""You have hit it. Crime and drink are twin"
brothers as no one knows better than the police. Look out for the name
and address of a man dismissed for drunkenness and we shall have our
"bird."""
"""The name I can no doubt give you, but not the address."""
"""Give us any address where he lived, even if it were ten years ago,"
and we will track him down in three days. That is just routine police
"work."""
"""I never presume to teach an expert his business--and you, Dawson, are"
"a super-expert, a director-general of those of common qualities--but"
"would it not be well to warn all the Post Offices, so that when"
another parcel is brought in addressed to the lieutenant the bearer
"may be arrested?"""
"Dawson sniffed. ""Police work; common police work. It was done at once"
for this city and fifty miles round. No parcel was put in last week.
The warning has since been extended to the whole of the United
"Kingdom. We may get our man this week, or at least a messenger of his,"
"but no news has yet come to me. I will lunch with you, as you so"
"kindly suggest, and afterwards I want you to come with me to see the"
draughtsman in the lockup. You may be able to shake his confounded
obstinacy. Run the pathetic stunt. Say if he keeps silent that you
"will be arrested, your home broken up, your family driven into the"

mantelpiece as if with purpose of personal assault. At such seasons the
stout old Abigail instantly remitted her attentions and stood perfectly
"well trained and motionless, with the brush and comb in her hand, till"
it pleased her lady to sit down again.
"All the while the gentleman said no word, but watched the development of"
"the scene with the utmost composure, passing his beautiful white fingers"
through his whiskers and moustache after the fashion of a comb. The
"lady's anger waxed higher and higher, and with it her voice also rose in"
an equal ratio. What the end would have been it is difficult to
"prophesy, for the Sergeant, realising that time was passing quickly,"
produced an instrument with a broad flat blade bent at an acute angle to
"the handle, and inserting it sharply into the crack of the French"
"window, opened it with a click which must have been distinctly audible"
"within, even in the height of the lady's argument."
CHAPTER XXXI
THE QUEEN'S ANTE-CHAMBER
Out of the darkness Rollo and the Sergeant stepped quickly into the
"room. Whereupon, small wonder that the lady should scream and fall back"
"into her chair, the waiting-maid drop upon the floor as if she had been"
"struck by a Carlist bullet, or the gentleman with the long and glossy"
whiskers suspend his caresses and gaze upon the pair with dropped jaw
and open mouth!
At his entrance Rollo had taken off his hat with a low bow. The Sergeant
CHAPTER XVI
THE CAMBRIAN
"THE PALEOZOIC ERA. The second volume of the geological record,"
"called the Paleozoic (Greek, PALAIOS, ancient; ZOE, life), has"
come down to us far less mutilated and defaced than has the first
"volume, which contains the traces of the most ancient life of the"
globe. Fossils are far more abundant in the Paleozoic than in the
"earlier strata, while the sediments in which they were entombed"
"have suffered far less from metamorphism and other causes, and"
"have been less widely buried from view, than the strata of the"
pre-Cambrian groups. By means of their fossils we can correlate
the formations of widely separated regions from the beginning of
"the Paleozoic on, and can therefore trace some outline of the"
history of the continents.
"Paleozoic time, although shorter than the pre-Cambrian as measured"
"by the thickness of the strata, must still be reckoned in millions"
of years. During this vast reach of time the changes in organisms
were very great. It is according to the successive stages in the
advance of life that the Paleozoic formations are arranged in five
"systems,--the CAMBRIAN, the ORDOVICIAN, the SILURIAN, the"
"DEVONIAN, and the CARBONIFEROUS. On the same basis the first three"
"systems are grouped together as the older Paleozoic, because they"
alike are characterized by the dominance of the invertebrates;
"while the last two systems are united in the later Paleozoic, and"
*       *       *       *       *
The train was running over the malarial-looking sea-plain--past the
"down-at-heel palm trees, past the mosque-looking buildings. At a level"
crossing the woman crossing-keeper darted out vigorously with her red
flag. And we rambled into the first village. It was built of sun-dried
"brick-adobe houses, thick adobe garden-walls, with tile ridges to keep"
off the rain. In the enclosures were dark orange trees. But the
"clay-coloured villages, clay-dry, looked foreign: the next thing to mere"
"earth they seem, like fox-holes or coyote colonies."
"Looking back, one sees Cagliari bluff on her rock, rather fine, with the"
thin edge of the sea's blade curving round. It is rather hard to believe
"in the real sea, on this sort of clay-pale plain."
*       *       *       *       *
But soon we begin to climb to the hills. And soon the cultivation begins
"to be intermittent. Extraordinary how the heathy, moor-like hills come"
near the sea: extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces
"of Sardinia are. It is wild, with heath and arbutus scrub and a sort of"
"myrtle, breast-high. Sometimes one sees a few head of cattle. And then"
"again come the greyish arable-patches, where the corn is grown. It is"
"like Cornwall, like the Land's End region. Here and there, in the"
"distance, are peasants working on the lonely landscape. Sometimes it is"
"one man alone in the distance, showing so vividly in his black-and-white"
"costume, small and far-off like a solitary magpie, and curiously"
distinct. All the strange magic of Sardinia is in this sight. Among the
"low, moor-like hills, away in a hollow of the wide landscape one"
"solitary figure, small but vivid black-and-white, working alone, as if"
"eternally. There are patches and hollows of grey arable land, good for"
corn. Sardinia was once a great granary.
5 Chemung     . . . . . . sandstones and sandy shales
4 Hamilton    . . . . . . shales and sandstones
3 Corniferous . . . . . . limestones
2 Oriskany    . . . . . . sandstones
1 Helderberg  . . . . . . limestones
The Helderberg is a transition epoch referred by some geologists
to the Silurian. The thin sandstones of the Oriskany mark an epoch
when waves worked over the deposits of former coastal plains. The
limestones of the Corniferous testify to a warm and clear wide sea
which extended from the Hudson to beyond the Mississippi. Corals
"throve luxuriantly, and their remains, with those of mollusks and"
"other lime-secreting animals, built up great beds of limestone."
"The bordering continents, as during the later Silurian, must now"
have been monotonous lowlands which sent down little of even the
finest waste to the sea.
In the Hamilton the clear seas of the previous epoch became
clouded with mud. The immense deposits of coarse sandstones and
"sandy shales of the Chemung, which are found off what was at the"
"time the west coast of Appalachia, prove an uplift of that ancient"
continent.
The Chemung series extends from the Catskill Mountains to
"northeastern Ohio and south to northeastern Tennessee, covering an"
area of not less than a hundred thousand square miles. In eastern
New York it attains three thousand feet in thickness; in
Pennsylvania it reaches the enormous thickness of two miles; but
it rapidly thins to the west. Everywhere the Chemung is made of
"thin beds of rapidly alternating coarse and fine sands and clays,"
"with an occasional pebble layer, and hence is a shallow-water"
deposit. The fine material has not been thoroughly winnowed from
ACIDUM CARBOLICUM CRUDUM--CRUDE CARBOLIC ACID
DERIVATION.--A liquid consisting of several different constituents of
"coal tar, particularly creosol and phenol, obtained by fractional"
distillation.
"PROPERTIES.--A nearly colorless, or reddish-brown liquid of a strong"
"disagreeable and creosote-like odor, and gradually turning darker on"
exposure to the air and light. Soluble in fifteen parts of water.
PHENOL--ACIDUM CARBOLICUM--CARBOLIC ACID
DERIVATION.--Obtained from crude carbolic acid by agitation with caustic
"soda, heating to 338° F., and adding hydrochloric acid. Then by"
"agitation with sodium chloride, digestion with calcium chloride, and"
distillation at a temperature between 336° F. and 374° F. and finally by
crystallization.
PROPERTIES.--Phenol in its pure state is a solid at ordinary
"temperatures, crystallizing in minute plates or long rhomboidal needles,"
"white or colorless, of a peculiar odor recalling that of creosote, and"
an acrid burning taste. It is likely to be colored pinkish or brown
under the influence of light and air. Soluble in about 19.6 parts of
"water, and very soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, glycerin, fixed"
"""That's the end o' that--that's the end o' that,"" she wound up, slamming"
the door after him. But all the way from the threshold to the bureau she
"kept murmuring to herself: ""I don't care, I don't care . . . I'll be"
like the rest o' the women I've seen. I'll give that Nina Micheltoreña
"cards an' spades. There'll be another hussy around here. There'll be--"""
"The threat was never finished. Instead, with eyes that fairly started"
"out of their sockets, she listened to the sound of a couple of shots,"
the last one exploding so loud and distinct that there was no mistaking
its nearness to the cabin.
"""They've got 'im!"" she cried. ""Well, I don't care--I don't--"" But again"
she did not finish what she intended to say. For at the sound of a heavy
"body falling against the cabin door she flew to it, opened it and,"
"throwing her arms about the sorely-wounded man, dragged him into the"
cabin and placed him in a chair. Quick as lightning she was back at the
door bolting it.
With his eyes Johnson followed her action.
"""Don't lock that door--I'm going out again--out there. Don't bar that"
"door,"" he commanded feebly, struggling to his feet and attempting to"
walk towards it; but he lurched forward and would have fallen to the
"floor had she not caught him. Vainly he strove to break away from her,"
"all the time crying out: ""Don't you see, don't you see, Girl--open the"
"door."" And then again with almost a sob: ""Do you think me a man to hide"
"behind a woman?"" He would have collapsed except for the strong arms that"
held him.
"""I love you an' I'm goin' to save you,"" the Girl murmured while"
"struggling with him. ""You asked me to go away with you; I will when you"
"git out o' this. If you can't save your own soul--"" She stopped and"
quickly went over to the mantel where she took down a bottle of whisky
who are neither priests nor in orders.
"The Abbé spoke poor English, therefore the conversation was carried on in"
"French, much to the annoyance of some of our guests, who pretended to a"
greater knowledge of that language than they possessed.
"Soon after my presentation to the Abbé, the king arrived, and we all went"
"out to the supper table, where the Abbé's chair was on the king's right,"
with De Grammont on his Majesty's left. After the king had been seated a
"moment, he rose and asked us to be seated; so we took our places, all"
save the king dropping our hats beside us on the floor because of his
Majesty's presence.
"I sat next to De Grammont, almost opposite the Abbé, and had a good"
opportunity to observe the French emissary. The king's French was
"excellent, and the dinner conversation was carried on largely between him"
"and the Abbé. All subjects were discussed, but the Abbé adroitly avoided"
Dunkirk and seemed to prefer talking on religious and philosophical
"topics, in which he took the liberty to disagree with the king in many"
"respects, politely though positively."
"I listened attentively, hoping that some tone of the Abbé's voice, a pose"
"or a gesture, might reveal George Hamilton, if it were he, in the most"
"excellent disguise I had ever seen. But nothing of the sort occurred, and"
"before the dinner was over, I was still more convinced that whoever the"
"Abbé du Boise might be, he was not Hamilton."
"After dinner came the heavy wines, of which the Abbé did not partake, and"
"of which De Grammont and I drank sparingly. All the others, including the"
"king, were gloriously drunk long before the night was over."
"While smoking our pipes, the king, who was eager to get his hands"
"[Footnote 109: 'The wish to be able to fly,' he declares (_Eine"
"Kindheitserinnerung des Leonardo da Vinci_, p. 59), 'signifies in dreaming"

wish of early childhood.']

[Footnote 111: I retain this statement of my explanation in almost the
same words as first written down in 1895. I was not then aware that
several psychologists had offered very similar explanations. Scherner
"(_Das Leben des Traumes_, 1861) seems to have been the first to connect"
"the lungs with dreams of flying, though he put forward the explanation"
"in too fanciful a form and failed to realise that other factors, notably"
"a change in skin pressure, are also involved. Strümpell at a later date"
"recognised this explanation, as well as Wundt.]"

the contractions become violent and accelerated. The palpitations are
as strong as would be experienced at the close of some violent bodily
"exertion.' It is significant, also, as bearing on the interpretation of"
"the dream of flying, that under chloroform 'all movements made appeared to"
And on Mrs. James Williams’s face was recorded a little library of the
world’s best thoughts in three volumes. Volume No. 1 contained the
belief that James Williams was about the right sort of thing. Volume
"No. 2 was an essay on the world, declaring it to be a very excellent"
place. Volume No. 3 disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest
seat in a Rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all
understanding.
"James Williams, you would have guessed, was about twenty-four. It will"
gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate. He was exactly
"twenty-three years, eleven months and twenty-nine days old. He was well"
"built, active, strong-jawed, good-natured and rising. He was on his"
wedding trip.
"Dear kind fairy, please cut out those orders for money and 40 H. P."
touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of
"the boat club. Instead of any of them turn backward—oh, turn backward"
and give us just a teeny-weeny bit of our wedding trip over again. Just
"an hour, dear fairy, so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees"
"looked, and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin—even"
if it was the hatpins that did the work. Can’t do it? Very well; hurry
"up with that touring car and the oil stock, then."
Just in front of Mrs. James Williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket
and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses. Only in dreams and
"milliners’ shops do we, alas! gather grapes and roses at one swipe."
"This girl gazed with large blue eyes, credulous, when the megaphone man"

be concerned. Between blasts she resorted to Epictetian philosophy in

other by the appearance of amphibians and reptiles.
"Each of these systems is world-wide in its distribution, and may"
be recognized on any continent by its own peculiar fauna. The
names first given them in Great Britain have therefore come into
"general use, while their subdivisions, which often cannot be"
"correlated in different countries and different regions, are"
usually given local names.
The first three systems were named from the fact that their strata
are well displayed in Wales. The Cambrian carries the Roman name
"of Wales, and the Ordovician and Silurian the names of tribes of"
ancient Britons which inhabited the same country. The Devonian is
"named from the English county Devon, where its rocks were early"
studied. The Carboniferous was so called from the large amount of
coal which it was found to contain in Great Britain and
continental Europe.
THE CAMBRIAN
DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Cambrian rocks outcrop in narrow belts
about the pre-Cambrian areas of eastern Canada and the Lake
"Superior region, the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. Strips"
of Cambrian formations occupy troughs in the pre-Cambrian rocks of
New England and the maritime provinces of Canada; a long belt
borders on the west the crystalline rocks of the Blue Ridge; and
on the opposite side of the continent the Cambrian reappears in
the mountains of the Great Basin and the Canadian Rockies. In the
Mississippi valley it is exposed in small districts where uplift
has permitted the stripping off of younger rocks. Although the
"areas of outcrop are small, we may infer that Cambrian rocks were"
"exactly how much--or, rather, how little money Slyne had had in his"
"pockets when he went ashore. And, if Slyne had already, within four and"
"twenty hours, been able to turn that over at a profit sufficient to"
"provide himself with a fur coat and diamonds, it might perhaps pay"
"Captain Dove to hear what he had to propose. Slyne, reading all the old"
"man's thoughts, could see that he had decided to temporise."
"""But, I can do with a damn sight less of _your_ back-chat!"" rumbled"
"Captain Dove, not to be put down without protest. ""If you've come back"
"on board to offer me a founder's share in any new gold-brick factory,"
"fire straight ahead--and be short about it. It'll save time, too, if"
you'll take it from me again that I'd rather have your room than your
"company."""
"And at that, Slyne made his next considered move."
"""All right,"" he said in a tone of the most utter contempt. ""That's"
enough. I'm off.
"""I came back to do you a good turn--although few men, in my position,"
"would ever have looked near you again,"" he paused in the doorway to"
"remark acridly. ""But I can see now what's the matter with you--and I"
only wish I had noticed it in time to save myself all it has cost me.
It's senile decay you're suffering from. You're far too old to be of any
"more use--even to yourself. You're in your dotage, and you'll soon be in"
"an asylum--for pauper lunatics!"""
He had evidently lost his own temper at last. And Captain Dove was
visibly pleased with that result of his tactics; as a rule he was better
"able to cope with Slyne on a basis of mutual abuse, heated on both"
sides; Slyne cool and collected had him at a disadvantage.

"The pirates sailed down the West Coast of India from Goa to Cochin, and"
returned to Mauritius. Thence sailing to the Island of Mascarine they
"found a big Portuguese ship, which they took. In her they discovered the"
"Conde de Eviceira, Viceroy of Goa, and, even better, four million dollars"
worth of diamonds.
"Taylor, now sailing in the _Cassandra_, heard that there were four"
"men-of-war on his tracks, so he sailed to Delagoa Bay and spent the"
winter of the year 1722 there. It was now decided that as they had a huge
"amount of plunder they had better give up piracy, so they sailed away to"
the West Indies and surrendered themselves to the Governor of Porto Bello.
"The crew broke up and each man, with a bag of diamonds, went whither he"
"would; but Captain Taylor joined the Spanish service, and was put in"
"command of a man-of-war, which was sent to attack the English logwood"
cutters in the Bay of Honduras.

One of Captain Phillips's crew. Wounded in the leg while attempting to
"desert. There being no surgeon on board, a consultation was held over the"

agreeing that the leg should be amputated. Some dispute then arose as to
"who should act the part of surgeon, and at length the carpenter was chosen"
"as the most proper person. ""Upon which he fetch'd up the biggest saw, and"
"taking the limb under his Arm, fell to Work, and separated it from the"
Body of the Patient in as little Time as he could have cut a Deal Board in

David is really the center of this territory. It is a typical Central
"American town of about 15,000 people, with a plaza, a cathedral, a hotel"
and all the appurtenances of metropolitan life in Panama. The place is
"attractive in its way, with its streets of white-walled, red-tiled"
"dwellings, with blue or green doors and shutters. It seems to have grown"
"with some steadiness, for though the Panama census for 1912 gave it"
"15,000 inhabitants, travelers like Mr. Forbes Lindsay and Albert"
"Edwards, who visited it only a year or two earlier, gave it only from"
"5000 to 8000 people. Its growth, however, is natural and healthy, for"
the country round it is developing rapidly. You reach David now by boats
of the Pacific Mail and the National Navigation Company from Panama. The
"quickest trip takes thirty hours. When the government railroad is built,"
"about which there is some slight doubt, the whole country will be opened"
and should be quickly settled. The road in all probability will be
continued to Bocas del Toro on the Atlantic coast.

BREADFRUIT TREE]
"While the cattle business of the Chiriqui region is its chief mainstay,"
it is far from being developed to its natural extent. The Commissary
officials of the Canal organization tried to interest cattle growers to
"the extent of raising enough beef for the need of the Canal workers, but"
failed. Practically all of the meat thus used is furnished by the
so-called “Beef Trust” of the United States. It is believed that there
"are not more than 50,000 head of cattle all told in Panama. I was told"
on the Isthmus that agents of a large Chicago firm had traveled through
been thrown together at random. Then he nodded sagely twice and passed
on his way.
The glen continued to narrow overhead. The sunshine was entirely shut
out. The jaws of the precipice closed in upon the wayfarer as if to
"crush him, but Sergeant Cardono advanced with the steady stride of a"
"mountaineer, and the aplomb of one who is entirely sure of his"
reception.
The mountain silence grew stiller all about. None had passed that way
(so it seemed) since the beginning of time. None would repass till time
should be no more.
"Suddenly through the utter quiet there rang out, repeated and"
"reduplicated, the loud report of a rifle. The hills gave back the"
challenge. A moment before the dingy bedrabbled snow at Cardono's feet
"had been puffed upwards in a white jet, yet he neither stopped for this"
"nor took the least notice. Loyal or disloyal, true or false, he was a"
brave man this Sergeant Cardono. I dare say that any one close to him
might have discerned his beady eyes glitter and glance quickly from side
"to side, but his countenance was turned steadfastly as ever upon the"
snow at his feet.
Again came the same startling challenge out of the vague emptiness of
"space, the bullet apparently bursting like a bomb among the snow. And"
again Cardono took as much notice as if some half-dozen of village
loungers had been playing ball among the trees.
Only when a third time the _whisk_ of the bullet in the snow a yard or
"two to the right preceded the sound of the shot, Cardono shook his head"
"and muttered, ""Too long range! The fools ought to be better taught than"
"that!"" Then he continued his tramp steadily, neither looking to the"
CHAPTER IX
HALF-LIGHT
"Once before she had placed herself in his path, trusting to her skill,"
"her daring, above all, her beauty. With laughter in her heart and"
cold-blooded coquetry she had chosen out the spot before the altar
where the sunlight struck burnished gold from her waving hair and lent
"deeper, softening shades to her eyes. With cruel satisfaction, not"
"unmixed with admiration, she had seen her power successful and the"
awe-struck wonder and veneration creep into his face. In the silence
and peace of the temple she had plunged reckless hands into the woven
"threads of his life. Amidst the shriek of war, face to face with"
"death, she sought to save him. It was another woman who stood opposite"
"the yielding, cracking door, past whose head a half-spent bullet spat"
"its way, burying itself in the wall behind her,--another woman,"
"disheveled, forgetful of her wan beauty, trusting to no power but that"
which her heart gave her to face the man she had betrayed and ruined.
Yet both in an instantaneous flash remembered that first meeting. The
"drawn sword sank, point downward. He stood motionless in the shattered"
"doorway, holding out a hand which commanded, and obtained, a"
"petrified, waiting silence from the armed horde whose faces glared"
hatred and the lust of slaughter in the narrow space behind. Whatever
"had been his resolution, whatever the detestation and contempt which"
"had filled him, all sank now into an ocean of reborn pain."
"""Why are you here?"" he asked sternly. ""Why have you not fled?"""
"sun shone no more, and the merriment was stilled for ever. So she"
"thought, and, if she were not right, it needed a philosopher to tell her"
"so; and then she would not have believed him, but caught her woe closer"
"to her heart, and nursed it with fiercer tenderness against his shallow"
"prating. Perhaps he might have told her too, that it is cruel kindness"
"unasked to set people on a pinnacle, and, when they cannot keep foothold"
"on that slippery height, to scorn their fall. Other things such an one"
"might well have said, but more wisely left unsaid; for cool reason is a"
"blister to heartache, and heartache is not best cured by blisters. Never"
yet did a child stop crying for being told its pain was nought and would
soon be gone. Yet this prescription had been Lady Eynesford's--although
"she was no philosopher, to her knowledge--for Alicia, and it had left"
"the patient protesting that she felt no pain at all, and yet feeling it"
all the more.
"""What do you accuse me of? Why do you speak to me?"" she had burst out."
"""What is it to me what he has done or not done? What do you mean, Mary?"""
Before this torrent of questions Lady Eynesford tactfully retreated a
little way. A warning against hasty love dwindled to an appeal whether
"so much friendliness, such constant meetings, either with daughter or"
"with father, were desirable."
"""I'm sure I'm sorry for the poor child,"" she said; ""but in this"
"world----"""
"""Suppose it's all a slander!"""
"""My dear Alicia, do they say such things about a man in his position"
"unless there's something in them?"""
"""It's nothing to me,"" said Alicia again."

"They next cruised in the West Indies, taking several English and Dutch"
"ships, the crews of which they treated with the greatest brutality."

"ventured to return to Prince Edward Island to visit his wife and family,"
where no one dared to molest him.
"By this time Nelson had been a pirate for three years and had, by his"
"industry, won for himself a fortune worth £150,000, but his Scotch"
"partner, Morrison, being a frugal soul, had in the meantime saved an even"
larger sum. Eventually their ship was wrecked in a fog on a small barren
"island near Prince Edward Island, and Morrison and most of the crew were"
"drowned, but Nelson and a few others were saved. At last he reached New"
"York, where he lived the rest of his life in peaceful happiness with his"
wife and family.

"""That is surprising, seeing that you have made me what I am,"" he"
"answered. Then he made a quick gesture of apology. ""Forgive me, that"
sounded like a reproach or a complaint. I make neither. That is not my
"purpose."""
"""And yet you have the right,"" she said, drawing a deep breath, ""you"
"have every right, Nehal. It does not matter what the others did to"
you. I know that does not count an atom in comparison to my
"responsibilities. You trusted me as you trusted no one else, and I"
deceived you. So you have the right to hate me as you hate no one
"else. And yet--is it not something, does it not mitigate my fault a"
"little, that I deceived myself far, far more than I ever deceived"
"you?"" He raised his eyebrows. There was mockery in the movement, and"
"she went on, desperately resolute: ""I played at loving you, Nehal. I"
played a comedy with you for my own purposes. And one day it ceased to
be a comedy. I did not know it. I did not know what was driving me to
"tell the truth, and reveal myself to you in the ugliest light I could."
I only knew it was something in me stronger than any other impulse of
"my life. I know what it is now, and you must know, too. Can't you"
"understand? If it had been no more than a comedy, you must have found"
me out--months ago. But you never found me out. It was _I_ who told
"you what I had done and who I was--"""
"""Why did you tell me?"" He took an involuntary step toward her."
Something in his face relaxed beneath the force of an uncontrollable
emotion. He was asking a question which had hammered at the gates of
"his mind day after day and in every waking hour. ""Why?"" he repeated."
"""I have told you--because I had to. I had to speak the truth. I"
couldn't build up my new life on an old lie. You had to know. I had
soon found it; but there I came to a check. Round the churchyard stood
"a number of quiet family houses, many-gabled and shaded by limes, and"
doubtless once occupied by reverend canons and prebendaries. But no
"one of these held such a position that it could shoulder Herr Krapp's,"
or be by any possibility the house I wanted. The churchyard lay too
far from the street for that.
I walked up the row twice before I would admit this; but at last I
"made it certain. Still Herr Krapp must know his own premises, and not"
"much cast down, I was going to knock at a chance door and put the"
"question, when my eyes fell on a man who sat at work in the"
"churchyard. He wore a mason's apron, and was busily deepening the"
inscription on a tablet let into the church wall. He seemed to be the
"very man to know, and I went to him."
"'I want a house which looks into the Neu Strasse,' I said. 'It is the"
next house to Herr Krapp's. Can you direct me to the door?'
"He looked at me for a moment, his hammer suspended. Then he pointed to"
"the farther end of the row. 'There is an alley,' he said in a hoarse,"
croaking voice. 'The door is at the end.'
"I thought his occupation an odd one, considering the state of the"
"city; but I had other things to dwell on, and hastened off to the"
"place he indicated. Here, sure enough, I found the mouth of a very"
"narrow passage which, starting between the last house and a blind"
"wall, ran in the required direction. It was a queer place, scarcely"
"wider than my shoulders, and with two turns so sharp that I remember"
wondering how they brought their dead out. In one part it wound under
"the timbers of a house; it was dark and somewhat foul, and altogether"
so ill-favoured a path that I was glad I had brought my arms.

the inhabitants of the town of San Ildefonso.
"Then in her turn La Giralda told of her visit to the pavilion, of the"
"little Queen, passionate, joyous, kindly natured, absolutely Spanish,"
till the hearts of her hearers melted to the tale.
"""Our orders are to capture her and her mother the Regent,"" said Rollo,"
"thoughtfully. ""It would therefore serve our purpose but ill if we"
permitted these two to be sacrificed to the bloodthirsty fury of a mob
"of plunderers!"""
"""Then the sooner we find ourselves within the gates, the more chance we"
"shall have of saving them both!"" said the Sergeant. ""Serve out the"
"_puchero_, La Giralda!"""
Concha had taken no part in the discussion. But she had listened with
"all her ears, and now in the pause that followed she declared her"
unalterable intention of making one of the party.
"""I also am of Andalucia,"" she said with calm determination, ""there are"
two others of my country here who will answer for me. You cannot leave
"me alone, and La Giralda will be needed as guide when once you reach the"
"palace precincts. I shall not be in the way, I promise you, and if it"
"comes to gun and pistol, there I think you will not find me wanting!"""
"In his heart and though he made several objections, Rollo was glad"
enough to give way. For with all the unknown dangers of the night before
"them, and the certainty of bloodshed when the gipsies should attack, he"
relished still less the thought of leaving Concha alone in that pit on
the chill side of Guadarrama.

Now where's the damned on-board AI module?
He scanned the bay. The AI system was the key to his plan. He had to
make certain the computer's artificial intelligence functions could be
"completely shut down, disengaged, when the crucial moment came. He"
couldn't afford for the on-board system-override to abort his planned
revision in the hypersonic flight plan. His job tonight was to make
"sure all the surprises were his, not somebody else's. There wouldn't be"
any margin for screw-ups. Everything had to go like clockwork.
"He edged his way on through the freezing bay, searching the banks of"
"equipment for a clue, and then he saw what he was looking for. There,"
"along the portside bulkhead. It was a white, rectangular console, and"
everything about it told him immediately it was what he wanted.
"He studied it a second, trying to decide where to begin."
At that moment he also caught himself wondering fleetingly how he'd
ever gotten into this crazy situation. Maybe he should have quit the
Air Force years ago and gone to engineering school like his father had
"wanted. Right now, he had to admit, a little electrical engineering"
would definitely come in handy.
He took out a pocket screwdriver and began carefully removing the AI
"console's faceplate, a bronzed rectangle. Eight screws later, he lifted"
it off and settled it on the floor.
The penlight revealed a line of chips connected by neat sections of
plastic-coated wires. Somewhere in this electronic ganglia there had to

"hesitate, and approached the loud-voiced old man, holding out their palms"
"and clamoring: ""Money!"" But that did not suit the old man, who entered the"
"car forthwith, urging his companions to hurry. The driver, no doubt"
"thinking of his own tips, felt he would serve his passengers best by"
"driving off with them at once. So off he went. A toot of the horn, and a"
rapid fanfare--tara-ra-boom-de-ay!

"Foreign lands--ah, no, this country will not bear comparison with them!"

"one, the one with the skirts and the northern lights?"""
"But some of the homeward-turning bumpkins, such as the Olaus family, had"
more serious matters on their minds. Olaus for the first time understood
"what he had read in the paper so many times, that the Norwegian elementary"
school is a worthless institution because it does not teach English to the
"children of the lower orders. Here were his boys, losing a handsome tip"
merely because they could not swear back intelligibly at the gentleman
with the northern lights. The boys themselves had also something to think
"about: ""That driver, that scoundrel, that southerner! But just wait!"" They"
had heard that bits of broken bottle were very good for tires....

"I return to her knapsack and her clothes, and the reason why I do so is"
that Eilert is so little to be trusted. I want to count her clothes to
make sure none of them disappear; it was a mistake not to have done so at
once.
It may seem as though I kept returning to these clothes and thinking about
them; but why should I do that? At any rate it is now evident that I was
Both Zeppelins began to throw out ballast with frantic haste. They
"also released the whole of their remaining supply of bombs, which"
fell with a rapid series of deafening detonations more than half a
mile from the nearest destroyer.
With the release of the ballast the undamaged Zeppelin shot skywards
until her altitude was not less than ten thousand feet. Comparatively
"safe for the time being from the effect of the anti-aircraft shells,"
"she floated, a mere speck in the concentrated yet diminished glare of"
"a dozen searchlights, and awaited events."
"Meanwhile, the damaged Zeppelin had checked her plunge, and, in spite"
"of a hot fire, was slowly rising. By dint of strenuous efforts her"
crew succeeded in shifting aft the travelling weight that served to
trim the unwieldy craft. Even then her longitudinal axis was sharply
inclined to the horizontal.
"Everything that could be jettisoned was thrown overboard. Guns,"
"ammunition, stores, and the metal framework of the wrecked car were"
"sacrificed, till without being hit by the British guns, she rose to a"
terrific height.
"""We've lost her!"" exclaimed Oswestry savagely."
"""One thing, she won't trouble us again,"" added the commander. ""And"
I'm not so certain that she will get clear. We've wirelessed the
"seaplanes, and they'll have a chip in. Hullo! What's the game now?"""
A searchlight flashed from the undamaged Zeppelin and played in
ever-widening circles until it picked up her damaged consort. The
latter was consequently more plainly discernible to the crew of the
"earnest when he preaches on Truth, and he is in just as dead earnest"
"when, stripped of every moral scruple, he pursues a spy or a criminal."
"In pursuit he is ruthless as a Prussian, but towards the captured"
victim he can be strangely tender. I should not be surprised to learn
that he hates capital punishment and is a strong advocate of gentle
"methods in prison discipline."""
"The chief assistant stared, opened a drawer, and pulled forth a slim"
"grey pamphlet. It was marked ""For Office Use Only,"" and was entitled,"
"""Some Notes on Prison Reform,"" by Chief Inspector William Dawson."
"I had begun to read the pamphlet, when a step sounded outside; the"
"assistant snatched it from my hand, flashed it back into its place,"
and jumped to attention as Dawson entered. He surveyed us with those
"searching, unwinking eyes of his--for we had the air of"
"conspirators--and said brusquely: ""Clear out, Wilson. You talk too"
"much. And don't admit any one except Petty Officer Trehayne."""
"""The _Antigone_!"" cried Cary, who thought only of ships. ""The"
"_Antigone_! Is she much damaged?"""
"""No. Whoever tried to cut her wires was disturbed, or in too great a"
"hurry to do his work well. The main gun-cable was nipped, but not cut"
"through. She will be delayed till to-morrow, not longer. I am not"
"worrying about the _Antigone_, but about the new battleship"
"_Malplaquet_, which was commissioned last month, is nearly filled up"
"with stores, and is expected to leave the river on Saturday. We can't"
"have her delayed by any hanky tricks, not even if we have to put the"
"whole detective force on board of her. Still, I'm not so anxious as I"
"was. This _Antigone_ business has cleared things up a lot, and one can"
"sift out the impossible from the possible. To begin with, the"
"_Antinous_ was in for repairs to her geared turbines, and the"
"inadvertently upon the last occasion it was used, exploded. The man’s"
"arm had been wrenched off, and he was burned terribly. It was a stroke"
of luck that the liner hove in sight at the moment she did. There was
"no chance of extending succour to the injured man on the spot, and he"
would have died before a doctor could have been summoned by boat from
"Ballycastle, nine miles away. The surgeon bound up the man’s injuries,"
"lowered him into his boat, and, on regaining the liner, placed him"
"in the hospital, where he was tended until the vessel’s arrival in"
"Liverpool, where he was landed and placed in hospital."

More remarkable was the accident which happened at the Flannen Islands
light-station in 1900; it remains an unsolved mystery to this day. This
"is one of Scotland’s lonely lights, mounting guard over a group of"
islets fifteen miles off the Hebrides. On December 26 the relief-tender
"approached the station on her usual fortnightly visit, but, to the"
"amazement of those on board, no signs of the keepers or the usual"
"signals were to be seen, while the lantern was not dressed in its"
"daylight garb. The crew landed hurriedly, wondering what was amiss."
They found the lighthouse absolutely deserted; not a sign of any of the
"three keepers was to be seen or heard. They examined the log, and found"
"that the light had not been burning for some days, the last entry being"
"made about 4 a.m. nearly a week previously. The rock was searched, but"
yielded no clue to the mystery of the complete disappearance of the
"Instantly a voice answered, ""I am Idu of the Chagai Levies, friendly"
"to the British Government."""
"I then called out who I was, and, immediately, three fully armed men"
came forward in the darkness.
"I asked them what they were doing there, and the voice that had"
answered me before replied that they were all three members of the
"Chagai Levies, and that they, and about fifty others, had come out to"
fight me.
"""To fight me?"" I exclaimed. ""Whatever for?"""
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned the man who had said his name was Idu, ""we"
"thought you were a German airship."" And he went on to explain that"
for a long time he and his companions had been watching powerful
"lights floating about in the sky, and as they knew that Germans were"
"the only people in the world who had _hawaiijihaz_ or airships, they"
were convinced the lights they had seen belonged to one of these. And
"when it had alighted on the hill in front of them, the majority of"
"his companions had been so terrified that they had run away, and only"
himself and his two comrades had had the bravery to stay where they
were and face the unknown danger.
Then it dawned on me what he was driving at. The flashing electric
"lights of the car, lighting up the distant, rising slopes of the"
"desert, had appeared to these men to come from the sky, and my"
"harmless motor-car the dreaded German airship. Cars, of course, along"
"this route were as great a novelty as airships, and doubtless not one"
of the men in front of me had ever seen one before.
"I reassured them as completely as I could, adding that I was"
"plucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and"
"shivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,"
"although his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with"
"the living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet"
infinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape
the scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.

The grizzled general--there was also one who was gray--was thinking
that this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and
usually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his
ire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent
"than himself. And always orders of the ""Tell me how to kill that man"""
"rather than the ""Kill that man"" sort. The distinction bothered him"
obscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls
"which made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's"
right-minded leaders--even the Thinkers weren't certain which.
"The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a"
"more turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and"
the dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.
He asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation
be in metal rather than flesh?
The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such
pains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success
"with Buddhism. Sitting before his _guru_, his teacher, feeling the"
"Occidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had"
felt a little like this.
"The burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,"
"83,664. (Mr. Chaubal). He did not know whether the salaries he had"
"mentioned as having been paid in Japan, New Zealand and Yale were on an"
incremental scale or not.
"83,665. There was a difference of kind between the way in which"
students were taught in schools and the way in which they were taught in
colleges. He did not agree with the witnesses who had said that during
the first year or two years at college the instruction given was similar
to that given in a school. It was very difficult to disprove or to prove
such statements. There would be no advantage in keeping boys to a school
course up the intermediate standard and making the colleges deal with
only those students who had passed the intermediate examination.
"83,666. (Sir Theodore Morison). There should be one scale of pay for all"
"persons in the higher educational department. The rate of salary, Rs."
"200 rising to Rs. 1,500 per month, was suitable, subject to the proviso"
"that the man of great distinction, instead of beginning at the lowest"
"rate of pay, should start some where in the middle of the list, say, at"
Rs. 400 or Rs. 500. He would make no reference in regard to Europeans or
Indians in that respect. In effect this no doubt amounted to making
Indians eligible for higher educational posts both by direct recruitment
and by promotion.
"83,667. He would not favour the handing over of all the Government"
institutions in Bengal to private agencies; there must be one or two
Government colleges in order to keep up the standard. He should be
sorry to see the Government dissociating itself from one of its primary
"duties, which was education."
"83,668. Privately managed Colleges paid less in salary than the"
Government Colleges. They paid about the same as was given in the

"In this connection, it is a good plan occasionally during the story"
"hour to introduce really good poetry which, delivered in a dramatic"
"manner (far removed, of course, from the melodramatic), might give"
children their first love of beautiful form in verse. And I do not
think it necessary to wait for this. Even the normal child of seven
(though there is nothing arbitrary in the suggestion of this age) will
appreciate the effect--if only on the ear--of beautiful lines well
"spoken. Mahomet has said, in his teaching advice: “Teach your children"
"poetry: it opens the mind, lends grace to wisdom and makes heroic"
virtues hereditary.”
"To begin with the youngest children of all, here is a poem which"

"When the cows come home, the milk is coming,"

"Duck, Drake on the rushy lake,"
"And the deer live safe in the breezy brake,"
"And timid, funny, pert little bunny"
"Winks his nose, and sits all sunny."
_Christina Rossetti._
"Now, in comparing this poem with some of the doggerel verse offered"
"to small children, one is struck with the literary superiority in the"
"choice of words. Here, in spite of the simplicity of the poem, there"
"is not the ordinary limited vocabulary, nor the forced rhyme, nor the"
"application of a moral, by which the artist falls from grace."
"standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park, and spoke into the"
transmitter:
“Tell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my
ideals. He knows what they have been and what they still are. So far as
"they touch on this case, absolute loyalty and truth are the ones"
paramount. Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well as one
"can, and I know its weakness as well as I do its needs. That is why I"
"decline to hear his pleas, whatever they may be. I did not condemn him"
"through hearsay or doubtful evidence, and that is why I made no charge."
"But, since he persists in hearing what he already well knows, you may"
convey the matter.
"“Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear,"
to cut a rose for my mother. Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton
"beneath the pink oleander. The tableau was pretty, but the pose and"
juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation. I
"left the conservatory, and, at the same time, the rose and my ideal."
You may carry that song and dance to your impresario.”
"“I’m shy on one word, lady. Jux—jux—put me wise on dat, will yer?”"

rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal.”
The gravel spun from beneath the boy’s feet. He stood by the other
"bench. The man’s eyes interrogated him, hungrily. The boy’s were"
shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator.

And it seemed to her as though she knew all the people who were there;
"they were the women of the village, and the girls of her own age. But"
the dog was well aware that there was something uncanny about it all.
"He made his way down to Melbustad in flying leaps, and howled and barked"
"in the most lamentable manner, and gave the people no rest until they"
"followed him. The young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun,"
"and climbed the hills; and when he drew near, there stood a number of"
"horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He crept up to the hut,"
"looked through a loop-hole in the wall, and saw a whole company sitting"
"together inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls, the people"
"from underground, and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof. At"
"that moment the doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn, one"
"larger than the other, came shooting out about his legs. When he went"
"in, there sat the maiden in her bridal finery, and nothing was missing"
"but the ring on her little finger, then all would have been complete."
"""In heaven's name, what has happened here?"" he asked, as he looked"
"around. All the silverware was still on the table, but all the tasty"

"Here, then, is a group of kindred peoples apparently at least as capable"
"of reaching a solution of the social problem as any other, and visibly"
prospering materially and morally in proportion as they bring reason to
"bear on the vital lines of conduct, though still in the stage of curing"
over-population by emigration. Given continued peaceful political
"evolution in the direction first of democratic federation, and further"
"of socialisation of wealth, they may reach and keep the front rank in"
"civilisation, while the more unmanageably large communities face risks"
of dire vicissitude.

"Several of the men could not conceal a grin. One broke into a laugh,"
and meeting the stern glance of the commander tried to side-track
into a painful cough.
Fortunately for the culprit the commander was inwardly affected by a
"similar complaint, for he, too, saw the humour of the business."
"""Confound you!"" shouted the staff-paymaster, removing his cap and"
"rubbing his bald head. ""Confound you, you brute! Throwing away the"
"money from the public chest!"""
"The only reply from Mephisto was another penny that, thrown with"
"and groan, while they are, for the most part, forgetful of anything"
"else life may have to offer."""
"""But what IS life without plenty of money?"" inquired the Duchess"
"carelessly--""Surely, not worth the trouble of living!"""
"Alwyn looked at her steadily, and a swift flush colored her smooth"
"cheek. She toyed with the magnificent diamond spray at her breast, and"
wondered what strange spell was in this man's brilliant gray-black
eyes!--did he guess that she--even she--had sold herself to the Duc de
la Santoisie for the sake of his money and title as easily and
unresistingly as though she were a mere purchasable animal?
"""That is an argument I would rather not enter into,"" he said"
"gently--""It would lead us too far. But I am convinced, that whether"
"dire poverty or great riches be our portion, life, considered apart"
"from its worldly appendages, is always worth living, if lived WELL."""
"""Pray, how can you separate life from its worldly"
"appendages?""--inquired a satirical-looking gentleman opposite--""Life IS"
"the world, and the things of the world; when we lose sight of the"
"world, we lose ourselves,--in short, we die,--and the world is at an"
"end, and we with it. That's plain practical philosophy."""
"""Possibly it may be called philosophy""--returned Alwyn--""It is not"
"Christianity."""
"""Oh, Christianity!""--and the gentleman gave a portentous sniff of"
"contempt--""That is a system of faith that is rapidly dying out; fast"
"falling into contempt!--In fact, with the scientific and cultured"
"classes, it is already an exploded doctrine."""
"for about ten minutes, then suddenly dump it back into its cradle, stare"
"at it gloomily or utter a laugh, and go out.  Sometimes, he would come up"
"when Gyp was there, and after watching her a little in silence, almost"
drag her away.
"Suffering always from the guilty consciousness of having no love for him,"
"and ever more and more from her sense that, instead of saving him she"
"was, as it were, pushing him down-hill--ironical nemesis for vanity!--Gyp"
"was ever more and more compliant to his whims, trying to make up.  But"
"this compliance, when all the time she felt further and further away, was"
straining her to breaking-point.  Hers was a nature that goes on
passively enduring till something snaps; after that--no more.
"Those months of spring and summer were like a long spell of drought, when"
"moisture gathers far away, coming nearer, nearer, till, at last, the"
deluge bursts and sweeps the garden.
XV
The tenth of July that year was as the first day of summer.  There had
"been much fine weather, but always easterly or northerly; now, after a"
"broken, rainy fortnight, the sun had come in full summer warmth with a"
"gentle breeze, drifting here and there scent of the opening lime blossom."
"In the garden, under the trees at the far end, Betty sewed at a garment,"
and the baby in her perambulator had her seventh morning sleep.  Gyp
stood before a bed of pansies and sweet peas.  How monkeyish the pansies'
"faces!  The sweet peas, too, were like tiny bright birds fastened to"
"green perches swaying with the wind.  And their little green tridents,"
"growing out from the queer, flat stems, resembled the antennae of"
was thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists
"weren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd"
"always felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,"
rather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill
"of the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty"
sort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better--more
"disciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,"
which helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.
*       *       *       *       *
"The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was"
"also glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though"
he trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.
"Still, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even"
the Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!
Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal
"features, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the"
tape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had
"handed him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for"
"next year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet"
"minds--profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising"
"simplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were"
alike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical
"shorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines."
The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice
nervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly
put it away. No one spoke.
"Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. ""Section Five, Question"
"into balls at the approach of danger. It is in this attitude,"
"taken at the approach of death, that trilobites are often found in"
the Ordovician and later rocks. The gigantic crustaceans called
the EURYPTERIDS were also present in this period.
The arthropods had now seized upon the land. Centipedes and
"insects of a low type, the earliest known land animals, have been"
discovered in strata of this system.
BRYOZOANS. No fossils are more common in the limestones of the
time than the small branching stems and lacelike mats of the
"bryozoans,--the skeletons of colonies of a minute animal allied in"
structure to the brachiopod.
"BRACHIOPODS. These multiplied greatly, and in places their shells"
formed thick beds of coquina. They still greatly surpassed the
mollusks in numbers.
CEPHALOPODS. Among the mollusks we must note the evolution of the
cephalopods. The primitive straight Orthoceras has now become
abundant. But in addition to this ancestral type there appears a
"succession of forms more and more curved and closely coiled, as"
"illustrated in Figure 285. The nautilus, which began its course in"
"this period, crawls on the bottom of our present seas."
VERTEBRATES. The most important record of the Ordovician is that
"of the appearance of a new and higher type, with possibilities of"
development lying hidden in its structure that the mollusk and the
insect could never hope to reach. Scales and plates of minute
"fishes found in the Ordovician rocks near Canon City, Colorado,"
show that the humblest of the vertebrates had already made its
appearance. But it is probable that vertebrates had been on the
"There were a lot of untouched spaces--a horde, a myriad. On the side"
"wall was a chart, showing that nine squadrons of twenty-five spacecraft"
"each were patrolling back and forth through the uncharted wastes,"
seeking the space-wrecked lifeships.
The maddening part was the hourly report from both lifeships. It was
"like someone hiding in the dark and calling for aid, invisible and"
"alone. And not really calling for aid, but only making whimpering"
noises. For the signaling equipment on the lifeships was not equipped
"with the complicated infrawave phone, but only with the simple"
"signal-emitter, coded to transmit the identification call of the unit."
"On the hour they came in, calling three times, ""Lifeship Seventy-nine,"
"Seventy-nine, Number Three."" Number Two had not been heard from."
"Presumably it was not in use, or hadn't made the grade."
Wilson chewed his fingernails and fretted. Was Alice on Number One or
"Number Three, or was she on Number Two and it had foundered?"
"If she were still alive, what kind of fellow survivors were with her?"
He hoped she was with a group. If she had blown out in a lifeship with
"only one other--well, Ted Wilson did not like the idea. Of course, it"
was more customary than not for a young woman to love lightly before
she mated permanently. There was a lot less chance of wading into
matrimony wide-eyed and ignorant of what it was all about.
"But Wilson, if willing to face such transient loving at all, would"
"have preferred that Alice have her chance to pick and choose, rather"
than have the matter thrust upon her in the middle of a threatening
situation. The passion that comes with the shadow of death is only the
"instinct of racial preservation, and it mates men and women unsuited to"
Northern companies are finding some profit in exploiting such natural
resources of Panama as are available in their wild state. Of these the
"most promising is rubber, the tree being found in practically every part"
"of the country. One concern, the Boston-Panama Company, has an estate"
"approximating 400 square miles on which are about 100,000 wild rubber"
"trees, and which is being further developed by the planting of bananas,"
"pineapples, cocoanuts and other tropical fruits."

"Coffee, sugar and cacao are raised on the Isthmus, but of the two former"
not enough to supply the local demand. The development of the cacao
"industry to large proportions seems probable, as several foreign"
corporations are experimenting on a considerable scale. Cocoanuts are
easily grown along both coasts of the Isthmus. A new grove takes about
"five years to come into bearing, costing an average of about three"
dollars a tree. Once established the trees bring in a revenue of about
"one dollar each at present prices and, as the demand for Panama"
"cocoanuts is steady, the industry seems to offer attractive"
"possibilities. The groves must be near the coast, as the cocoanut tree"
needs salt air to reach its best estate. Given the right atmospheric
conditions they will thrive where no other plant will take root. Growing
"at the edge of the sea, water transportation is easy."

"object to her in the days long ago."""
"""Ah!""  I laughed, ""you certainly had no cause.  It is true that we have"
been good friends ever since the day when she arrived home from the
"convent-school at Bruges, a prim young miss with her hair tied up with"

confidant and intimate friend; hence my licence to give her counsel in
many matters and sometimes to criticise those actions of which I don't

"I don't entertain one single spark of love for her.  In brief, she has"
"developed into an essentially smart girl, in the true sense of the word,"
and by reason of our constant companionship knows that to attempt a
flirtation with me would result in a most dismal failure.  I accused her
"once, not long ago, of having designs upon my heart, whereupon she"
replied that to accomplish such a thing would be about as easy as to win

An Ideal Family
"That evening for the first time in his life, as he pressed through the"
"swing door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement, old Mr."
"Neave felt he was too old for the spring. Spring—warm, eager,"
"restless—was there, waiting for him in the golden light, ready in front"
"of everybody to run up, to blow in his white beard, to drag sweetly on"
"his arm. And he couldn’t meet her, no; he couldn’t square up once more"
"and stride off, jaunty as a young man. He was tired and, although the"
"late sun was still shining, curiously cold, with a numbed feeling all"
"over. Quite suddenly he hadn’t the energy, he hadn’t the heart to stand"
this gaiety and bright movement any longer; it confused him. He wanted
"to stand still, to wave it away with his stick, to say, “Be off with"
you!” Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual—tipping his
"wide-awake with his stick—all the people whom he knew, the friends,"
"acquaintances, shopkeepers, postmen, drivers. But the gay glance that"
"went with the gesture, the kindly twinkle that seemed to say, “I’m a"
match and more for any of you”—that old Mr. Neave could not manage at
"all. He stumped along, lifting his knees high as if he were walking"
through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water. And the
"homeward-looking crowd hurried by, the trams clanked, the light carts"
"clattered, the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless,"
defiant indifference that one knows only in dreams....
It had been a day like other days at the office. Nothing special had
happened. Harold hadn’t come back from lunch until close on four. Where
had he been? What had he been up to? He wasn’t going to let his father
"know. Old Mr. Neave had happened to be in the vestibule, saying"
the tincture of aconite with other colic mixture; in congestion of the
"bowels or liver, or in congestion of any part, small repeated doses are"
better than large ones. It is also advantageously used in lung
disorders.
AETHER--ETHER--PURE ETHER
"A liquid composed of about 96 per cent, by weight, of absolute ether or"
"ethyl oxide, and about 4 per cent of alcohol containing a little water."
DERIVATION.--Prepared by distillation of alcohol with sulphuric acid.
There are two steps in the production of ether; sulphorvinic acid and
water are formed in the first step. Sulphorvinic acid is then further
acted upon by alcohol. The distillate is freed from water by agitation
with calcium oxide and chloride and subjected to redistillation.
"PROPERTIES.--A transparent, colorless, mobile liquid, having a"
characteristic odor and a burning and sweetish taste. Ether is highly
"volatile and inflammable; its vapor, when mixed with air and ignited,"
"explodes violently. Miscible in all proportions with alcohol,"
"chloroform, benzine, benzol, fixed and volatile oils. Ether is a solvent"
"for fats, oils, alkaloids, resins, gutta percha and guncotton. Upon"
evaporation ether should have no residue. Ether vapor is heavier than
air and consequently etherization should never be done above a light or
fire.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 ozs.; sheep and pigs, 2 to 4 drs.;"
"dogs, 10 ms. to 1 dr."
"however, when he was asleep, an incident happened that warned the Girl"
that it was necessary to get her lover away just as soon as he was able
to ride a horse.
"Lying on the rug in front of the fire she had been thinking of him when,"
"suddenly, her quick ear, more than ever alert in these days, caught the"
sound of a stealthy footstep outside the cabin. With no fear whatever
"except in relation to the discovery of her lover, the Girl went"
noiselessly to the window and peered out into the darkness. A man was
making signs that he wished to speak with her. For a moment she stood
"watching in perplexity, but almost instantly her instinct told her that"
"one of that race, for she believed the man to be a Mexican, would never"
dare to come to her cabin at that time of night unless it was on a
friendly errand. So putting her face close to the pane to reassure
"herself that she had not been mistaken in regard to his nationality, she"
"then went to the door and held it wide open for the man to enter, at the"
same time putting her finger to her lips as a sign that he should be
very still.
"""What are you doin' here? What do you want?"" she asked in a low voice,"
at the same time leading him to the side of the room further away from
her lover.
"Jose Castro's first words were in Spanish, but immediately perceiving"
"that he failed to make her understand, he nodded comprehendingly, and"
said:
"""All righta--I espeak Engleesh--I am Jose Castro too well known to the"
"_Maestro_. I want to see 'im."""
The Girl's intuition told her that a member of the band stood before
"her, and she regarded him suspiciously. Not that she believed that he"
MARGINS
A feature not to be overlooked in the appearance of a well-printed
book is that of the margins. The perfect type-page is supposed to be
proportioned in such a way that its diagonal is twice its width. With
"this page as a basis, the location of the type upon the paper leaf is"
"to be studied carefully. In general, the two pages, right and left,"
"should be considered as a unit, and the top margin and the inside"
"margin of each page should be approximately the same. Doing this, the"
total blank between the two pages is supposed approximately to equal
the outside and the bottom margins.
"The proportion of margin is, to a certain extent, dependent upon the"
"size of the book, the margins becoming greater as the volume increases"
from the thirty-two mo size up to the folio. A student of typography
"has ingeniously estimated that, taking the height of the paper leaf"
"as 100 units, the height of the type page of the ordinary trade book"
"should be from 72% to 75%; that of a library edition, from 66% to 71%;"
"that of a de luxe volume, from 60% to 65%."
MAKING THE INDEX
"EVERY book of a permanent nature, or intended as a work of reference,"
"requires an index. The length of the Index, or its minuteness, depends"
"upon the nature of the subject treated, and the importance of making it"
easily available to the reader. The Index belongs to the same family
"as the Table of Contents, and the Topical Analyses often placed at the"
than by the Secretary of State alone. Indians were under a great
"difficulty, in that they could not remain indefinitely in England after"
taking their degrees and being away from the place of recruitment their
claims were overlooked.
"83,643. There was no reason why a European should be paid a higher rate"
of salary than an Indian on account of the distance he came. An Indian
felt a sense of inferiority if a difference was made as regards pay. The
very slight saving which government made by differentiating between the
two did not compensate for the feeling of wrong done. This feeling would
"remain even if the pay was the same, but an additional grant in the"
shape of a foreign service allowance was made to Europeans. All workers
"in the field of education should feel a sense of solidarity, because"
"they were all serving one great cause, namely, education."
"83,644. The term ""professor"", as at present used in India, was"
"undoubtedly a comprehensive one, but it was equally comprehensive in the"
West.
"83,645. (Sir Murray Hammick). The witness did not wish to recruit"
definite proportions of the service in England and in India
respectively. He would for various reasons prefer a large number of
Indians engaged in education.
"83,646. Even in Calcutta he would not make any difference between the"
pay of the Indian and the pay of the European.
"83,647. (Sir Valentine Chirol). The witness attached great value to the"
influence of the teacher upon the student in the earlier stages of his
"education, and it was in these stages that that influence could best be"
exercised. At the same time he desired to limit the appointment of
non-Indians to men of very great distinction.
"end reached, he let the paper fall on his knees, lay back, and took a"
"long pull at his cigar. He was shocked--yes, he supposed he was"
"shocked. He had known the man, and it was shocking to think of his"
"throat being cut; yes, he had known him, and he didn't like to think of"
that. But--The Premier gave a long-drawn sigh of relief. That unknown
murderer's hand had done great things for him. His daughter was safe
"now--anyhow, she was safe. She could never be subject to the degradation"
the dead man had once hinted at; and when he thought of what the man had
"threatened, pity for him died out of Medland's heart. More--although"
Kilshaw no doubt knew something--there was a chance that Benham had kept
"his own counsel, and that his employer would be helpless without his"
"aid. Medland's sanguine mind caught eagerly at the chance, and in a"
moment turned it into a hope--almost a conviction. Then the whole thing
"would go down to the grave with the unlucky man, and not even its"
"spectre survive to trouble him. For if no one had certain knowledge, if"
"there were never more than gossip, growing, as time passed, fainter and"
"fainter from having no food to feed on, would not utter silence follow"
"at last, so that the things that had been might be as if they had never"
been?
"""Well, what do they say about us?"" asked the Treasurer."
"""Oh, nothing much,"" he answered, thrusting the paper behind him with a"
careless air. He did not want to discuss what the paper had told him.
"""What's happened to-day,"" said Daisy, ""ought to make all the difference,"
"oughtn't it, father?"""
"""I hope it will,"" replied the Premier; but, for once in his life, he was"
not thinking most about political affairs.
"Francesco climbed from the valley as the day came with splendor, a"
glow of molten gold streaming from the east. Wood and hillside
"glimmered in a smoking mist, dew-bespangled, wonderful. As the sun"
"rose, the sea stretched sudden into the arch of the west, a great"
"expanse of liquid gold. A mysterious lustre hovered over the cliffs,"
waves of light bent like saffron mist upon San Nicandro.
The dawn-light found an echo in Francesco's face. He came that
"morning the ransomer, the champion, defeated in life and hope and"
"happiness, yet with head erect, as if defying Fate. His manhood smote"
"him like the deep-throated cry of a great bell, majestic and solemn."
"The towers on the cliff were haloed with magic hues. Life, glory, joy,"
lay locked in the gray stone walls. His heart sang in him; his eyes
were afire.
As he walked his horse with a hollow thunder of hoof over the narrow
"bridge, he took his horn and blew a blast thereon. There was a sense"
"of desolation, a lifelessness about the place that smote his senses"
with a strange fear. The walls stared void against the sky. There was
"no stir, no sound within, no watchful faces at portal or wicket. Only"
the gulls circled from the cliffs and the sea made its moan along the
strand.
"Francesco sat in the saddle and looked from wall to belfry, from tower"
"to gate. There was something tragic about the place, the silence of a"
"sacked town, the ghostliness of a ship sailing the seas with a dead"
"crew upon her decks. Francesco's glance rested on the open postern, an"
empty gash in the great gate. His face darkened and his eyes lost
their sanguine glow. There was something betwixt death and worse than
death in all this calm.
in his repertory.
"""Oh, come, old chap, I bet he didn't,"" observed Captain Heseltine."
"""We've seen him, you know."""
Duncombe laughed good-humouredly.
"""At any rate he made Kilshaw look a little green, and some of the people"
behind called out 'Shame!' and got themselves sat upon. Then they had
Medland up again and twisted him a bit about his acquaintance with
"Gaspard; but the coroner didn't seem to think there was anything in it,"
"and they found murder against Gaspard, and rang down the curtain. And"
when we got outside there was a bit of a rumpus. They hooted Kilshaw and
"cheered Medland, and yelled like mad when a dashed pretty girl drove up"
"in a pony-cart and carried him off. Altogether it wasn't half bad."""
"""Glad you enjoyed yourself,"" observed Captain Heseltine. ""If it amuses"
strangers to see our leading celebrities mixed up in a murder and other
"distressing affairs, it's the least we can do to see that they get it."""
The Captain's facetiousness fell on unappreciative ears. Most of Mr.
Duncombe's audience were too alive to the serious side of the matter to
enjoy it. To them it was another and a very striking scene in the fight
"which had long gone on between Medland and Kilshaw, and had taken a"
fresh and fiercer impetus from the well-remembered day when Medland had
spoken his words about Kilshaw and his race-horses. Nobody doubted that
"Kilshaw had kept this man Benyon, or Benham, as a secret weapon, and"
that the murder had only made the disclosure come earlier. Kilshaw's
"reputation suffered somewhat in the minds of the scrupulous, but his"
"partisans would hear of no condemnation. They said, as he had said, that"
in dealing with a man like Medland it would have been folly not to use
"the weapons fate, or the foe himself by his own misdeeds, offered. As"
"first flowers seen after winter snows!--welcome, more welcome than"
"swift rescue to one in dire peril!--welcome, my Angel, into the"
"darkness of mortal things, which haply so sweet a Presence shall make"
bright! O sacred innocence that I am not worthy to shield! ... O
sinless beauty that I am all unfitted to claim or possess! Welcome to
"my life, my heart, my soul! Welcome, sweet Trust, sweet Hope, sweet"
"Love, that as Christ lives, I will never wrong, betray, or resign again"
"through all the glory spaces of far Eternity!"""
"As he spoke, his arms closed more surely about her,--his lips met"
"hers,--and in the mingled human and divine rapture of that moment,"
"there came a rushing noise, as of thousands of wings beating the air,"
followed by a mighty wave of music that rolled approachingly and then
"departingly through and through the Cathedral arches--and a Voice,"
"clear and resonant as a silver clarion, proclaimed aloud:"
"""Those whom GOD hath joined together, let no MAN put asunder!"""
"Then, with a surging, jubilant sound, like the sea in a storm, the"
"music seemed to tread past in a measured march of stately harmony,--and"
"presently there was silence once more,--the silence and sunshine of the"
morning pouring through the rose windows of the church and sparkling on
"the Cross above the Altar,--the silence of a love made perfect,--of"
twin souls made ONE!
And then Edris drew herself gently from her lover's embrace and raised
"her head,--putting her hand confidingly in his, a lovely smile played"
on her sweetly parted lips:
"""Take me, Theos,"" she said softly, ""Lead me,--into the World!"""

"devious to the Canon’s intellect, failed entirely to appeal to Yvonne."
She referred them entirely to his personal inclinations. On the other
"hand, the Canon had a false insight into her soul that was a chilling"
disillusion.
The beauty of her exquisite purity and innocence had always captivated
in him the finer man. It was a mirage. It was gone. Emptiness remained.
"She was simply a graceful, non-moral being--a spiritual anomaly."
"Yvonne shivered, and rising, walked unsteadily to the wardrobe, whence"
"she took a dressing-jacket. Putting it on, she returned to the couch. It"
"was almost dark. The Canon watched her dim, slight figure as it passed"
"him, with a strange feeling of remoteness. A hundred trivial instances"
of her want of moral sense crowded into his mind to support his
"view--her inability to see the wrong-doing of Stephen, her indefinite"
"notions in religious matters, her mental attitude toward the girl that"
"had gone astray, of whom she had been talking only the night before, her"
former showing his delight in a rare display of white teeth and a flow
"of unintelligible English. Even the sledge-dogs, now fat from idleness,"
"greeted their mistress with a fierce clamor that dismayed Alton Clyde,"
to whom all was utterly new and strange.
"""Glory be!"" he exclaimed. ""They're nothing but wolves. Won't they bite?"
"And the house--ain't it a hit! Why, it looks like a stage setting! Oh,"
"say, I'm for this! I'm getting rough and primitive and brutal already!"""
"When they passed from the store, with its shelves sadly naked now, to"
"the cozy living quarters behind, his enthusiasm knew no bounds. Leaving"
"Chakawana and her mistress to chatter and clack in their patois, he"
"inspected the premises inside and out, peering into all sorts of"
"corners, collecting souvenirs, and making friends with the saturnine"
breed.
"Cherry would not return to the ship, but Emerson and Clyde re-embarked"
"and were rowed down to the cannery site, abreast of which lay _The"
"Bedford Castle_, where they lingered until the creeping twilight forced"
them to the boat again. When they reached the ship the cool Arctic
"night had descended, but its quiet was broken by the halting nimble of"
"steam-winches, the creak of tackle, the cries of men, and the sounds of"
a great activity. Baring his head to the breezes Boyd filled his lungs
"full of the bracing air, sweet with the flavor of spring, vowing"
secretly that no music that he had ever heard was the equal of this. He
"turned his face to the southward and smiled, while his thoughts sped a"
message of love and hope into the darkness.
"though I am not abroad. But perhaps I am abroad after all, far away from"
the soil where I have my roots.
"Why, indeed, do I stay here any longer, at a resort full of"
"schoolmistresses, with a host who has once more said farewell to sobriety?"
Nothing is happening to me; I do not grow here. The others go out and lie
"on their backs; I steal off and find relish in myself, and feel poetry"
"within me for the night. The world wants no, poetry; it wants only verses"
that have not been sung before.
"And Norway wants no red-hot irons; only village smiths forge irons now,"
for the needs of the mob and the honor of the country.
No one came; the stream of tourists went up and down Stordalen and left
our little Reisa valley deserted. If only the Northern Railway could have
come to Reisa with Cook's and Bennett's tours--then Stordalen in its turn
"would have lain deserted. Meanwhile, the cotters who are cultivating the"
soil will probably go on harvesting half the crop of the outlying fields
for the rest of time. There is every reason to think so--unless our
"descendants are more intelligent than we, and refuse to be smitten with"
the demoralizing effects of the tourist traffic.
"Now, my friend, you mustn't believe me; this is the point where you must"
"shake your head. There is a professor scuttling about the country, a born"
mediocrity with a little school knowledge about history; you had better
"ask him. He'll give you just as much mediocre information, my friend, as"
your vision can grasp and your brain endure.

irregular life again. More and more all roads were closed to him; he saw
DR. J. C. BOSE CALLED AND EXAMINED
"83,635. (Chairman). The witness favoured an arrangement by which Indians"
"would enter the higher ranks of the service, either through the"
Provincial Service or by direct recruitment in India. The latter class
"of officers, after completing their education in India, should"
ordinarily go to Europe with a view to widening their experience. By
this he did not wish to decry the training given in the Indian
"Universities, which produced some of the very best men, and he would not"
make the rule absolute. It was not necessary for men of exceptional
"ability to go to England in order to occupy a high chair. Unfortunately,"
on account of there being no openings for men of genius in the
"Educational Service, distinguished men were driven to the profession of"
Law. In the present condition of India a larger number of distinguished
men were needed to give their lives to the education of the people.
"83,636. The witness himself had spent part of his career in Europe, and"
"looking back he could say that this had been of great profit to him,"
"not so much on account of the training he got, as by being brought into"
personal contact with eminent men whose influence extorted his
"admiration, and create in him a feeling of emulation. In this way he"
"owed a great deal to Lord Rayleigh under whom he worked, but he did not"
see why that advantage should not eventually be secured by Indians in
India under an Indian Lord Rayleigh.
"83,637. There should be only one Educational Service, but men who were"
distinguished in any subject should not start from its very lowest rung
but should be placed somewhere in the middle of it.
"83,638. There were men in the Provincial Service who were very"
"sailed away with his prize from the harbour. This prize, amongst the"
"merchandise, contained 40,000 moidors and a cross of diamonds designed for"
the King of Portugal.
"He then took a Dutch ship, and two days later an English one, and sailed"
"back to Brazil, refitting and cleaning at the Island of Ferdinando."
"In a work such as this is, it is impossible to recount all, or even a few,"
"of the daring adventures, or the piratical ups and downs of one pirate."
Roberts sailed to the West Indies devastating the commerce of Jamaica and
"Barbadoes. When things grew too hot there, he went north to Newfoundland,"
and played the very devil with the English and French fishing fleets and
settlements.
"His first ship he called the _Fortune_, his next, a bigger ship, the"
"_Royal Fortune_, another the _Good Fortune_."
"On two occasions Roberts had been very roughly handled, once by a ship"
"from Barbadoes and once by the inhabitants of Martinica, so when he"
"designed his new flag, he portrayed on it a huge figure of himself"
"standing sword in hand upon two skulls, and under these were the letters"
"A.B.H. and A.M.H., signifying a Barbadian's and a Martinican's head."
"In April, 1721, Roberts was back again on the Guinea Coast, burning and"
plundering. Amongst the prisoners he took out of one of his prizes was a
clergyman. The captain dearly wished to have a chaplain on board his ship
"to administer to the spiritual welfare of his crew, and tried all he could"
"to persuade the parson to sign on, promising him that his only duties"
should be to say prayers and make punch. But the prelate begged to be
"excused, and was at length allowed to go with all his belongings, except"
three prayer-books and a corkscrew--articles which were sorely needed
aboard the _Royal Fortune_.
"itself.""[7] The mere Ã¦sthetic sensibility makes but a new artist; what"
"makes the critic is his philosophy. Here also, however, as during the"
"whole course of our inquiry, we must not identify philosophy with the"
"official history of philosophical disciplines, which offers a large"
number of theories of Ã¦sthetics only remotely related to the concrete
"works of art, to the concrete processes of Ã¦sthetic creation, but with"
"the whole history of human thought, with the working out of particular"
problems successively presented to the intelligence of man by the
"actual developments of poetry and art. The Ã¦sthetic judgment, like"
"every other judgment, is a synthesis of the individual intuition, or"
"subject, and of the universal category, or predicate; and this is but"
"another way of stating the identity of Ã¦sthetic criticism, as of all"
"forms of history, with philosophy. The critic must be endowed with a"
"power to give new life, within his own mind, to the intuitions of the"
"artist, but this is for him but the soil in which his thought must"
"spread its roots; it is true that without that power, no criticism"
"is possible, but it is equally true that no philosophy of art can"
grow on any but that same soil. The ultimate test of the validity of
Ã¦sthetic thought is in its capacity to expand our sphere of Ã¦sthetic
apprehension; and pure Ã¦sthetics is but the methodological moment of
Ã¦sthetic history or criticism.

"(163) Wounded at Rensburg. _Entry_ (Mauser), in ninth left"
"intercostal space in posterior axillary line; _exit_, a"
transverse slit 1/2 an inch in length to left of xiphoid
"appendage. Patient was retiring when struck; he did not fall,"
"but ran for about 1,000 yards, whence he was conveyed to"
hospital. He vomited half an hour after the injury (last meal
"bread and 'bully beef,' taken two hours previously), and during"
"the evening three times again, the vomit consisting mainly 'of"
"dark thick blood.' He was put on milk diet, and not completely"
starved; on the third day a large quantity of dark clotted
"blood was passed per rectum with the stool, and this continued"
for two days.
Ten days after the injury the temperature was still rising to
"100°, and did not become normal till the fourteenth day. The"
"pulse averaged 80. The abdomen, meanwhile, moved fairly well,"
respirations 18 to 20. Some tenderness was present in the
epigastrium and towards the spleen. Resonance throughout.
"Ordinary diet was now resumed, and beyond slight epigastric"
"pain on deep inspiration, no further symptoms were observed,"
and the patient left for England at the end of the month. The
"spleen may have been traversed in this patient, as well as the"
lower margin of the right lung.
"(164*) Wounded at Enslin. _Entry_ (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch from"
"the spine, opposite the eighth intercostal space; _exit_,"
"through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch from the"
median line. The patient was lying in the prone position when
"shot: he vomited blood freely, and the bowels acted three times"
"before he was seen forty hours after the accident, each motion"
Belgium for Holland. But this last plea was said by the American
"representative to be unsustainable. For various reasons, the German"
"Government would not permit it, and he was afraid neither Vivie nor"
her mother would get enough backing from the British authorities to
strengthen the American demand. She must stop on in Brussels till
the War came to an end.
"""But how are we to live?"" asked Vivie, with a catch in her throat."
"""Our supply of Belgian money is coming to an end. My mother has"
considerable funds invested in England. These she can't touch. She
"has other sums in German securities, but soon after the War they"
stopped sending her the interest on the plea that she was an
"'enemy.' As to the money we have in Belgium, the bank in Brussels"
"can tell me nothing. What are we to do?"" The rather cold-mannered"
American diplomatist--it was one of the Secretaries of Legation and
"he knew all about Mrs. Warren's past, and regarded Vivie as an"
outlaw--said he would try to communicate with her friends in England
"and see if through the American Relief organization, funds could be"
transmitted for their maintenance. She gave him the addresses of
"Rossiter, Praed, and her mother's London bankers."
Vivie now tried to settle down to a life of usefulness. To increase
their resources she gave lessons in English to Belgians and even to
German officers. She offered herself to various groups of Belgian
ladies who had taken up such charities as the Germans permitted. She
also asked to be taken on as a Red Cross helper. But in all these
directions she had many snubs to meet and little encouragement.
Scandal had been busy with her name--the unhappy reputation of her
"mother, the peculiar circumstances under which she had left England,"
the two or three months shut up at Tervueren with Colonel von
"Giesselin, and the very protection he now accorded her and her"
mother at the Hotel Impérial. She felt herself looked upon almost as
"grown to piracy, the northern League gave its main strength to trade by"
sea.
Its special interest for us to-day lies in the fact that it was
"ultra-racial, beginning in 1241 in a pact between the free cities of"
"Lübeck and Hamburg,[715] and finally including Wendish, German, Dutch,"
"French, and even Spanish cities, in fluctuating numbers. The motive to"
"union, as it had need be, was one of mercantile gain. Beginning,"
"apparently, by having each its separate authorised _hansa_ or"
"trading-group in foreign cities, the earlier trading-towns of the group,"
perhaps from the measure of co-operation and fraternity thus forced on
"them abroad,[716] saw their advantage in a special league for the common"
good as a monopoly maintained against outsiders; and this being
"extended, the whole League came to bear the generic name."
See Kohlrausch for the theory that contact in foreign cities is the
"probable cause of the policy of union (_History of Germany_, Eng."
"tr., p. 260; cp. Ashley, _Introd. to Economic History_, i, 104,"
"110). As to the origin of the word, see Stubbs, i, 447, _note_. The"
_hans_ or _hansa_ first appears historically in England as a name
"apparently identical with _gild_; and, starting with a _hansa_ or"
"hanse-house of their own, English cities in some cases are found"
"trading through subordinate _hansas_ in other cities, not only of"
Normandy but of England itself. Thus arose the Flemish Hansa or
"""Hansa of London,"" ignored in so many notices of the better-known"
Hanseatic League. Early in the thirteenth century it included a
number of the towns of Flanders engaged in the English wool-trade;
"and later it numbered at one time seventeen towns, including"
"Chalons, Rheims, St. Quentin, Cambray, and Amiens (Ashley, _Introd."

"Daphne Wing sighed out: ""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen!"" and, bending over that hand,"
"kissed it.  Gyp saw that her new glove was wet.  Then the girl relapsed,"
"her feet a little forward, her head a little forward, her back against"
"the door.  Gyp, who knew why she stood thus, was swept again by those two"
"emotions--rage against men, and fellow feeling for one about to go"
through what she herself had just endured.
"""It's all right,"" she said, gently; ""only, what's to be done?"""
Daphne Wing put her hands up over her white face and sobbed.  She sobbed
so quietly but so terribly deeply that Gyp herself had the utmost
difficulty not to cry.  It was the sobbing of real despair by a creature
"bereft of hope and strength, above all, of love--the sort of weeping"
"which is drawn from desolate, suffering souls only by the touch of fellow"
"feeling.  And, instead of making Gyp glad or satisfying her sense of"
"justice, it filled her with more rage against her husband--that he had"
taken this girl's infatuation for his pleasure and then thrown her away.
"She seemed to see him discarding that clinging, dove-fair girl, for"
"cloying his senses and getting on his nerves, discarding her with caustic"
"words, to abide alone the consequences of her infatuation.  She put her"
"hand timidly on that shaking shoulder, and stroked it.  For a moment the"
"sobbing stopped, and the girl said brokenly:"
"""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I do love him so!""  At those naive words, a painful"
"wish to laugh seized on Gyp, making her shiver from head to foot.  Daphne"
"Wing saw it, and went on: ""I know--I know--it's awful; but I do--and now"
"he--he--""  Her quiet but really dreadful sobbing broke out again.  And"
"again Gyp began stroking and stroking her shoulder.  ""And I have been so"
"awful to you!  Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, do forgive me, please!"""
"All Gyp could find to answer, was:"
them--and with the informality of adversity the three captives began
to talk. Swiftly Brand got a little knowledge of Greca's position on
"Jupiter, and of the racial history that led up to it."
*       *       *       *       *
Four of the nine satellites of Jupiter were now the home of living
"beings. But two only, at the dawn of history as Greca knew it, had"
been originally inhabited. These were the fourth and the second.
"On the fourth there dwelt a race, ""like me,"" as Greca put it--a"
"kindly, gentle people content to live and let live."
"On the second had been a race of immensely tall, but attenuated and"
physically feeble things with great heads and huge dull eyes and
characters distinguished mainly for cold-blooded savagery.
The inhabitants of the fourth satellite had remained in ignorance of
"the monsters on the second till one day ""many, many ages ago,"" a fleet"
of clumsy ships appeared on the fourth satellite. From the ships had
"poured thousands of pipe-like creatures, armed with horrible rods of"
"metal that killed instantly and without a sound. The things, it"
"seemed, had crowded over the limits of their own globe, and had been"
forced to find more territory.
They had made captive the entire population of the satellite.
Then--for like all dangerous vermin they multiplied rapidly--they had
overflowed to the first and fifth satellites--the others were
uninhabitable--and finally to the dangerous surface of Jupiter itself.
"Everywhere they had gone, they had taken droves of Greca's people to"
"be their slaves, ""and the source of their food,"" added Greca, with a"
shudder; a statement that was at the moment unintelligible to the two
"on the field an hour, whence he was removed to hospital."
"Probably the track pierced the ilium, and remained confined to"
the abdominal wall. There were no signs of visceral injury.
"(159) Cape Boy. Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford),"
immediately above and outside right anterior superior spine;
"_exit_, 1-1/2 inch below and to right of umbilicus. A"
well-marked swelling corresponded with division of the fibres
"of the oblique muscles and of the rectus, and on palpation a"
hollow corresponding with the track was felt. The abdominal
muscles were exceptionally well developed (fig. 84).
"(160) Wounded at Magersfontein while lying prone. _Entry_,"
"irregular, oblique, and somewhat contused, over the eighth left"
"rib, in the anterior axillary line; _exit_, a slit wound"
immediately above and to the left of the umbilicus. The bullet
"struck a small circular metal looking-glass before entering,"
hence the irregularity of the wound. The patient developed a
"hæmothorax, but no abdominal signs; the former was probably"
"parietal in origin, secondary to the fractured rib, and the"
whole wound non-penetrating as far as the abdominal cavity was
concerned.
"(161) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1-1/2 inch"
external to and 1/2 inch below the left posterior superior
"iliac spine; _exit_, 1 inch internal horizontally to the left"
anterior superior spine.
"No signs of intra-peritoneal injury were noted, but free"
suppuration occurred in left loin; the ilium was tunnelled.
The same patient was wounded by a Jeffrey bullet in the hand;
"told Sir Oliver to go to the devil with his lugubrious and rotten game,"
and dashed away to the solitude of the beach until the luncheon-bell
summoned him back.
"“I'm going by the 3:50,” said he at the luncheon-table."
At three o'clock Stella was free to see him again. He went up to her
room distinctly determined to shut his heart against folly. The sun
had crept round toward the west and flooded the head and shoulders of
"Stellamaris and the dainty bedspread with pale gold, just as it flooded"
the now still and smiling sea. Again paralysis fell upon John. The words
"he was to speak were to him, as well as to her, the words of doom, and"
"he could not utter them. They talked of vain, childish things. Then"
Stellamaris's clock chimed the three-quarters. There are some chimes
"that are brutal, others ironic; but Stellamaris's chimes (the clock was"
"a gift from John himself) were soft, and pealed a soothing mystery, like"
a bell swung in a deep sea-cave.
"It was a quarter to four, and he had missed his train once more. Well,"
"the train could go to--to London, as good a synonym for Tophet as any"
"other. So he stayed, recklessly surrendering himself to the pale, sunlit"
"peace of the sea-chamber, till he was dislodged by Lady Blount."
An attempt to catch a six o'clock train was equally unsuccessful. He did
not return to town that night. Why should a sorely bruised man reject
"the balm that healed? To-morrow he would be stronger and more serene,"
"abler to control the driving force of the Furies, and therefore fitted"
to announce in gentler wise the decrees of destiny. So Risca went to bed
"and slept easier, and the room which Stellamaris had made for him became"
the enchanted bower of a Fair Lady of All Mercy.
In their simple human way Sir Oliver and Lady Blount besought him to
afterwards rejoined Wafer.
"SPRIGGS, CAPTAIN FRANCIS FARRINGTON."
An uninteresting and bloody pirate without one single redeeming character.
"He learnt his art with the pirate Captain Lowther, afterwards serving as"
quartermaster with Captain Low and taking an active part in all the
barbarities committed by the latter.
"About 1720 Low took a prize, a man-of-war called the _Squirrel_. This he"
"handed over to some of the crew, who elected Spriggs their captain. The"
"ship they renamed the _Delight_, and in the night altered their course and"
"left Low. They made a flag, bearing upon it a white skeleton, holding in"
"one hand a dart striking a bleeding heart, and in the other an hourglass."
"Sailing to the West Indies, Spriggs took several prizes, treating the"
crews with abominable cruelty. On one occasion the pirates chased what
"they believed to be a Spanish ship, and after a long while they came"
alongside and fired a broadside into her. The ship immediately
"surrendered, and turned out to be a vessel the pirate had plundered only a"
"few days previously. This infuriated Spriggs and his crew, who showed"
their disappointment by half murdering the captain. After a narrow escape
"from being captured by a French man-of-war near the Island of St. Kitts,"
"Spriggs sailed north to the Summer Isles, or Bermudas. Taking a ship"
"coming from Rhode Island, they found her cargo to consist of horses."
Several of the pirates mounted these and galloped up and down the deck
until they were thrown. While plundering several small vessels of their
"cargo of logwood in the Bay of Honduras, Spriggs was surprised and"
"attacked by an English man-of-war, and the pirates only escaped by using"
their sweeps. Spriggs now went for a cruise off the coast of South
"Carolina, returning again to Honduras. This was a rash proceeding on"

Part V.--SPECIAL CASES OF JURISDICTION.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of capture in land expedition. [27 & 28
"Vict. c. 25, s. 34.]]"
"34. Where, in an expedition of any of His Majesty's naval or naval and"
military forces against a fortress or possession on land goods belonging
"to the state of the enemy, or to a public trading company of the enemy"
"exercising powers of government, are taken in the fortress or"
"possession, or a ship is taken in waters defended by or belonging to the"
"fortress or possession, a prize court shall have jurisdiction as to the"
"goods or ships so taken, and any goods taken on board the ship, as in"
case of prize.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of prize taken in expedition with ally.
"[27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 35.]]"
35. Where any ship or goods is or are taken by any of His Majesty's
naval or naval and military forces while acting in conjunction with any
"forces of any of His Majesty's allies, a prize court shall have"
"jurisdiction as to the same as in case of prize, and shall have power,"
"after condemnation, to apportion the due share of the proceeds to His"
"Majesty's ally, the proportionate amount and the disposition of which"
share shall be such as may from time to time be agreed between His
"been there, and had secured all the little snakes. There were seven of"
them.
"We asked the boys what they intended to do with the snakes, and they"
answered that they would show them to their friends in the village. 'And
then?' we asked. And then they would let them go in the water. My friend
"killed all the hamadryads on the spot, and gave the boys some coppers,"
and we went on. Can you imagine this happening anywhere else? Can you
"think of any other schoolboys sparing any animal they caught, much less"
poisonous snakes? The extraordinary hold that this tenet of their
religion has upon the Burmese must be seen to be understood. What I
"write will sound like some fairy story, I fear, to my people at home. It"
is far beneath the truth. The belief that it is wrong to take life is a
belief with them as strong as any belief could be. I do not know
"anywhere any command, earthly or heavenly, that is acted up to with such"
earnestness as this command is amongst the Burmese. It is an abiding
principle of their daily life.
Where the command came from I do not know. I cannot find any allusion to
it in the life of the great teacher. We know that he ate meat. It seems
to me that it is older even than he. It has been derived both by the
Burmese Buddhists and the Hindus from a faith whose origin is hidden in
the mists of long ago. It is part of that far older faith on which
"Buddhism was built, as was Christianity on Judaism."
But if not part of his teaching--and though it is included in the sacred
"books, we do not know how much of them are derived from the Buddha"
himself--it is in strict accordance with all his teaching. That is one
"of the most wonderful points of Buddhism, it is all in accordance; there"
are no exceptions.
I have heard amongst Europeans a very curious explanation of this
"Queen-Regent,"" whispered the portress, Rebeca, pointing upwards; ""but"
"promise me to commit no murder or do any hurt to the little maid."""
"""Be quiet, woman,"" muttered Rollo, more roughly than was his wont; ""we"
"are come to save both of them from worse than death. Sergeant Cardono,"
"bring the ladder!"""
"The Sergeant disappeared, and it was not many seconds before he was back"
again adjusting its hooks to the side of an iron balcony in front of one
of the lighted rooms. Almost before he had finished Rollo would have
"mounted, impetuously as was his custom, but the Sergeant held him back"
by the arm.
"""I crave your forgiveness,"" he whispered, ""but if you will pardon me"
"saying so, I have much more experience in such matters than you. Permit"
me in this single case to precede you! We know not what or whom we may
"meet with above!"""
"Nevertheless, though the Sergeant mounted first, Rollo followed so"
closely that his hands upon the rounds of the ladder were more than once
in danger of being trodden upon by the Sergeant's half-boots.
Presently they stood together on the iron balcony and peered within. A
tall dark man leaned against an elaborately carved mantelpiece
indolently stroking his glossy black whiskers. A lady arrayed in a
"dressing-gown of pink silk reaching to her feet was seated on a chair,"
"and submitting restlessly enough to the hands of her maid, who was"
"arranging her hair for the night, in the intervals of a violent but"
somewhat one-sided quarrel which was proceeding between the pair.
Every few moments the lady would start from her seat and with her eyes
flashing fire she would advance towards the indolent dandy by the
"men of learning, men of character who will take on themselves the burden"
"of the world."" Such is the prophetic vision given to the greatest of"
teachers. The modern teacher from England will set before him an ideal
"not less exalted--regarding his pupils as his comrades, he as an"
Englishman will instill into them greater virility and a greater public
spirit. This will be his special contribution to the forming of our
Indian youths.
Turning to the Indian students he could say that it was his good fortune
never to have had the harmonious relation between teacher and pupils in
any way ruffled during his long connection with them for more than three
decades. The real secret of success was in trying at times to see things
from the student's point of view and to cultivate a sense of humour
enabling him to enjoy the splendid self-assurance of youth with a
"feeling not unmixed with envy. In essential matters, however, one could"
not wish to meet a better type or one more quickly susceptible to finer
appeals to right conduct and duty as Indian students. Their faults are
"rather of omission than of commission, since in his experience he formed"
"that the moment they realised their teachers to be their friends, they"
"responded instantly and did not flinch from any test, however severe,"
that could be laid on them.

"three distinct series, the LOWER CAMBRIAN, the MIDDLE CAMBRIAN,"
"and the UPPER CAMBRIAN, each of which is characterized by its own"
peculiar fauna. In sketching the outlines of the continent as it
"was at the beginning of the Paleozoic, it must be remembered that"
wherever the Lower Cambrian formations now are found was certainly
"then sea bottom, and wherever the Lower Cambrian are wanting, and"
"the next formations rest directly on pre-Cambrian rocks, was"
probably then land.
EARLY CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. In this way we know that at the opening
"of the Cambrian two long, narrow mediterranean seas stretched from"
north to south across the continent. The eastern sea extended from
the Gulf of St. Lawrence down the Champlain-Hudson valley and
thence along the western base of the Blue Ridge south at least to
Alabama. The western sea stretched from the Canadian Rockies over
the Great Basin and at least as far south as the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado in Arizona.
Between these mediterraneans lay a great central land which
included the pre-Cambrian U-shaped area of the Laurentian
"peneplain, and probably extended southward to the latitude of New"
Orleans. To the east lay a land which we may designate as
"APPALACHIA, whose western shore line was drawn along the site of"
"the present Blue Ridge, but whose other limits are quite unknown."
"The land of Appalachia must have been large, for it furnished a"
"great amount of waste during the entire Paleozoic era, and its"
eastern coast may possibly have lain even beyond the edge of the
present continental shelf. On the western side of the continent a
narrow land occupied the site of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
to be blamed as her sins?
"To me the Yellow Peril cry, which is so often revived in some quarters"
"of the Continent, is either a sort of what we call 'guchi,' that is to"
"say, useless repetition of complaint of some unreasonable"
"disappointment, or a perpetuation of wicked instigation and selfish"
"intention. In either case, it is not at all a laudable action; indeed, I"
may say it is wasteful calumny for no material good will come of it
inasmuch as its object can never be achieved from the very condition of
the world. The people who entertain that idea would be doing far better
"service to their country, to the progress of civilisation, to the"
"general cause of humanity, if only they put aside such a silly notion,"
and busy themselves in teaching their fellow country-folks to accustom
themselves to the changed circumstances of the time. It would be a far
"more manly and noble act if they revised their old notions, which in a"
measure may be called prejudice.
"As to ourselves, the Japanese, we shall only be glad if we can enjoy a"
"peaceful and harmonious life in the happy family of the world, as we are"
"determined to do, in spite of all the obstacles which may be laid before"
us.

XI
THE INDO-CHINA QUESTION[1]
INTERVIEW WITH THE BARON SUYEMATSU
I did not like to say before my lady what I thought--that the
"Waldgrave was not quite himself, nor to be depended upon; and instead"
I proposed to go forward on foot and learn if anything was amiss. The
"road ran straight down the hill, and the party could scarcely pass me,"
"even in the gloom. If I found all well, I would whistle, and they"
could come on.
"My lady agreed, and, leaving them halted, I started cautiously down"
the hill. The darkness was not extreme; the cloud drift was broken
"here and there, and showed light patches of sky between; I could make"
"out the shapes of things, and more than once took a clump of bushes"
"for a lurking ambush. But halfway down, a line of poplars began to"
"shadow the road on our side, and from that point I might have walked"
"into a regiment and never seen a man. This, the being suddenly alone,"
"and the constant rustling of the leaves overhead, which moved with the"
"slightest air, shook my nerves, and I went very warily, with my heart"
in my mouth and a cry trembling on my lips.
Still I had reached the hillfoot before anything happened. Then I
"stopped abruptly, hearing quite distinctly in front of me the sound of"
footsteps. It was impossible that this could be the sound that the
"Waldgrave had heard, for only one man seemed to be stirring, and he"
"moved stealthily; but I crouched down and listened, and in a moment I"
was rewarded. A dark figure came out of the densest of the shadow and
"stood in the middle of the road. I sank lower, noiselessly. The man"
seemed to be listening.
It flashed into my head that he was a sentry; and I thought how
fortunate it was that I had come on alone.
"Presently he moved again. He stole along the track towards me,"
We were shown everything that we desired to see except the
transmission room and the upper conning tower--the twin holy of holies
"in a commissioned ship--and slipped away, escaping the Captain by a"
"bare two minutes. Which was lucky, as he would probably have had us"
"thrown into the ""ditch."""
"The end of the day was as weariful as the beginning, and we were all"
"glad--especially, I expect, Mrs. Cary--to go early to bed. That"
"ill-used lady, to whom we could disclose nothing of our anxieties,"
must have found us wretched company.
We had finished breakfast the next morning--the Saturday of Dawson's
gamble--and were sitting on Cary's big fireguard talking of every
"subject, except the one which had kept us awake at night, when a"
servant entered and announced that a soldier was at the door with a
"message from Mr. Dawson. ""Show him in,"" almost shouted Cary, and I"
"jumped to my feet, stirred for once into a visible display of"
eagerness.
"A Marine came in, dressed in the smart blue sea kit that I love; upon"
his head the low flat cap of his Corps. He gave us a full swinging
"salute, and jumped to attention with a click of his heels. He looked"
"about thirty-five, and wore a neatly trimmed dark moustache. His hair,"
"also very dark, was cropped close to his head. Standing there with his"
"hands upon the red seams of his trousers, his chest well filled out,"
"and his face weather tanned, he looked a proper figure of a sea-going"
"soldier. ""Mr. Cary, sir,"" he said, in a flat, monotonous orderly's"
"voice, ""Major Boyle's compliments, and could you and your friend come"
down to the Police Station to meet him and Chief Inspector Dawson. I
"have a taxi-cab at the door, sir."""
"""Certainly,"" cried Cary; ""in two minutes we shall be ready."""
maintain a mission of its own in Congoland. Kind Mme. Trouessart
"(née Walcker), distressed and unusually moved at the sad"
"circumstances of Mrs. Warren's death, had called in her uncle the"
Baptist pastor (who also in some unexplained way seemed to hold a
brief for the Salvation Army). He prayed silently by the death-bed
"which, under the circumstances, was more tactful than open"
intercession. He helped greatly over all the formalities of the
"funeral, and he took upon himself the arrangement of the ceremony,"
"so that everything was done decorously, and certainly to the"
"satisfaction of the Belgians, who attended. Such people would be"
"large-minded in religion--you might be Protestant, if you were not"
"Catholic, or you might be Jewish; but a funeral without some outward"
sign of faith and hope would have puzzled and distressed them.
"To Vivie's great surprise, there was a considerable attendance at"
the ceremony. She had expected no more than the company of Minna--an
"unprofessing but real Christian, if ever there were one, and the"
equally Christian if equally hedonist Mme. Trouessart. But there
"came in addition quite a number of shopkeepers from the Rue Royale,"
"the Rues de Schaerbeek, du Marais, de Lione, and de l'Association,"
"with whom Mrs. Warren had dealt in years gone by. ""C'etait une dame"
"_très_ convenable,"" said one purveyor, and the others agreed. ""Elle"
"me paya écus sonnants,"" said another, ""et toujours sans"
"marchander."" There was even present a more distinguished"
acquaintance of the past: a long-retired Commissaire de Police of
the Quartier in which Mrs. Warren's hotel was situated.
"He appeared in the tightly-buttoned frock-coat of civil life, with a"
"minute disc of some civic decoration in his button hole, and an"
incredibly tall chimney-pot hat. He came to render his _respectueux
hommages_ to the maîtresse-femme who had conducted her business
"within the four corners of the law, ""sans avoir maille à partir avec"
"This wood was never quite dark, it was so full of these lights that"
flickered aimlessly.
There were men in this wood who wandered to and fro. The wood was full
of them.
They did not know whither they went; they did not know whither they
"wished to go. Only this they knew, that they could never keep still;"
"for the keeper of this wood was Time. He was armed with a keen whip, and"
kept driving them on and on; there was no rest.
"Many of these when they first came loved the wood. The glades, they"
"said, were very beautiful, the flowers very sweet. They wandered down"
"the broad roads into the glades, and tried to lie upon the moss and love"
the flowers; but Time would not let them. Just for a few moments they
"could have peace, and then they must on and on. But they did not care."
"'The forest is full of glades,' they said; 'if we cannot live in one, we"
"can find another.' And so they went on finding others and others, and"
each one pleased them less.
Some few there were who did not go to the glades at all. 'They are very
"beautiful,' they said, 'but these roads that pass through them, whither"
do they lead? Round and round and round again. There is no peace there.
"Time rules in those glades, Time with his whip and goad, and there is no"
"peace. What we want is rest. And those lights,' they said, 'they are"
"wandering lights, like the summer lightning far down in the South,"
moving hither and thither. We care not for such lights. Our light is
firm and clear. What we desire is peace; we do not care to wander for
"ever round this forest, to see for ever those shifting lights.'"
"And so they would not go down the winding roads, but essayed the path"
"upon the cliffs. 'It is narrow,' they said, 'it has no flowers, it is"

"7. The registrar of every prize court in a British possession shall, on"
"the first day of January and first day of July in every year, make out a"
return (in such form as the Admiralty from time to time direct) of all
"cases adjudged in the court since the last half-yearly return, and shall"
with all convenient speed send the same to the Admiralty registrar of
"the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court, who"
"RACKAM, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ CALICO JACK."
Served as quartermaster in Captain Vane's company. On one occasion Vane
"refused to fight a big French ship, and in consequence was dismissed his"
"ship and marooned on an uninhabited island off the coast of America, while"
the crew elected Rackam to be their captain in his place. This was on
"November 24th, 1718, and on the very first day of his command he had the"
good fortune to take and plunder several small vessels.
"Off the Island of Jamaica they took a Madeira ship, and found an old"
"friend on board as a passenger--a Mr. Hosea Tisdell, who kept a tavern in"
"the island, and they treated him with great respect."
"Christmas Day coming, the pirates landed on a small island to celebrate"
"this festival in a thorough manner, carousing and drinking as long as the"
"liquor lasted, when they sailed away to seek more. Their next prize was a"
"strange one. On coming alongside a ship, she surrendered, and the pirates"
"boarding her to examine her cargo, found it to consist of thieves from"
"Newgate on their way to the plantations. Taking two more vessels, Rackam"
"sailed to the Bahama Islands, but the Governor, Captain Woodes Rogers,"
"sent a sloop, which took away their prizes."
"Rackam now sailed his ship to a snug little cove he knew of in Cuba, where"
he had more than one lady acquaintance. Here the pirates were very happy
until all their provisions and money was spent. Just as they were about to
"sail, in comes a Spanish Guarda del Costa with a small English sloop which"
"they had recently taken. Rackam was now in a very awkward position, being"
"unable to get past the Spaniard, and all he could do was to hide behind a"
"small island. Night came on, and when it was dark Rackam put all his crew"
"into a boat, rowed quietly up to the sloop, clambered aboard, threatening"
"'You loved her so much,' I said. 'She was such a good wife to you."
Surely you would like to live with her again.'
"'But all that,' she replied, 'was in a former life.'"
Now she loved only her present father and mother. The last life was like
"a dream. Broken memories of it still remained, but the loves and hates,"
"the passions and impulses, were all dead."
Another little boy told me once that the way remembrance came to him was
"by seeing the silk he used to wear made into curtains, which are given"
"to the monks and used as partitions in their monasteries, and as walls"
to temporary erections made at festival times. He was taken when some
"three years old to a feast at the making of a lad, the son of a wealthy"
"merchant, into a monk. There he recognised in the curtain walling in"
part of the bamboo building his old dress. He pointed it out at once.
This same little fellow told me that he passed three months between his
death and his next incarnation without a body. This was because he had
"once accidentally killed a fowl. Had he killed it on purpose, he would"
have been punished very much more severely. Most of this three months he
"spent dwelling in the hollow shell of a palm-fruit. The nuisance was, he"
"explained, that this shell was close to the cattle-path, and that the"
lads as they drove the cattle afield in the early morning would bang
with a stick against the shell. This made things very uncomfortable for
him inside.
It is not an uncommon thing for a woman when about to be delivered of a
"baby to have a dream, and to see in that dream the spirit of someone"
"asking for permission to enter the unborn child; for, to a certain"
"extent, it lies within a woman's power to say who is to be the life of"
her child.
"""I suppose I had better introduce myself to you, Mr. Alwyn""--she said"
"with a condescending and confident air--""Though really we know each"
other so well by reputation that there seems scarcely any necessity for
"it! Of course you have heard of 'Tiger-Lily!'"""
"Villiers gazed at her helplessly,--he had never felt so uncomfortable"
"in all his life. Here was a strange woman, who had actually taken"
"bodily possession of his apartment as though it were her own,--who had"
"settled herself down in his particular pet Louis Quatorze chair,--who"
stared at him with the scrutinizing complacency of a professional
"physiognomist,--and who seemed to think no explanation of her"
"extraordinary conduct was necessary, inasmuch as ""of course"" he,"
"Villiers, had heard of ""TIGER-LILY!"" It was very singular! ... almost"
like madness! ... Perhaps she WAS mad! How could he tell? She had a
"remarkably high, knobby brow,--a brow with an unpleasantly bald"
"appearance, owing to the uncompromising way in which her hair was"
brushed well off it--he had seen such brows before in certain
"""spiritualists"" who believed, or pretended to believe, in the suddenly"
"willed dematerialization of matter, and THEY were mad, he knew, or else"
very foolishly feigning madness!
"Endeavoring to compose his bewildered mind, he fixed glass in eye, and"
"regarded her through it with an inquiring solemnity,--he would have"
"spoken, but before he could utter a word, she went on rapidly:"
"""You are not in the least like the person I imagined you to be! ..."
"However, that doesn't matter. Literary celebrities are always so"
"different to what we expect!"""
"""Pardon me, madam,""--began Villiers politely.. ""You are making a slight"
"error,--my servant probably did not explain. I am not Mr. Alwyn, . . my"
"""run"" across the mountains or beached on the desolate sands of"
Catalunia.
"""I am no inlander,"" he said, ""I am of the sea-coast of Tarragona. I have"
never been south of Tortosa in my life; but there does not live a man
who has conducted more good cigars and brandy to their destination than
"old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds!"""
The sergeant with grave courtesy reached him a well-rolled cigarette.
"""I have heard of your fame, brother,"" he said; ""even at Ronda and on the"
Madrid-Seville road your deeds are not unknown. But what of this venture
"to-night? Have you enough men, think you, to overpower the town watchmen"
"and the palace-guards?"""
The old gipsy tossed his bony hands into the air with a gesture of
incomparable contempt.
"""The palace guards are fled back to Madrid,"" he cried, ""and as to the"
"town watch they are either drunk or in their dotage!"""
Meantime the main body of the gipsies waited patiently in the
"background, and every few minutes their numbers were augmented by the"
arrival of others over the various passes of the mountains. These took
"their places without salutation, like men expected, and fell promptly to"
"listening to the conversation of the two great men, who sat smoking"
their cigarettes each on his own stone in the wide wild corrie among the
rocks of the Guadarrama which had been chosen as an appropriate
rendezvous.
"Singularly enough, after the sergeant had shown the scarlet mark of the"
"strangling ring about his neck, no one of all that company doubted for a"
"terms I don't think they could have agreed for ten minutes. As it was,"
"they had serious differences at times, which, however, I believe were"
all ultimately and happily adjusted.'
"The visits to his uncle's home, and the attractive young lady whom he"
"there met, must have largely contributed to Ferrier's happiness in"
these years of mental fermentation. Such times come in many men's lives
"when youth is turning into manhood, and powers are wakening up within"
that seem as though they would lead us we know not whither. And so it
may have been with Ferrier. But he was endowed with considerable
"calmness and self-command, combined with a confidence in his powers"
sufficient to carry him through many difficulties that might otherwise
"have got the better of him. Wilson's home, Elleray, near the Lake of"
"Windermere, was the centre of a circle of brilliant stars. Ferrier"
"recollected, while still a lad of seventeen years of age, meeting there"
"at one time, in the summer of 1825, Scott, Wordsworth, Lockhart, and"
"Canning, a conjunction difficult to beat.[4] Once more, we are told,"
"and on a sadder occasion, he came into association with the greatest"
Scottish novelist. 'It was on that gloomy voyage when the suffering man
"was conveyed to Leith from London, on his return from his ill-fated"
"foreign journey. Mr. Ferrier was also a passenger, and scarcely dared"
to look on the almost unconscious form of one whose genius he so warmly
admired.' The end was then very near.
"[4] This meeting occurred after the Irish tour of Scott,"
"Miss Anne Scott, and Lockhart, when they visited Wilson at"
"Elleray. Canning was staying at Storre, in the"
neighbourhood.
"Professor Ferrier's daughter tells us that long after, in the summer of"
"1856, the family went to visit the English Lakes, the centre of"
"attraction being Elleray, Mr. Ferrier's old home and birthplace. 'The"
"""Lady, you have asked a hard question, inasmuch as I know but little of"
"the man, albeit I have lived with him above a month.  He attracts me,"
and yet there be moments when he repels me too.  He is a good friend—I
would not speak a word against him; yet it is said that he can be a
bitter and an unscrupulous enemy; and those who have lost his favour
"withdraw themselves as speedily as possible from his notice, fearful"
"lest some evil may befall them."""
"""Is he then cruel and rancorous?"""
"""I can believe that he might be, were his passions roused.  He has that"
forceful nature which tends to vehement liking and bitter hatred.  I
"have experienced the one; I have not tasted of the other.  For the rest,"
"he is a man of parts, and can do all well to which he puts his hand."
Methinks he would be strong enough to break off his reckless and vicious
"habits, had he but motive sufficient to make him! desire to do so.  But"
"for the nonce he floats with the current, and lives as the world lives."
"More I cannot say."""
"At that moment a swift, firm tread was heard approaching along the dim"
"alley; and Geraldine looked hastily round, her hand dropping from Grey’s"
arm.
"""It is he!"" she whispered, and there was a catch in her voice which the"
"young man heard without understanding.  He faced round, and beheld the"
towering figure of Lord Sandford beside them.
"""Well chanced upon!"" quoth he in his resonant tones.  ""I was sent by"
"your mother in search of you, Lady Geraldine.  The court of beauty has"
sat.  To her has been adjudged the prize.  She now desires the presence
"of her daughter, to share her triumph. We shall sup anon, and the table"
will not be complete without one gracious and lovely presence. Lady
LONG DELAYED SUCCESS
"And when the night was at its darkest, light gradually appeared, and"
after innumerable difficulties had been overcome his Resonant Recorder
"was perfected, which enabled the plant to tell its own story. And in"
the meantime something still more wonderful came to pass. Hitherto all
gates had been barred and he had to produce his passports everywhere. He
now found friends who never asked him for credentials. His time had come
at last. The Royal Society found his new methods most convincing and
honoured him by publication of his researches in the Philosophical
"transactions. And his discoveries, which had so long remained in"
"obscurity, found enthusiastic acceptance."
Though his theories had thus received acceptance from the leading
"scientific men of the Royal Society, there was yet no general conviction"
of the identity of life reactions in plant and animal. No amount of
controversy can remove the tendency of the human mind to follow
precedents. The only thing left was to make the plant itself bear
"witness before the scientific bodies in the West, by means of"
"self-records. At the recommendation of the Minister of Education, and of"
"the Government of Bengal, the Secretary of State sanctioned his"
scientific deputation to Europe and America.
JOURNEY OF INDIAN PLANT ROUND THE WORLD
The special difficulty which he had to contend against lay in the fact
"that the only time during which the plant flourished at all in the West,"
"was in the months of July and August, when the Universities and"
scientific societies were in vacation. The only thing left was to take
the bold step of carrying growing plants from India and trust to human
Doome took an early opportunity to draw me aside and to whisper to me
the grave disappointment it must be to all who respected him if they
"should discover the real Don Juan, begged me not to expose him, and"
pointed out the serious loss of prestige he must suffer in the eyes of
the British Public; so we sat down together on a sofa and pitied him
for his decencies.
"Luddy, luddy! how the homely virtues will persist!"
"The idol of our youth, the dark, mysteriously wicked man--with feet of"
"honest clay and a clean simple heart after all! Even prolific, and----"
"Well, damn romance, say I...."
"Oh, and more!"
Even the gods fall out--drift apart.
Aubrey and the O’Myre go different ways--Aubrey in pain that O’Myre
has now discovered that there is no great work of art without a moral
"purpose--Aubrey holding that Aubrey himself is sufficient purpose. He,"
"Aubrey, avers that he has found himself--nothing matters after that."
He must back to Paris. There the women have secular lips and voices
of brocade and understand being loved. Tiens! He will in future give
his splendid talents to attack the Philistinic brutality of strength
and the barbarity of the over-rated glory in mere outdoor delight
that to-day holds England in poisonous embrace; in all the pride of
"effeminacy he withdraws into the palace of his Egoism, where he is"
"lord--back to Paris--_there_ are mirrors, where he may reflect upon"
"himself, take himself up by the roots and dwell upon his own image!"
him and played square. For that reason he would be equally square and
"aboveboard, and let this dirty work alone."
"That was what he _had_ decided, but now----"
"He gritted his teeth, glared fiercely around, and came to an abrupt"
stop. Every instinct of the riverman was aroused. On his left the river
dropped over short falls into a narrow gorge. It was a spot where things
"were likely to happen at any time, and where a man or two should have"
"been stationed continually. Curly knew, in fact, that there had been men"
"here all morning. They had been called away for some purpose, leaving"
the little falls unguarded. And as he stood there his practiced eyes
told him that he was beholding the very start of a jam.
"A log, plunging over the falls, upended. Another was thrust under it. A"
"third and fourth, coming down together, caught on the obstruction, all"
being held by some stones rising midstream. Before the current could
tear them loose several more timbers were forced against the mass which
"was piling up so swiftly, bridging to the opposite shore."
"To carry out that angry resolve of a minute or two ago, Curly should"
"have rolled himself another cigarette, and watched the growing damage"
with a sardonic smile. He did nothing of the sort. For a flash he had
"forgotten his grievance, and was a “river hog,” pure and simple. The"
stoppage must be broken before it reached the proportions of a real jam.
"There was no one else to do it, and so he leaped to the task without a"
second’s pause for thought.
"Upstream he ran a few feet, his eyes fixed on the surface of the river"
"above the falls. Then he saw what he wanted. An instant later, using his"
"peavey much as a pole vaulter does his pole, he leaped straight out over"
"the water, landed squarely on a big log, and was carried down to the"
"without undue hostility to strangers, they discourage their incursions."

A GIRL OF THE CHOCO TRIBE]
“Their means of persuasion are adjusted to the importance of the
intruder. They do not hesitate to shoot at any negro of the nearby
settlements poaching on their cocoanuts or other products; the trader or
any occasional visitor is very seldom allowed to stay ashore at night;
the adventurers who try to go prospecting into Indian territory are
invariably caught and shipped back to the next Panamanian port”.
Among the men of the San Blas tribe the land held by their people is
"regarded as a sacred trust, bequeathed to them by their ancestors and to"
be handed down by them to the remotest posterity. During the early days
of the Canal project it was desired to dig sand from a beach in the San
Blas country. A small United States man-of-war was sent thither to
"broach the subject to the Indians, and the Captain held parley with the"
chief. After hearing the plea and all the arguments and promises with
which it was strengthened the old Indian courteously refused the
privilege:
"“He who made this land”, said he, “made it for Cuna-Cuna who live no"
"longer, for those who are here today and also for the ones to come. So"
it is not ours only and we could not sell it”.
"To this decision the tribe adhered, and the wishes of the aborigines"
have been respected. It has been the policy of the United States to
avoid any possibility of giving offense to the native population of the
where a girl is weaving ceaselessly. All these sounds come into the
"house as if there were no walls at all, but they are unheeded from long"
custom.
The man lies on a low bed with a fine mat spread under him for bedding.
"His wife, his grown-up children, his sister, his brother are about him,"
"for the time is short, and death comes very quickly in the East. They"
"talk to him kindly and lovingly, but they read to him no sacred books;"
they give him no messages from the world to which he is bound; they
whisper to him no hopes of heaven. He is tortured with no fears of
"everlasting hell. Yet life is sweet and death is bitter, and it is hard"
to go; and as he tosses to and fro in his fever there comes in to him an
"old friend, the headman of the village perhaps, with a white muslin"
"fillet bound about his kind old head, and he sits beside the dying man"
and speaks to him.
"'Remember,' he says slowly and clearly, 'all those things that you have"
done well. Think of your good deeds.'
"And as the sick man turns wearily, trying to move his thoughts as he is"
"bidden, trying to direct the wheels of memory, the old man helps him to"
remember.
"'Think,' he says, 'of your good deeds, of how you have given charity to"
"the monks, of how you have fed the poor. Remember how you worked and"
saved to build the little rest-house in the forest where the traveller
"stays and finds water for his thirst. All these are pleasant things, and"
"men will always be grateful to you. Remember your brother, how you"
"helped him in his need, how you fed him and went security for him till"
"he was able again to secure his own living. You did well to him, surely"
that is a pleasant thing.'
welcome it and then I would destroy it once and for all. I would enjoy
"my leave at any cost. It would become my only reality, and when it was"
over it would be a reality which I would take back to the front. I would
"hoard it and always think of it out there, so that the war would seem"
"like a dream, the end of which I could await with patience and"
resignation.
I went out to seek friends and acquaintances. I also hoped to meet some
war enthusiasts. I would tell them something about the war. How would
their theories be able to stand before my actual experiences!
I was soon disillusioned.
I dined with a wealthy kinsman. The slaughter of millions had brought
"him prosperity. He had never done any fighting except with his mouth,"
"but it is precisely that kind of fighting that infuriates the spirit,"
"engenders heroic ardour, and causes the nostrils to dilate. He was so"
"bellicose that he even desired to do some _real_ righting, not"
understanding the difference between the two. He thought of joining an
"infantry unit--the artillery were not good enough, he did not want to"
"fire at an enemy he could not see, he wanted to use the bayonet and"
murder his fellow men in hand-to-hand encounters.
I began to understand why many men I had met were glad to come back from
leave.
"I tried to dissuade him, although I felt it would do him good to see"
something of the war and he would learn a much-needed lesson. And yet I
"did not want him killed or horribly mutilated, although I knew that he"
"and those like him were alone responsible for the entire war, both at"
its origins and its continuance.
and Gaspard bade him good-night in a cheery voice as they passed him.
The doorkeeper stood and watched the pair for a minute as they left the
Square and turned down a narrow street which led to the poorer part of
"the town, and thence to the quays. He heard Gaspard's high-pitched voice"
"and shrill laughter, and, in answer, Benham's thick tones and heavy"
"shout of drunken mirth. Once or twice these sounds repeated themselves,"
then they ceased; the footsteps of the Frenchman and his companion died
"away in the distance. The doorkeeper went on his way, thinking with"
"relief that Mr. Gaspard, for all his tall talk, was more at home with a"
bottle than with a knife or a bomb.
"Notwithstanding his dissipation, Gaspard was afoot very early in the"
"morning. It was hardly light, and the deep scratch of finger-nails on"
his face--it is so awkward when drunken fools wake at the wrong
minute--attracted no attention from the few people he encountered. He
"did not give them long to look at him, for he hurried swiftly through"
"the streets, towards the quays where the ships lay loading their"
"cargoes. He seemed to have urgent business to transact down there,"
"business that would brook no delay, and that was, if one might guess"
"from his uneasy glances over his shoulder, of a private nature. With one"
"hand he held tight hold of something in his trousers pocket, the other"
"rested on his belt, hard by a little revolver. In his business it is"
necessary to be ready for everything.
"Meanwhile Mr. Benham, having no affairs to trouble him, and no more"
"business to transact, stayed where he was."
CHAPTER XIX.
"Another naked tree I would paint is the gleaming mauve-silver fig, which"
"burns its cold incandescence, tangled, like some sensitive creature"
emerged from the rock. A fig tree come forth in its nudity gleaming over
"the dark winter-earth is a sight to behold. Like some white, tangled sea"
"anemone. Ah, if it could but answer! or if we had tree-speech!"
*       *       *       *       *
"Yes, the steep valley sides become almost gorges, and there are trees."
"Not forests such as I had imagined, but scattered, grey, smallish oaks,"
"and some lithe chestnuts. Chestnuts with their long whips, and oaks with"
"their stubby boughs, scattered on steep hillsides where rocks crop out."
"The train perilously winding round, half way up. Then suddenly bolting"
"over a bridge and into a completely unexpected station. What is more,"
men crowd in--the station is connected with the main railway by a post
motor-omnibus.
An unexpected irruption of men--they may be miners or navvies or
land-workers. They all have huge sacks: some lovely saddle-bags with
rose-coloured flowers across the darkness. One old man is in full
"black-and-white costume, but very dirty and coming to pieces. The others"
wear the tight madder-brown breeches and sleeved waistcoats. Some have
"the sheepskin tunic, and all wear the long stocking cap. And how they"
smell! of sheep-wool and of men and goat. A rank scent fills the
carriage.
"They talk and are very lively. And they have mediaeval faces, _rusé_,"
"never really abandoning their defences for a moment, as a badger or a"
pole-cat never abandons its defences. There is none of the brotherliness
and civilised simplicity. Each man knows he must guard himself and his
own: each man knows the devil is behind the next bush. They have never
"And without so much as turning his head again, Grey Dumaresq walked off,"
"his head held high, neither observing nor returning the many salutes and"
bright arch glances shot at him from the lane of bystanders through
"which he needs must pass, but walking like a man in a dream, and so"
disappearing from view along the white road which led Londonwards.
Round Lord Sandford men were buzzing like bees disturbed.
"""Insolent young jackanapes!""  ""What did he mean?""  ""What was his motive"
"in such an insult?""  ""What will you do, my lord?""  ""Whither has he gone?"
"Whither will he go?""  ""Is it true that he is ruined?""  ""He has lost his"
"horse, at least. None will give him a score of guineas for the beast"
"now.""  ""How did it chance?""  ""Was it an accident?""  ""What meant he by"
"his words?""  All were pouring out these and like questions; but there"
"was none to answer them, till Lord Sandford himself spoke."
"""The fellow’s wits are gone astray,"" he cried in his loud, dominating"
"tones.  ""It is the Dumaresq blood.  Sir Hugh was just such another—mad"
"as a March hare half his time, flinging his gold to the winds, and"
"quarrelling with every man he met.  Like father, like son.  It has been"
coming on for days. I misdoubted me if ever he would ride this race. He
"came and told me he must reform.  That was ever his father’s cry, and he"
"would disappear into the country for a while, and reappear again as gay"
"as ever.  ’Tis the same with the son.  I saw it then, and I strove to"
combat the madness; but ’tis ill dealing with the lunatic.  You see what
we get for our pains!  Tush! let the fellow alone.  I did wrong to
"answer him.  Let him go his own way, and we will think of him no more."""
"And Lord Sandford, with a heavy cloud upon his brow, and a look about"
"the corners of his mouth which warned those about him to say no more,"
"but leave matters as they were, flung away from them, and made his way"
"back alone to the inn, from which he was presently seen to issue forth"
"said ""with all her own private grudge against the present ministry"
she felt _au fond_ she was _British_; she must range herself in time
"of war with her own people."""
Mrs. Warren went much farther. She was not very voluble nowadays.
The German occupation of her villa had given her a mental and
physical shock from which she never recovered. She often sat quite
silent and rather huddled at meal times and looked the old woman
now. In such a conversation as this she roused herself and her voice
"took an aggressive tone. ""My daughter write to her friends to ask"
them to obstruct the government at such a time as this? _Never!_ I'd
"disown her if she did, I'd repudiate her! She may have had her own"
"turn-up with 'em. I was quite with her there. But that, so to"
"speak, was only a domestic quarrel. We're British all through, and"
don't you forget it--sir--(she added deprecatingly): British _all
"through_ and we're goin' to beat Germany yet, _you'll_ see. The"
"British navy never _has_ been licked nor won't be, this time."""
Colonel von Giesselin did not insist. He seemed depressed himself at
"times, and far from elated at the victories announced in his own"
newspapers. He would in the dreary autumn evenings show them the
photographs of his wife--a sweet-looking woman--and his two
"solid-looking, handsome children, and talk with rapture of his home"
"life. Why, indeed, was there this War! His heart like his Emperor's"
bled for these unhappy Belgians. But it was all due to the
"Macchiavellian policy of ""Sir Grey and Asquiss."" If Germany had not"
felt herself surrounded and barred from all future expansion of
trade and influence she would not have felt forced to attack France
"and invade Belgium. Why, see! All the time they were talking,"
"barbarous Russia, egged on by England, was ravaging East Prussia!"
"Then, in other moods, he would lament the war and the policy of"
"followed Tilly were, beside these, gentle and kindly men."
'God help us!' my lady cried fervently. 'God help this great city! God
help the North! Never was such a battle fought as must be fought
here!'
"We went down very much sobered, filled with awe and wonder and"
"great thoughts, the dullest of us feeling the air heavy with portents,"
the more clerkly considering of Armageddon and the Last Fight.
Briefly--for thirteen years the Emperor and the Papists had hustled
"and harried the Protestants; had dragooned Donauwörth, and held down"
"Bohemia, and plundered the Palatinate, and crushed the King of"
"Denmark, and wherever there was a weak Protestant state had pressed"
sorely on it. Then one short year before I stood on the Burg above the
"Pegnitz, the Protestant king had come out of the North like a"
"thunderbolt, had shattered in a month the Papist armies, had run like"
"a devouring fire down the Priests' Lane, rushed over Bohemia, shaken"
the Emperor on his throne!
But could he maintain himself? That was now to be seen. To the
"Emperor's help had come all who loved the old system, and would have"
it that the south was Germany; all who wished to chain men's minds and
saw their profit in the shadow of the imperial throne; all who lived
"by license and plunder, and reckoned a mass to-day against a murder"
"to-morrow. All these had come, from the great Duke of Friedland"
"grasping at empire, to the meanest freebooter with peasant's blood on"
"his hands and in his veins; and there they lay opposite us,"
"impregnably placed on the Burgstall, waiting patiently until famine"
"and the sword should weaken the fair city, and enable them to plunge"
their vulture's talons into its vitals.
No wonder that in Nuremberg the citizens could be distinguished from
"“It's rather a mad notion, is n't it?”"
"“I don't think so at all,” replied Miss Lindon in a most disconcertingly"
matter-of-fact tone. “The only thing is that since poor papa died I've
"had so little to do with gentlemen, and have forgotten their ways."
"You see, dear, you have put me quite in a flutter. How do I know, for"
"instance, what you would like to have for breakfast? Your dear"
grandpapa used to have only one egg boiled for two minutes--he was
most particular--and a piece of dry toast; whereas I well remember
Mrs. Brownlow telling me that her husband used to eat a hearty meal of
"porridge and eggs and bacon, with an underdone beefsteak to follow. So"
"you see, dear, I have no rule which I could follow; you would have to"
tell me.”
"“That's quite a detail,” said John, rather touched by her unselfish,"
"if tangential, dealing with the proposal. “The main point is,” said he,"
"moving a step or two forward, “would you care to come and play propriety"
for me and this daughter of misery?”
“Do you really want me to?”
"“Naturally, since I 've asked you.”"
"She rose and came up to him. “My dear boy,” she said with wet eyes, “I"
"know I'm not a clever woman, and often when clever people like you talk,"
I don't in the least understand what they 're talking about; but I did
"love your dear mother with all my heart, and I would do anything in the"
wide world for her son.”
"John took her hand and looked down into her foolish, kind face, which"
wore for the moment the dignity of love. “I'm afraid it will mean an
"Perhaps, after all, my jealousy might have been utterly unfounded."
"Sometimes I had thought I had treated her harshly, for, truth to tell, I"
had never obtained absolute proof that this man was more than a mere
"acquaintance.  Indeed, I think it was this fact, or just a slight twinge"
"of conscience, that caused a suspicion of the old love I once bore her"
to remain within me.  It was not just to Edith--that I knew; yet
"notwithstanding the denunciations of both Kaye and Anderson, I could not"
altogether crush her from my heart.  To wholly forget the woman for whom
"one has entertained the grand passion is often most difficult,"
"sometimes, indeed, impossible of accomplishment.  Visions of some sweet"
"face with its pouting and ready lips will arise, constantly keeping the"
"past ever present, and recalling a day one would fain forget.  Thus it"
was with me--just as it has been with thousands of others.
"""No,"" I admitted truthfully and honestly at last, ""my love for Yolande"
"is perhaps not altogether dead."""
"""Then you will render me a service?"" she cried quickly.  ""Say that you"
"will--for her sake!--for the sake of the great love you once bore her!"""
"""Of what nature is this service you desire?""  I asked, determined to act"
"with caution, for the startling stories I had heard had aroused within"
me considerable suspicion.
"""I desire your silence regarding an absolute secret,"" she answered in a"
hoarse half-whisper.
"""What secret?"""
"""A secret concerning Yolande,"" she responded.  ""Will you, for her sake,"
"render us assistance, and at the same time preserve absolute secrecy as"
"to what you may see or learn here to-day?"""
fail to appreciate the courtesy and consideration which he consistently
"showed her now. His patience with Captain Dove, a trying companion at"
"the best of times and doubly troublesome idle, more than once made her"
wonder whether he could be the same Jasper Slyne she had known on the
_Olive Branch_. Prosperity seemed to have improved him almost beyond
recognition.
He had a cabin at her disposal on the Calais-Dover steamer but she
"stayed on deck throughout the brief passage, glad to breathe the salt"
"sea-air again, while he entertained her with descriptions of London and"
she watched the twinkling lights that were guiding her home.
"And then came London itself, at last, somewhat grey, and cold, and"
disconsolate-looking on a wet winter morning.
"But after breakfast in a cosy suite at the Savoy, a blink of sunshine"
along the Embankment helped to better that first hasty impression. And
then Slyne took Captain Dove and her in a taxicab along the thronged and
bustling Strand to Mr. Jobling's office in Chancery Lane.
They got out in front of a dingy building not very far from Cursitor
"Street. It was raining again, and Sallie, looking up and down the"
"narrow, turbid thoroughfare, felt glad that she did not need to live"
there.
"Indoors, the atmosphere was scarcely less depressing. A dismal passage"
"led toward a dark stairway, up which they had to climb flight after"
"flight to reach at last a dusty, ill-smelling, gas-lighted room,"
"inhabited only by a shabby, shock-headed hobbledehoy of uncertain age"
"and unprepossessing appearance, perched on a preposterously high stool"
"at a still higher desk, behind a cage-like partition."

"40. Where any Ship or Goods belonging to any of Her Majesty's Subjects,"
"after being taken as Prize by the Enemy, is or are retaken from the"
"Enemy by any of Her Majesty's Ships of War, the same shall be restored"
"by Decree of a Prize Court to the Owner, on his paying as Prize Salvage"
One Eighth Part of the Value of the Prize to be decreed and ascertained
"by the Court, or such Sum not exceeding One Eighth Part of the estimated"
Value of the Prize as may be agreed on between the Owner and the

"the Prize Court may, if it thinks fit, award to the Re-captors as Prize"
"Salvage a larger Part than One Eighth Part, but not exceeding in any"
"Case One Fourth Part, of the Value of the Prize."
"Provided also, that where a Ship after being so taken is set forth or"

"for Restitution shall not apply, and the Ship shall be adjudicated on as"
in other Cases of Prize.

"composed himself to sleep, his chest rising and falling with regular,"
"uninterrupted breathing. Once he smiled: he was thinking of Ned Evans,"
"the doorkeeper; then he gave himself a little shake, closed his eyes,"
"and forgot all the troubles of this weary world. So sleep children,"
"so--we are told--the just: so slept M. François Gaspard, on his way to"
seek fresh woods and pastures new.
CHAPTER XXI.
ALL THERE WAS TO TELL.
The custom in New Lindsey was that every Monday during the session of
"Parliament the Executive Council should meet at Government House, and,"
"under the presidency of the Governor, formally ratify and adopt the"
arrangements as to the business of the coming week which its members had
"decided upon at their Cabinet meetings. It is to be hoped that, in these"
"days, when we all take an interest in our Empire, everybody knows that"
"the Executive Council is the outward, visible, and recognised form of"
"that impalpable, unrecognised, all-powerful institution, the Cabinet,"
"consisting in fact, though not in theory, of the same persons, save that"
"the Governor is present when the meeting is of the Council, and absent"
"when it is of the Cabinet--a difference of less moment than it sounds,"
"seeing that, except in extreme cases, the Governor has little to do but"
"listen to what is going to be done. However, forms doubtless have their"
"value, and at any rate they must be observed, so on this Monday morning"
"the Executive Council was to meet as usual, although nobody knew where"
"the Cabinet would be that time twenty-four hours. Lady Eynesford, who"
"wanted her husband to drive her out, thought the meeting under the"
"him--namely, that the Regent and her daughter were by no means averse to"
"Holy Church, nor yet eager to keep the true King out of his own. But,"
"they were in the power of unscrupulous men--Mendizábal, Linares, and"
"others, who for their own ends published edicts and compelled the ladies"
"to sign them. If they were captured and sequestered for their own good,"
the ministry would break down and Don Carlos would reign undisturbed.
Rollo thought the exposition a marvel of clearness and point. It was
"somewhat disappointing, therefore, when he had finished to hear from"
"Cabrera the unmoved declaration: ""A Cristino is a Cristino whether in"
the palace of Madrid or on the mountains of Morella. And the quickest
"way is the best way with such an one, wherever met with!"""
"""But you do not mean to say that you would shoot the girl-Queen or the"
"mother-Regent if they fell into your hands?"" cried Rollo, aghast at the"
horror.
The deep underlying anger leaped up fiery red into the eyes of the
_guerrilla_ chief.
"""Aye, that would I,"" he cried, ""as quickly as they slew my own old"
"mother in the barrack yard of Tortosa!"""
"And thinking of that tragedy and the guilt of Nogueras, Rollo felt there"
"was something to be said for the indomitable, implacable little"
butcher-general of Don Carlos.
"Cabrera was silent for a while after making this speech, and then"
abruptly demanded of Rollo how many men he would require for his
undertaking.
"""I am bidden to place my entire command at your service,"" he said with"
USES.--Tartar emetic is too mild as an emetic in poison cases. In asthma
of dogs it may be used in from ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ grain doses to relax spasm
and promote secretion. For horses its most valuable use is to expel the
"common round worms from the intestines, for which it is very"
efficacious; given in two drachm doses once or twice daily in the feed
"for four to six days, or one-half ounce dissolved in water is given on"
an empty stomach followed by a full dose of linseed oil.
ANTIPYRINA--ANTIPYRIN
"Phenyl-hydrazine is acted upon by aceto-acetic ether, when"
"phenyl-monomethyl-pyrazolon, ethyl alcohol and water results."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, odorless, scaly crystals, of a bitterish taste."
"Soluble in water, ether and chloroform."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 3 to 4 drs.; sheep and pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 dr.;"
"dogs, 5 to 20 grs."
"ACTIONS.--Powerful antipyretic, anodyne and local anesthetic,"
"antiseptic, cardiac depressant; it reduces temperature very quickly,"
usually within half an hour and the effects continue two or more hours.
"It can be administered by the mouth, hypodermically or intertracheally;"
"as an antiseptic it diminishes oxidation, and promotes heat loss by"
"dilating the cutaneous vessels, but more probably by depressing the"
activity of the calorifacient centers.
of gloom. Stars flickered in the heavens; the moon came and enveloped
the trees with silver flame. A primeval calm lay heavy upon the bosom
of the night. The spectral branches of the trees pointed rigid and
motionless towards the sky.
Francesco had left the duke gazing out upon the shimmering sea. The
voice called to him from the woods with plaintive peals of song. The
"man followed it, holding to a grass-grown track that curled at random"
into the gloom. Moonlight and shadow lay alternate upon his armor.
Hope and despair battled in his face. His soul leaped voiceless and
inarticulate into the darkened shrine of prayer.
The voice came to him clearer in the forest calm. The gulf had
"narrowed, the words flew as over the waters of Death. They were pure,"
"yet meaningless, passionate, yet void; words barbed with an utter"
"pathos, that silenced desire."
"For an hour Francesco roamed in the woods, drawing ever nearer, the"
fear in him increasing with every step. Anon the voice failed him by a
little stream that quivered dimly through the grass. A stillness that
was ghostly held the woods. The moonlight seemed to shudder on the
trees. A stupendous silence weighed upon the world.
"A hollow glade opened suddenly in the woods, a white gulf in a forest"
"gloom. Water shone there, a mere rush-ringed and full of mysterious"
"shadows, girded by the bronzed foliage of a thousand oaks. Moss grew"
"thick about the roots, dead leaves covered the grass."
"And ever and anon a dead leaf dropped silently to earth, like a hope"
that has died on the Tree of Life.
Francesco knelt in a patch of bracken and looked out over the glades.
"me--may the Devil take him!"""
(ANDREYEFF.)
Throughout the winter one question above all others was discussed by the
"few who took an interest in the war: ""What were the Germans going to"
"do?"" It was clear that they had been able to withdraw many divisions"
from their Eastern Front. Would they be numerically equal or superior to
the Allies on the Western Front?
"On the whole we were of opinion that, whatever happened, our positions"
"would prove impregnable, although we observed with some astonishment"
that there were no extensive trench systems or fortified places behind
our lines. I doubted whether the Germans would even attempt to break
through--I thought they would merely hold the Western Front and throw
"the Allies out of Macedonia, Palestine, and Mesopotamia."
The winter was over and the fine weather had set in. For several months
we had been working in a wood-yard and saw-mills. Our lives had become
"unspeakably monotonous, but the coming of warm days banished much of our"
dreariness. The hazy blue sky was an object of real delight. I often
contrived to slip away from my work and lean idly against a wall in the
mild sunshine. At times I was so filled with the sense of physical
"well-being, and so penetrated by the sensuous enjoyment of warmth and"
"colour, that I even forgot the war."
"At the bottom of the wood-yard was a little stream, and on the far bank"
clusters of oxlips were in bloom. Here we would lie down during the
midday interval and surrender to the charm of the spring weather. It
"seemed unnatural and almost uncanny that we should be happy, but there"
"were moments when we felt something very much like happiness. Moreover,"
"By a window at the end of the passage, one could see, far away, the"
"Alban Hills, looking like a blue mountain-range, half hidden in white"
"haze, and nearby one could see the trees in the Protestant cemetery and"
the pyramid of Caïus Cestius close to them.
"Cæsar felt a sort of deep repugnance for the people shut up here,"
remote from life and protected from it by a lot of things.
“The man who is playing the harmonium in this church with its opaque
"light, is a coward,” he said to himself. “One must live and struggle in"
"the open air, among men, in the midst of their passions and hatreds,"
even though one’s miserable nerves quiver and tremble.”
"After showing them the monastery, the abbot Hildebrand took them to his"
"study, where he worked at revising ancient translations of the Bible. He"
had photographic copies of all the Latin texts and he was collating them
with the original.
"They talked of the progress of the Church, and the abbot commented with"
"some contempt on the worldly success of the Jesuit churches, with their"
saints who serve as well to get husbands and rich wives as to bring
winning numbers in the lottery.
"Before going out, they went to a window, at the other end of the"
corridor from where they had looked out before. Below them they could
"see the Tiber as far as the Ripa harbour; opposite, the heights of the"
"Janiculum, and further, Saint Peter’s."
"When they went out, Kennedy said to Cæsar:"
"“What devilish effect has the abbey produced in you, that you are so"
much gayer than when we went in?”
"upon you."""
"""Your remarks, Cary,"" I observed, ""are deficient in tact. You might,"
"at least, pretend to believe that my personal charm has won for me"
"Dawson's affection. As a matter of fact, he cares not a straw for my"
_beaux yeux_; his motives are crudely selfish. He thinks that it is in
"my power to contribute to the greater glory of Dawson, and he"
cultivates me just as he would one of his show chrysanthemums. He has
"done me the honour to appoint me his biographer extraordinary."""
"""I am sure you are wrong,"" cried Cary. ""He was most frightfully angry"
about that story of ours in _Cornhill_. He demanded from me your name
"and address, and swore that if I ever again disclosed to you official"
secrets he would proceed against me under the Defence of the Realm
"Act. He was a perfect terror, I can assure you."""
"""And yet he always carries that story about with him in his"
breast-pocket; he has summoned me here to see him at his work; and you
have been commanded to tell me everything which you know! My dear
"Cary, do not be an ass. You are too simple a soul for this rather"
"grubby world. In your eyes every politician is an ardent,"
"disinterested patriot, and every soldier or sailor a knightly hero of"
"romance. Human beings, Cary, are made in streaks, like bacon; we have"
"our fat streaks and our lean ones; we can be big and bold, and also"
very small and mean. Your great man and your national hero can become
"very poor worms when, so to speak, they are off duty. But I didn't"
"come here, at great inconvenience, to talk this sort of stuff at"
midnight. Go ahead; give me the details of this sabotage case which is
baffling Dawson and the naval authorities; let me hear about the
"cutting of those electric wires."""
"""It is, as I told you, in my note, a queer business. The _Antinous_, a"
within the posterior axillary line. The whole right side of the
"chest was dull, with signs of the presence of fluid, the heart"
being displaced to the left. There was considerable distress;
"the respirations averaged 40, the pulse 100, and the"
temperature reached 101.5° the first evening after arrival.
On the nineteenth day the thorax was aspirated (Mr. Hanwell)
"and 50 ounces of dirty red-coloured fluid, half clot, half"
"serum, were evacuated. Considerable relief was afforded; the"
respirations became slightly less frequent; the heart returned
"to a normal position, and distant tubular respiration was"
audible. The temperature dropped to normal the third day after
"evacuation of the fluid, but on the sixth day it again"
"commenced to rise, and meanwhile fluid again began to collect."
On the twenty-sixth day a second aspiration resulted in the
evacuation of 35 ounces of bloody fluid in which flakes of
lymph were found. Three days later the temperature became
"normal. The respirations fell to 22, and the patient made an"
uninterrupted recovery.

They were now in the midst of the great wilderness. On all sides
"myriads of trees, interminably pillared; through their tops the wind"
sighed and pined like the soft breath of a sleeping world. Away on
"every hand stretched oblivious vistas, black under multitudinous green"
spires.
"The interminable trees seemed to vex the duke's spirit, as their"
trunks crowded the winding track and seemed to shut in the twain as
"with a never ending barrier. And behind them, with the muffled tread"
"of a phantom army, came the duke's armed array striding through the"
night.
"""Have you too suffered a wrong at the hands of the Frangipani?"""
"Francesco at last broke the silence, turning to his companion."
The latter jerked the bridle of his charger so viciously that the
terrified animal reared on its haunches and neighed in protest.
"""Man, know you whereof you speak?"" the duke snarled, as he came closer"
"to Francesco. ""He has made the one woman the Duke of Spoleto ever"
"loved--a wanton!""--"
They pushed uphill through the solemn shadows of the forest. A sound
like the raging of a wind through a wood came down to them faintly
"from afar. It was a sullen sound, deep and mysterious as the hoarse"
"babel of the sea, smitten through with the shrill scream of trumpets,"
like the cry of gulls above a storm. Yet in the aisles of the pine
forest it was still as death.
"Then, like a spark struck from flint and steel falling upon tinder, a"
red glare blazed out against the background of the night. A horn
"blared across the moorlands; the castle bell began to ring, jerkily,"
"(170*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1/2 inch to"
"the left of the second sacral spine; _exit_, immediately below"
the left anterior superior iliac spine; the patient was
"kneeling at the time, and the same bullet traversed his left"
"thigh in the lower third. When seen on the third day, the"
"lower part of the abdomen was motionless, tumid, and tender."
The bowels had been confined for three days; there had been no
"sickness, and the tongue was moist and clean. Temperature 100°,"
"pulse 90, fair strength, respirations 38. The patient had once"
"had an attack of acute appendicitis, and he himself said he was"
"sure he now had 'peritonitis,' as he had pain exactly similar"
in the belly to that he had suffered in his previous illness.
"No further signs, however, developed under an expectant"
"treatment, and he remained some two months in hospital, while"
the wound in the thigh and a third injury to the elbow-joint
were healing.
"(171) _Entry_ (Mauser), at the highest point of the left crista"
"ilii; _exit_, through the right ilium, 2 inches horizontally"
anterior to the posterior superior spine. Absolutely no
abdominal symptoms followed. The bowels were confined five
"days, and then opened by enema. The patient complained of some"
"stiffness in the lumbo-sacral region, but the right"
synchondrosis was no doubt implicated in the track.
(172) Wounded at Paardeberg (range 800 yards). _Entry_
"(Mauser), 2 inches diagonally below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus; _exit_, not discoverable. For the first two days the"
patient had to lie out with the regiment; on the fourth he was
removed to the Field hospital. During the first three days the
"patient vomited (green matter) frequently, and the belly was"
the room where it was lying.  If she had not been ordered to give up
"nursing, that struggle would never have come.  Her heart ached, but a"
demon pressed her on and past the door.  Downstairs she just pottered
"round, dusting her china, putting in order the books which, after"
"house-cleaning, the maid had arranged almost too carefully, so that the"
first volumes of Dickens and Thackeray followed each other on the top
"shell, and the second volumes followed each other on the bottom shelf."
And all the time she thought dully: 'Why am I doing this?  What do I care
how the place looks?  It is not my home.  It can never be my home!'
"For lunch she drank some beef tea, keeping up the fiction of her"
"indisposition.  After that, she sat down at her bureau to write."
"Something must be decided!  There she sat, her forehead on her hand, and"
nothing came--not one word--not even the way to address him; just the
"date, and that was all.  At a ring of the bell she started up.  She could"
"not see anybody!  But the maid only brought a note from Aunt Rosamund,"
"and the dogs, who fell frantically on their mistress and instantly began"
"to fight for her possession. She went on her knees to separate them, and"
"enjoin peace and good-will, and their little avid tongues furiously"
licked her cheeks. Under the eager touch of those wet tongues the band
round her brain and heart gave way; she was overwhelmed with longing for
her baby. Nearly a day since she had seen her--was it possible?  Nearly a
day without sight of those solemn eyes and crinkled toes and fingers! And
"followed by the dogs, she went upstairs."
"The house was invisible from the music-room; and, spurred on by thought"
"that, until Fiorsen knew she was back, those two might be there in each"
"other's arms any moment of the day or night, Gyp wrote that evening:"
"""DEAR GUSTAV,--We are back.--GYP."""
What else in the world could she say?  He would not get it till he woke
"determining to get on, but uneasy at the expense, for monetary conditions"
"were ever more embarrassed. At home, she practised steadily and worked"
hard at composition. She finished several songs and studies during the
"spring and summer, and left still more unfinished.  Monsieur Harmost was"
"tolerant of these efforts, seeming to know that harsh criticism or"
"disapproval would cut her impulse down, as frost cuts the life of"
"flowers.  Besides, there was always something fresh and individual in her"
things.  He asked her one day:
"""What does your husband think of these?"""
Gyp was silent a moment.
"""I don't show them to him."""
She never had; she instinctively kept back the knowledge that she
"composed, dreading his ruthlessness when anything grated on his nerves,"
"and knowing that a breath of mockery would wither her belief in herself,"
"frail enough plant already.  The only person, besides her master, to whom"
she confided her efforts was--strangely enough--Rosek.  But he had
"surprised her one day copying out some music, and said at once: ""I knew."
"I was certain you composed.  Ah, do play it to me!  I am sure you have"
"talent.""  The warmth with which he praised that little ""caprice"" was"
"surely genuine; and she felt so grateful that she even played him others,"
"and then a song for him to sing.  From that day, he no longer seemed to"
"her odious; she even began to have for him a certain friendliness, to be"
"a little sorry, watching him, pale, trim, and sphinx-like, in her"
"drawing-room or garden, getting no nearer to the fulfilment of his"
"desire.  He had never again made love to her, but she knew that at the"
least sign he would.  His face and his invincible patience made him
pathetic to her.  Women such as Gyp cannot actively dislike those who
admire them greatly.  She consulted him about Fiorsen's debts.  There
Don't you remember about going to the beach?
"Arrizaga, Alonso, Adbinu, Arza..."
I still know it!
"No, please, don't name the whole list."
-Arostegui...
Arostegui comes before Arza!
You're right.
I'm sure I couldn't recognize any of them.
"Arostegui, Arza, De Blas..."
I remember a lot of soccer team lineups.
The Italian one was beautiful.
"Lupo, Taviani, Becattini,.."
"Estébanez, Estremianas..."
Who were the next to Estremianas?
Alcón!
Maybe I know the class list better!
What time is it?
It's 12:15.
-I haven't called Laura yet.
Be right back.
Julian and I were close friends.
"When you're young, you meet friends everyday and then they vanish."
Don't you get bored with our silliness?
-No.
How long didn't you guys see each other?
We met by coincidence the other day.
Apart from that...
Maybe 10 years or more...
You also named that list back then?
I hope not.
The last thing I remember is we were really drunk.
At dawn we decided to look for an old mutual girlfriend.
Marrakech.
I need two thousand dollars.
Listen to me.
I brought some people to see you.
Look.
I got these pieces.
They're good pieces Marcus.
Indiana!
"Yes the museum will buy them as usual, no questions asked - yes they are nice."
They are worth at least the price for a ticket to Marrakech.
But the people I brought are important - they are waiting.
What people?
The army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
Wouldn't tell me what they want.
What do I want to see them for?
What am I
- In trouble?
"Yes, Dr. Jones."
We have heard a great deal about you.
Have you?
"Professor of archaeology, expert on the occult."
"And uh, how does one say it - obtainer of rare antiquities."
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You would be more comfortable.
"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
"And you studied under Professor Ravenwood, at the University of Chicago?"
"Yes, I did."
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
"Ah, just rumors really."
Mine is not the only heart you harbor
And I love America
God!
Can she be cruel...
"Hi, Joce!"
What's wrong?
I just had the worst day!
I don't know how much more of this crap I can take.
"I've been there for hours, re-acessorizing the bulletin boards."
How is the hottie?
So completely taken.
"It's hopeless, Josie."
It's completely hopeless.
I'm beginning to think I'll never get on staff... and my summer money is running low.
Look on the bright side:
You are the star of public television.
They are running your office tour again... for the fifth time this week.
They must have it on a loop.
- Come here.
- I'm horrified!
Hey did you see that?
She was coming out of the fax room.
So?
She never sends her own faxes.
What's the big deal?
Maybe she had something to do in the fax room.
So what I'm thinking.
I'm loving this tone.
"Tone for a just, isn't it genious?"
It's good she does LOB ingenious...
I'll have her messenger over some for me.
Vuitton Gellys is planning a hostile takeover of Fava.

"Full-power acceleration from orbit, Mr. Scott."
"Full power, sir."
"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment,"
Mr. Sulu.
"Standing by to warp, sir."
Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command?
Not yet.
They may trace our beam.
Wait until we're well out of range.
"Can we know his range, Captain?"
We can take an educated guess-- at the point we entered their solar system.
Still no sign of pursuit.
"Instruments clear, sir."
Good.
May I take a moment to change?
"Yes, I think you might."
Turn in your glass slippers.
The ball is over.
"Gladly, Captain."
Hard to believe that it ever happened.
"Captain, we're about to warp."
Large body ahead.
Collision course.
"Hard to port, Mr. Sulu."
"That was the planet Gothos, Captain."
Gothos!
Have we been going in circles?
No.
All instruments show on-course.
Gothos again.
Hard over.
what?
What the fuck?
That's my car!
Stop!
Stop the car!
"Stop, you bastard!"
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Stop!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Let me go!

I'm looking for my father.
Is he a patient here...?
Yeah...

Do you know where he is...?

But it's restricted...

WELCOME TO THE LABOR MARKET
Any idea where they may have gone?
Did you argue about anything?
Notice anything missing?
"A bankbook, for their savings account."
And clothing.
Do you know why your daughters wanted to leave?
My daughters didn't want to go anywhere.
Did anyone want to hurt them?
"- Any money, anything valuable?"
- Do you know why you're here?
- To find your daughters.
- No one gives a shit about them.
You're here because her cousin served with Judge Andrade.
So skip the song and dance and just find them.
- Lunch.
- I'm coming.
I found it in the brazier.
Please don't tell my husband.
If he finds out he'll kill them.
They've already brought him enough shame.
- Were they with anyone?
- They were alone.
- Did you talk to them?
- They were far away.
- We were with them after that.
- Where?
"At the bumper cars for a while, then we went home."
- What time was it?
- Midnight.
- I know because we had to go.
- Where did you leave them?
Lift to the side of the arm.
"Bend your knee, exert force using the waist, thus lowering the center of gravity."
"Try again, okay?"
Hey.
Can't you be more gentle?
Practicing on it now.
Where exactly are you looking at?
Acting in such a perverted manner.
Pervert?
I'm really speechless.
"I'll see you on Thanksgiving, you set a date."
Tell me honestly...
"It's your first kiss, right?"
What did you say?
Are you not speaking formally anymore?
"Listening to the President's introduction, it seems you're younger than me."
Instructors should teach students to be honorable.
But it did not work.
Dr. Lee.
I'm not sure...
"You saw it, right?"
Completely defeated.
What defeated?
She fell on her own account.
She tripped that's why she fell.
I thought you flipped her.
Come don't pretend you're in pain.
Hurry get up.
I'm not pretending to be in pain.
Dr. Lee.
"At that time, that woman."
Where is she?
Fantastic.
Thank you.
Yeah.
"So, it's almost 3:00."
Are you still going to give that lecture on emergency C-Sections?
"Oh gosh, no."
I have a date with Riley.
Could you cover for me?
Really?
Do you think I'm qualified to?
"Sara, I think you show great promise as an obstetrician."
"Oh, my God."
Thank you so much.

"A glass of sherry wine, sir?"
No.
"No, thanks."
"Well, would you consider a letter from Monte Carlo, sir?"
- I'll take the sherry wine too.
"- Yes, sir."
"Miss Beatrix should be returning home soon now, shouldn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, Poole."
Hobson was telling me that they were expected.
"Bad news, sir?"
Miss Beatrix and her father are going to Aix-les-Bains.
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
"Sir Charles' health, no doubt?"
"Yes, yes."
"Yes, Sir Charles' health, no doubt."

It isn't right.

"Very comical, you know, sir."
"And very daring, if you follow my meaning, sir."

"Quite so, sir."

"Thanks for the pay, sir."
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Here.
"What's the idea, governor?"
"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir."
"- Just have fun, baby, that's all that counts."
"So, Mom, I was thinking about what you said last night."
About not giving up?
- Right.
- And I think I want the surgery.
Try to repair the nerve damage.
Ok.
Um...
The doctor said that it's a difficult and complex procedure.
"And if things don't go as hoped, your hand could actually get worse."
"Yeah, I mean, she said there's a chance of that."
"She also said that if the surgery did cause damage, that it could... it could actually be permanent."
You've got almost 95 percent function now.
That's better than the doctors even hoped.
"But if I'm gonna play piano, though, I need 100 percent."
So I'd like to give it a shot.
- So we agreed?
You're good?
- Yeah.
It's the right call.
- Ok.
- Ok.
- I'll let Brandon know.
- Ok.
"Oh, and tell him if he wants to come by, that, you know, I'm here."
- I will.
- Ok.
Gotta hit the shower.
- Let yourself out?
- Yeah.
Thanks a lot for letting me barge in like this.
Appreciate it.

Okay.

Morton:
No.
"Oh, I missed that."
(wiart speaking)
Ooh.
Right.
"We've already found a lot of things just by, like, stopping for a few seconds."
Morton:
One of the reasons a lot of these drugs
"Probably haven't been found is 'cause, first of all,"
"It's hard to find the plants, because they're in the fucking jungle,"
And you got to come here and get into the jungle.
"And then, second of all, you'd expect new antibiotics"
To look like the craziest plants in the jungle.
"It'd be like weird, rare orchids that you have to,"
"You know, climb a mountain and snip."
"But they're not, they just look like this."
You have to really know what you're looking for to find stuff
That could be potentially useful.
"So, the thrill of the find is a plant that looks"
"Exactly like this, but slightly different."

Are Ogami-sama's orders.
Even if he says so....
Hotoke-san is praying for mercy.
Don't worry.
Ogami-sama will give us a quick answer...
I'm sure it will send us armed troops.
Help!
Well...
In this town... there's nothing left to take.
In that case we shouldn't be helping wandering samurais...
That demon... could be a white bear?
"No, its 10 feet tall, and it's a red big monster, demon like."
A monster...
We are begging you to help us.
"Exterminate the demon, please!"
"Since then, that demon, night after night keeps coming..."
"Kidnaps young girls, and destroys everything,"
"Already in this town, that's the only girl left."
We are not able to hold that girl any longer.
There's nothing to do.
No one can match with that thing...
Kao!
"O-samurai-sama, I beg you!"
"In the name of God and Buddah, we depend on you, Samurai-sama."
A bear!
There's nothing to do... nothing to do...
A demon came.
Save me... please...

That's great.

You'll be a hero.
You'll live better here than most people outside.
Some deal!
Alive.
Pentangeli is alive.
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth.
"He engineered it, Michael."
When Frankie went to make a deal with the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.
He thought you double-crossed him.
"Our people with the detectives said he was half dead, scared and shouted that you'd turned on him."
"They already had him on possession, bookmaking, murder one and more."
The FBI has him airtight.
"He's on an army base, 24 hour guards."
We can't get to him.
You've opened yourself to five counts of perjury.
What about Fredo?
What does he know?
"He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him."
"Roth, he played this one beautifully."
I'm going to talk to Fredo.
"I haven't got a lot to say, Mike."
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark.
I didn't know all that much.
What about now?
Is there anything you can help me out with?
Anything you can tell me now?
How beautiful it is!
You like it?
I haven't seen such a lovely house in my life.
This is the world's most beautiful house.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
I feel like...
"Believe me, Mr Ravi, you won't find a better building contractor than myself in the whole of Bombay."
All right.
You go with my secretay and check out my vacant plot at Juhu.
And build a house for me.
Exactly like this.
How long will it take to build it?
- Say around 6 months.
Make it as soon as possible.
Don't wory about the money.
"Ifthat's the case, I'll show you better designs than this."
"I just want this design, Mr. Malkhani."
Because this is the world's most beautiful home.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
"I get it, Mr Ravi."
You are strange!
Where are you?
Can't even get to see you at the Gym.
Nothing as such.
- Who was he?
An architect.
Why?
What for?
I am building a house.
- A house?
What's wrong with this?
I have travelled much.
Are you okay?
I mean...
"- Yeah, no, yeah."
- Okay.
All right.
"- So, have you..."
"- Um, yes?"
- ... bartended before?
"- I have, I've bartended a lot, actually."
"The last, I was in Greece, I worked at a taverna for a while in Athens, Greece."
"And then I did a little bit of bartending in Mykonos, 'cause I was there, and I bartended in"
"Chicago at a little club, but I hated the manager."
I'm not gonna give you his reference.
I hated his guts.
I actually took his keys and I threw them in the snow 'cause I knew he wouldn't find them 'til the springtime.
I just couldn't stand that guy.
"I mean, I know I shouldn't be telling you that, 'cause here I am trying to get a job, but..."
"And then I've been everywhere but pretty much, like, North and South Dakota,"
I've never been.
"But I love Black Hills Gold, so I should go there one day, right?"
Are you all right?
You look--
- I've had a tough day.
- Oh.
"I'm sorry, let me just.."
"God, it's driving me crazy, your eyes are, like, soaking wet."
"They're, like, soaking wet."
Do you have an allergy problem or something?
- Um.
"- Look, Iâm gonna just go like this."
- Okay.
- And you're just gonna breathe.
Do you believe in prayer?
Not really.
Neither do I.
My dad always prays.
So does mine.
Do you wanna try it?
Try praying'?
Okay.
How is he?
Still dying.
"Well, you've almost mastered another skill, though."
That's good.
Foreman's biopsy results.
Non-specific signs of inflammation.
That's it?
We also swabbed for staph.
Negative.
He's not even a carrier.
"Well, at least foreman was wrong too."
"Yeah, there's that."
Can I go to joe's apartment now?
No.
Go back to the lab.
Start retesting all the samples that foreman collected.
For what?
Everything.
"Bacteria, toxins, fungus."
Anything that likes to feast on brain.
That's thousands of... better hurry.
"Cameron, suit up."
You're gonna monitor foreman.
He's on to hand contractures.
"Hide yourselves, wait for my sign, then use your knives."
Right.
[Sanye] Hold it!
So you're Lun Sanye.
Uh sure.
"Truly, brother, I'm sorry I didn't meet you when you first arrived in this place."
Sorry. (Laughing)
"Yeah, but you sent your men to come and meet me, and I'm grateful."
"Ah, it was nothing."
Maybe there was a mistake there.
Wanna come to my house?
Please?
Please. (Chuckling)
"Sit down, sit down."
"Uh, what are you called?"
Jeng-Ko Cheng.
I'm a police officer from Shandong.
I'm here to arrest you.
You see?
For these 19 crimes.
"Ah, never mind."
I really shouldn't have made you come all this way to arrest me.
I'll go quickly with you.
Well then?
What do you say?
"Ah, you are a government officer, right?"
So what?
(laughing)
"When you get promoted to officer rank, or you've been arranged to become police commissioner, how much money do you think you'll make each month?"
"Working for government, money's not important."
"Ah, let's not talk so foolishly."
We can be good friends.
Why did you run away then?
In time for the promotion.
There were only two of us:
"I, with 30 years of experience in the field."
And this kid from the academy.
It was full of extensions.
Artificially intelligent implants and so on.
There could only be one of us.
We treat it the same way.
Or your way.
"I guess the manager was probably good, so..."
Trajan son of a bitch...
Trajan became the new commander.
And I...
I was thrown out of this garbage.
Trajan?
General Trajan?
General?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, that suits you."
I always knew that son of a bitch would come up easily.
"At that moment he was so deep in the ass of his superiors,"
"I could smell, what they had for breakfast."
Duty calls!
That's where I meet the Noids right there.
Make sure you go straight.
The 306 cartridges you have.
"I do not want to have lead poisoning,"
Before it's all over here.
Too small for a humanoid.
Who you are?
- Shit!
Kix!
GIBBS:
"Ziva, take Elliott with you."
Come on.
(whispers):
Game show host.
Did you see that?
Is she serious about this whole game show host thing?
"Oh, the doc does not mess around when it comes to peoples' personality traits."
Gibbs smiled at her.
I saw it.
And the way he walked to the elevator-- it was...
It was what?
Bouncy.
Gibbs' walk definitely had a bounce to it.
"Yeah, happy feet."
I saw it.
Feet are the most honest part of a human's body.
"Eyes are not bad indicators, as well."
I saw Ryan's dilate when Gibbs walked into her office the other day.
"So, what do you think this means?"
"Oh, interest, excitement, you know."
It's a neurovascular response.
"The fact is, the only one who knows what a person is thinking is the person who's thinking it."
I thought you PsyOps agents could interpret everything.
No.
"And even if we could, we wouldn't tell you."
Mm.
"So, Dr. Ryan-- is she...?"
The best.
The annoying big sister I never had.
"I'd do anything for her, and if Gibbs hurts her, I'll kill him."

"Oh, easily."
"I tore a hole into the fabric of your dimension with my Interplanar Portal Pal, patent pending."

- What are you doing?
We're gonna eat your brain!
"Now, now, now, there will be plenty of time for brain-eating after we conquer Earth."
[Wails]
"And to conquer said Earth, I will need an invincible army."
A million superhuman soldiers marching to the tune of my big drum.
"Which is why I shall clone the mighty, blue Tick!"
- Clone the Tick?
"- Oh, yes."
Your superhero friend has all the attributes I require.
"Incredible strength, nigh invulnerability, and a teeny-tiny little brain."
Eat brain!
Lmagine a legion of Ticks at my command.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, yes!"
"And when my army is complete,"
I will rule the world!
And eat lots of brains!
"Fresh, tasty brains!"
[Both laugh]

Oh.
Ahem.
"Uh, are we bothering you?"
No.

"Paul, have you got the keys?"
"- You're not going yet, are you?"

Better get some sleep.
We've both got a big day tomorrow.
Don't tell me you've forgotten our little arrangement.
I'll see you at six minutes past ten.

It was great.

Sweet dreams.

The guy is sitting at a table with Paul Anka and he goes light?
"I was wondering if you have an address, phone number, last name."
He robbed one of our guests.
"Oh, you gotta be- Oh, I am so sorry."
"No, it's not your fault, but I was just wondering if maybe you could help me find him."
He was just a fill-in.
He was referred to me by one of my clients.
"You know Pomona, dancer at the Rhino?"
"No, Stan, I don't."
You don't?
She was here just yesterday.
"I don't know her, but maybe you can tell me a little bit about her."
She lives in Henderson.
I got her in zero coupon bonds.
She just got herself a new Mustang convertible.
I want to-
"And for what it's worth, if you ever see her, uh, they're real."
Whoa.
I want an address.
All right.
"You got it, boss."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Thank you.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- I want that man fired.
- I'm not sure we can do that.
Says who?
Fired for what?
He's cost this hotel a lot of money.
Let me tell you about something that'll cost a lot more.
It's called a wrongful termination suit.

"What do I gotta do, fight my way back in?"
Come on!
And you won't say why you came back and gave yourself up?
You know what it means.
"What is this, a guessing game?"
"According to rules, it means the book and the Hole, but not for me."
I only came back for the weekend.
"You made it out once, Stacey, but you'll never do it again."
We'll see how it works out.
"Now, do I get that plush-lined cell in solitary, or don't I?"
All right.
Everything set for the break?
Yeah.
You coming in with us or not?
"I don't love life much, but I don't hate it enough to stick my head in front of a screw's bullet."

"Well, those are all valid questions, but they're not for you and I to discuss, so..."
Why not?
Why?
Because.
"In here, we talk about you."
Right?

"and your choices and, lo and behold, your list."
But I can't just ignore what's happening to him.
"Kai, he has no one."
"I feel responsible, and so should you."
"I mean, you let Dr. Fred send me to his future for a reason."
Yes.
I did.
"And, you know, it's a decision that I've since come to regret."
"Well, then why did you agree?"
"Because I thought that it would help you, that it might provide for you some useful, you know, perspective."
"But instead, you've gotten completely caught up in his life."
He hoped that I may help you fill it some how.
How are you going to do that?
I'm an interior decorator.
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
He said that was your choice.
That you had described exactly who you wanted.
So you work for him?
No.
Mr. sawamato is my god-father.
"So who is he, Vic?"
We don't know yet.
Don't know yet?
"That's very impressive, Vic."
"We're spread a little thin right now, dino."
"Yeah, right."
Shit.
What's this I hear about you and carmine settling down?
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"A house, what like this house?"
"No, not like this."
What's wrong with this house?
"Oh come on, huh?"
I don't need anything big.

Do you think I need fourteen bedrooms?
Do you think I need eight rooms to take a shit in?

I was able to see you as a Master.

The uncharacteristic lack of verbal abuse was troubling me.
look here...
Am I going to have to lay down the law?
You want to sleep in my room?
Of course.
To prevent a repeat of last night's error
I shall sleep in your room.
Surely you have no objections?
I do!
Big ones!
When it comes down to it it's your fault for falling victim to remote hypnosis from such a great distance.
I cannot protect you from Caster's magic so it's natural that I at least stay in the same room.

All right.
I'll have you sleep nearby.
Good.
Hi.
I'm Michael Gallant from Psychiatry.
Stella Willits from Ohio.
Nice shiner.
I understand you have quite a few medical complaints.

I've been thinking about going on the Zone.
- How about dry skin?
- Like the Sahara.

Give me this.
"""Intolerance to cold."" Yes. ""Arthritis, sore muscles, constipation."" Yes, yes, and yes."

You have some delayed relaxation from the deep-tendon reflexes.
What about depression?
- Me?
- Yeah.
"No, I'm glass-half-full, I'm silver-lining girl."
I'm an optimist.
"Listen, I'll be back to finish."
I guess I do get a little blue sometimes.
Get this gurney out of the way.
"If you haven't talked to anyone, you need to go back to the nurse in Triage."
Your food poisoning in Exam 4's been here for 11 hours-
- Waiting on a consult.
- From the Naked Chef?
He ate bad shrimp.
- Can I get something for my skin?
"- Yeah, sun block."
Can I talk about Stella Willits?
"I know it hurts, Jenny."
You'll get through this.
Just give it time.
"- Maybe you should go lie down, okay?"
- Okay.
Come on.
How was your thing with the counselor?
Useless.
Jesus.
"So what are we thinking here, human kill or Fae on Fae?"
Don't know yet.
"I kept it out of the human system to be safe, but the wife's missing."
"Hale, where's the head?"
- Not here.
- What do you think did this?
Something went through those bones without too much fuss.
- And interrupted the poor man's dinner.
- Yeah.
"Hey, you think it was a misadventure with the electric carving knife?"
"Yeah, I'll just call the cleaners."
Any witnesses?
All we have is the text that you got from Samir's own cell phone.
Anonymous.
Not that anonymous.
"So Olivia ran out of the house, crazy as a loon and I found Samir, no head."
"Oh, and Jenny's upstairs sleeping."
Did Olivia have the weapon?
- I didn't notice.
- Did she have the head?
- I don't know.
Was it not there?
- No.
We dominated the department

"Uh, what do you want in Hillie's room?"
"Well, I need-- I need a dress to bury her in."
Do you have any suggestions?
Her favorite was the blue dress with the bow on the back.
"You loved her, didn't you?"
"- Uh, everybody loved Hillie."
- But... you loved her a little more.

"All alone, a drifter with no one to love."
That's what's missing from my life-- someone to love.
"Mr. Truesdale's son, Greg, asked me to a picnic today."
He is so cute.
"He turned my camera on me, and I can't believe how silly I acted."

Mrs. Dashwood.
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.
"My brother, Edward Ferrars."
Do sit down.
Where is Miss Margaret?
I'm beginning to doubt of her existence.
"Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars."
My youngest is shy of strangers at present.

- You told Serena you love me.
- Serena heard wrong.
"Last year, you told Nate."
"This year, you told Serena."
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is Gossip Girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip Girl can be right about you all she wants.
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
"Chuck Bass, I love you."
"I love you so much, it consumes me."
I love you.
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me.
"That everything we've done, all the gossip and the lies, and the hurt will have been for something."
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
How'd it go with Dr. Klein?
"- Oh, fine."
Fine.
Good.
Any change since your last physical?
No.
Everything's
- Everything's fine.
"Oh, great."
"You want a drink before dinner, honey?"
[Clicks Tongue] No.
"Well, there's some fruit, if you wanna munch."
"No, uh"
- No munching.
"Bob, is"
- Is there something you're not telling me?
"Well, I just have to go on a little diet."
I have to start counting the calories and... try to get rid of that.
"Oh, that?"
"Honey, that's just a little happy fat."
I think it's cute.
[Chuckles]
"Emily, fat isn't cute unless you're nine months old and you're playing with a Busy Box."
"Well, it shouldn't be hard to lose three or four pounds."
"- Uh, eight pounds."
- Eight?
"Well, I know you can do it, and I'll help you every step of the way, Bob."
I'll help you every inch of the way.
"Emily, uh, why are you making such a big thing about eight pounds?"
"Well, eight pounds are not easy to lose."
"Well, they are for me, once I set my mind to it."
"- Uh, w-what's that?"
Be careful.
Means you are not shooting me?
I had to shoot.
But not with gud with boom.
Make a boom which blast.
"Bring the beg like he put in that locker, and we will put boom in it."
And after that we will exchange there bags.
Then we will have 900000/-.
And he will have the boom.
And by pressing the remote.
How can i do this.
I don't know how to press the remote.
He is big rascal.
He is trashing him with boom to have his money.
You stuff has also trash by him.
Should i shoot him right here?
Will we trash him in his style.
Means with boom?
Yeah.
And now there is no tension of getting same to same bag.
Really Bhai you have.
What?
Bag Bhai (brother).
This boom can blush even by touching hand.
What shall i do?
Put it in this.
"Now let me go, let me go Papa."
Papa?
"He is saying Papa just like us, Papa."
Papa we should took on photo.
"Sir, what are you doing, it will blast."
"Sir, do you also want to put bag in safe deposit."
Get him off!
Get him off!
"Come back here, you!"
I regret nothing!
I'm too young to have termites!
"I'm no termite, Pinocchio."
I'm a cricket.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be your...
The end.
That wasn't me.
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ask anyone.
"OK, then."
Why don't we start by asking your conscience.
Now who's cheating?
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Oh, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man."
That was an accident.
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that.
I used to... act out.
Patrick was popular.
He'd ditch his girlfriend after games and we'd go down to the pier.
"Well, under it."
Did you and Patrick reunite for old times' sake ?
No.
"Michelle, Patrick incurred a suction bruise on his neck antemortem."
What's that mean ?
It means whoever gave him the hickey did so before his murder.
Perhaps during it.
Now we swabbed the area around his neck to check for DNA.
Would you care to give us a sample for comparison ?
Patrick was so cute.
I just wanted to experience that feeling again.
- Okay...
Okay !
- Come on.
Still like that ?
"Oh, you know it."
"But to him, I was still a skank."
Hear that ?
I requested our song.
We didn't have a song.
Come on.
Let's go out there and dance.
"What, in public ?"
Are you kidding me ?
I didn't take you out in public in high school.
Why would I start now ?
"If someone killed him, I can't say I'm sorry."
But it wasn't me.
Alexx...
Right?
"Now, if you want to see the most unpleasant side of me,"
Have another person come up the steps.
"But I'm a nasty, horrible guy."
"I'm not worried about-- right, you guys"
Are the sensitive young people.
"You're worried about-- you know, seriously, come on."
Wake up.
"I'm not gonna screw around, man, when it comes"
"To the people whose little babies are coming through here,"
I don't care.
MAN:
"Yeah, I'm making a sign."
You can dislike me all you want.
But I'm sorry.
I've been here for an hour.
I've been asking for some kind of polite system
Of the Poughkeepsie-vilians to go around.
They're perfectly willing.
They don't want to go through here.
"You don't want people falling on cables, right,"
Especially little tiny babies.
MAN:
I got it.
"Yeah, well I didn't think you got it, because it's"
Like the eighth time.
"So until it gets done, I'm gonna keep being unpleasant,"
Which I'm pretty good at.
And have somebody here.
"Whatever it takes, right."
MAN:
I think we're--
[Indistinct conversations]
"Go, go!"
You're gonna be okay.
This is the last set from the sequencer.
"Well, you were right."
I isolated nine different sets of DNA.
Six are from the Swiss expedition.
"I haven't found matches for two of the others, although, genetic markers do indicate they may be local."
So there may not be a match.
What about this one?
It's common to all parties and it was found in the bite marks on Pemba.
That's your killer.
Western European markers as well as Polynesian.
The 2015 quake was his trigger.
And I use that as a filter with missing persons.

"How's that angle for you, Tim?"

It's the west side entrance to the terminal.

Not bad.

I had come to see what you do at the Academy!
You are so busy that you didn't even go to meet Mother?
You didn't even telephone her?
Mother is furious at you.
But what can I do?
"So much of drills, studies... I have to study so much."
Such big books!
Sometimes I read through the nights.
The drills too are so backbreaking.
You don't realize how much of hard work is involved in this.
- Your timing is indeed ridiculous.
- Why?
What happened?
I am trying to create a good impression.
- lf my mother gets to know...
- l don't understand.
Brother!
She's Pooja and he's my brother!
"So she's your fat book, is it?"
I don't find her too fat!
What about your studies for the whole of nights?
"You must be finding it hard, don't you?"
Have you seen other things?
Other creatures?
There's more out there than even you and I know about.
I photograph and study what I can.
"So, Shannon, if you would do me the honour of being my guide, tonight, I will find the beast for you."
I'd be delighted.
"- Here, let me help."
- Thanks.
"So, you're with Kyle?"
Filming Kyle.
There's a difference.
- That the beast freak?
- We just call her Shannon.
Good.
It's always better if they look like they don't live under a bridge.
"- So, I'm Tom."
And you are?
- Busy.
Jo.
You are Jo.
"So, what are you, a film student?"
Yes.
I'll let you be in my documentary if you leave me alone for two minutes to set up.
"So, you're hunting the hunter, so to speak?"
"Right, I'll just let you get on."
"Excuse me, but if you're going to interview anyone about the beast, it has to be us."
We've known about it for years.
What are you looking for?
I don't know.

You actually said that to people?
"Well, you know, just, like, biker types."
Huh.
"Hey, Russ."
Checkit out.
I don't believe it.
I thought you called for partly cloudy and pleasant tonight.
A backdoor cold front.
- A what?
- A backdoor cold front.
Rare.
Almost impossible to predict.
The atmosphere - a beautiful yet fickle beast she is.
Is that from the Evel Knievel play?
We just proved that she didn't shoot herself.
"Come on, Melvin."
"If she committed suicide, the gun would have been down there."
It's not.
So someone shot her.
"Damn it, Melvin."
Will you give it up?
You've got no evidence and no motive.
She was pregnant.
Pregnant?
That's right.
And we both know who the father was.
[ Laughs ] [ Groans ]
"Oh, come on, Greg."
"Ah, I'm just a little off today."
"Hey, Melvin, Lyle."
"Can you believe it, Melvin?"
First time I beat the kid since he was 1 6.
Must be the cold.
[ Chuckles ]
I've got your check up at the office.
Looks like we'll have snow for the funeral.
I can't bury her until I finish the investigation.
Melvin thinks she was murdered.
Murdered?
You said she committed suicide.
"No, I found a bullet hole in her left temple right here."
So the poor kid shot herself.
Why would anybody want to kill Hilla?
Maybe because she was pregnant.
"Of course, that probably doesn't come as any big news to you, does it, Greg?"
How did he know she was telling the truth?
- Great.
Go learn something.
His tongue and his dick were cut off.
LAPD didn't mention it?
No.
"They didn't find his tongue, but his dick was in his mouth."

"What the hell's happening here, man?"
We honestly don't know.
"But, obviously, someone's mad enough to send you a message, and he was the message."
But we don't know.
Here you go.
All records of foreign sales by Borns Tech of cluster bombs.
Are you kidding me?
I asked Borns Tech.
They just say they don't make them.
"We're asking for all of Karl Stoltz' military records, too."
We need to tie him to Borns Tech and prove that they hired him to kill Rachel Kennedy.
That guy doesn't have any records.

No.
"No, thanks, Poole."
"Would you consider a telegram from foreign parts, sir?"
"And a nice cup of tea as well, sir, huh?"
I know it's good news.
"Hobson told me last night that they were expected home today, sir."
"This is a great day for us, if you'll forgive me saying so."
"Soon be back to our regular meals, regular hours, regular ways, sir."

- I'll make some tea.
- We don't want anything.

"Anyway, like I said, but f or this woman Elaine,"
I definitely would've called you.
"Well, thanks f or stopping by."
You bet.
Hi.

"No, listen, I was just thinking -- I r eally like you."
"I mean, these little conversations have been kind of f un, and I was wondering if you'd like to maybe have a drink later."
"Oh, that's -- that's r eally sweet of you."
"But no, thanks."
This thing with Elaine isn't that serious.
-
- Who's Elaine?
-
- Exactly.
"Dan, l-I r eally have got work to do."
-
"- Look, do you want -- -"
"- Dan, I'm flatter ed, honestly, but I'm just not inter ested."
"Hey, you don't have to hit me over the head."
[ Both chuckle ]
At least you don't have to do it seven or eight times.
It was good talking to you.
"Yeah, it was a r eal clambake."

You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?

You're wearing make-up.

What kind of a name is Airport?
"Brother, people laugh out helplessness as ajoke.."

I am production manager in the film industry.
And I pick up and drop artists to the airport.
Artist?
You mean even the heroes and the heroines?
"Yes, everyone."
From Amitabh Bachchan to Asrani.
And from Sridevi to Aruna Irani..
..I have picked up and dropped all of..
..them to the airport more than a thousand times.
But I swear I still didnt get a chance to sit in the plane.

Forgive the deceit.
Your landlady didn't look the sort to approve a gentleman caller.
"To be perfectly frank, she's the first person I've met for weeks who didn't recognize me."
She doesn't hold with the pictures.
Ungodly.
Ah!
That's...
That's charming.
It's from Rose and Lily.
The real Rose and Lily.
They ran away to join the ATS.
"Rose thought if she could fix a propeller in a film, she could learn to mend an engine in real life."
Ah.
They're both mechanics now.
Um...
Baker's planning a new film.
Air-raid wardens.
Wants me in it.
He's pretty much left the part up to me.
"So, I was thinking, newly retired cat burglar, not quite reformed."
That's why he's so good at the rescues.
He knows the way in and out of any property.
"Thing is, in the hands of the wrong writer..."
"So, I was wondering if you would consider putting your time and talent..."
I don't do that anymore.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
You'll get-
- You'll get soap in your eyes.
Here.
Hmm.
"You got to relax, man."
"The chip's a lot smaller than I'm used to doing it with, all right?"
- I'm pulling the plug on this.
"- No, no."
Hold on.
One more.
"Take his chip out, then get off the train, you understand?"
"Tell him you need to get back to the Higher Authority, say you have guidelines to follow, whatever."
Do not stay in there with him.
That's an order.
"Yes, sir."
- Can you guys do me a favor?
- Anything.
Could at least one of you look like you're going to see me again?
See you when you get back.
- No!
No!
- Get up!
Tell your men to get whatever target they can.
"If this starts to go bad, we're going to go in."
Probably not going to have a great shot.
Take the one they can get.
"- That's far enough, Ted."
- That's far enough.
"Hello, everyone."
Here to remove a chip from Dr. Bryar.
Check him out.
Take the vest off.
I want to see you.
I don't have any weapons.
The Higher Authority doesn't authorize it for technicians.
Take it off!
"All right, go ahead."
I gotta go.
Baby!
You guys go ahead!
We'll meet you guys there!
"So, what are we gonna do about Trudy?"
"What are we gonna do about Cynthia, who just disappeared into the jungle?"
"Jason, she's upset."
Let her cool down.
You'll talk to her later.
"We still gotta get Trudy to do all the Marcel stuff, anyway, all right?"
So let's just get her ass and let's get back home.
"Cyn, please, slow down, honey."
I think we're almost there.
I think we might have taken a wrong turn.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Finally made it to the waterfall.
I think my marriage is over.
What?
"Honey, don't say that."
You're just exhausted.
I am.
I'm so tired of him trying to steer everything in the direction that he thinks is right all the time.
Listen.
Don't make any decisions right now.
You guys just need to take a breather.
"Get a little bit of space, you know?"
You'll be okay.
You know?
You guys have been on top of each other ever since we got here.
Just a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I want you to take these.
They'll relax you.
Relax me?
I'm so relaxed I'm tired.
- Maybe you need them.
"- These are for you, Jo."
- l'm the doctor.
Here.
- Ben -
You know what happens when you get excited and nervous.
Here.
Do me a favour.
Six months ago you told me I took too many pills.
Six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder.
You've been excited.
You've been talking a blue streak.
- You've been walking around in circles.
- l haven't!
"Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine."
You'll feel better if you take these.
Nothing bad?
Look at us; do you call this a life?
"First my father, now Beatrice."
"I'm worse than him, much more wretched and vile."
I don't even have the courage to be cruel.
When will it end?
"It feels like I'm sinking more and more everyday, until eventually they'll unmask us."
"It won't happen, I promise."
It was.
"You're a smart man, Detective, smarter man than I."
Why do you think you have nothing on us?
Because there's nothing to be had
When I killed Sid...
I looked him in the eye and I told him that he was going to die.
So just tell me the truth.
You do realize that we can still charge you for accessory.
Confessing won't change that.
"Oh, I'm prepared to accept whatever the punishment may be."
"If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead."
Tell me there was pento in the needle.
There was.
Watered down pento.
Hmm.
"I don't understand the game, Mary."
The only crime that Mary's guilty of is trying to protect me.
"Save me, really."
She can't help herself.
It's just what she does.
"We're not the same, you and I."
You sell drugs to addicts.
You murdered Sid.
You came after my daughter!
You're not a healer.
You create pain.
"I don't like games, Mary."
Police!
Put the weapon down!
"Mary, you okay?"
Mary?
I need something to stop the bleeding.
"Well, I think it's way too soon to start packing up our desks."
Come on.
You know he's gonna bring in his own people.
"No, we don't."
we haven't even met him yet.
He might want to keep things intact.
Seriously?
And not clean house?
He's throwing out merc's toilet.
Mm.
Stop it.
We need to stay positive.
I have a good feeling about this.
You do?
I don't.
"Well, I really do."
I am so fucked.
No way this guy isn't gonna clean house.
"Well, you haven't even met him yet."
I don't need to.
It's what I would do.
But you're brilliant at your job.
Why wouldn't he want to keep you?
Because I'm brilliant at it.
"Okay, you know what you mean, but..."
You never want someone who can do your job better than you can.
Why do you think I've got Andy and myra?
"Plus, if this guy finds out they offered me the job before him, forget it!"
Fucked!
"Normally, at this point,"
I would try and be encouraging...
"Yeah, no point in that."
- I want you to meet my girlfriend.
She needs your help.
She's desperate to get out of the country as fast as possible.
And since you're an expert in that kind of thing --
You -- your girlfriend?
It's a new thing.
"Well, if she's your girlfriend, where did you meet?"
Both of you at the same time.
"One, two, three, go!"
A f-friend's house.
I-- the Internet.
"Uh, my friend's Internet house."
"I hope you get eye cancer, Dixon."
W-w-w-w-w-wait.
You don't understand.
"No, I-I understand well enough, okay?"
"And so spare me the sob story, spare me the desperate tale of woe."
"Well, I-I don't have a desperate tale of woe."
But I do have three very well-armed friends.
That would be us.
You might want to invite us in.
"Dixon, you slack-jawed, traitorous nimrod!"
I -- that's your spy friend!
"I-I tell you I'm going off the grid, and you bring the most radioactive man in Miami to my door?"
!
"Are you gonna invite us in, or do I have to start shooting?"
God.
Fine.
Yes.
Come in.
Quickly!
Don't saunter!
Wait a minute:
Listen:
There's not a sound:
"Not an animal, not a bird:"
Nothing:
Not even the wind:
It is as though the planet were keeping quiet: : :
Better to listen to us:
It is astounding:
Ten thousand years old:
Must have been quite a place in its heyday:
I wonder why they left:
Perhaps a plague:
Could be:
Wait a minute:
What's that over there?
A religious symbol?
"[Buck] Well, they could be:"
These markings remind me of Egyptian hieroglyphics:
I'm gonna holograph this for Dr:
Goodfellow:
He can tell us what these hieroglyphics are saying:
Buck:
What?
Over there:
Looks like it might have been a temple at one time:
I will see:
[Beeping]
Hawk!
Buck!
It looked...
I thought you disappeared:
- I don't understand.
My legs are nothing.
These are my life.
I play the piano.
I'm a concert pianist.
A pianist?
"Well, any helpful suggestions?"
"Well, this one is interesting, but I'm afraid... burning down the entire camp would be impractical."
First Annual Naked Day shows promise.
We're working on that.
[ Chuckles ] I see.
Oh.
"Uh, how did your Simon Says tournament turn out?"
"- Oh, great."
B.J. won.
I came in second.
- Nobody else showed up.
"Evening, Captains Heckle and Jeckle."
"I'd have been here sooner, but I stopped to watch the dancing in the streets."
"Well, after just two days, what did you expect?"
Miracles?
I expected a big goose egg.
But you two haven't even done that good.
These folks expected a lot from you.
And getting let down is worse than having no hope in the first place.
"Oh, now, Colonel, I don't think it's as bad as all that."
Right!
Everything is under control.
"Listen, you two."
Where are the cosmetics I asked for?
"My nurses are human beings, you know?"
They have needs.
Not really.
"Yeah,real."
"You've been dropping a lot ofash lately,mcgee."
"New phone,new watch,new teeth."
What'up?
Ducky matched the dental records.
The body downstairs is lance corporal finn.
"Ziva,when did you..."
"Mcgee,how long does it take to put on a clean shirt?"
Ten conds.
"With buttons,a little longer."
Rhetorical question.
Contractor's off the hook.
He's been out of town for a week.
Going to check on the real estate agents this morning.
- That's all you did?
- No.
"While you and mcgee were watching the sunrise, I was pulling lance corporal finn's srb."
And I would have to say it was spotty.
He was unc' on the range and failed his swiqual.
- So they de him a supply clerk.
- Right.
"Six months ago,he signed out on a three-day pass before deploying to iraq and he never returned home."
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in iraq.
I'll contact mtac.
"I put in a request for finn's bank records, earning statements and medical records."
Night wasn't a total loss.
Ground radar picked up a shol about ten feet from the gravesite.
Already sent it to abby.
Yep.
The old gibbs is back
Should I really?
Should I just quit everything and follow you around?
Yeah.
Quit everything and even follow me to school.
Let's go to school.
Jik.
Noona wants to follow you around...
You know that Sin Joon Young's fans isn't a joke.
Hm?
"Among the fans from singer celebrities, Sin Joon Young's fans are the most extreme ones."
There are even psychos.
They're looking into you right now.
If something happens then...
This is Oh Jik's phone right?
Youtoldme you'dgivememoreinformationaboutPD NoEul butyoudidn'tcontactmeback.
You're not answering my calls either.
"If by any chance everything is a big lie, you will die for sure!"
She said she's the president of Sin Joon Young's fan club.
{ Sin Joon Young }
"Not that, not that."
Doyourememberthatmyfatherwasanextremelyfamousprosecutor ?
"Byanychance,ifyoueverhaveanypersonal interest inme..."

Doyourparentsknowthat youaredoingthiswithyour life ?
Heol!
Waah!
She must be really mad.
What are you doing?
Noona!
Does she have nothing to do after eating?
Give me your cellphone.
No Jik.
!
I didn't try to kill myself.
But you tried to hang yourself from the fan.
"No, dad!"
"I was watching TV and... all of a sudden, I don't know what happened but..."
I fell unconscious and...
Wh... what's going on?
"Dad, you need to tell me."
I really need to know.
- What's happening?
"- Excuse me, this is going to have to wait."
Can you please step outside?
Sure.
What does this mean?
Why would someone want to kill Tisha?
"Mr. Khanna, it's critical that you do exactly as I say."
You'll never guess.
Tisha was attacked.
But she's alright now.
"Even so, you instructed Mr. Khanna that he should say that his daughter is dead."
How did you know that?
Because it's what I would've done.
"So, it's obvious that there is a killer hiding somewhere."
"Or, perhaps Tisha is lying so that we don't suspect her."
Perhaps.
It's possible.
What does anyone get by killing Tisha?
10 billion Euro.
Sunil... ask Mr. Malhotra's lawyer who inherits after Tisha?
Got that.
"That's it, right?"
"The question is, who would want to kill Tisha."
Huh.
Who doesn't love Paris?
Have a safe trip.
Excuse me.
Sure.
"Now you say ""excuse me."""
Thanks.
We're just killing time waiting for the storm to blow over.
How credible a threat is it?
It's elevated.
"Pretty typical this time of year, but... worth calling about."
"Well, man of few words."
Maybe I'm wrong.
"She's not talking about you, boss."
Bishop's husband know anything?
"Uh, there was some talk of chatter."
"Just some memos going around the office, but..."
Chatter?
"Well, snowstorm Yeah."
"will probably keep the terrorists home anyway, right?"
Yeah.
"It also keeps first responders and emergency service vehicles from getting through, DiNozzo, so... keep your eyes open."
Copy that.
You have been on edge.
You knew.
We're just hearing the chatter now?
NSA heard about it days ago.
"Well, I'm..."
"I'm a lawyer, Tony."
My ear's not exactly pressed to the pipeline.
"So, you didn't..."
tell me?
Yikes.
"Okay, for your information, Richard, I have had plenty of sex."
I don't tell you everything.
I've had it under my belt.
"Over my belt, around my belt."
"You know, I've pretty much worn out my belt."
Really?
So plenty of sex?
"Hey, when I gots to have it, I gots to have it."
"Look, it's not a competition."
You'll be ready when you're ready.
"Hey, I'm ready."
I'm ready right now.
Then I gots to go.
I didn't mean from you.
I got plenty guys coming here to get some sex...
"All right, what about the one with the mystic tan and the butterfly clip?"
"Yep, I think she's having sex, too."
Are you kidding me?
What about you?
Are you doing it?
"You know, maybe sex isn't your thing."
Maybe your thing is more having awkward conversations with your employees.
Sex used to be my thing.
"God, in fact, senior year in high school, I was a little bit of a slut."
That's what I was known for.
"I mean, that and my laugh."
You do have a nice laugh.
"Oh, thanks."
"God, I used to be fun."
"Then I became a mom, you know."
I used to be turned on by the touch of a man.
You're in danger!
- Go after him!
"Ifyou consider me your friend, kill me now."
I loathe seeing you demean yourself by begging.
Though I didn't succeed...
I risked my life trying to get you your money!
I could havejust killed you.
I didn't have to beg Weng foryour money.
"I'm not completely without honor, am I?"
Our world is changing so fast.
It never used to be like this.
Perhaps we're too nostalgic.
Nostalgia is one ofour saving graces.
"At least when I die, I'll know I was remembered by a friend."
Let's settle our differences in the next life.
Let's cancel them right now.
That's what friends are for.
Right?
- A drink?
- Thankyou.
Jenny always wanted to live by the sea.
You've done so much for her.
I wonder how she feels about you.
- Hello?
-Jenny!
"Jeffrey, why did you leave without saying good-bye?"
I'm sorry.
I had something to do.
We have to leave tonight.
- Tonight?
- Dr. Ho called this afternoon.
"He's reserved a pair ofcorneas, but they're in Singapore."
"Well, um, we're meeting for breakfast."
"So, maybe we'll get into some of that."
It just seems a little strange that he's suddenly here now.
"Yeah, I get that, but come on, you remember how good he was before he left, right?"
I'm just...
I'm trying to focus on that. (CHUCKLES)
"Mmm... actually, I kinda remember him being a little off."
He wasn't off.
"What do you mean ""off""?"
"He was damaged, Emma."
"I wouldn't have used that word when we were little, but he was damaged."
- When Brandon James killed all of his...
"- He went through a lot, okay?"
We should definitely be able to understand that.
And maybe he's better now.
People can recover.
"Em, he just left you without any explanation."
What about that?
You should be careful.
Yeah.
"Okay, I shouldn't have called you."
"- Wait, are you pissed at me?"
"- Um, I'll see you later."
"(KNOCKING) Hey, sleepyhead!"
I've been texting you since dawn.
Ready to check the storage unit?
"Let's go, go, go!"
"Yeah, just give me one sec, okay?"
One second.
Meet me out front.
Thank you.
"This place is, uh, nice."
I thought so too.
I made a mistake.
Now I've put it right.
Faster!
Keep moving!
Faster!
"Jump to it, you lazy dogs!"
- Jump to it!
- Mr. Scott-Padget!
I got them to fight well yesterday.
I'll have no officer carrying or using a rope's end.
- I couldn't find Kilpatrick.
- I'm suspending you.
- For the rope?
- For disobeying an order.
I shall take steps that will astound you.
- You have astounded me many times.
- What was that?
You need a hard lesson.
You'll keep watch.
"Four hours on and four hours off, day and night."
"I'm a senior officer, not a midshipman."
Not a midshipman.
- I apologize...
"- Damn you, get below!"
- I only want to say...
- Still you argue!
Mr. Ponsonby.
"This officer will report every two hours, fully equipped to the officer of the watch, who'll report to me."
Now get below!
They've forgotten the petition already.
"In our business, Scott-Padget was our best friend."
"That wasn't a lie, that was doctor/patient confidentiality."
- She didn't...
"- No, that's bullshit."
A mom would tell another mom something like that.
Just please tell me the truth.
Okay.
"Okay, I was scared."
"I was scared if your dad and Louise found out that I had left that stuff lying around,"
I could lose you and Cambie.
That could happen?
Yes.
That's why I didn't tell anyone.
"But Jess, I can, and I will if it would make your life easier."
I thought you were lying because you were a drug dealer.
"Honey, I'm not a drug dealer."
I know.
That must have been really hard growing up without a mother.
"Like, with all your flaws still,"
"I couldn't imagine life without you, so."
"Well, you don't have to."
"Mr. Lewis did request a late check out, but..."
It's urgent.
"Since he's not answering the hotel phone,"
- I can let you in.
"- Uh, actually,"
- we should probably go in alone.
- Yeah.
- Room 214.
- Thank you.
Shit.
What do you think?
I think Mary finally figured out a way to kill Morgan.
He said it was better if I didn't know.
Because of the danger.
"Look, I didn't give him the money."
I loaned it to him.
So you drew up a legal document?
No.
But we had an oral agreement.
"I mean, he promised to pay me back."
With interest.
"I mean, I maxed out all of my cards, so you better find that money."
What was he like the last time you saw him?
He was sweet.
We made love right before he left.
He use a condom?
I'm on the pill.
We were engaged.
"Abs, can DNA still be recovered from Lance Corporal Finn's skivvies?"
It would take the cooperation of weather and protection.
He was wrapped in plastic and it's been cold
", so there's a decent chance."
"Well, run the tests."
We'll do a cheek swab on his fiancées.
"Wait, did you say ""fiancées?"""
Like plural?
Huh.
Kinky.
Is that it?
"For now, Siri."
I need to follow you home and pick up his belongings.
I want them back when James returns.
He's dead.
He can't return.
archaeology is not an exact science.
Does not deal in time schedules.
The Führer is not a patient man he demands constant reports.
And he expects progress.
You led me to believe -
Nothing!
I made no promises!
I only said it looked very favorable.
"Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct."
Boy they're not kidding are they?
What time does the sun hit the map room?
About nine in the morning.
Not much time then.
where are they digging for the Well of the Souls?
On that ridge.
But the map room is over there.
"Let's go, come on."
[Guards speaking German]
Sallah!
Sallah!
Mehr Wasser!
What is the matter?
"I fetch the water, I shall get it for you."
Water?
"I will give you water, no problem, no problem."
I thought you were dead.
They must have switched baskets.
Are you hurt?
No.
You have to get me out of here quick!
They're going to be back at any minute.
Quick!
- Working with cars.
Right.
Ever wanted to work at a newspaper?
"No, sir."
- Have you ever read a newspaper?
- Not really.
"OK, it does seem there's been some sort of mistake here somewhere."
"That's OK, mistakes happen."
Shall I go the paper tomorrow?
You go to the garage.
It's all booked.
Is this a joke?
Do I make a lot of jokes?
- But sir...
- I can't change the placements.
Can't or won't?
You pick.
It's the same result.
Sutherland?
Does this mean I won't be driving any planes?
This is a fuck-up.
What experience will I get at a garage?
Apart from a depressing working-class one?
You get to look at horny calendars.
Why work for a paper?
I thought you were going into the family business.
- Which is...?
- Prostitution.
"Yep, nice one."
It'll be shit anyway.
The clue's in the name - work experience.
It won't be shit at my dad's firm.

-Have you had a chance to talk at all?
"-Well, we did meet at the hospital."
-Did anything good come out of it?
"-No, nothing."
-You didn't say anything to each other?
-We said things to each other but we weren't talking.
-We're saying things and that's all nice and sweet.
-Nice and sweet is good.

He doesn't miss me.

-Dad loves you so very much
"-In fact, he loves you so much it almost killed him."
-I'm not getting any younger.
I want to live.
-What the hell is that?
-Is that a dating site you're showing me?
"-They're pretty handsome, don't you think?"
"-Well, they look like dad, all three of them."
"-No, I don't think so."
-They definitely do.
These two are sea captains and the third one works for the Maritime Administration.
-I must have a thing for sailors then.
-This is not happening.
"-But you know what, none of these guys have summer cabins."
-Is that the problem?
Is it the house that's the issue?
"-There you go, dad."
Finally back at your favourite place.

Take your time.
I can wait.
I'm going to be here a while yet.

Hawaii is like every sensual woman I've ever known.
"She can have raging, violent bursts of temper, followed by incredible calm and peacefulness."
Today was one of those days of true serenity... when even the great tourist wave seems to recede.
"I mean, I couldn't believe the stillness."
"Man, business stinks."
"Hi, guys."
Hi.
"Rick, what's the exact time right now?"
"You know, everybody's on the mainland."
"Nobody even cares if my chopper's sittin' there gettin' rusty, just eatin' money."
"Rick, the time!"
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.
"Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes."
That's a song.
Don't forget to give my love to Rose.
Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"So, where are you heading?"
Patagonia.
Travelling light.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you?"
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"I don't have any whisky, actually."
"Oh, no?"
"Well, then, you lured me here"
Under false pretences.
Just a lie to get you into my room.
Cunning.
But unnecessary.
Sorry.
I might need this to replace the pretty clothes you ripped off me last night.
You work for them.
Good luck.
"So what now, John?"
How do you see this playing now?
You tell me.
"Well, not such an elaborate routine next time you run away."
Why did you this time?
I'm always curious as far as you're concerned.
You said you wanted to go back to prison.
Yeah.
I'll take my chances.
"But there's a dark side to progress, Hogarth."

Boop.
Watching us.
"We can't see it, but it's there."
Much like that giant thing in the woods.
We don't know what it is or what it can do.
"I don't feel safe, Hogarth."
- Do you?
- What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?
"I'm talking about your goldarned security, Hogarth!"
"While you're snoozing in your little jammies, back in Washington, we're wide-awake and worried."
Why?
"Because everyone wants what we have, Hogarth!"
Everyone!
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?
The Russians?
The Chinese?
Martians?
Canadians?
I don't care!
"All I know is, we didn't build it, and that's reason enough to assume the worst and blow it to kingdom come!"
"Now, you're going to tell me about this thing."
You're gonna lead me to it.
And we are going to destroy it before it destroys us!

Alright.
Alright.

Everything will fall apart if something happens to you.
I'll get what we need.
Trust me.
Let me go.
I don't want to send you on such a rough journey.
I'm afraid too.
But whenever I'm scared...
I'll think of you.
Of how you lead the migrants.
I won't die in vain.
Don't worry.
I'll come back... and help you realize your dream.

We have to do something.
The chiefs are having a meeting.
You have many fine qualities.
"You are big and strong... full of life, mischief."
I have always feel positive towards you.
"You should see yourself now... in the shadows there, with the smoke all around you."

-Greta Garbo.
-May I help you?
-Yeah.
"Brad to reception, your 1:00 client is here."
You'll call me later?
No phone calls for the first two weeks.

I'll write.
I was thinking of keeping a journal anyway.
"Get it published, maybe, under my pen name."
Congratulations.
"You got here, dude."
That's the hardest part.
I'm going to have to search your bag.
"-Cigarettes are Okay, right?"
-Cigarettes are fine.
They're encouraged for patients who smoke.
"But, Chris, no chocolate allowed."

When's Bill coming back?
Next week.
I'll be busy for a few days... but I'll see you when I can.
Did he kiss you?
No.
"That's kind of sweet, actually."

This is Cindy.

It makes graphic representations of the music.
Watch.

- Rose Morgan.
Henry Fine is a professor in anthropology.
"Beautiful music, isn't it?"
Beautiful atmosphere.
I enjoyed that.
- Thank you so much for inviting me.
"- Oh, my pleasure."
Why don't you come up to my apartment?
I want to give you a copy of my book.
I'd love that.
"Your book, I mean."
Not to come up to your apartment.
"But, Rose, I'm inviting you up."
"If you like this kind of music, I have some wonderful CDs, but they're also in my apartment."
"Greg, I have to be honest with you."
I'm a bit out of practice with this.
"Rose, I want you to feel comfortable."
That's very important to me.
I want to tell you up front.
I'm not interested in sex.
- You're not?
"- No, and it has nothing to do with you."
It has to do with what you were talking about in your class.
"I mean, slapping all that money down on the saloon?"

What do you know about running a saloon?
I've spent my whole life in saloons.
You may trust I have ample experience.
"What about you, Josiah?"
Money is like manure.
Not good except it be spread.
May I take that as an affirmative?
No.

"Glistening wood, sparkling mirrors, a new piano, lush green felt tables."
That does sound good.
And it proves you're a smart lad.
-You know the answer to the question.
J.D. :
You bet.
-What's the question?
-The question is...
... whatdoeseveryone in this town want to do?
What does every visitor here want to do?
Quite possibly in her death.
"That's fascinating, sir."
You've got quite a way of putting things.
Especially about Mrs. Daley.
"Let me ask you, sir."
Could you maybe tell me more about her?
Not much.
But you're right.
"About what, sir?"
What you're thinking.
I was lying before.
I didn't like Claire very much.
I haven't for years.
Which doesn't mean to say
"I wasrt shocked by the news of her death, I was."
"And I was still a little bit shook up when you first walked in, so I said whatever sounded right to a detective."
Some other detective.
Not you.
Please sit down.
"Properties, a glass for the Lieutenant, please."

"Yes, sir."
"You had me absolutely fooled, sir."
Really?

Even after you asked a few questions around the set?
Thank you.
"Our fights, Claire's and mine, werert always discreet."
"And some of them were overheard, I believe."

He's got a ca...
He pretty much built Newcastle about 100 years ago.
I knew that.
"Local knowledge, John."
"Can't beat it, eh?"
The dead man's obviously got a sense of humour.
He was interested in how the city was built and then he names himself after two different blokes who are known as Mr Newcastle.
"I'll just go and, er... chase up those choccy biscuits for you, eh?"
"~ Still irritating you, then?"
"~ Teeny bit, yeah."
"~ (Lab report, sir.) ~ What?"
"He's lost his voice, sir."
"He's got a cold, or flu, or summat."

Work.
Oh.
"Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?"
Probably.
"Can't understand it, a guy taking his wife way out in the wilderness."
"Stupid, if you ask me."
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He loved me and I loved him.
"Well, I wouldn't let him go alone."
"Undoubtedly, that will still impress you as being a very stupid reason."
We thought it an excellent one.
I still think it's stupid.
Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.
"Well, tell me somethin'."
"Uh, didn't he have some object?"
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?
"What I mean is, did he have a hunch, or did somebody give him a tip?"

"- Me, tired?"

"""Devi, You only hold my hands and take me to an isolated place"""
You have never behaved liked this before.
What has happened
"""Nothing, hold me in your arms, come my beauty."""
"""Come, beauty."""
"""lllusionary Jalandhar, your death is near."
"You can't live any more"""
"""What sort of Shiv Leela is this, Lord?"
"- It is like that"""
And Shiv Leela's beginning  end can't be ascertained at all.
"""Now it is half-way."
"When it ends, it will only bring welfare."""
We all have to wait for that.
Shri Hari Vishnu!
Shri Hari Vishnu!
Come to Kailash Bhavan immediately.
Mother Parvati is calling out to you.
Some bad incident has surely happened
Place looks good.
I'm excited you finally get to see our renovations.
Can't believe that excites you.
"God, you sound like a brat who lives in a dump in New York."
Don't be shitty.
My house is not a dump.
Wouldn't know.
I've never been.
Lots of fights happened in this room.
Only with you.
We're going out.
Get yourself dressed up.
It's gonna be a big night. (LAUGHS)
"OK, could you stop doing that?"
It's really annoying.
I planned on going away for a week.
- You know this is important to me.
"- I know, but it wasn't supposed to start for 10 days."
They changed it.
I don't know what to tell you.
You're not being really supportive right now.
You know this is an amazing opportunity for me.
Tell me the good version of this conversation.
"""You got the job?"
"""Congratulations, Ashley."
I'm so happy for you.
"""Although I admit to being a little disappointed,"
"""I understand that these things happen."
"""I'm so proud of you, baby."""
That's basically what I said.
I would never say that.
I am proud of you.
"Charlotte's fifth birthday would be like, right?"
- What are you talking about?
"- When Cookie rolls up, like, piñatas aplenty, everyone will be like,"
"""Hey, Cookie's here!"""
You wanna slow your roll?
'Cause that's not gonna happen.
They're not gonna last.
"She's like the perfect physical specimen, and he's just, you know, Bruce."
"It makes now sense at all, and, at the same time, it kind of makes all the sense in the world."
"I mean, look at them."
Like two hippos wrestling in the wild.
"Oh, that's a classic viper hold into a Chinese handcuff."
[phone buzzing]
Man.
We learned that two weeks ago.
"God, she's good."
"Oh, we didn't learn that one."
We should not be watching this.
And I am all alone. [sighs]
"Officer Rodriguez, at your service."
"Mark, what are you doing here?"
I'm being spontaneous.
"I slipped in through the window, ""Dawson's Creek"" style."
"- No, you didn't."
"- Oh, yes, I did."
"You better come over here, girl, 'cause I don't wanna wait."
There is a former MMA fighter named Cookie downstairs.
"Well, then we're gonna have to be quiet, huh?"
[both moaning]
Hmm.
You know what?
You know what?
Why would I drive his car?
Manoj said that you were fired because of you didn't maintain the car properly.
I was his driver for 3 years.
"If that was true, he could've fired me long ago."
My current employer verified with him before giving me this job.
You can cross-check if needed.
"If it wasn't you, who would've driven the car?"
I thought that he was going to sell the car.
He didn't say anything when I asked him.
"One day, I saw a lady driving his car."
I heard that she was staying with him.
I presumed that that might be the reason for firing me.
Do you know her?
No.
I have not seen her while I was working for him.
How did she look like?
"She was young, fair, and stylish."
Age?
She was a young lady.
Would you able to identify her?
I can't be very sure.
We will enquire again if required.
Give me your number.
You mustn't leave the town now.
"Okay, Sir."
"Yes, aunt."
How are you?
I'm okay.
Tell me.
What's the matter?
Did Varun call you?
I have deleted his number.
The letter wouldn't be at Crescent Beach.
Maybe not.
"While I'm at the club, I want Martinelli at police headquarters."
- l don't see the connection.
- Nobody can without opening the back of your car.
The trunk compartment.
Louis Ord's body's back there.
- How long you been driving?
- l didn't see the signal.
- lt was my f ault.
- Let's see your driver's license.
I just told her something that startled her.
It must be here. I know it is.
"It better be, unless you want to come along to the station house."
- lt isn't here. lt just isn't here.
- Keep your head.
I guess we're hooked.
She must have left it in some other bag.
That's the standard answer.
Can we stop by the mayor's office?
We got a date with His Honour.
"He's your pal, I suppose."
"No, but he told me that if I got Mrs. Chandler there by 4:00, he'd marry us."
That's what I'd just told her when we went through that stop signal.
is that a f act?
And I hardly know him.
Okay.
Get along with you.
"Hey, wait a minute!"
"- What did you say, lady?"
- l said yes.
That was close.
Wait
What should I do?
Make yourself useful
Help those who need it
How?
You can ease their consciences
That's a tremendous power
We can't keep him for long
The generator is running low.
We have to evacuate
is he dead?
What do you think?
Did you shoot him?
Yeah
Good work
Right in the heart.
He died instantly
Tell me ifyou find anything odd
Like?
I don't know.
Just odd
"Can you go to your room, please?"
Go to your room
- Is it about the ghost?
"- Go to your room, please"
- The ghost has gone
- Where to?
Back where he came from
How do you know he won't come back?
Because now he knows we don't need him
The police will come and ask you questions
They will want to know if you knew the ghost
"Yeah, but you didn't."
I should have.
But you didn't.
How did you know?
I knew this girl Vicki.
"She, uh..."
"She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck."
She started acting crazy.
"You know, weird, and it seemed like drugs but then you showed me those articles."
And then I saw your face and how it changed that night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
Look.
"You know you can't tell anyone, right?"
Who would believe me?
You'd be surprised.
Why didn't you?
Kill me?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
Like what?
Lost.
Why would you confront me about it?
Why would you risk it?
"Because if it was true, maybe..."
Maybe it's true about Vicki.
And also because I want you to turn me.
ripped by looxlike
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...
"For over a century, I have lived in secret until now."
"I know the risk, but I have to know her."
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"Anna, your face?"
"Sir, he is that fellow."
Bad news!
I sent your son into Coma and I will send you to Tihar jail.
Get Ready!
"I'll break all of your bones, bastard!"
Good news sir.
"Sir, he said bad news and this guy said good news."
This fellow is him sir.
That stranger has agreed.
"If you make your Facebook friend agree, it is like the scene is all set sir."
Okay..
Is it not nice?
See that one
"Hi Ria,"
- Where are you?
In Kalamandir
- Turn back once.
Are you surprised?
- I am shocked.
Why?
When I was thinking it would have been better if someone was there to say second opinion on this shirt and you correctly came in time.
"Come, you can see and say it."
Where is brother?
He may have been to the trial room.
How is this?
Looks dreadful!
You can be however in normal times.
It is the marriage of your sister so you should be decent.
Again you?
Why are you following me?
"This is the final warning, if you talk again I will shoot you."
Sorry sir.
"Ernie, hair?"
"Hey, Hensh, look at all that hair-- a regular mop."
(laughter)
Wasn't I a thing of beauty?
Squad Leader Private First Class Ernest Bilko.
"A PFC, huh?"
"Hey, wait till they see you with all them stripes."
Master Sergeant Bilko.
"Oh, boy, they'll really flip."
Who ever thought I'd wind up with more stripes than hair?
(all laugh)
"Oh, what a bunch of characters."
"Look, this guy right here."
Oh...
look at the end... the end...
Meathead.
He used to be a truck driver before the war.
"To get him to move, I had to honk a horn."
This is a beauty right here.
Goof-off Gunther was his name.
He was a busboy before the war.
Used to open K ration boxes looking for tips...
"This is a real beauty, a hillbilly--"
"Zeke ""Ozark"" Rutlege-- the only man in the Army wore suspenders."
"Oh, they were beautiful."
"How did those meatballs ever get along in civilian life without you to watch over 'em, Sarge?"
"Oh, I shudder to think about it."
"Ah, those poor jerks-- probably going in hock to get to that reunion in New York."
"Hey, Ernie, the reunion's tomorrow night."
You'd better start packing.
-Packing...
-Got an idea.
There's something I want to ask you about.
"Sure, yeah."
So this girl...
- Saffron.
- Such a pretty name.
And you like her?
So what problem?
"I had a fiancée... not so long ago, and it did not end well for me."
The heart is strong muscle.
It spring back.
You ready for the love again.
"Yeah, but I don't know if this is the kind of woman that..."
"Come, Mr. Heller, you handsome man."
Don't.
I know how people see me.
But this Saffron make you feel good.
Yeah.
She makes me want to... be nice.
I think you have good luck with this girl.
"If there's any way we could see the room before paying for it... um, we just want to make sure the room is up to our standards."
We don't usually let people see the rooms before they check in.
"I guess they just don't want us here, babe."
"You want to carry me over the threshold, too?"
"Yeah, you wish."
Let's hurry this up.
Are you coming out anytime this year?
"Crap, I think we're out of hot water."
"Hey, man, you want to use this?"
Eat shit!
"Hello, Alice."
"Hello, Ava."
We decided against it.
Roll down your window.
We have to tell him.
No.
"If he stops, it'll fall off."
"Even if he slows down, it'll fall."
The best thing for that fish would be... if he could just drive steadily... forever.
I guess these are his last moments of life.
Shall we say some words?
I didn't know you... but I want you to die knowing that you were loved.
I love you.
Hey.
It was on your roof!
.
We'll go in front of you!
- Pull in front of him.
- Okay.
We've got to keep him at a steady speed.
Just keep them steady.
"Oh, God."
That little girl is gonna have towatch it.
But at least they know.
At least we're all together on this.
"When me and Pam were first in love... we hated to be apart, even for an hour."
"Oh, yeah."
I had something like that once.
- A real fuck-a-thon.
- We just slept.
We loved to sleep when it was time to sleep.
Not sex.
"I mean, we had sex... but what we really loved was to sleep like babies all day long."
That sounds perfect.
I don't want to have to do this living.
Then we'll meet up and talk about it.
Otherwise we talk and talk and nothing ever happens.
That's why we have to take the initiative ourselves.
"Those who want to join, come with me to the entrance..."
The others can think about it.
"If a few came, I'd be happy."
Who here has a camera or a cell phone?
...
Stop...
Two steps to the right...
- Sit down!
Open your eyes!
They're for you.
They're pretty.
What do they eat... water?
You have to feed them.
I have to feed them?
We'll feed them.
They'll definitely die.
They'll last a little while.
So...
What's up?
How's it going with your marketing assistant?
What do you want?
Did you tell her your idea for a Christian community center?
Have a seat!
You know someone who can sing... female... pretty.
You mean Nora.
"You won't get Nora, she belongs to the hotel."
Make me a beer Angie!
"Well, that takes a while."
Then take your time!
What are you doing?
No!
Let me go!
"Oh no, I've been caught!"
"Help me, Big Sis!"
Ow!
Ow!
I'm gonna die!
No more!
Not there!
This is a situation neither the North nor the South should want.
"Not only that, there's absolutely no consistency to the Venom's destruction."
So it's most likely the work of someone operating independently.
"But who in the world would make the North and South fight each other, and for what purpose?"
"President Hunter, you have a guest."
She has been anxious to see you.
It seems urgent.
Turn her away.
- Even you should understand what kind of crisis I'm facing right now.
- Hey!
Get out of my way!
"Hey you, you shouldn't be here!"
I'm telling you to let me see him!
A Helmajistani?
"Nope, don't know anyone like that."
But a lot of Arabs live in that building over there.
"So you're Kashim, huh?"
"You reek of alcohol, you worthless brat."
"Are you trying to ruin the reputation of ""Bdakshon's Tiger""?"
As if I even care.
State your business.
A Chinese girl asked me to give this to you.
You need to be home where you're safe.
You could chain me to this porch and I'd still never touch you like that again.
I got off the phone with Mrs. Potter's housekeeper.
Mrs. Potter had a heart attack.
Paige?
"I'm sorry, Emily."
I wanted you to know that.
- I think maybe you're being framed.
- What changed your mind?
I think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me.
So this is what a real date with Ezra Fitz looks like.
Lead the way.
I gave your mom the museum ticket.
- Why would you do that?
"- A has something on me, and..."
"A has something on all of us, Hanna."
"Okay, so your sister's pregnant."
How'd that happen?
I figure pretty much the usual way.
"It's not really a ""how"" question, it's more of a ""why"" question."
"Well, I mean, I guess Melissa could have gone all maternal but I doubt it."
"Ugh, this is so creepy."
Where are they now?
Philadelphia.
Shopping.
What do you think this means?
"I don't know, but Toby wanted us to have it."
There.
"It's in Braille, so..."
"- You want to see this, Aria?"
- No.
I can see just fine from here.
You gotta see this.
Look at this.
This is how they're separating us.
You can control the doors from here.
Watch.
There they are.
Yeah.
They don't even care we're down here.
"Yeah, but they don't know that we know about this room."
Not yet.
"Now look, I've..."
"I've been monitoring surveillance, okay, and I think I found a way out."
Where?
"Okay, look at this."
Look at this.
You see that room right there?
"Those are, those are drainage ducts right there."
"Now, it's a tight squeeze, but I checked it out, and I think you guys can fit through it."
What do you mean you guys?
"Look, I can hide."
I'll stay here.
I'm gonna slow you down.
Connor.
"Look, it's the only way to do this, Blair."
Okay.
"You guys, you guys go out, phone for help and then,"
I'll hide down here and-
- We're not leaving you again.
I would leave me.
"No, we're staying."
How many people have they killed?
"If we leave, they get away, and they'll kill again."
- Norm.
- Take care.
Was a pleasure.
Take care.
- And...
- Be well.
"- I can, I will be."
"- Oh, well, don't look at that."
Jesus Christ.
You dick.
- Good one?
- Good enough.
Even looking at the girls here brings on a cascade of conflicting emotions.
They're always gonna want more than you're prepared to offer.
You remember that.
"You'll learn it yourself one day, if you haven't already."
What are you thinking about?
Are you thinking about what I just told you?
This place looks unforgiving.
Suffers in comparison to the guest room.
"Well, the offer's still on the table."
Don't sit on the car.
"Listen, this isn't the city."
They're a different breed of snob up here.
It's academia.
Academia nuts.
(LAUGHS)
I fail to understand the distinction.
"Yeah, I do, too, sometimes."
It's been really awful.
I consider you my good friend.
I appreciate that.
What are they going to ask us to do next?
Somebody's really gonna get hurt.
Maybe they should've just shut down the terminal.
And miss catching Professor Plum red-handed in the conservatory with the wrench?
Don't tell me you're enjoying this.
"You know the NSA, sweetheart-- we don't get out much."
"London, Brussels, Athens..."
Speaking of Brussels-- fun fact:
"the Brussels sprout-- Americans like to drop the ""S"""
"and just say ""Brussel,"" but..."
Jimmy.
"Put a sock in it, Mr. Palmer."
"Find the target, people."
"Let's go, let's go."
Come on.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be re-screening"
Paris flight 8247.
Why screen us twice?
It's not like any of us have gone anywhere.
"I know, but it only took a minute."
"Miss, can I give you a hand?"
Thank you for helping me.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"You got something, Abbs?"
The London flight.
Two Colombian federal agents and an unnamed third party.
"Scheduled to deplane at Dulles, and then connect on a later flight to Bogotá."
Opportunity.
McGee.
Working on it.
"Opportunity, Agent Gibbs?"
Mm-hmm.
"A team of researchers in Sweden gave it to a small group of glioblastoma patients, and they lived a remarkably long time."
"- Yeah, h-how long?"
- More than two years.
Yeah.
That's twice as long as the patients that didn't receive it.
Two years?
What I...
What I could do with that time.
I was hoping for a good six months.
Shall I arrange it?
"Oh, sign me up!"
I'm gonna fight this thing with everything I've got.
Look.
- My grandson.
- Mm.
He was three last week.
How's that for a reason to live?
Give me that.
"Can you look at me, please, Mr. Myers?"
"Uh, please, call me Jacob..."
Descendant of our tribe's forefather of the Israelites.
"Or, for short, the Messiah."
"So, just for the sake of clarity..."
You are the Messiah?
"I am chosen by Hashem, who calls on me to walk with angels."
"The only thing you should walk with is our dog, which you haven't done once since this started."
You have any headaches recently?
"No, I've never felt better."
And does God talk to you?
"If you're asking do I hear voices, no, I'm not crazy."
But God and I have an understanding.
Our soldiers have been instructed not to shoot unless they are attacked by you.
Accept this offer.
You are surrounded.
You cannot escape any more.
"General Benítez has promised that no one will be harmed, if Enrique Carrasco negotiates with him."
Every single word is a bloody lie.
Not even a child would fall for that.
- No.
Are you crazy?
- I believe him.
Enrique!
The regime has collapsed.
Ramírez has left the country.
He's fled?
Yes.
General Gómez is leading the provisional government.
- He's guaranteed law and order.
- And you believe him?
I hope it's true.
I'd like to tell you that I'm glad that we're meeting this way.
I want you to know that I don't wish to be your enemy.
Commander!
"Commander, the militia!"
They've stopped Padre Julio's bus.
Guerrilleros!
Padre Julio's bus has been ambushed by Silveira's men.
We must hurry.
- Come on!
- The bus has been ambushed.
Come on!
Forward march!
Hurry up!
"One more shot, and I kill her."
Papa!
Lower your weapons.
We have lost.
Not just yet.
Back to your mother.
Lock 'em up!
One night away to bury my brother and what do I come back to?
Taylor and his officers got out.
It's in the nature of captives to want to escape.
It's the jailer's job to stop 'em.
They had help.
Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
"No, you take 'em!"
And you stay with 'em till I send for ya.
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
"U, lad!"
Come here!
"Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get, so you go with him."
What will happen to the women?
Leave the women here.
It'll give captain taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those 2 men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on!
"Hey, who are you?"
Molly?
"Molly, I'm hungry."
"Well, go downstairs and fill up your big cereal bowl."
By myself?
Take your bobblehead.
"Mike, come on."
Sunday's my only day to sleep in.
What if your mom and sister are down there?
You've eaten meals with my family before.
"Yeah, but you're always there with me."
"Sweetheart, this is your house now."
You can go do whatever you want.
"Well, what I want is for you to come downstairs with me and have breakfast."
Go!
Fine.
"You know, you're meaner now that we live together."
"Whoa, there he is."
"Morning, Victoria."
You just getting home?
"Yeah, I had a little car trouble."
Maybe I can help.
"I'm not a mechanic, but I know what's what under the hood."
"This is actually more of a ""too stoned to remember where I parked"" problem."
"Well, as a sworn police officer,"
"I cannot comment, but I commend you for not driving a motor vehicle while under the influence."
Wasn't really my choice.
But thank you for not harshing my mellow.
No problem.
"And for the record,"
Johnny law...
"Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow."
And I'm walking the line.
"Goodbye, Mrs John!"
- Bye.
Mealtime!
Thanks so much for your visit...
"Ei Ei, now look."
Ei!
"Now stop that, Selma!"
The only thing missing is that mine is infected by yours.
"It isn't contagious, or else I would've gotten tuberculosis a long time ago"
And you did say that I could put it down here.
"Yes, once upon a time!"
"When one has one's own, one can no longer take care of strangers' kids."
Now get out of the parlour...
Where is Miss Pauline?
How come?
When I went to the laundry yesterday there was a new one there!
"Oh well, and?"
I sent for her from the employment exchange due to my condition.
The other one went back where she came from...
Back?
But she didn't want to go back at all!
What do I care what she wanted?
Get out!
One may still ask!
What are you doing down here?
Are you not pleased with my hotel anymore or..am I perhaps not friendly with you?
Yes...
You are like a brother.
Brother?
Nobody has told me that before.
"Well, that is an outright insult, indeed it is!"
Oh well...
"I was only waiting to take Miss, uh, Miss what's-her-name home."
Or maybe she doesn't want you to take her home.
Silly of her if she doesn't 'cause I'm a pretty nice fella and I think she's divine.
'Get out of here before I throw you out.'
"- Oh, you're gonna get tough?"
"- Yes, I'm gonna get tough."
"- Well, start something."
- That's just what I'm gonna do.
[grunts]
'I'll drag you out of here by the neck.'
Let go off my throat.
Let go.
Let go off me.
Let go.
"Well, fancy meeting you here."
- What...
- Shh.
[knocking]
"Hello, partner."
"""Breathes there the man with soul so dead"
"""who never to himself hath said."
"You're an angel."""
That gives me an idea.
I'm gonna write a little song about you someday.
[clattering]
"Now, that's hardly a friendly attitude."
Do you have to annoy me?
"I just dropped around to tell you I'll be back tomorrow night, and the following night and each consecutive night for an interminable period."
I hope you enjoy the new show.
This is my last night.
Leaving us?
Tch-tch-tch.
I'm... not...?
Rest assured.
You won't have a thing to worry about.
"It is unfortunate but, another one of our students disappeared last night."
We have requested the help of the authorities who now are conducting a thorough investigation.
I'd like to ask all you students to be on the alert...
"All the ones who've disappeared were athletes, right?"
Yes.
"Yesterday, it was the captain of the tennis team."
You might be the next target of the kidnappers.
That's ridiculous!
"When you have that look in your eye, I know you're scheming."
Uh-uh.
Who's planning to capture the kidnappers?
See.
You are!
"Why, the shy little guy's waiting for her?"
Huh?
For who?
Do you plan to get her alone by saying...
"""It's a little dangerous, so shall I walk you home? """
"No, uh... but..."
"What, were you going to invite me along?"
"Sorry, but I have other plans."
See ya!
Go straight home!
Shall we go?
Uh-hmm...
Straight home...
Yeah.
Sure.
You kidnappers...!
Then I am too.

"She was done, right?"
I should probably get going.
"Um, didn't you just leave?"
"I wanted to talk to you, and, um..."
Kyle said that I should...
use the front door.
Okay.
"Um... your parents didn't press charges, and they could have."
They understand that what I did to you wasn't me.

"So, what, you caused the most traumatic experience of my life, and now you're telling me that it's not your fault?"
I'm telling you I'm sorry.
I'm not here to ruin things anymore.
I'm here to help.
I'm trying.
"Then I guess I can try, too."
Okay.
Hey.
Want some help?
Dig in.
"Hey, I thought you got rid of this."

"No, sir."
There's no blood around him.
He was dead when he hit.

There's no money in it either.
"So, robbery, maybe?"
We've got this.
"It's a receipt for a pawnbroker, a couple of betting slips from the dog track and a note that says, ""Gwendolen Howard, 5:00 Wednesdays."""

Seal it.

"Besides, somebody'll come in and pick you up."
Maybe somebody with a big backyard or something.
Might even live in the country.

This is probably the luckiest break you ever got that I didn't take you with me.

"- No, I didn't do him, but Colleen can."
Did you get me a prostitute?
What?
No. (scoffs)
What do you take me for?
"No, he's a dancer."
Classy.
"But if you tip him enough, he will have sex with you."
"HEATHER: (gasps) Oh, this is perfect."

- Hell no.
- Team Colleen.
- Hos before bros.
I broke up with him.
- What's that?
- Shut the front door.
You just said you missed him.
I do.
"Well, then why did you break up with him, Colleen?"
Because Matt's a great guy.
I got scared.
Matt fits into some really bad patterns in my family history.
"I mean, I do know, but I'm embarrassed."
"Kaitlin, you come in here all the time, and you look right through me like I don't even exist."
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
"I mean, why would a girl like you pay any attention to a guy like me ?"
I know the only reason you'd ever get to know me is if you had no choice.
"Tonight, that happened, and it felt like fate."
I didn't want it to end.
"I guess, I mean, that's understandable."
"But what do you mean, you didn't want it to end ?"
What the... ?

I don't know what happened.
I don't know why it burned down.
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?
He didn't want to go to a foster home.
"He didn't want to leave, and I didn't want him to leave either."
"It's like, you force me to live amongst these pod people and the first cool person I meet, you kick him out of the house."
I did the best I could.
So did I.
Come on.
The police want to ask us some more questions.
"Dispatch, is there a description...?"
Thank you.
Just follow my lead.
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan Atwood?
We got some questions for you.
- It was an accident.
"- Yeah, you were there?"
Yeah.
Then we got some questions for you too.
"Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney."
Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present.
"Ryan, keep your mouth shut."
You too.
"Dad, I know."
I understand how important the model home is to the new development.
"We'll sell the lots by Christmas, I promise."
So unless he's here to report a crime...
I can't allow him in this building.
I don't know.
Makes you think.
Vic says the guy was a real crackerjack cop.
"Somebody like him can get booted, man, none of us are safe."
Come on.

Probably lost his edge.
–Nothing's gonna happen to us.
–How are you so sure?
Because we're careful.
Because Joe got sloppy and stupid.
"Stupid, huh?"
"–Vic, I..."
–What's stupid is Joe's twice the cop you'll ever be.
You're too sloppy to even know it.
–Here we go again.
–I guess so.
"You know, I'm gettin' a little tired of this bullshit."
I'm gettin' tired of constantly having to clean up after your bullshit!
"Every time something goes to shit in your life, I become your whipping boy."
Why don't you find someone else?
–Maybe that's exactly what I'll do.
–You want my transfer request?
"Say the word, Vic!"
It'll be on Aceveda's desk first thing in the morning!
–Fine.
Write it up.
–Fine!
Asshole.
–What'd you call me?
They took care of Tunney when he was gonna talk.
How come Figgis didn't do somethin' about it?
He was Ray's right-hand man back then.
Then they tried to kill Superboy.
"They were hiding him, Freddy."
Then they burned down Figgsy's house when they think he might talk.
You don't know that.
We went over every inch of that house.
Not everything is a hexagonal conspiracy.
I think you been hangin' around Figgs too much.
He's the only one getting cash out of that house... and he's totally playing you—
just like those assholes in the city.
"And I'm sorry, but... there's nothing you can do about this."
"Yes, there is."
"I can find Superboy, and I can bring him in."
I'm going back upstate.
I want my old job back.
I don't want any part of this.
I don't want any part of this place.
"Come on, Cindy."
Shit.
Freddy.
"Look, I don't know about Ray, okay?"
But everyone in Garrison is not a murderer.
No.
"They just keep their eyes closed and their mouths shut, just like me."
"Hey, Freddy."
"All right, thank you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, sweetheart."
I love you too.
"All right, terrific."
Thank you.
"Thanks, thank you."
"Well, what did Ernie say?"
"He get you fired, or what?"
"No, he thought I was funny, and he likes my look, and wants me to come in and audition for a guest role on one of his sitcoms next week."

"For me, the perfect combination in a man is:"
He's made a place for himself.
"He does his share of housework, and in terms of sex, he takes the lead."
That's just me.
I need a man like that.
"Someone I can do whatever I want with is, sexually, not for me."
- I can go like this.
"-Yeah, do that."
- How does that feel on the toe?
- Good.
Good.
Why don't you walk around in them?
- Did you want to try these on?
"- No, I'm just driving him."
- So those are comfortable?
- I guess so.
"I mean, they kind of rub my ankles, but all shoes do that."
I have low ankles.
"You think you deserve that pain, but you don't."
- I don't think I deserve it.
"- Well, not consciously maybe."
My ankles are just low.
People think foot pain is a fact of life... but life is actually better than that.
I'll say.
You should get some.
Your whole life could be better.
Starting right now.
I can't believe I got these shoes.
"And they're exactly like my old shoes, except they're pink."
"I don't need these, and they're not orthopedic."
But you seemed to believe everything he said.
Yeah.

He was very professional.

"Easy, killer. it's just me."
"Bo, what happened?"
- What's wrong?
What did Samir say?
- Not very much.
"Nothing, actually."
"I'm sorry, Jenny."
"When I got there, Samir was dead."
"Olivia, she's kind of insane."
She got there first.
I was too late.
No.
No.
No.
- No.
No.
- I don't deal well with hysterical.
"Bo, what are you doing?"
"I'm taking the edge off, I think."
You're not even the prettiest woman in this car.
That couldn't be further from the truth!
"Okay, look, the editor's gonna be here any minute."
We still don't have an idea for this book.
Don't panic.
Maybe he'll be late.
"Oh, my God, he's not late."
"And the advance he gave us was huge, and we've already spent it."
What?
I didn't get any money.
You've only been working here a day.
Don't get greedy.
You know what?
I'll stall him.
"Anderson, how lovely to see you."
"This is my collaborator, Melanie."
- Hello.
- Listen.
"We could do that whole dance, but let me just bottom-line this for you."
Melanie and I just need a little...
"Victoria, you better not be asking for another extension."
You and Melanie have had two years.
Two?
"Extension, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Delay this idea that is going to change children's literature forever?
"If anything, we need less time."
Fantastic.
I want to hear it after I take this.

"- Oh, yes."

-How much longer is that gonna take?
-About six minutes.

- Yes!
Exactly.
"Almost, which means we're all just fine."
You aren't the least bit upset?
It's gonna take more than that to ruin a morning that started with a whipped-cream smile on my waffle.
"Okay, it may have affected me a little, but sometimes it's hard to know what you're feeling."
You got a lot of hell on your plate.

That man in the woods when you were eight.
The one that took you in that shed.
He wasn't from another planet.
He was just mean and crazy.
You shut up about that.
"You're just going to hurt more people, that's all."
It's not going to make what happened to you go away.
Shut up!

Old Jonah dragged him off his horse and throwed him down.
Then the Negro followed him down the street.
-That's when he killed him.
-So you... .
-You actually saw him do it?
"-No, sir."
I come around the comer by the feed lot and there was Jonah.
His face was mushed in and there was blood all over.
He was deader than a hammer.
Did you see the murder take place?
"I'd have said so, wouldn't I?"
That's when I seen that fella there galloping out of town.
I drawed down on him and I told him to halt.
There was blood on his hands.
I didn't see it happen neither.
Sit down.
"Gentlemen of the jury, consider the facts here."

No.

How?

"Oh, if only there were enough weekends between now and the cruise,"

She's gonna have us all killed.
I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to make that call.
"My people have a very old-fashioned, Cold-War slant on things."
It's not right...keeping something like this secret as I'm sure everyone here would agree.

How do you know she's not one of them?

"- Okay, see you later."
- Good news.
I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
That is good news.
Bye.
"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced center combat-area problem?"
Five words:
transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
That... that's brilliant.
It's what I do.
"But wait, there's more."
I also invented two new chess pieces.
The serpent...
and the old woman.
"Okay, now I have to ask."
What do they do?
"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves."
All right.
"Unless... it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress:"
"a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
Elegant.
That's because it's simple.
"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
And...
And what?
And a third person.
It's three-person chess.
I keep daydreaming about the stuff that I wanted to do.
Get really drunk at a college party.
Go windsurfing.
Get married and have kids.
Stupid stuff like that.
It's not stupid.
Even after I got really sick I kept talking myself into believing that I had more time.
At least enough to do some of those things.
Sean Simmons?
You know what?
Hold on a second.
"Sean, I can't get you into college, and windsurfing's nuts."
But you know what?
"Come on, let's get out of here."
- For real?
"- Yeah, come on."
Not unless you have someplace else to go.
- I'm supposed to get him home.
"- Yeah, could you call his mom for us?"
- Tell her we went on a date.
- I'll have him back by curfew.
Maybe.
Say maybe.
Abby.
Abby.
"Listen, I got ahold of Sonia Riley and I told her to call you here if she hears from Eric."
I'll keep my eye open for messages.
Can you get this banana bag to that guy?
My leg-splint girl's screaming.
The Soupbox for lunch?
"Oh, you' re busy."
We could go to that place across the street.
"Although, all of you will have to be out of here by then."
- Where should I go?
Should I make myself invisible?
- Well I think It's cool here...
"No doors, wild."
"Tell me, how did you find this place?"
"Angie, three schnapps, and no objections!"
"Okay, my last offer... 150 per show, and only if it works."
Why wouldn't it work?
You never know.
And what happens if it doesn't work?
God damn it!
Don't you start up again with me.
Yes or no?
I just want to have it cleared up.
This guy's got an issue earning money.
"He's in debt, fiddles around on his show for a year  lives from nothing, and he gets stuck on the fine print."
Thanks.
"Alfons, you're my uncle."
You can't do anything about that and neither can I.
"I'm sorry to say this but  every time you get an opportunity, you blow it."
He's got a point.
Fuck you.
I think we got him.
"Ah, a tent!"
I haven't gone camping in a while.
Fine.
We got a lot done today.
"Got a lot done, but for what?"
For what?
Well good night then.
Can I sleep here?
Hey.
Speaking Japanese
speaking Japanese you should have bought American.
Speaking Japanese
"hey, guys how's it going?"
Come on in.
Right this way.
So you guys want to hear a joke?
So there is this little boy.
He finds a welders mask.
"Get out of the Van, fucker, slowly."
Let's go jerk off.
So the kid is walking down the street and this old mans pulls over and offers him a ride.
"Come on, Mike, not that joke, Jesus."
That joke is older than fire.
That joke is older than fire.
"So the old man leans over and says, so have you ever heard of falatio?"
And the kid says no.
So they drive another mile or two.
"The guy leans over and says, hey, have you ever head of sodomy?"
"The kid rips off his mask and says, look man, I'm not a welder."
I guess you had to be there.
"Ok, OK, now let's see the Booty."
Let's see what he got here.
"Fully automatic, who did the conversions?"
Right.
Never mind.
That's it.
"That's the ticket, come on."
"Get down, get down."
"Take it, take it!"
Shoot him!
"But you're notable now, and that helps."
We're so excited you accepted.
The new book is really terrific.
"Oh, boy."
I wish somebody here would say something mean.
- Mean?
- Or honest.
It's unlikely that everybody here has nothing but praise.
It's not real.
I don't like how this is starting.
These are decent people.
(MOCKINGLY) They just want to be your friend.
"I know, that's the problem."
Sorry to bother you again.
- Is there trash in here?
"- Yes, I'm right here."
(LAUGHS)
Hey.
It's Philip.
You look like you're asleep with your eyes open.
I didn't even see you there.
You were looking right at me.
You were right.
This place is beautiful.
You sure you don't want any of these?
Brought you a whole box.
I'd rather just look around and stare at people.
I was surprised you called me.
I didn't see any way that I couldn't.
Things are pretty hectic with my new book and everything.
That's pretty cool.
"No, it's not cool."
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm notJeffrey.
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.
I mistookyou for my friend.
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
"Yes, Mrs John... 9 years!"
Since the end of the war all my stage equipment has been here.
Ever since I saved it from the beautiful Glogau.
And for what?
...Oh well.
Bruno?
What have you been up to with Selma up there?
Do you think I'm crazy?
How do I know what you are and what you're not!
I don't want to know anything!
I always keep my eyes shut.
Because you're my brother.
You already allowed that to happen once with a minor..
If that gets out!
What gets out is up to you.
And I also know what else cannot get out...
Sometimes I ask myself why I don't tell Karl everything.
"There'll be a big washing-up, and then I'll be rid of the eternal fear."
"You won't do that, Anna."
You know very well what'll happen!
"Good evening, Miss."
You have visitors!
Mrs John!
- I've been to the doctor.
"- Yes, he has already called."
Everything is fine.
You're as fit as a fiddle.
It can be any day now.
Any day...
Did you tell him that I must go back before it comes?
"Yes, I told him that."
But I won't go back!
- Yeah.
She's been emailing me.
Here.

Piper murdered Riley Marra months ago.
You've been getting emails from a dead girl.
"Okay, no, it's not a crush."
I'm just a little obsessed with his podcast.
(CHUCKLES)
But he was with Riley.
- That was so sad.
"- Now, he's always with Audrey."
"Although, after that video last fall, I guess guys aren't really her thing."
Did you see it?
Who would even post something like that?
Mean people who don't think.
"In other news,"
I definitely think there's something we can do about this whole Noah situation.
"- No, Brooke, please."
I really don't...
- (PHONE VIBRATES)
"- Ugh, unknown numbers drive me nuts."
Hello?
- _
MAN:
"That, in black ink, my love may still shine bright."
"Okay, you are blocked on all social media, phones, even the telegraph, Branson, and you're blocked for a reason."
"I miss you, Brooke, and I heard that you broke up with Jake,"
- so I wanted to...
"No, hey, so you're a little on edge."
A giant glass spear in the back will do that to a guy.
It's not a spear.
"What is it, more of a spike or a skewer ?"
"Dude, you're doing a terrible job of trying to keep my mind off the pain."
"You're supposed to talk about something else, not the thing causing the pain."
"True, but the real question is, what are you doing to keep my mind off of your pain ?"
'Cause right now you're not looking too good and I'm starting to feel...
What was that ?
"Uh, seems like we hit something."
"Oh, God, not a body."
"All right, well, pull over or something."
"All right, go out and check,"
I guess.
With the zombies ?

You guys are amazing.
"Uh, no."
We're not.
No.
It's just something we do.
I used to sing that to Kaitlin when she was little and scared.
But maybe he's what we need to mix with our blood now that we've lost belle Reve and have to go on without belle Reve to protect us.
"Oh, how pretty the sky is."
I ought to go there on a rocket that never comes down.
"Which way do we go now, stella?"
This way?
"No, hon, this way."
The blind are leading the blind.
Red hots!
Are you going upstairs and tell her to cut that out?
"If I go up, I won't come down."
Let's just forget it.
Remember that night she poured boiling water through them cracks in the floor?
I gotta go home pretty soon.
"-Come on, what do you say?"
"-No, I'm out."
"Every time you win a big pot, you're out like stout."
I got a sick mother and she don't go to sleep...
-...until I get in.
-What do you say?
I'm gonna wash up.
-stella?
"-Yes, Eunice?"
You tell them guys the kettle's on the stove.
I'm gonna break up the game.
-What did she mean by that?
-She'II pour it straight through the cracks.
"stella, wait."
Wait till I powder.
I feel so hot and frazzled.
-Do I Iook done in?
-You look as fresh as a daisy.
One that's been picked a few days.
By whom?
By Yagi.
By Takao.
You surprise me.
Isn't your husband in Kyoto?
But Takao might be watching for us.
That kid is his father's son.
He doesn't like ballet.
He wouldn't be at the theatre.
So everything is just fine with you?
I don't think that we're doing anything that should make us afraid of people.
I thought that someone was watching us the whole time.
It sounds like you're getting hysterical.
Maybe.
I shouldn't be seeing you.
"This place has changed a lot, too, hasn't it?"
"During the war, Takao and Shinako used to come here to get grass and dirt."
"When they came home, Yagi used to clean them off."
Yagi was like that back then.
Let's not talk about Yagi.
Shall we go to Ginza to get something to eat?
I said I'd meet Shinako at 6:00.
She's coming back from her performance in Sendai.
Wouldn't it be alright if I came along to meet Shinako?
I'll see you some other time.
It's difficult for me to be with you today.
Come in!
Is my mother here?
"Yes, she's waiting upstairs."
Mother?
Welcome back.
Sorry I'm late.
"Aw, Serena finally has"
The perfect relationship with her daddy.
But will her dream come true be Rufus' worst nightmare?
"Oh, of course."
The theme of this evening seems to be torture.
"You're not a fan of, uh, university galas?"
Quite the opposite.
I'm in my natural habitat.
It's torture because it's at Columbia.
"And by some cruel Twist of fate, I go to N.Y.U."
It's like being locked out of lanvin
On the day they get fall in.
"Sorry, I don't mean to ramble on."
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Wait.
I know that name.
"You read ""Gossip Girl""?"
"No, I read college applications."
I work in the admissions office at Columbia.
I was just looking at your application today.
I'm sorry?
"Look, it's, um, it's not our policy to do this,"
"But e-mails go out tomorrow, and you're standing right here,"
"So welcome to Columbia, Blair Waldorf."
"Champagne, please."
Whoa.
Are you okay?
You got crazy eyes.
I think I just became a Columbia student...
For real.
It doesn't make any sense.
I
"Yeah, I understand that."
"- Uh, how old are you, young lady?"
- Nineteen.
Yeah.
"Well, probably mostof you think I'm a real S.o.B. I knowthat."
- [Murmuring Agreement]
- I understand howyou feel.
"But, you know, I want peace too."
- But peace with honor.
- [Girl] What does that mean?
[Quiet Murmuring]
"Well, you can't have peace withouta price."
"Sometimes you have to be, uh, willing to fightfor peace... and sometimes to die."
Yeah?
Tell that to the G.I. S who are going to die tomorrow in Vietnam.
[Girl] What lets you kill women and children?
Whatyou have to understand is we're willing to die forwhat we believe in.
- [Girl] That's right.
- [Boy] It's the truth.
Yeah.
"Look, thatman up there, he lived in similartimes."
"Oh, he had chaos, civil war, hatred between the races."
- [Boy] This is all bullshit.
- Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room... atthe White House and just pray.
"But, you know, Liberals... act like idealism belongs to them."
That's nottrue.
No.
My family... went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.
My grandmother was an abolitionist.
"Itwas Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown,"
- [Impatient Murmuring]
"- Uh, to abolish slavery."
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
"Uh, yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
The principal wanted to see me?
No...
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Or for whoever's controlling him?
"Oh, my god."
"Sean.Sean, you all right?"
"Holy shit, mike, he's pissing blood."
"All right, call an ambulance."
Sean?
"- Hey, franc."
- Hey.
Lot of iron on that bar.
"What is that, 200, 240?"
"Oh, I don't know, maybe 280 on a good day."
"Animale, this kid, huh?"
Yeah.
"Got a proposition for you, franco."
Yeah?
"Well, I'm very flattered, lou, but I don't believe in gay marriage."
- Hilarious.
- This kid cracks me up.
"No.Now look, we saw you beating the heavy bag into submission the other day."
"We were wondering, maybe you ever thought about stepping into the ring."
- Boxing?
"- No, bullfighting."
What are you doing?
"Look, I cornered a couple of fighters back in the day, and i think you got potential."
- You got a thunderous left.
"- Thanks, lou."
"You, uh, you used to be a boxing trainer?"
"Yeah, indeed I was."
I took joltin' joel johansson to the department title back in '86.
He had a brief but minorly successful golden gloves run.
No shit.
You guys talking about slow joel johansson?
"Want to mind your business, tommy?"
"Is that why last night, when I asked you to honka-honka me..."
- you only honka'd me?
- I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
"- Thanks, baby."
- Mmm.
Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
"I'm sorry, bro."
I totally overreacted.
You think?
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
And wait...
You-You forgive me?
Absolutely.
"Hey, I got a couple cee-gars."
Get over here!
"All right, so where are those cee-gars?"
We'll break 'em out in a minute.
"Hey, Barn."
- Ted?
"- Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say ""bro-in-law""?"
Shut up.

"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
Those words had been dancing around my head all night.
"I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase."
"Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses, they'll know."
It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's who was first credited with the line.
He would shout it every time he dealt blackjack.
"That was over 40 years ago, and the words still catch."
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
There it is!
"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
"Yeah, try it."
I had heard it at least 14 times that night.
I couldn't lose.
"First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal."
"There were certain institutions and people that frowned upon it, but it's legal."
And not everyone can do it.
Just those with gifted minds.
I have a gifted mind.
That's what got me into all this mess.
"I was counting cards and I was up over $640,000."
All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.
"Well, that's all right."
I've been winning and losing for years.
"George, this was found snagged on the shed where you made the tea."
Got any ideas?
Yeah.
That woman that Henry had a spat with at the party last night.
"She was wearing a cardigan, same colour as that."
Iris Lightman?
Is that her name?
"Thank you, George."
I'm sure we'll have you out of here very shortly.
"Of all the secretaries I know,"
Jean is definitely one of the most obliging.
Interesting?
I'm afraid so.
All right.
I did go to that flower garden this morning.
I wanted to punish Henry Lee for not speaking up.
"Punish him how, Iris?"
By hitting him with a spade.
A spade?
Yes!
"But as I stood there in that garden shed,"
"I realised it wasn't going to solve anything, was it?"
So I left.
That's it?
Yes.
OK.
So this is what really happened.
You put hemlock in Henry's teacup and then set up George Hammond for the crime.
I don't know any George Hammond.
"Come on, Iris, make this easier on yourself."
Where would I get hemlock?
How would I know which cup to put it in?
"What's the matter, Sweetie?"
Wow.

"I think from here on out, it's you and I till the end."
"No, these space condition reports are recent."
"There is an odd smell, sort of sickly sweet."
"Yes, there is something."
"Could be the change of atmosphere, a different recycle system to that of the Liberator."
"No, it's more than that I can't place it."
"All right, shall we get on with it?"
"You go on down towards the stern,"
Cally and I'll work up towards the flight deck.
"Right, I'll just contact Vila."
- Are you awake?
- No.
That's what I thought.
It's very quiet here.
"If it should get noisy, I'll be in touch."
It's that same smell again.
- The girl's alive.
- So's this one.
The pulse is strong.
No visible sign of injury.
- D'you think they're drugged?
- What?
They could be drugged.
Possibly I don't know possibly.
They're certainly in a coma of some sort.
"No, it's no good."
"We'll we need the Cally, that's it."
"Cally, wake up!"
- Alone.
"- Yes, Cally!"
What?
It's Sonovapour Tranquillising gas Gas?
That's why we're so sleepy.
"OK, he admitted it but there was never any evidence."
"Oh, Mark, come on."
He was seen in the area the night Jesse went missing.
- He killed 4 other children.
"- No, no."
His other victims was older.
It's a different MO.
"- He admitted it, Mark."
- Tell me then why does everyone keep on talking like he's suddenly gonna turn up one day
Because of your mother.
Why do you think we don't live together anymore?
Because she can't move on.
"Now look, he is dead, Mark."
Jesse is dead.
And this is... ?
We have to do a 100.
"Every hour, on, the hour."
I need you to double-check these forensic results.
"Why, what's the problem?"
The problem is they don't make any sense.
Can you stop that?
We've had a DNA hit from the Missing person database.
- From a kid that went missing in 1995.
- What?
"Yeah, so how about you you stop pressing with your boyfriend and check it again?"
Thanks.
Is that Pru?
"Yep, under her married name."
Pru Carew.
"Yeah, it's unfortunate."
"Oh, to think she could have been Mrs. Mark Wells married to a hot-shot lawyer."
And we're back in the playground.
Sometimes.
"Yeah, you get to move around, change of scenery, meet new people."
Well...
I never thought of it that way.
You seem like a real people person.
Oh.
Outgoing.
Not like me.
No?
Thanks.
I bet you're really good at it.
"Well, there's only one way to find out."
"Boy, am I glad to hear you say that... because it's the one subject he's having trouble with."
You think you could fit him in?
"""Him?"""
Frank.
Frank?
Are you kidding?
At his age?
"Well, I'm afraid if he doesn't learn it now, he's never going to."
"You know, I would teach him myself, but I'm way out of practice."
Ah!
Oh.
Um...
"You know, you should never have to practice."
"Well, that's easy for you to say."
You're a professional.
"But for us laymen, if you don't use it, you lose it."
"Well, how long has it been, you know, since you... used it?"
Oh...
"I use it a little bit every day, you know-- the bank, the grocery store-- but it, you know..."
"It's probably been a good ten, 15 years since I was any good at it, you know."
- Seth.
You're in my room.
- Yeah.
- How'd you get in here?
"- I, uh, took a left at the grotto, and I hopped the funicular to the dumbwaiter."
This is a... nic
"- So, what are you doing in here?"
"- Well, when I have a problem, Marissa, I like to talk about it incessantly."
"Yeah, no, that's it."
"I just think I burned out anyone else who will listen, so..."
- Is now a bad time?
- I'm game.
So...
"I think I really messed things up with Summer last night, hurt her pretty bad."
"- Yeah, you did."
"- Okay, not going to sugarcoat this one, huh?"
- Not for you.
"Look, if you really want to be her friend..."
then maybe you should think about just apologizing.
"- You know, say you were sorry."
"- Yeah, no, I know."
- Sounds so simple when you say it.
- I think that's a good place to start.
Okay.
"Uh, do you happen to know where Summer is right now?"
I just have this thing that I've got to tell her.
"- Yeah, she's at the club having lunch with her dad."
"- Oh, yeah, her father."
"Cool, well, I'm just going to, you know..."
"Whoa, Seth, you know what?"
Don't go there now.
"Just, uh, give her some space."
- What about supper?
- Don't worry about me.
I'II have a fiddle in the shed.
We'II get a takeaway later.

Looks like they're closing early tonight.
- so you do care a little bit -- a very little bit.
- what?
no!
i didn't ask my mama to leave me this place.
- so why didn't you sell it?
- 'cause.
- 'cause why?
"- 'cause i just didn't, okay?"
kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes.
- what'd you say?
i couldn't hear you.
"- i said it kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes -- big, fat, hairy deal."
- let's go.
"- oh, come on."
like i don't see this [chuckles] guy enough every day.
- all right. i got you.
"you're looking for something adventurous and sexy, right?"
"i got you this sporty model -- very popular, top-of-the-line."
- it is a beautiful machine.
"- oh, yeah."
- but i'm looking for something a little more family-oriented.
- oh!
got you!
"little lady prego, huh?"
huh?
"- uh, no. no."
- [chuckles]
"- but i have plenty of cash for a down payment, so..."
- ohh!
what an idiot!
who tells a car salesman they have a pocket full of cash?
"- but did you notice he was looking for something ""family-oriented""?"
"Terrans, Methuselah's, and all of the Empire follow her lead."
"Education isn't limited by birth or wealth, as it is in the Outer World."
Terrans and Methuselah's are all equal before Her Majesty.
Equal...
The two races coexist before Her Majesty's absoluteness.
That is why the Empire is so prosperous and peaceful.
But what if something ever happened to the empress?
If anything ever happened...
it would spell the end of everything.
Esther!
Are you hungry?
You haven't eaten for an entire day...
"Oh, now that you mention it..."
Let us go buy something to eat!
Where could that Seth girl have wandered off to?
!
Honestly!
Who's there?
!
"Looks like you've completely recovered, Ion."
R-Radu?
!
"Nice to see you again, Ion."
Impossible...
You're supposed to be dead!
Dead?
Don't be silly.
Then how could I possibly be standing here?
Have you set me up yet again?
!
You've already killed my grandmother and framed me for it...
Is that how much you hate me?
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
"You felt that, right?"
I couldn't have performed if I did.
"Don't you see, Ted?"
We had a bro-nnection.
"All right, I got to know what she looks like-- show me a picture."
"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."
"Okay, here she is."
Okay.
Scrolling up.
"Oh, yeah, those are"
"""plow me"" heels."
Nice.
Uh-huh.
The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up to those 20-year-old ta-tas.
"Oh... gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
"Now, let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face."
Mm-hmm.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone,"" am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"That's my sister, Ted!"
"Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you!"
This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York,"
"Ted, and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.
I thought you'd learned that lesson when you lost your daughter.
She made it as far as the tunnels before she was shot.
No!
So much tragedy for one man to bear... and now your foolishness has condemned another innocent woman.
Take the others back for questioning.
I'll interrogate this one myself.
No!
I won't let you hurt her!
Caylem!
Ralkana... he said you'd been shot.
"He was lying to you, Father."
I'm all right.
And your mother?
She's fine.
She was so happy to get your letters.
She wanted me to tell you something.
She forgives you.
We both do.
My sweet girl.
Captain.
I'm coming.
No one will forget what he did here today.
I'll make sure of that.
Chakotay to Transporter Room 2.
Do we have them?
"We're all back, Commander."
Take us out of here.
Gladly.
"Lieutenant, you heard her."
"The warp drive is functioning normally, and we'll have the main deflector back on line tomorrow."
"Yes, thank you, Mr. Kim."
"Captain, are you all right?"
- I don't know how.
"Ma'am, come to this window."
Do you know Peppe?
Are you crazy?
What did I do?
"Go home, if the director sees you..."
So peaceful.
They're all happy to have you here.
"And you, everything alright at work?"
I can't complain.
Can I tell you something?
Why get involved in...
You can ruin...
Are you married?
"Yes, we have a beautiful 8-year-oId son."
Yourwife didn't come.
"No, because..."
"We'd given up on children, an incredible joy, but since he was born silvia's become apprehensive, depressed, if I'd brought herhere..."
"Why, it's depressing here?"
She might get overit.
Of course.
"The move, school, packing..."
An outsider coming to the South cries when he arrives and when he leaves.
"It's true, when I came here I was upset."
- Just imagine when you leave!
- I don't think so.
"I'm fine here, but my home is up there."
"I Iike the fog, the people, the chaos."
Things you can't understand.
Coffee break.
- Good?
- Like only in naples.
"- It's an honor, sir."
- I've been meaning to have you up here for some time.
- Really?
Excuse me.
Willie?
"Thank you, Willie."
"Yeah, you betcha."
You unseated that old bastard Bettis.
He must've voted against me 70 percent of the time.
You know what this is?
That's a shark steak sandwich.
Fucking shark steak.
- You want half?
"- Uh, no, thank you."
- Are you a vegan?
Had lunch?
- No.
Uh...
So you choose not to break bread with the president of the United States?
Thank you.
"When I was in the Senate, Bettis could always be counted to leave half a grand at the poker table."
"Always stayed in, never folded."
Always wanted that miracle card.
"- That's good, isn't it?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Now, Truman, he was a poker player."
"Damn fine one, as I understand it."
"Son, I understand you may be making a mess of our plans... to put Laine Hanson into the vice president mansion."
"Right now, sir, I cannot see supporting Laine Hanson."
- How old are you?
"- Me, I'm 28."
"And at that age and experience, you think you're the one to sit and judge Mrs. Hanson?"
No matter what happens in life don't let their be any rift in your friendship.
- Promise?
- Promise!
I promise too!
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
What have you ordered for?
Aam...
late...
Omlette!
But why are you talking of eating?
Didn't you go home?
Your mother must have fed you to your heart's content!
Couldn't you have brought some food for me too?
I don't eat the stale food of this place.
- l feed it to the customers.
- What?
- Did you meet your brother?
"- No, I am on my way."
Come along?
I have to visit the shrine today.
- Gosh!
I had forgotten!
- Did you see?
"He forgot, he says!"
"Some day, he will forget his friend for his brother's sake."
- Such things happen.
- How can you say that?
What will you do if you are required to choose between...
- ...your friend and brother?
- l will tell you what to do!
If you talk like this I will break the heads of both of you.
- Stay out of this.
- No.
The government does watch us.
You got microwaves and satellites.
"I'm with you, man."
- Do not agitate him.
- Screw you.
"Dr. Bryar, answer the phone."
My old man used to have tracking devices in his cars.
"He said it's for theft, but it's so he can find out where I go."
And what about personal recordings in televisions?
You don't think someone's monitoring everything you watch?
You know how many patents are issued for devices to monitor people?
"Look it up, man."
"Here he comes, Ted."
He's the agent who's playing the hero.
"Answer the phone, Ted."
- Stop this.
It isn't going to help.
- What the hell do you know?
"Ted, he doesn't know what he's talking about."
- He's just a kid.
- Who you calling a kid?
Sit down!
"Oh, now you're going to tell me what to do?"
He'd only have one gun if you weren't here.
"- I'm with you, man."
"- He's not with us, Ted."
He's not with us at all.
"Answer the phone, Dr. Bryar."
It's the Higher Authority.
"They're coming for you, Ted."
"Whatever, corn chip man."
You got a problem with that?
"No, but..."
It's kind of low rent in the era of the cronut.
"""Cronuts""?"
What's a cronut?
Imagine a croissant had a baby with a doughnut.
"- Oh, that sounds like a delicious baby."
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, let's go right now."
"The only bakery that makes them is, uh, a few blocks away."
Fresh cronuts...
Full day's calories in one bite.
I can't.
I-I'm swamped.
I can't leave.
You always say that.
"You know, the only time I see you is when I come here."
"Well, I-I practically live here."
You're gonna have to deal with that.
At some point... soon...
"You're gonna have to let me take you on a proper date so we can, you know, move this thing forward."
Thing?
What thing?
"Hey, hey!"
Nice!
"Dad, you look tired."
Would you like to lie down?
"Well, I am tired a little bit after chemo, but I'm stronger than I have been."
Being with you and Jackson is the best medicine I've got.
This new treatment sounds so hopeful.
It is.
Ah!
"If only I had my wallet, I wouldn't have inconvenienced you like this!"
"Once I get my wallet back, I'll pay you back."
Teacher Gil...
Did you get scolded a lot?
It's because I'm so upset!
You have no idea how dashing and what a gentleman my Yoon Jae is!
You made people say that he's an idiot...
It's because I'm sorry and upset for Yoon Jae!
Go home and stay there quietly.
Don't go around again and cause more trouble.
If you need something...
I'll get it for you.
You'll get it?
Forget it!
"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it."
Go home.
"Don't go anywhere else, okay?"
Does she know how nice these clothes are?
Anything I wear is a total killer.
I only look like an idiot because I'm wearing it in this body.
Well...
"When I get my wallet back, I'll dress him like this."
Yoon Jae...
It would be nice if I could see you before I left.
Your call cannot be connected...
Um...
Can I found out what room Patient Kang Gyung Joon is in?
Room 560.
Okay.
Hey.
Doctor Seo's really different today.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"See you tomorrow, Tia."
We'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"Let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
You will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done by the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch Mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?
By energizing matter.
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow?
"Yes, sir."
"Please, continue to pack up."
Don't worry about us.
We have about 30 minutes left.
I'm... sorry.
I'll pay you back for the flyers.
- How... much is it?
"- It's probably around 30,000 won."
"Hey, give me 10,000 won."
"Kid, you should do your job right next time, okay?"
There are times when good guys get the short end of the stick.
But still...
I'm not really wasting my life away...
"Like Park Seon Woo said, am I?"
You're working very hard to clear the names of those wrongfully accused.
"This may be the time in your life, during which you shine the brightest."
Let's go.
"Oh, yes..."
He didn't show up?
He didn't call either?
I understand.
We will withdraw.
Yes.
The suspect must have had a change of heart.
- You got lucky this time.
- Yes.
Start being a decent citizen.
Hello.
"As I told you before, I found a good restaurant for you."
I'm thankful for your concern...
But I'll just stay here.
Mother...
If you continue to stay here...
Functional disorder in nature... and man.
I have to get through to people's hearts somehow.
"What is your heart telling you, Sire?"
The result of solar storm.
"Sire, all flights were cancelled."
"I know that, Carlos."
But there is a way.
What is it?
"Lili, stop it!"
I won't!
Take a look at yourself!
What is your problem?
That's a disgrace!
We have to try and be modern.
Modern?
"We are folk singers, after all."
So what?
It's the right thing to do!
"Come on, stop all that nonsense already!"
- I won't!
- What do you mean?
!
"Sire, I can't take responsibility for this mockery."
"I understand, Ludovic."
Please try to be more feminine.
That is pure madness!
"I agree, but the decision has been made."
There are no other options.
We take it or we leave it.
We can't neglect the protocol and security measures.
It's risky indeed.
There is always a risk.
Blake?
(melissa) I've caught blake and holly
One-on-one several times.
"(blake) when melissa walks in,"
That's not really the threesome I had in mind.
(jake) everybody will eventually stab you in the back
"For $250,000."
"(gia) this is (bleep), this game."
Graham backstabbed me.
(crying) I'm not losing my friend
Because of something I did.
You guys all had a preconceived notion of who I was.
"Honest to god, I really think it's (bleep)."
(crying) just tell me what happened.
You're okay.
(woman) this is crazy.
Everything is about to change here tonight.
"(erica) oh, my god."
"Oh, my god."
"It's all coming up right now on ""bachelor pad."""
(woman) that was the most shocking exit
"In ""bachelor pad"" history."
(kasey) I have control of this game.
Justin and alli were both going back and forth to both sides.
They had to go home.
(erica) I felt bad for alli a little bit.
"She looked sad like she was, like, fighting tears."
"(kasey) if you don't choose a side,"
You're gonna get canceled.
(woman) she went out gracefully.
She did.
"(kasey) 2 down, 16 to go."
What was your mission?
To have fun.
And drive the wheels off it.
That takes serious effort.
You have ruined it!
They were new!
I should've got some second-hand ones.
Running an old knacker is a good idea because track days aren't covered by road insurance.
If I wanted to get insurance it'd be around £120 for the day.
So I go out without it.
"If you broke it though, stick it in a ditch and go, ""Look!"
"What happened? "" I've heard that happens."
Yes...
I've seen cars pushed onto the road.
This is the Palmer Jaguar.
A track day thunderbolt.
And a more fitting remedy for a man who had once proclaimed...
I am a driving god!
Oh my goodness!
This is a properly great car.
It uses the three-litre V6 out of Jaguar's X-Type.
It has 300bhp and it weighs 600 kilos.
"That is very, very light."
"And it means it's very, very fast."
It really can travel at some incredible speeds.
"Straight up to...120, 130."
Absolutely awesome power in this thing.
Turn it in far here.
Use that torque.
The lowdown power.
Come on!
HE LAUGHS MANICALLY Yeeeeeees!
Mmm-hmm.
I'm fine.
"Nothing, huh?"
Doesn't look like nothing to me.
"You got a new tie there, huh?"
Classy.
Gray.
Didn't know that was the new power color.
Strong choice.
Thanks.
Mr. Gates.
"Okay, fellas, we all have a lot of work to get back to, so I'm gonna keep this snappy."
I've looked through all of your proposals.
"And while I think all of you have more than a little something to offer, the proposal that hits the nail on the head is the one that shows the most leadership and vision that is gonna be required to take this company into the future."
"Congratulations, Felzner."
"Thank you, sir."
You are welcome.
And you can move into that new office of yours whenever you'd like.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Mr. Gates?
"Yes, Allan?"
"Listen, you said that you liked my work."
You said that it was strong...
"I said I liked your work, Allan."
And I do.
"Okay, so why am I not getting the promotion?"
"I mean, I've been here longer than Felzner."
"Felzner is the future, Allan."
It's as simple as that.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Don't mess it up.
Son of a...
"Captain, where are we?"
We have reason to believe that the explosive was a diversion.
Diversion from what?
An armed team has taken over the White House.
Do we have the president?
I spoke to Walker.
He had eyes on Eagle.
Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.
Radio chatter indicated they were headed for the PEOC.
No contact.
We have to assume they've been compromised.
We gotta get you to a phone.
Call SEAL Team Six and they come in here and they'll shoot these assholes in the head.
- We keep a satphone in the residence.
- Great.
Where's that at?
Of course it is.
- You ever been rock climbing?
- We climbing this?
"Unless you got a better idea, yeah."
"No, I don't."
"By the way, John Cale."
- James Sawyer.
"-I'll get you out of here, sir."
Just follow me up.
"Yeah, I'm right behind you."
Make sure you have one handhold before you let go of the other one.
"- Whatever you do, I'll do."
I ain't doing that shit.
The scene here at the White House is getting more chaotic every second.
The wolf is by nature a pack animal and one of the few proud members of the animal kingdom that mates for life.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
"Hello, Jen."
"Welcome, Jennifer."
Thank you.
"For you, the noble honeybee."
The honeybee is committed.
"And though it may fly from flower to flower, collecting the sweet, sticky nectar' it has no choice but to return to the hive."
Congratulations.
Thank you.
That's a big-ass bee.
"Finally, Ronnie and David."
I have thought long and hard about this.
I could not decide with my mind.
I had to open my soul to the animal spirits.
"And, finally..."
"Okay, the build-up's killing me."
What do we got here?
Two cheetahs?
Couple of eagles?
You got two lions?
The ass.
You are the ass.
Stubborn and immovable.
The mighty ass tirelessly bears the heavy burden of others.
"But when the ass is on the move, nothing can stop the ass."
Be an ass for your marriage.
Be an ass for your children.
Be an ass for love.
"Thank you, Marcel."
I'm gonna be the biggest ass you've ever seen.
"A double espresso, and make it quick!"
I'm just about done with the glasses.
Did I ask her if she's done with anything?
No.
Why would she inform me then?
That's just her way.
This way of hers is starting to get on my nerves!
You must be Max.
I've got the 503 for you.
503.
- I don't need a room.
This is a beautiful room.
You don't have to sign anything.
Everything is for free.
It's very intimate here.
You're among friends.
What should I do with them?
Did you sleep well?
Your keys please.
Hand them over!
I'll hang them up  until you come back.
That's how it's done in hotels.
My name is Tom.
You can call me Tom.
Campaign of solidarity...
Give me the keys!
There's breakfast upstairs in the cafeteria.
I'd have a problem just simply asking...
I just couldn't come out...
- That's why I have this 10 Euro bill for you.
"- I found it, and would like to give it you, because you need money..."
That way we can approach one another  for both my sake and yours.
Partner!
THE ILLUSION OF FEAR
- Any problems?
-The entrance is closed.
"It must be opened, then."
It's not possible.
We're waiting for a government delegation.
But we're running late!
I'll see to that now.
What are you doing?
You!
I told you we're running late.
Understand?
You can lose your driver's license for that!
You don't have the authority.
We have a charter flight!
I heard you.
But I can't do anything.
OK?
It's not far to the terminal.
You can walk there.
Walk there yourself!
If I let just one car in I'll be fired!
Hey you...
Stop that!
Come on!
It's alright.
I'll walk.
Igor Alexandrovitch?
"King Solomon, the poor of the city are waiting for you with a petition to stop the construction of the altar of sacrifice to Moloch."
The main instigators are here and waiting for your mercy.
"I build altars to all the gods, because a human is weak."
Your unit served in both.
McKinney was there.
No chance McKinney did it.
"Look, the guy doesn't have a alibi."
He's impulsive and he's angry.
He's too angry to have done it.
CAROLINE:
I agree with Booth.
This was controlled.
It took planning.
McKinney's not capable of that.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
Look at those tire marks.
AUBREY:
They're fresh.
Yeah.
"McKinney was parked there, a half block away."
Then it makes sense that these tire marks are from the car that took Aldo.
The tracks run north.
There's a highway on-ramp three blocks away.
No way he took it.
How do you know that?
Because he's planned.
He thinks of everything.
"He's calculated, okay?"
There's no way he's gonna take the highway.
"I mean, there's surveillance cameras all over the place."
CAROLINE:
That explains why we have next to nothing to work with.
"Ah, not true, we know how he thinks."
What does that get us?
"We know that he takes the road less travelled, Aubrey."
The day after tomorrow. you know what you gotta do out there. we've decided to get a little bit of insurance.
Don't fuck it up.
All bets are closed.
All are closed.
are you ready?
Are you ready?
On my mark.
Fight!

That kid just chose his ego over your life.
Can you believe that?
I just can't figure out why... this fuck hole would choose to get his goddamn neck slit to keep a fucking win streak!
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me?
Can you fucking tell me?
Can anybody fucking tell me?
Give it to Jimmy.
Pay 'em their fucking winnings.
I had this little black dog when I was a kid.
We tried like hell but it was so stupid.
Maybe it was retarded.
They got retarded dogs?
I don't know.
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
"Oh, thank you."
I'll see you guys later.
That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you'd get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks.
Maybe later.
"-Gunther, can I get a scone?"
-Want anything?
I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love!
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
The One With The Birthing Video
How do you guys like living together?
-It's been good.
-Yeah.
-Except he's so uptight about crumbs.
-There was a drumstick in the couch.
I'm not uptight about crumbs.
"It's just, crumbs attract mice and mice leave droppings."
And that's how the plague started.
If you wanna relive that again... .
"Mice didn't start the plague, rats did."
"Rattus norvegicus, to be exact."
"Oh, good God, Ross."
"Summer, how come we keep looking for Pancakes when there's a giant elephant in the room ?"
We walk around the elephant.
"It may be big, but we are crafty."
The boys should have been back over an hour ago.
Aren't you worried ?
"No, I'm not worried."
"I'm freaking terrified, okay ?"
That's why I'm focusing on just finding Pancakes and not about the fact that my boyfriend could be laying on the side of the road ravaged by zombies.
"Okay, well, let's go look for them."
In what ?
They took the only car.
Have you thought of that ?
"Well, let's listen to the radio and see if there's any news."
The radio stopped working with the aftershock.
What was that ?
Pancakes ?
Maybe it was Ryan and Seth.
Why would they need to break a window ?
I don't know.
What do we do ?
"Quick, hide !"
Shh !
"No, no, no."
"Summer, wait."
I've got a better idea.
"Summer, come here."
Shh !
You received a makeover under false pretenses.
You lied about having asthma.
Do you even like Bob Seger ?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.
Come on.
It's not much farther.
We're not heading toward any businesses of any kind.
What?
- We have arrived.
- Arrived where?
You are without shame.
"Sookie, you do not have to do this."
What do you mean?
"Feeding my girls, making them happy."
I love doing this.
"Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt."
- It makes me feel guilty.
- Eating can help drown that.
"Yeah, eat."
I'm gonna eat.
"Can the help sit at the table, too?"
As long as they don't sing folk songs or tell bawdy stories.
What's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?
He's not much of a morning person.
"Now say, 'I can't believe I ate the whole thing. '"
It takes him about an hour to become Jackson.
"- Hey, I had a good idea for the wedding."
- Cool.
Instead of wrapped Jordan almonds things at every place setting...
- what if we wrap up a few Aspirin?
- Aspirin?
For the morning-after hangovers.
- That's funny.
- 'Cause Jordan almonds are so done.
"Jackson, what do you think?"
Aspirin over almonds?
What else can I want?
Only the table was missing.
and it is provided now
Don't you like the table?
I don't want a table.
I want my freedom
You expect too much from a barbarian
My dear
He kicked.
Did you feel that?
Yes
Can he hear us?
You can speak.
I guess he hears
What's his name?
First he should born.
Then we will decide
Mihrimah Sultan will get cold.
With your permission I'll bring something for her from inside
"Yes, her hands are cold"
We can go inside if you are cold
But it is so nice here
"Go upstairs, get in the room on the right."
There's a shawl on a box there
What are you doing here?
I was looking for the shawl.
But it is not here
You silly.
Did I tell you to get in here?
"Forgive me, I didn't know"
I wonder why my Sultana hired you
Obviously your mind doesn't work
"- hey, baby."
- hi.
"hope you don't mind, but i charged a few things on your account."
"- [sighs] hey, wink."
can i have a sec?
- yeah.
"- hi, wink."
- hey. [chuckles] hit... and run.
"- i don't know, cind."
we got to watch the spending.
and these scratchers?
"- well, what if we won, though?"
- and donkey soap?
"- no, it's supposed to be really good for your face."
cleopatra used it.
"wayne, you have your whole college fund to fall back on."
[chuckles] come on.
- my mama and daddy saved up that money so i could have a life outside of the trailer park.
"- well, what's wrong with the trailer park?"
- nothing.
"- do you love me, or don't you?"
- of course i do.
that's why i'm still here.
"- well, if you're still here, then let's make the most of it, right?"
can you do me a favor before you get off?
- what?
"- [sighs] apparently, the kids should eat more than just cheez whiz."
can you pick up some food?
thank you.
you're the best.
- [sighs] [drops clipboard]
"- [gasps] [chuckling] oh, my... oh, my rock goodness!"
"No, I'd rather stay."
"The hair brush, please."
Brush her hair.
"Carmela, take the dress off."
Let's hear the news.
Turn on the radio.
"Yes, Prince."
The Duchess is calling.
"Sirs, please follow me."
We are being summoned.
Hare is the Armed Forces radio...
We interrupt our program for an important report.
Mount Vesuvius' sismograph has registered... a sudden rise in volcanic activity.
All commanding officers must report to their bases... for further instructions.
"I repeat, all commanding officers must... report to their bases."
"This night, seeing those unhappy people..."
I have a confession to make.
It isn't easy.
Another time?
"Don't be afraid, we're in Italy."
It was in Italy that confession was born.
"I haven't been honest, Captain."
I wasn't honest.
I'm not here to help the civilian population.
"No, in no way."
I'm here to help Senator Wyatt...
"The President of the USA, the WAC..."
"No, that's a lie too."
I'm here for myself.
"For me, myself, I!"
How?
I don't know.
"We didn't quit until five in the morning, so I stayed over."
"Thank you, sir."
"This friend, sir, the lawyer, where can I reach him?"
SID:
Is this a grilling session?
What am I?
Some kind of suspect or something?
"Nothing personal, sir."
I have to ask these routine questions.
"Well, his name is Leo Hart."
But I think you're gonna have trouble contacting him.
He took the plane for Rome at noon.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're ready to roll.
"Let's do it then, huh?"
Mark!
Why don't you entertain the Lieutenant while we shoot this.
"I'm sure he's seen this, anyway."
Seen it?
He was in it.
"Yeah, you know, Ward is right."
"Time is my business, you know, and I always know it."
"Oh, boy, am I hung-over today."
I'll be glad when this day's over.
"Hey, what time you got, Lieutenant?"
11:00 on the dot.
Are you kidding?
"Jeez, I paid a thousand smackers for this watch."
I lost five minutes overnight.
"Do you mind, sir?"
I have never seen a thousand dollar watch before.
"Boy, that must be solid gold."
"In the parking lot over there, I have to walk a bit."
"All right, then."
"- It comes out to 18,400 won."
- Here.
"Out of 20,000 won, 1,600 won is your change."
"Thank you, good bye."
"Oh, hi."
Noona.
"I didn't want to make dinner, and we don't have any ramyun either."
- You're here?
- Yes.
I don't think we have any of those red bean donuts you like.
Anything is fine with me.
"Honey, pick a variety of ten, I'll pay for it."
Why are you passing over the sausage?
Stop butting in!
Idiot...
I haven't gotten to ten yet.
And what if you never get to ten?
"It's in the order of arrival, pick them in the order they arrived in!"
Really!
Don't even dream of having a husband who you're with all day.
"They go on about how we're such a beautiful couple, my life sucks."
"Thanks, Unni."
I'll be going.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
You don't need to come out!
Why are you coming out?
"Just because, I wanted to get some fresh air."
"You said you were going to take a break, when did you get here?"
"Well, with any luck we may be in Krems by morning."
Maybe even catch a barge up to Linz.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Are you starting that again?
Anybody cover?
Somebody step on that crumb.
"We warned you, Sefton."
Sure you warned me.
You were gonna slit the throat of that stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with.
Only make sure you got the right throat.
We're looking at it.
Hurry up on that door.
"What are you trying to do, gum up the works?"
That's right.
"Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the morning, like Manfredi and Johnson?"
"Look, Sefton,"
I had my hands full keeping these guys from tearing you apart.
"I called it last time, didn't I?"
Are we gonna listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
How do they know?
"You told them, Hoffy."
- Who did?
- You did.
Are you off your rocker?
Uh-huh.
Fell right on my head.
Sprechen sie deutsch?
"No, I don't sprechen sie deutsch."
Maybe just one word?
Kaputt?
There are thousands of other wolves in the world.
Not like these.
Plucky English survivors where wolves have been extinct for hundred of years?
I could sell the movie rights.
I might even play myself.
"Jo, we'll do close-ups back at my place."
Did you not hear?
They're wolves.
Not space wolves or zombie wolves.
- Just regular wolves!
- And this is their home!
So go and write a song about it.
"Thanks for your help,"
I couldn't have done it without you etc.
Hunt's over and it's way past your bedtime.
What is wrong with you?
You're obsessed!
"Yeah, and that means a lot coming from her."
Shannon...
Shannon's friend.
Say goodbye to the puppies.
Because they're going to their new home now.
"Steve, check the map."
Let's figure a way out of this place and away from these kids.
And then go back and secure the crate.
Did you know about this?
What?
That Kyle's an egomaniac who'll trample over anyone to get what he wants?
"I had an inkling, yes, but he just proved it."
- So you let him use us.
- No!
Listen.
Revísenlos‎.
‎
"- Danny‎, give a weapon to Lieutenant‎. ‎"
"- Well‎, I will‎."
"Simms‎, dame una 50th"
"Here it is‎, sir‎."
Where exactly are these Germans‎?
A few miles from here‎.
Very well‎.
"Show us the place‎, Lieutenant‎."
No sign of any German‎.
There are other places that we should review‎.
Good‎.
They will not go so soon‎.
Is a tank‎.
It's about 30 meters east of the road‎.
It is a Panzer ‎.‎.‎.
They leave well hidden ‎.‎.‎.
and always in position to fire‎.
And that is the chief command‎.
Klaus Shonbeck‎.
Is a retired tank commander‎.
Taught in training brigades‎.
Good‎.
"Apparently‎, ‎.‎.‎."
has come out of retirement‎.
"Hey‎, Mitchell‎."
Is everything okay‎?
No ‎.‎.‎. you're just leaking a bit‎.
"You know what they say: ""The old Helcats not leak oil‎."""
Yes‎.
Just mark their territory‎.
No.
Here we go again.
"Yeah, let's just stay away from the flying boxes."
"Yeah, isn't this where we cited the truck?"
"Just up ahead, I think."
"Let's take a look around, okay?"
What about your buddy Getraer?
He won't miss me for another five more minutes.
This is important.
I'll check the divider.
See anything?
You?
The boxes could've jumped the divider.
Could be.
Pull it over.
What's the matter with you boys?
You want to get yourselves killed?
"May I see your driver's license, ma'am?"
"I was so afraid, seeing you."
You boys ought to learn to study those posted signs.
"Ma'am, you were using an off-ramp to get on the freeway."
And no wonder.
With those itty-bitty signs.
"Now, you talk to your police chief."
"Oh, no, no, no."
"We're not L.A.P.D., see, we're State Highway Patrol."
"Well, better yet."
Then talk to the governor.
Watch out.
I'll write this one.
It's all mine.
And you boys stop speeding along on those motor things.
It's Paul's nephew.
Punk.
- What happened?
- Don't know yet.
"Detective Santos was signed out, that we know."
"But he carried no radio, wore no vest."
- Any backup?
- Zero.
Total breach of department policy.
What was the guy doing?
Taking a meeting with a drug dealer?
You got me.
But it adds up to a dead kid and a dead nephew of the head of the Zapatti family.
"Here's a guy headed for Attica on a 10 to 20, and he cops probation."
Probation?
No jail time?
Probation's a sentence in New York these days.
Which he skips out on 2 years later.
We've been looking for him ever since.
The mayor will want to step up for the wife.
I wouldn't do that if I were him.
"And who are you, again?"
Internal Affairs.
Listen we can bury Santos.
"And if it turns out he was dirty, well good cop turns bad."
Happens all the time.
Sure.
"We'll give him a full-dress funeral, to boot."
Who is she?
A lawyer for the Detective's Endowment Association.
I guess she'll be representing Eddie Santos and his family.
- I was wondering when you'd ask.
Would've been better to let him die.
His brother's gone crazy.
We need to call the police.
"Got no oxygen going to his brain, see... 'cause of the rope."
Half of it died away.
Now it don't hardly work no more.
"Better off dead, I reckon."
I need to call the police.
"Master Justin said he didn't need no help, cocking bugger."
Step away from the bed.
"You look after him, right?"
That's your job.
To keep him alive.
"So, if you just put the gun on the bed, and leave the room, you'll just be doing your job, right?"
Please... just go.
"I need a phone, Felix."
Good boy.
Shit.
Justin can help me.
- He says his family will protect me.
- And you believe him?
He's an army man.
Loyalty means a lot to him.
"Excuse me, Luke, in case you hadn't noticed, he's demented!"
He's obsessed with a fucking postcard!
"And you're on the list, remember?"
You are one of the scratched-out faces.
"When he's finished us off, Luke, you're going to be the only one left."
You sent it.
You sent the fucking postcard.
- Shut up.
"- Luke, for fuck's sake!"
All:
Votes for women.
Violets for votes.
[thunder] [wind blowing]
[mouthing]
[sighs] [bell ringing]
"Layout is ready, illustrations are late."
Where are we on print?
Depends on which magazines.
And how much lead time.
"Time, Life, Redbook."
National editions or regional?
What do they have to do with teeth?
- He speaks.
- Excuse me?
What do Chesterfields have to do with teeth?
Dentists recommend them.
"For what, stains?"
This is our first major shot at the cigarette market.
Do you have any idea how big this is gonna be?
"Oh, this big?"
[sighs]
"Mr. Little, people buy cigarettes for their taste, for the quality of the tobacco, not for their teeth."
We've got dentists.
"So, we have to get people to buy Chesterfields because dentists recommend them."
Makes your food taste even better.
The brandy's never been smoother.
Helps settle the stomach.
"Doesn't sound very ""dentisty."""
"And what does sound ""dentisty"" to you, Mr. Fitzgerald?"
Mr. Fitzgerald?
This is...
"Well, I wouldn't be surprised if she was trying to."
She'd better before that Pearl Danvers makes a tramp out of him.
"Lay off, will you?"
I'm through with that dame.
I was out with her to tell her goodbye.
- Yeah?
What did she say when you told her?
"- She said, ""Goodbye."
"Call me up soon. """
"Shame on you guys, wasting your time in idle chatter."
Look at Joe over there.
"Hey, Dombrowski."
"What do you got there, a honyock back scratcher?"
A slide rule to figure out these stress formulas.
What's that got to do with running a lathe?
Nothing.
It's to do with designing one.
Aw.
"Running a lathe ain't good enough for you, huh?"
Now you gotta learn how to design one.
"It ain't your time he's wasting, is it?"
His going to school don't hurt you.
"No, he's always got his nose in a book."
"Well, it's his nose, ain't it?"
And a plenty big one at that.
"- Hey, Cliff, why don't you stop?"
"Hello, fellas."
How are you?
"Hello, Tommy."
I got news for you.
- This came from the division super.
Ahem.
I'm singing on our record and I'm going to play you it on it.
I don't think I like singing.
You're not making a record.
He's not making a record.
He's down there now.
On a bench.
Who?
Tubby.
He's having...
I can't see if it's a pie or a pasty.
I think it's a pasty.
I might go and sit in the sun.
Don't say anything to him.
He's made his point.
I'm not going to say anything to him.
I'm not totally crass.
"So, she told me what you said to her, Enid."
She's just a person.
Bit lonely.
Probably been dumped a few times.
Picked a wrong 'un.
We all make mistakes.
That's why they put rubbers on the end of pencils.
Nobody's perfect.
"I'm fat, so I shouldn't be having a pasty, but I am."
Same with Enid.
And what have you done with your life that's so great?
You're not Albert Schweitzer.
Unless you're running a leper colony of a weekend and keeping that under wraps.
Would it be possible to have a word?
"""I'm the first to wade in when there's been a misdemeanour."
"""Bang."
(SOBS)
"Hey, look, it's going to get better."
Sean?
(inaudible)
(GASPS)
(gasping)
(SCREAMS)
(screaming)
(SCREECHES)
(yelling) No!
allison:
"lfJackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably doesn't know that someone's controlling him."
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
SCOTT:
He'd have to forget everything.
The murder.
allison:
Getting rid ofthe blood.
STlLES:
"But he had help with one thing though, the video."
Maybe someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
allison:
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any ofthis?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
allison:
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
"She doesn't realise that she can have me as well as you lot, but she will and when she does I'll be here, waiting."
You can use the inside toilets from now on if you want to.
Thanks.
"Electricity, 40 a quarter, and I'll get you your rent book."
Hey?
We have to find a way of getting shot of her.
We just have to...
"Sheila, will you..."
"I'm not fighting her any more, Frank."
If she wants the babies she's entitled to that.
"Yeah, but, Sheila..."
"It's too exhausting, hate."
"Anyway, the best woman's won."
"I'm married to you now, there's nothing she can do about that."
And if you love someone set them free.
"I'm sitting you free, Frank."
I'm trusting you.
"Hey, hey."
Hey!
What you doing?
There was too much sunlight yesterday.
I'm feeling a bit insidey outsidey.
Thought I'd make these for myself.
'Squidgy-gate.
Camilla-gate.
'Watergate.
Gareth Gates.
"'I mean, what's it all about, eh?"
All these private secrets?
"'What good does it do, eh, to let them out?"
'All you get's a load of heartache and misery.
"'And what you don't know can't hurt you, that's what I say."
I'm just trying to be normal for once but you ruin everything!
You fucking live to fucking embarrass me!
You don't need any help with that!
Whoring yourself!
No... because I learned from the very best
"Why you never strike me as the jealous type, Irina."
How dare you!
What?
She was crying.
I just sat next to her.
She's my daughter!
I don't want you anywhere near her.
"Oh, what makes you so upset?"
You were never the most trivialist mother.
It doesn't suit you.
I think you should leave.
"I'd like that very much, Jakob."
Leave?
"Yes, leave."
I'm sorry for our misunderstanding.
"Beautiful piece of work, kindly donated by Lorenzo Quid... with the added bonus that he will personally hand deliver it to your home!"
and maybe stay for dinner.
"Ezcellent, let's start the bidding at 90."
Do I have any advances on 90?
"So, any advances on 90?"
"Thank you, Madame!"
Do I see 95?
Why did you do that?
What?
Dominique...
I didn't do.
You know what I mean.
What you thinking?
"Laila, If this deal won't happen then you can't take place your bank's installments."
If the bank's installments would not take place then everything will go.
But you will see from far.
And...
You won't tell anyone about this.
"All right, show me."
"But not here, Then where?"
In your hotel.
All right.
Come.
Tell me who shot the fire?
Fire shot from there and we were here
And you.
"Yes, Madam."
Then come.
Yes!
Madam!
What are you doing?
"A weapon without riot,"
Didn't you fire a shot to him?
"Hey, search him, Yes!"
"If you don't mind, Sir!"
Why you always searching?
You didn't know that police officers didn't leave any chance.
"Do you understand, Come with me to police station."
Why police station?
I live in Ghat Kupar.
"If you do comedy again then I'll kill you, and you'll cry for entire life."
"Madam, your button is open, Catch him."
"Laxminarayan, My money."
Laxminarayan!
Turn around. [all] Super mega final strike.
[all] Super mega star burst. [all] Fire. [grunting] Yes.
"Super mega rangers, that's a super mega win. [Gia] Wow."
It's back to normal.
[Emma] Yeah.
Oh look.
[Emma] Everything looks great.
How is everything?
"Oh, uh, almost back to normal."
Now all we need is a teacher.
Where's Mr. Burley?
Yeah...
Let me take care of that.
Mr. Burley?
Mr. Burley!
Are you okay?
I'm good.
But my crypto-zoological prizes must be saved.
Here.
Let me help you with that.
Phew.
"Thank you, Noah."
How can I ever repay you?
You can get out there and start teaching again.
Your students need you.
Hey.
Mr. Burley.
"Around this time last year, I asked the question, which species will outlast all others?"
"One particular student said that if humans work together, they can achieve anything."
You all proved that to be true.
I could not be more proud of each and every one of you.
"It's very clear that when faced with great adversity, the human spirit will always prevail."
A beauty like yours never changes.
"Come, my dear."
I'll lead you.
It was to discover your thoughts.
You didn't answer me yet.
Well... it is yes.
Yes?
You mean...
"Yes, yes really?"
Yes.
I agree to become your wife.
Now let me.
Come and get me shortly.
Do not be afraid.
Sleep.
Sleep.
"In the violent effort made by the thief to snatch the necklace and earrings from the princess his fingers, pressing on the neck of Princess Danidoff, left a slight trace of sweating."
I spilled the silver nitrate on the princess' neck
You see the results.
Effectively.
The print is very clear.
It needs to be indentified.
We are not at the end of our inquiry.
"Wait a moment, my little Fandor, you have not seen everything."
Look at the details.
"The small scar, on both shots."
These two fingerprints are identical.
Absolutely identical.
And where does the second impression come from?
The anthropometric file.
The name.
The name of the culprit.
"- Oh, nothing a little whiskey can't take care of, right?"
I'm sorry to hear about your parents.
My condolences.
They were good people.
- Thank you.
Isabel has taken it especially hard.
- Hmm.
Sorry to hear that.
Please give her my best.
- I will.
"Truth be told,"
I found it necessary to temporarily place her in professional care.
- Hmm.
"- I didn't want to, but Dr. Torrington thought it the best course of action."
They say Rosewood is the best.
"What is it, Detective?"
- Nothing.
Rosewood provides the best care money can buy.
"- Thomas, please."
"- Okay, I heard rumblings of strange occurrences many years ago, but they are mere rumours, nothing more."
"- Thomas, you would tell me if there were reason to be concerned, would you not?"
"- Yes, of course I would."
Of course I would tell you.
"Please, pay me no mind."
"When I drink, I speak heedlessly."
"Look, set your mind at ease, all right?"
Your sister's gonna be just fine.
She's in good hands.
- You.
Have you seen me?
This is not me!
It's not me.
College for five kids won't be cheap.
We're having three.
It won't matter if you're not around for the honeymoon.
I'll be around.
It's gonna be the best years of our lives.
- Just five more spins.
- Three.
"Okay, we've found them."
- You see anything?
- Besides two scoundrels in love?
"No, but they might have something off-site."
I'm gonna go toss their room.
Call me if you see them chewing on a rabbit's foot or adjusting a magic girdle.
Red 23.
- Careful!
- Stop yelling!
- Start listening!
- I'm so running over your toes.
- Just get it straight.
Not like that!
- Okay!
- Can you close the door?
- Got it.
You know what?
"Pull all the Dodgson files, would you?"
"And anything that's got a listed cross-reference, like Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll."
- What are you still standing here for?
- I'm not your girl Friday.
What kept you?
Three pumpkin pies and a broken oven thermostat you keep promising to fix.
What's this?
- This is why I called you.
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
- No more fruit.
"- You live with these people, Jess?"
Seriously?
Stay here until you find a better place to live.
"I don't like you, stretch."
I don't like anything about you.
- And I'm not afraid to...
- I got this.
"I've got a place to live, Spence."
It's over.
I spent six years trying to figure you out.
All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair.
I'm happy you cheated on me.
"Thank you, because if you hadn't, I would have married you."
And then you would have hurt me all over again.
"And, yeah, I was scared to start over."
I didn't know what to do.
"And, yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the Internet."
"And, yeah, stranger danger is real."
But I love these guys.
"I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them."
I would just take it easy with the love stuff.
All of them.
"Give her the shirt back, man."
- What happens if I say no?
- You know what happens?
Schmidt happens.
- Aah!
What was on your hand?
"- Thumb ring, bitch!"
You got some Schmidt on your face.
You know what?
I want you to put a guard on me.
"Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy."
- Right?
- Right.
So who's gonna watch me?
Cookie?
"No, not Cookie."
Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
"Okay, Price, you stay here."
What about Schulz?
We'll take care of Schulz.
Come on.
You too.
"That's a boy, Joey."
Play us a little something.
"What do you want to hear, Price, ""Home on the Range""?"
Or maybe a little Wagner?
"Or, uh, how about a game of pinochle?"
"No, you're not a pinochle man."
You're a chess player.
I never knew much about the game.
"Now, let's see a pawn moves this way and a bishop moves this way and the queen moves every which way, doesn't it?"
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
I went to school with a guy named Price.
That was in Boston.

-Yes.
- Everything is all right.
-You know I was going to face a real war.
I prepared myselffor hardships or even death.
And we live in the headquarters like in paradise.
We sleep on beds.
As ifthere were no war around.
"We drink milk, listen to birds, walk around with boys like you."
"Everything is as usual, do you understand?"
-The offensive is to start soon.
- Really?
"-Olya, can I have a look in the gunsight?"
-You'll survive without that.
"You know, Kolya, a real marksman never makes two shots from the same place."
And this guy does everything the otherway.
-He way not be a real ace after all.
"- No, he is."
He seems to play hide-and-seek with me.
He seems to say:
""" lfyou are smart - look for me."
He must have about five secure firing positions here.
This one is the fourth one.
And your canister shot was made from the last one.
-What?
- Forthe first time you...
-What?
-You smiled...
-At last. I see his position.
-Where is he?
-At last orthe life was becoming boring..

He stole our master's nine-dragon jade cup lf you can't find him by tomorrow
Then just move this winery out of here!
Yes-please report to the master that I want to keep renting this place
The rental's up 30 per cent
About the nine-dragon cup... I'll surely make him to give me back!

"Bastard, you dare come to start trouble?"
The cup's broken!
Report it to Master!
It's time you gave back to the community.
"If you want to help,"
You could contribute to ann's defense fund.
That's blackmail.

"If you want to stay out of these cases,"
Quit screwing around.
He might have pardoned you... but your wife never will.
"Ron,tom, these are ann's parents."
Great.
"You haven't talked to the press,have you?"
"Ann,what have you gotten yourself into now?"
"I'm sorry,mom."
You should be.
This is why we didn't want you to go to college out here.
They remind me of my parents.
Mr. Diggs?
"Tom nicholson, from hastings,nebraska."
It's right near where you folks live.
We've just posted ann's bail.
"Listen, i'm sorry about all this,"
"But,uh,ann's gonna be okay."
She's not gonna be okay.
We read the papers.
"She killed a man with a knife,"
And she's not denying it.
They called her a whore.
I'm not a whore.
Then why's it say so in the papers?
Get them out of here.
I don't want them around for trial.
I'm cold.
It's actually about 110 in here.
There's no way it's warm in here.
- Do you really feel warm?
- You could grow tomatoes in here.
"Honestly, it is unbelievable."
"Well, I can't make it cooler for you."
"Well, we're taking the credit."
"No, we're taking the credit."
How about a compromise?
We'll take all the credit.
"- Well, perhaps we could split the bounty?"
- What bounty?
"Well, I'm guessing there's no bounty, but..."
"Dan, Amy, how are you?"
I'll take it from here.
- I want to take in Pierce.
"- Whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
We are not going into the White House and blowing our cover for this guy.
You can't come in.
That comes from the president.
"- Well, she's a bitch."
- I'll tell her you said hi.
"Hey, we got to get moving."
"Hey, you guys."
Long time no see.
"Jesus, Mike, they got you involved in this?"
You're the fucking press secretary.
Thank you.
That's what I've been saying.
I have no wish to be embroiled in this either.
- I'm in a hurry.
Could you...
Don't worry.
Have you there in a couple of minutes.
Listen.
Feel the power in this cab?
It has lots of power.
"You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver."
What do you think?
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
Want me to tell you how safe?
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month, they're gonna give me a gold safety award."
What do you think of that?
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
I sure hope you're a good tipper.
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh... record.
Scapegoat

Om!
My sister-in-law is here
Whose sister-in-law?
"Agesha, your bride"

Your only daughter?
Yes
Lovely...
What...?
Tree
That tree is about a hundred years old
And this is a lovely house
And this house is also about a hundred years old
Even my brother is hundred years old
Can I ask you something?
Straight from the heart...
Love's no tv show for fun
Love is life.
"Love is an emotion... that touches hearts, enthralls for a lifetime, forever"
"Sorry, did I say something wrong?"
How do you manage that candour?
I remember the sincerity with which you showed me your childhood photo
That sincerity I liked.
I see that candour in you again
Can I ask you one more thing?
What will it be for you?
An arranged marriage or love marriage?
Love marriage
"One day, I met her... and she enthralled me"
When she held my gaze...
"Oh, I remember these."
Can we go again?
Sure.
I'm happy to take more of your money.
Gambling's awesome.
I think it's gonna be a problem for me later in life.
Whoo!
I feel good.
"- Me, too."
- Yeah.
"Mom, all you do is try to get attention, and all I do is yell at you."
We have got to figure out a way to stop that.
- Mm.
"- I mean, come on, Mom."
What is with this thing?
"Well, it's... it's from my car accident."
"I called you about it, but you never followed up."
Because you said it was nothing.
"When I hear the word ""nothing,"" I move on."
"Okay, can I just ask you..."
Why is it so hard for you to be there for me?
Seriously?
When were you there for me?
You picked a life of travel and adventure over being there for your kids!
"I sound happy, but I'm very upset!"
"Katie, I know that I wasn't a good parent."
"You know, whatever that thing was that's supposed to kick in just never kicked in."
"Well, maybe because you were such a crappy mom, that's why I try so hard to be a good mom."
Oh!
So I made you a good mom.
Mnh-mnh.
That's not what I'm saying.
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post traumatic stress.
"Yeah, and unofficially?"
I don't really think that's any of your concern.
My job's to disorganise crime.
Illegally.
I prefer to use the world irregular.
"Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
Look at that.
Bobbies on bikes.
Everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
Unfortunately a million extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould.
Operation Merlin couldn't deal with him either.
What do you want from me?
You're going to kill him for me.
"Niece and nephew, right?"
Yeah.
"I haven't got 'em any presents, though."
A bit behind when it comes to computer games and stuff like that.
You should talk to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games."
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John, that'd be irresponsible!"
That's not their age range at all!
How did it go with Lenny?
"Yeah, pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"I guess that's what you did in the Army, right?"
Wrong.
That was legal.
Yeah.

-Brígida Bonazzi.
-She is not patient mine.

We were in charge.
"Help, please."
"But, who is Brígida Bonazzi?"

Thank you.
"Strip, strip."
You watch what handsome.
You watch that teats and what ass.

They are going to us to stop to all by insult to the modesty.
Desínflala already.

"Alvaro, I will not get tired of decírtelo, you are rich, stupid and also a jerk."
To the women it is necessary to deal with them with hand iron.
Muéstrale to Lella the man that you are.
So that I have decided that it is better than not we see more.
If it is what you want...
"Pity, had made me a bikini of crochet for this summer and she wanted ensenártelo."
A bikini?
-Yes.?
You want that it embosoms it to you?
- I don't think so madam.

"- Hey fast-food, tea for both of us."

"If you drink this tea, you won't live to drink milk tomorrow."
-How much is your commission?

"Don't you know it is 10,000?"
"- OK, find out that girl's profession."

You make me laugh.

"We want him to cook, not to perform a ritual for us!"
"It's good to know, sir."
"You must've been reciting the hymns before the accident, right?"
"The Gayatri Mantra, too?"
"You can't speak, all right."
But you must sing for us.
Recite the Gayatri Mantra for us.
That's enough.
Employ him.

Snake eyes again.
Krause is a f ool.

"A judicious principle. I gather that you've been around, as the saying is."
- East St. Louis is around enough.
"- Ah, St. Louis."
"In what business were you, may I ask?"
"I owned taxicabs, but they got sunk at Pearl Harbor."
- Then you know Al Baretto?
- You know Al?
Were you in St. Louis?
"Many times, although my headquarters were in Detroit."
I thought Al's Detroit f riends were all mobsters.

You're just the bait.
It'll be over quick once Bo gets here.
"Actually, I prefer slow and drawn out."
"There's no reason to rush anything, you know?"
I knew you'd come.
How could I resist such a romantic gesture?
- You're not mad?
- No.
At you?
"Jenny, no."
You're my destiny.
I love you.
Nobody ever loves me as much as I love them.
Everyone whoever said they loved me they all left.
But I always keep a piece of them close.
Samir was no different.
"A coward in the end, too scared to love me back."
- You killed him.
- I went to his home to tell him that I totally accepted it was over.
He was so relieved.
Then I drugged him and cut off his head.
Teach me secretly.
Training for the lower body builds strength and agility.
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force generated there ejects your fist like a bullet.
A vertical axis extends through your body.
The basic principle is to be aware of it.
"feel the axis, relax and with smooth, flowing movements take a fighting stance."
Then...
One more time.
Stand still.
Keep the axis straight and the body flowing.
This is the most difficult and important exercise.
Since when have you...
Since forever.
I have a question.
What?
Why do you Iike wushu?
I've always loved it.
It's never been a burden.
shaolin Kung Fu makes people happy.
But Shaolin Kung Fu is a fighting art.
You're wrong.
It's the art of protection.
It's difficult.
That's why I need to know.
My mission is to spread the art of Shaolin.
Here?
"Yes, here."
This is my home.
Everything starts here.
Home?
"Yes, a home."
I just want you to be happy.
I am happy.
"Yeah, okay."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
"From now on, I'm going to be here for you."
"But I want you to know that if you ever change your mind, and you need a job, you know where to go."
Thank you.
And if you ever need a job...
"Uh, nah."

Ooh!
What do you think?
I got it yesterday.
Wow.
That is disappointing.
"Before the accident, I was really on the fence about Noah, but meeting you two opened my eyes."
Anyone who has friends as good as you must be a pretty special person.
"Man, this rental cost me 80 bucks."
You rented yours?
Aah!
"Ah, I really appreciate you guys pitching in"
- for Noah.
"- Yeah, friends till the end."

"There will be great costumes, fun music and a dance instructor that's gonna teach us dances from the 20."
Did I just fell asleep with my eyes open?
I haven't finished yet.
That's just...

"- But downstairs,"
"- My, oh, my, oh, my."
"But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife, stick somebody and take it away from 'em."

Mush!

Keep your fingers crossed till we get back.
"We've gotta make a touch, Shorty."
Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine.
"Yeah, I been noticing that."
You're the doctor.
You know what's good for ya.
"The way I figures it, hunting for gold's a full-time job."
"Anything that interferes with it, interferes with it."

"- But, who else gets paid to fuck?"
- Ho's.
"People, watch my shit."
Everybody on the floor!
"Hey, bruja!"
"You better not be drinking out of the bottle, you know how Carlos hates that."
Carlos?
That nigga ain't here.
Which one of your hooker friends is this one for?
"You should let me know, so I could roll up and fuck her."
Sometimes I wonder how we come from the same two people.
Get the fuck outta here.
We both got a talent for merchandising.
Merchandising?
Is that what you're calling it?
Merchandising?
Why don't you let a nigga set you up?
Set you up with a little shop.
We can keep all your shit there.
Because I can take care of all my shit right here in my house.
"It's all right, hermanita."
"One day, I'm gonna open you up a store, when you come back with me to the D.R., en la Calle del Sol, we could call it ""Maggie's."""
Yeah?
Give it to Darlene.
Are you trippin'?
You know Carlos ain't gonna take care of your ass.
Like everybody else in this motherfucker-- out for himself.
"You know what, hermanito?"
Why don't you support your kids...
y déjame de joder?
I was looking out for my little sister.
Who do you think you are?
"Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go."
That was the deal.
"The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse."
"Now, scrape it off!"
Start over again.
"Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer."
I'm a racecar.
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Is that right?
Then why don't we just have a little race?
Me and you.
- What?
- Me and you.
That a joke?
"If you win, you go and I fix the road."
"If I win, you do the road my way."
"Doc, what're you doin'?"
"I don't mean to be rude here, but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what?"
Three-point-five years?
Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
"You know what, old-timer?"
That's a wonderful idea.
Let's race.
"Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race."
"You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back."
"There will be no bumping', no cheatin', no spitting', no biting', no road rage, no maiming', no oil slickin', no pushing', no shoving', no backstabbing', no road-hoggin',"
and no lollygaggin'.
Speed.
I'm speed.
"Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer."
"My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop."
How did you get here so soon?
Hannah!
I just left from the broker's office.
My driver knows all the shortcuts in New York.
I must say I didn't expect you that soon.
Neither did your secretary.
"Stephanie, dear, you may leave now."
The stock is up to eight and three eighths.
I've made $120.000 so far.
Good for you.
You need me.
Maybe you need me even more.
Is that your husband?
Yes.
Was that painted before or after he died?
Six months he sat for that.
Maybe that's what killed him.
You are a wicked man.
"Tell me, where did you learn the market so thoroughly?"
I studied in Europe.
How would you like to make $12.000 cash immediately?
I would love to.
What do I have to do for it?
Just write me a check for $20.000.
Do you really think I'm an idiot?
"Look, I will sell you four thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at $5 a share."
The stock is selling at 8 dollars.
You make three points.
That's roughly $3.000 less commission.
It's a gift.
Why will you do that?
Well... let's say it's because you appeal to me.
Shouldn't it be Brandon's decision?
He's the one who got his ass kicked.
"I wouldn't put it that way, but that's a good point."
What if it doesn't work?
"I mean, what if he can't use his fingers at all?"
"Look, Mike and I talked through all of this."
And you made your decision.
Got it.
Hey.
Nice coat rack.
"Yeah, well, might as well use it for something."
Brandon.
"I mean, you can still play, right?"
Not classical.
Not the way I did.
"OK, so all music is dead to you then?"
"- No, but..."
"- Well, it sounds like that's what you're risking,"
- if you have this surgery.
- Ok.
"Look, I had a future."
That's not something you just throw away.
But what if you're not throwing it away?
What if it's just... a different future?
"What if it doesn't have to be that way, though?"
"I mean, why is everyone focusing on the worst-case scenario?"
"Ok, yeah, I'm sorry."
I hear you.
It's...
I hate it when people assume the worst.
- Like your birth dad?
"- Yeah, like him."
I guess.
"Professor, let's see the medallion."
"Have you got an idea, MacGyver?"
"Well, if the cult took the Torch out of the Ark, maybe they built a bigger, better one."
But where is it?
I think we're in it.
Are you suggesting that this entire chamber is a giant Ark?
This could be the key.
Then we need to find a keyhole.
Maybe not.
The Torch of Truth.
It's more magnificent than I ever imagined.
Wait a minute.
Just wait.
I guess it's all right.
You're wrong.
"These caves are full of unpleasant surprises,"
I'm afraid.
"Lord Cleeve, at your service."
"I owe you a debt of thanks, Mr. MacGyver."
"And you too, Miss Carson."
"Now, if you'd mind just handing over the Torch to my partner."
Partner?
"I'm truly sorry, MacGyver."
"I don't like this, Cleeve."
You promised not to hurt them.
"I wouldn't dream of it, but we can hardly have them following us, now can we?"
I trusted you.
"How can you do this, Atticus?"
You're not a criminal.
We have what we came for.
Let's get out of here.
- Please.
Don't Varun.
You are the only friend that I have left.
I don't want your name in the moneylender's list.
Forget this issue.
Also ask your dad not to borrow any money for your wedding.
Because I have no demands from my side.
Don't get me wrong that I'm... taking advantage of your situation.
I was actually waiting for you today...
To propose.
All these arrangements were meant for that.
Deepa.
I'm visually challenged.
If that's the reason for your silence...
You can tell me frankly.
We can drop this right now.
And remain friends.
Other than that...
There can be no reason for rejecting me.
Because...
I'm handsome...
Charming...
I know it myself.
Hey!
"You did laugh, didn't you?"
I didn't.
Don't you think that we have reached here a bit early today?
"Don't play around, Varun."
It's getting late.
It's not fair to leave me halfway.
I'm going to be with you throughout my life.
"Okay, bye."
How could you do such a thing?
"No, I don't want that one!"
I want Mario!
He's too ugly.
- Shut up!
"- No, Mario!"
"Don't worry, Sir, I'll handle it."
- I want Mario!
"Mario, it was me!"
I found him!
It was your Quirino!
"If it were up to the lawyers, you'd never get out!"
I did it!
"- Mama, are you OK?"
The Tribunal.
Mama.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
"Oh God, what now!"
"In the name of the Italian people, by article 479 of the Criminal Code, this tribunal acquits.."
"- Valeria, did you hear?"
Acquitted!
".. of the Code for not having committed the deed, and orders the immediate release if not detained for another reason."
- Mario!
"In this moment, I must inform Mario De Santis, who is present of having incriminated himself.."
"- What, Sir!"
- Nothing.
.. the crime of autocalumny!
"Autocalumny, what's that?"
"- Don't worry, it's a misdemeanor of 1-3 years."
"Because having confessed before this Court, he blamed himself for the crime of bigamy, which he knew had never happened."
This is the warrant.
- The warrant?
I had already decided I was gonna leave my husband.
-I just had to wait for... -your father to die.
"-When you say it,it sounds horrible."
"-Well,yeah.It is."
"If dad knew I was getting a divorce, he'd have disowned me."
She inherited $2 million last month when dad died.
Ah... how about if you were a murderer?
I didn't kill james.
You buried him.
No.
I did not even know that he was dead.
I will admit that we had a fight.
"James wanted to borrow money... and I refused,and he got angry,and... and he said that we were throug he got up to leave."
I just wanted m to stay.
"I,uh... took his cigarettes."
-Give 'em back!
-No!
-Now!
No!
-Not unless you promisemes!
"I just got in my car,and I drove for hours."
"I came back to-to check on him, to see if he was okay,but..."
"-he was dead,so you buried him."
-No.
James was gone.
"I thought that he was fine, until I went to that house for the showing the other day."
And there he was.
And I could only think of one explanation.
It was the hand of god.
Can gibbs arrest god?
I don't know it's like the thing tryg to bring in the hulk.
She's telling the truth.
Back off!
The man will kill you.
Kill you.
Understood?
"Yes, sir."
Hello.
- How are you?
- All right.
Your tie is crooked.
You just knocked everything crooked.
- How are my teeth?
- Your teeth are fine.
Perfume?
That's a first.
So I've been going over the possibles.
And I've been sniffing ten grand.
"Nothing in Artie's hit list suggests a multi-part object, which means we're looking for one thing and it should be in their possession."
Why?
It's Carson's rule of linear transfer.
It means they have to have it on them.
Forced outcomes require tangency.
Someone's been paying attention.
Some of us longer than others.
Let's assume that it's a single artifact shared by two suspects.
We each take one and we compare notes.
I'll take lady luck.
You take her date.
And I got these.
- I...
- What is it?
"I cleaned 'em with alcohol, all right?"
So...
"No, you are, Charles."
This was all your idea.
"- Well, what should I tell him?"
- I thought my lack of words said it all.
- But Kisan was great.
- Don't care.
I don't want him.
- Why the hell not?
"- 'Cause I don't trust him, that's why."
"And you don't need to know what I'm gonna do, Charles, till after I do it."
"So, you don't trust Kisan, you don't trust Berg, and you don't trust me, for that matter."
"All the same now, Charles, but I'm talking about the player."
This ain't all about you.
When are you gonna realize that?
"Man, this is fucked."
You're gonna put politics over performance?
You're gonna stand here and let your ego keep us from getting a player of Kisan's caliber?
"- Do you know what subtext is, Charles?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Good, then go fuck yourself."
And that is about you.
( man chattering )
- ( door closes )
- T!
"T, where are you at?"
T!
- ( line ringing ) - ( phone ringing )
"- Yo, what's up?"
"- Yo, where are you at, man?"
- I'm at the house.
- Then why didn't you answer me?
I just did!
"But you might gain many detractors, calling you a traitor who sold out her kingdom."
I don't mind.
"If you wish it, you may kill me afterwards."
So...
"Don't kill everyone, please."
Very well.
The battle is over.
"Please call off your soldiers, Rear Admiral Klom."
"Wait, damn you!"
"Hey, are you okay?"
"I believe in you, and your king."
Huh?
"Rear Admiral Klom, I can't bring myself to move."
Would you mind helping me stand?
Sure thing.
Thank you.
"With all of you, I'm sure the people of Estabul will be..."
"Again, people have died."
"Again, I made Claugh kill people."
I knew this war was necessary.
That's why I didn't charge Froaude with any crimes.
"I put Claugh in charge because I wanted to save more lives, even if only a few."
Or is that just my excuse?
"Brother Sion, are you going to cry?"
I've read about it in picture books.
"That's a face on the verge of tears, right?"
It's the first time Iris has seen one!
"Sister Ferris never cries, and Brother Lucile always smiles, which is really scary!"
Lucile is quite scary.
"Hey, are you going to cry?"
C'mon!
- I won't cry.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the argents."
First I wanna know where the clothes are from.
You'd rather walk naked than receive a gift from me.
You'll bring the stuff back to where it came from.
Understand?
"- So, I might as well just leave!"
"- Yep, you might as well."
Where did you get them from?
- A girl gave them to me and she...
- Watch out.
"I tell you, watch out."
"Don't be mad at me, Franz."
"Well, none of us is an angel."
"Move, don't stand around."
Let's go down to the pub.
- What?
You really want to go?
"- Sure, why not?"
Stop bothering it.
"You, stop smoking."
The air in here is bad enough already.
You're crazy.
"They've never been inside a cage, they don't understand."
What about Franz?
- He doesn't want the clothes
"- But I want Biberkopf, I want him!"
- I won't do it.
- If I want Biberkopf I get him!
- What do you want with that guy?
"The weaklings, I have no use for them."
Leave that little bird alone already.
"Herr Biberkopf, my tie came undone."
Don't you have one of your patented clip-on ties?
Astal thinks he's going to a safe place.
Fifty Magic Knights.
What a clown.
He thinks he can bare his fangs at the prince and win.
Hilarious!
You sick-minded manipulator!
Don't you dare look at my sister that rudely!
The prince?
Brother.
"What's the matter, Sister?"
I can't breathe!
"Ferris, you always spoil Iris so."
Jobs should be thoroughly finished.
"If we let a man like this live, it would sully the Eris family, would it not?"
What's your intent?
Is the prince behind this?
Does that mean Sion is also a prince?
The Eris family serves only the king of Roland.
The true king.
The king?
We must see whether or not Sion would be a suitable king.
"Will he make it back alive, faced with a troop of fifty Magic Knights?"
Impossible.
I could do it.
Sion isn't you.
He most certainly isn't.
But he carries something.
"You met Sion, and as a result, you saved his life."
Don't you find that fascinating?
"I'm not particularly fascinated, no."
Staying asleep
Losing sight of you
He keeps a little anchor to windward.
Don't we all?
Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day?
The convention?
We'll turn this city upside down for you.
We'll stage the right kind of convention.
-What kind is that?
-The kind that re-elects the President.
Where else?
Second cities like Chicago?
Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68?
California?
The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden that nominates a Mondale.
"You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca."
We'll make you a winner right here.
"You're not a New Yorker, are you?"
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
Huey Long country.
"""""Every man a king,"""" but no one wears a crown."
I love this guy.
Thank you so much.
Lovely evening.
"Kevin, give me a call in the morning."
I need some stuff for The New York Times.
An editorial lauding our choice of convention city.
The President loves a good Times editorial.
-Let me assure you--
-The vote's in.
We got it.
Let them catch their shuttle.
I'm sure they're running late.
-Thank you.
"So, um, can I get anybody a drink or--"
"Okay, you need to tell her."
"Um, tell her--"
"About you, about me, about everything."
"You know, I'm really sorry."
I have no idea what he expects you to do.
"Monroe, you need to show her what a Blutbad is."
"Okay, I-- you want to explain to me how we suddenly arrived at this crucial crux kind of a zenith pinnacle moment?"
Juliette got scratched by a cat.
"Um, well, that's too bad, but I'm not sure how that qualifies--"
- The cat belongs to Adalind.
- Oh.
That's actually not so good.
And I took her to the trailer.
- Adalind?
"- No, Juliette."
"I-I showed her everything, I told her everything."
She thinks I'm crazy.
"Ho, okay."
"So we're just kind of jumping out of the old airplane without a parachute here, huh?"
"Monroe, you're my last chance."
You have to do this.
Nick.
Enough.
"Juliette, I don't care if you believe me anymore."
- I'm just worried about you.
- You're worried about me?
You don't understand what Adalind is capable of.
I'm going home.
This is ridiculous.
"[Sighs] Okay, okay."
Just give me a second to get into it.
"Sorry, I already set the alarm for the night."
"But, Sadie!"
"I've been gone so long, and all the food in our house went bad."
And I'm just starving.
"Um, I think fish Pizza is still open."
I don't know if I'm hungry enough for a meal.
But you're starving?
"No, I'm dying!"
Blegh!
"Well, if you're dead now,"
I guess you can't come by tomorrow.
I won't be dead then!
What happens tomorrow?
"If you didn't know, we started baking our own donuts after that workplace-safety lawsuit got thrown out."
"So if you get here tomorrow right when the shop opens, you can have the very first, fresh donut of the day."
What an honor!
"First thing tomorrow, I'll be here right when the store opens to taste your first delicious donut of the day!"
"Yeah, sure."
"Later, Steven!"
[ Alarm clock beeping ]
"Mm, 6:55 A.M."
That should give me enough time to get to the big donut right when it opens at 7:00.
"And I can start another beautiful, Beach City day."
[ Sighs ]
It feels so good to be home.
"Hello, Beach City!"
It's great to be back!
Whoa!
I jumped super high!
I didn't know I could do that!
♪
"Oh, my gosh!"
Ok.
"- I love you, B."
"- I love you too, Mom."
I'm proud of you.
"So, what are you up to tonight?"
"Think I'm gonna work on this, actually."
Sounds like a plan.
"Hey, guys."
Anyone wanna play Dawn of Armageddon with me?
I just got it.
- Isn't Connor coming over?
"- No, he, um... he couldn't."
Oh.
How come?
"Well, I'll play with you, Judicorn."
Run.
"""Dear Callie, My name is Sophia."
"I'm 14, and according to my dad, I'm your sister."
"I've never had any siblings, so when he told me about you,"
I couldn't believe it.
"My dad says we look just alike, so I sent you my picture."
I know this must be really weird for you.
"It is for me, too."
"But I would really, really like to meet you."
"And I hope you want to meet me, too."""
"Washington,DC, hasn't seen snow like this for Thanksgiving in decades."
"The roads are slick, and visibility is near zero."
A bitterly cold windchill makes our nation's capital feel more like the frozen Arctic.

Patience.

"- Oh, yeah."
Sure.
- Here comes Mr. Show Business now.
"Any luck, ""Shobe""?"
"So far, the only nibble is a movie called Terror in the Tiny Town."
It's a Western with an all-midget cast.
"- Oh, great."
"What do we do, show it on a pillowcase?"
- With selected tall subjects.
I'm serious.
It's a real movie.
You guys stink.

"Well, I've had it!"
"If you don't like the swill here, talk to the cook!"

What's the matter with it?
"My father died very soon after he called in your debt, Harry Clayton."
"And you were there, in the casino, the night it happened."
SURI:
So what happened?
BEN:
There was a shod and the screen jumped.
- SURI:
I can't believe that.
- Suri.
Wait.
Suri...
- It cut out.
- What cut out?
There was a shod.
Ben just told me.
Everything went down.
(SIGHS)
"Why weren't you honest with me, Harry?"
- I looked like an idiot in there.
- I'm sorry.
How am I supposed to do my job knowing you were at that casino the night Lau died?
"- Yeah, I should have told you that."
"- And yet once again, you didn't."
"You're the reason I got to where I am, Harry."
"Everything I've learnt has come from watching you these two years, but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you screw it up for me."

"And so, in coming up..."
Summing up...
Uh...
"Excuse me, I'm feeling a little dizzy."
Uh...
I thought it would feel differently.
I thought I would know more.
I don't.
"I don't know anything, really."
Thank you all for coming.
Thanks.
Thank you.
"Oh, God."
What did I say?
"It was fine, although I'd think twice about doing volunteer work for a suicide hotline."
You were doing okay until Candice walked in.
"Don't start, Henry."
I just forgot to eat.
You should never drink on an empty stomach.
"Listen, it's perfectly natural."
"She left you what, a year ago?"
- You're not Mr. Sommer.
"- No, I'm not."
No harm done.
What's up... with y'all?
[Turk] Ahh!
"Hey, Dr. Turk."
What happened to you?
I found the latest issue at a comic book store a mile and a half away.
Here you go.
"Actually, I ran there in a foam needle suit, but you don't care."
"Thanks, Dr. Turk."
"Christopher, I heard you were sweating the rankings."
No.
I'm married and trying to have a baby.
Not having a job would be a big boost for me.
You're a good surgeon.
"Plus, your bedside manner is really important."
There's no one on that list who spends more time with their patients.
Are you saying I have a job?
"If you are trying to ""Kelly Ripa"" me right now, I will freak out."
I got a job!
"Well, the good news is, his head isn't in the storage room."
I once found a head.
It's a funny story.
I put it in my locker.
"I didn't have time to get to Lost and Found, forgot all about it."
"Come back to work on Monday, open my locker, whoa!"
Head!
Plus rats!
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.
"I grabbed the thing and ran up to the roof, punt it, and I shank it wide-left."
My phone has a clock.
And they subsist on a diet...

- Ooh.
"Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake with bacon frosting?"
They are the best here.
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, that'll go great with my cucumber-jalapeño egg cream."
- Chug it!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta get going.
"- Right, okay."
"Then, later, at a club in Chinatown... somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."
Old men are so sexy.
"All right, to be fair... some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream."
"Turns out when you projectile vomit on skates, you roll right into the spray."
How old does she think you are?

Because everything is about sex.
"When I'm with someone, when I'm involved with them,"

"- If I know Candice, she's out there."
"- No, no, no."
Henry!
She's out there.
"Come on, face her like a grown-up."
Come on.
"Wait, do me a favor, Henry."
Don't let me go home with her.
Say we're going out to dinner.
We are.
It may seem odd not to invite...
"Please, Henry, just don't let me go home with her."
All right.
All right.
Are you all right?
- It was that stupid wine.
"Hello, Candice."
- Hi.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
I hope you don't mind me just showing up like this on your big night.
No.
It's just that I've been thinking so much about you lately.
"Here, here, here."
"Sweetheart, is he annoying you?"
"Well, no."
No one beneath me could hurt me and no one above me would hurt me.
What a beautiful sentiment.
"Now, you let her finish."
Music.
Cooing.
"* Cooing, billing birds of spring *"
* Come back each year and sing and sing *
"Cooing and billing birds of spring, come back and..."
"Pardon me, something is bothering you?"
- I forgot the words.
- That's fine.
* Oh that is what he taught me to.. *
* Spreading sunshine and gladness *
* And teaching lessons of love
"* Fluttering, chirping birds of spring * [yodeling]"
[yodeling continues]
What a lovely pizzicato.
"To you, that's a pizzicato."
"To me, that's a pizzinati."
"I know, music."
[yodeling]
"All my life, I've looked forward to America."
"I suffered fire, floods, pestilence, and starvation to get here."
"And when I arrive, what does America give me?"
- A hillbilly.
- Oh.
"Now, you see what you've done?"
I warn you.
"Any more insults, and I take my money and Miss Chummy out of this production."
You know what I mean?
"You hear conversations like,"
"""Yo, man, I got HIV."""
"""Oh, that's cool."
"""As long as you ain't got that Ebola shit."
"""Come over here, drink from my cups."
"Come over here."""
"I'm gonna tell you, look,"
I don't even shake nobody's hands no more.
I'm telling you this.
I don't fist bump.
None of that shit.
I do this just right here.
"If you can't do this, then you can't get down with me."
"This is ""Elbow-la,"" nigga."
That's what this is.
Elbow-la.
I don't play.
I was in the Western Union the other day.
"You know, 'cause my family is awesome."
"And, um, there was a dude behind me, right?"
"Dude behind me, he was just hacking."
"""A-hock-a-da-hock-a-da- hock-a-da."""
"And even though I knew he was from the Middle East,"
"I was still a little bit scared, because the chick behind him was just sneezing, achoo!"
"I was in that bitch looking like ISIS, just..."
I looked like ISIS.
"""I See Infected Sons of bitches."""
That's what it is.
"But damn, this shit's crazy, man."
We gotta do something.
It's crazy.
Can you copy up on top?
Anybody copy?
Come again?
Just making sure We can communicate.
How am I looking?
I should be headed Right towards the beach.
"Yeah, you're about 20 to 40 Feet Past where you were before."
"Far from the boat, Shawn is truly on his own."
"Come on, shawn."
Here's a big boulder.
"It's a big, big rock."
I like big rocks.
Here we go.
"Come on, keep it up."
"Come on, let me see it."
I've been in nome About five years.
It was my dad's Get-rich-quick idea.
So we're sitting in hawaii.
"Everything was cool In my happy little life,"
And I had my own Painting company.
"He's like, ""Yeah, We just got to pump dirt."""
"And we'll get rich, And we'll come back here,"
"""And we only have to work Six months a year."""
"At that point, I was already."
A master painter Living a great life.
"So looking back, you have To be very selective."
On who you get ideas from.
100 miles east of nome...
Here's a big boulder.
"Determined to keep His gold empire from failing,"
Shawn pomrenke is going For broke at the bluff.
Here I'm seeing Some much better color.
- You followed me.
- He's the one?
- You're starting up with him again?
- I'd sooner chew glass.
"Choose your seconds and meet me at dawn, sir."
- No more duels!
- This is men's business.
- I accept.
- Men?
You're not fit to be men!
Morons!
Idiots!
"Choose your weapons, Mallefille."
Red or white?
Leave her alone!
She's going off to write about us.
It's time for her nightly regurgitation.
20 pages.
The only reason she needs you or me or anybody is to provide characters for her ghastly novels!
- I trust you have no objection to pistols.
- What?
- For tomorrow.
"- My boy, I really don't care."
"Thank you for the loan, my dear."
It was most instructive.
"You'll be up before dawn for the duel, so I shall sleep in my own bed."
Ooh!
I do wish I could be there tomorrow.
You will make sure nobody's killed?
"I abhor killing, but a good fight's something to see."
- Good night.
"- Good night, Claudette."
- My shame?
- Glitter.
- Ohh.
Tell me what happened.
"We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and..."
I don't know.
I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.
Why didn't you leave them in the car?
I didn't want them to get stolen.
"And I may have taken it out to impress a certain Chyna with a ""Y."""
I think she really liked me.
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.
I graduate in five hours!
We'll get you another cap and gown.
That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.
I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
Fine.
Where is this place?
I don't know!
I remember there was a lot of brass and mirrors and loud '80s music.
"Well, that narrows it down."
Wait.
"Uh, it was by the airport."
All right.
We'll find it.
I'll take you.
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.
"Thank you, Jay."
(sighs)
What happened to him?
I'm back.
"Hey, hey."
What the...?
And we needed to find us some shelter.
This is my turn to tell a story.
"Hey, hey."
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles.
- We are equals.
"- Oh, man."
Of course we are.
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this.
"But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath."
What the...?
"Well, as long as I am here."
"But right then, danger came from behind."
And Puss was never seen again.
The end.
No!
That is not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel!
"Don't worry, little buddy."
I'm here to save you.
"Oh, you're killing me."
It was Prince Charming.
He was packing heat and he wanted revenge!
- I want revenge!
- He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
Can I see?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything okay?
Except that Annette can't cope with the stress.
Then now's not the time to say another guest is coming.
A business contact from India.
You better do it gently... in stages.
"Hello, hello."
Have you changed your mind?
There's still time.
"- Yes, come on..."
You've got time.
- You're just jealous.
"Yes, of course."
You're much too beautiful for him.
"Will you love and honor her, for better or for worse   in good times and bad   as husband and wife til death do you part?"
Yes.
"And now I ask you, Anna Louise Hansson   do you take Christian Refner as your lawfully wedded husband?"
- Yes.
- Will you love and honor...
- I'm very sorry.
- That's okay.
"Those who before us have pledged to live as man and wife   confirming before God and those assembled here   their solemn vows, I therefore pronounce you   man and wife."
Don't throw them yet.
Come here.
I'll show you...
- Hi.
"- Hi, Jacob."
- Doing well?
- Yes.
- Hi.
It's true.
The doctor declared him dead.
Yes.
He was put on the bed.
We didn't touch him.
"You may have kept your key, but the prisoner found another one."
The key to freedom.
It's extraordinary!
He could not crawl through the bars!
Chief.
"This man, was he dead, yes or no?"
"Mr Judge, to be dead is to be dead, and he was dead."
He lives.
He lives.
A boy is arrested for murder.
But he is innocent.
"Then he hangs himself, dies, and escapes from jail without being seen."
"If we don't double our readership with that, I will be hanged!"
Hold your horses!
One hanging man is enough.
One of two things:
"Either Jacques Dollon was not dead and he went out alone, or he was dead and someone took him out."
"Anyway, we must know how the escape took place."
An inexplicable mystery is worthy only of one man.
I'm sure of it now.
"He returns, unlike what I said earlier."
Fantômas?
Yes.
"I have to take the case, if only to avenge Juve."
What are you going to do?
Blood.
Get lost!
She was asleep on the couch with the door open.
"I couldn't stop myself, Beth."
She'd lied to me.
I picked up an ashtray.
I hit her.
I couldn't help it.
I hit her and hit her and hit her.
That's very interesting.
It explains a lot.
"- You're trespassing, Lieutenant."
"- Take it easy, Perry."
I have a warrant here.
"Mr. Sandover, you understand that anything you've said to me that might have been overheard by Lieutenant Tragg--"
What difference does it make?
I killed her.
"I have to tell, Mr. Mason."
"I killed her, yes."
And then I put a necktie in her hand.
She was always playing with neckties.
It was Enos's necktie.
"Thank you, Mr. Sandover."
"But suppose you tell us all this down at headquarters, eh?"
"Now look here, Tragg--"
"It's too bad you didn't check sooner with us, Perry."
"You see, when this guy struck her,"
Lita Krail had probably been dead for over a half an hour.
The doctor found the bullet in her heart.
[Tragg] My warrant is for Mrs. Sandover... for murder.
"Well, that's-- that's it, Perry."
"I did go out there, but I was with Lita only 20 minutes or so."
It was sometime after 11:00.
When did she call you?
"Oh, did you see?"
"Oh, there's a little lizard."
Quite a big lizard.
What kind?
That was a water monitor.
"Water monitor, that sounds like a job at school."
"It does, actually."
"Today, you'll be water monitor."
That was quite big.It's a slightly weaker version of a milk monitor.
"Oh, careful, careful.Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my..."
That's a sea snake?
"Look at that, that's a good size one, isn't it?"
Yep.You're not going to handle it?
"Oh, my God, you are."
Careful.
"Oh, my goodness!"
You are very brave!
Mark told me this is possibly the second most venomous snake in the world.Yep.
"God, look at that."
Gorgeous markings.
I was just going to say.
"Because it's also called the banded sea krait, you can see why - all those dark bands across the body."
"What's amazing about it is that it spends most of its time out at sea, out in the ocean."
It can dive and hold its breath for up to 2 hours.
Yes.Good Lord.They'll come on land for mating also.
And lays the eggs.
"Is this a female, this one?"
Yeah.
Normally the female is bigger than the male.Right.
"OK, so I'm going to release it."
We should release it.
"And ""net"" means they'll be weighed in the nude and after... having gone through their morning routine."
I understand...
- Mr. Eduardo.
- General.
I assume that you understand that this little transaction... will cost the American taxpayers... 50 thousand dollars in exchange for 20 tons of enemy flesh.
You don't want to pay?
He doesn't think this price is democratic.
Isn't democratic?
I hope the newspapers don't learn about this.
How is it not democratic?
Officers and soldiers cost the same thing.
- The same price...
"- Yes, yes, I understand, I understand."
"Ask him, how much would Hitler be?"
- What did he say?
- He's asking how much Hitler would cost.
"Ah, thank you."
Hitler...
Tell him that with the Fifth Battalion marching on Rome... the price is falling ever day.
It's the Fifth Battalion's fault the price is falling.
- That's amusing.
- Very well.
"Sir, the photographers."
They're waiting outside.
Let them in.
Is he signing?
Come in gentlemen.
"Mr. Eduardo, a group photo."
- This way.
- Yes.
- Is someone looking for Febo?
- Yes.
I
And he doesn't knowwhat the hell he's doin'in Vietnam.
"These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business."
- Agreed.
- We knowwhatyou tried to do for Cuba.
"Lfyou had been elected in '60, Castro would be dead now."
"Gentlemen, I tried."
I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.
He heard me and he made his decision.
I appreciate yoursentiments.
I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots.
But it's nothing I can do anything about.
"It's a long drive to Dallas, and Trini and I have a plane to catch tomorrow."
- So...
"- Dick, these boys wantyou to run."
- Absolutely.
- [Man] That's right.
"Now, they're serious."
They can deliver the South and putTexas in your column.
Only if Kennedy dumpsJohnson.
That'll never happen.
I don'tthink you know howmuch people hate Kennedy down here.
"He's comin'to town tomorrow, and they will run his ass outta town on a rail!"
- Damn right.
- [Man] Thatwe will.
We are willing to give you a shit pot full ofmoney to get rid ofhim.
More than you ever dreamed of.
[Chuckles]
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
Suppose Kennedy don't run in '64.
[Chuckles] Not a chance.
Yeah.
And then see if you can hold it.
"Otis, you've got to be kidding."
What if I can't stop it?
"Well, then I'll get a really good look at what happened."
"Yeah, you stay right there in case I need you."
"Well, of course."
I was gonna do that.
"I'll be right there by your side, OK?"
"Ah, ah, OK."
All right.
That's good.
[Sighs]
"Well, I guess you're right."
He should have been able to stop it.
One thing I can't figure though...
I
Can't see how the car would push them into the street.
"Yeah, well, I don't know."
Wait a minute.
"He could've slipped, right?"
He falls back as the car rolls forward.
"Uh, could be, I guess."
RICHARD:
It's got to be the way it happened.
The driver... he won't swear he saw anybody push him.
OTIS:
"No, he won't swear."
"Well, come on."
I guess we better get this heap back to the pound.
"You know, it's a damn shame this thing's got that little old"
Whine there in the rear end.
I always sort of imagined myself had a little old car like this.
Wow.
"That's great, Warren."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"You slept with him, didn't you?"
"- Yes, I did."
"Yes, I did."
"- Yes, you did."
"I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour."
"So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?"
"And I say to him,"
"""Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need at least 14 capacitance probes"
"""to get the kind of results that you're looking for,"" okay?"
"So then he says to me, ""Miles, don't you think that's a little excessive?"""
"And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up in front of the entire class and I say,"
"""You can never have enough capacitance probes."""
"Oh, my God."
What the hell is wrong with you?
"Oh, nothing."
I hope nothing.
"You just got promoted, man."
You should be happy.
"I just gotta write this essay for the Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing."
"And the reason that I have nothing is 'cause, well, I've done nothing."
"- Oh, give me a break, Ben."
- What?
You have everything.
"You blow me out of the water, and I'm a cerebral stud."
Is that nothing?
"Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle."
Hey.
"It dazzles me, mister."
- You are amazing.
- I feel like you can tell that I tried to spit my gum out.
- Such a terrible actor.
"- Oh, my God."
"I love the audience, like, reaction whenever Ari does something gross."
- It's so amazing.
- People really get vocal.
"Okay, this is my favorite thing, right here."
"Sounds like fun, right?"
Not always.
Scary.
"- That is a genius, genius line."
- So good.
Genius.
Ari.
And that was all you.
You made all that up.
You guys are so supportive.
I love you.
I guess Jonny looks a little like Josh Harnett.
- I can see it.
- He's just so chiseled.
- But I don't think that they look...
- So chiseled.
He's angular.
"I love the end of this scene what you guys do, what Mike and Kat do."
You're relating to each other silently for one of the only times in the movie.
"And there's this whole thing, Mike, where..."
Now you decided you gonna be on her side and not on your friends' side.
Right.
"If you watch carefully, you do this gesture that's like..."
- We're a team.
Be cool.
"Okay, you're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates."
Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment.
All right?
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
"Okay, so if a prison shanking is completely off the table..."
And we're sure of that?
No shanking!
"All right, all right."
The way I see it is somebody is going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right.
"Lame-ass TV ads aside your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal."
"Time served, no probation."
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.
You don't give us the name of your supplier...
- ...you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right?
"Yeah, you cooperating?"
"Okay, let's start with a name."
He just goes by Heisenberg.
"Heisenberg, huh?"
How old is this Heisenberg?
Old.
Like 50 or 70 or something.
"I'm a little stressed, OK?"
"Well, I'm just the guy to relieve that stress."
- How's that?
- It helps.
Mm-hmm.
- Ow!
"- Was that a good ""ow""?"
"No, it wasn't you."
It was this.
Whose earring is this?
"- Well, it's not yours?"
- No.
"Well, I-I-I have no idea."
"Honestly, I don't know who-whose earring that is."
"Alan, sweetheart, I'm not accusing you."
- Why not?
- I know you're not having an affair.
"Oh, you think I'm safe?"
You think other women aren't attracted to me?
- I haven't said anything.
"- And, boy, are you oh so wrong."
"Just today at the store, this slim little blonde with a low-cut dress, she came up to me and asked me if the bread was fresh."
"Alan, sweetheart, I know there are still many women that still are attracted to you."
- You don't sound very threatened.
- I'm threatened.
I know I could lose you at any moment.
- (blows)
"- Oh, stop that."
We just found an earring in our bed.
"I know... a cheap, tacky one, the kind of thing a teenager would... wear."
- Eric!
- What about Eric?
What is this?
Ow'
"Yeow' Oh, ow, ow, oh'"
I think I'd better go see what Louie is up to.
"Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man'"
- Louie'
- Ow.
- What are you doing?
"- Well, I-I-I wasjust, uh, uh, uh--"
"I'm sorry, madame."
"You know, Eric, perhaps ouryoung guest might enjoy... seeing some ofthe sights ofthe kingdom."
Something in the way ofa tour.
"I'm sorry, Grim."
What was that?
You can't spend all your time moping about.
You need to get out.
Do something.
Have a life.
Get your mind off--
"Easy, Grim, easy."
"It's not a bad idea, ifshe's interested."
"Well, what do ya say?"
Would you like tojoin me... on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
"Wonderful' Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate."
"Come here, boy."
"This has got to be, without a doubt... the single most humiliating day of my life."
"I hope that you appreciate what I go through foryou, young lady."
"Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you."
"Tomorrow, when he takes you for that ride, you gotta lookyour best."
"You gotta bat your eyes, like this."
"You gotta pucker up your lips, like this."
"You are hopeless, child."
That's what always happens.
"He sees something, then the killer has to silence him before he can say what he knows."
How is he?
His heart had stopped.
"It was touch and go for a while, but we managed to revive him."
They're just getting him to hospital.
And what was it?
"Veronal, I'd say."
"Some sort of sleeping draft, anyway, in his whisky."
Who found him?
His son.
All right.
"My father was late coming down to breakfast, so I went to call him."
"I found him lying on the bed fully dressed, and at first, I thought he must have had some sort of heart attack."
I don't know.
Did he often have whisky before bedtime?
I don't know.
This your dad's?
Yes.
He didn't smoke it much.
"And, um..."
And you say you...
Haven't...
Touched anything?
No.
I thought he was dead.
I called the police.
"Well, for..."
"Someone whose mother's been murdered and father's been poisoned, you seem remarkably unaffected."
"What would you like me to do, cry?"
I never liked my parents.
My mother was cruel and stupid.
You got that completely wrong.
The person you were after was Alan Sugar.
It was obviously Alan Sugar.
Why?
"The Mayor was going to close Sugar's sweet shop down, it was all he had, he was a desperate man."
Did you not see the VHS player in Alan Sugar's shop?
Yeah.
You did?
Yeah.
"Yes, well, did you not see that the hostage tape was misspelt, yes?"
"""Kidnapp"" takes one P."
"You were closer to that than me,"
I didn't get to look at that.
"Oh, stop talking, please!"
"Hey, don't start blaming me."
"Don't start blaming me for this, O'Leary!"
Lana Del Rey was...
That's on your conscience.
"The point is, O'Leary, it couldn't have been Miley Cyrus because she told you..."
No-one ever beat Miley Cyrus at Scrabble.
"In other words, she could spell!"
We should have just questioned her normally.
"Well, all right, in retrospect, sorry, we should have questioned her normally."
Everything in Sugar's shop was misspelt.
"Oh, I see."
"I've trodden in more intelligent things than you, O'Leary!"
Sorry.
"Yeah, you're fired!"
And it'll probably cost me my job!
I hope you're happy.
You should go for mayor.
"That's actually a good idea, sir."
"Yes, thank you."

It is a tragedy how things have turned out.
Okay.
Then let us work to resolve it.
"Indeed, yes."
"All along, I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return."
As your Major Sinclair can confirm.
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shoot-out."
The shoot-out.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
"Although, there is still a fatal traffic incident..."
About which we must question Mr. Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes, but complications do occur."
Hmm...
May I visit him?
"Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
As for Mr. Stonebridge and Mr. Crawford...
"Tomorrow, we will send troops into the desert."
"I only pray we find them, before the bandits who have his daughter."
It would be deeply regrettable...

were their two corpses.

"Uh, Felix fancied her."
"I told him to go for it, you know."
"I said, end of the term, anything goes."
- You think she was out of his league.
- No way!
"He just needed to be confident, 'cause that's what the girls like."
Just a bit of confidence.
So you sold him drugs?
"It was just a couple of lines, I swear, I was just trying to help."
That was en error of judgement.
"I'm just a ""party guy."""
"Gemma, there's a workbench just a few feet behind you."
There's a drawer.
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught and you're with me, you're in trouble, too..."
You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake IDs and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car!
We make it legit.
We take a VIN number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not going to have you in the seat next to me..."
"Wait, wait, wait, seriously, wait, wait, wait!"
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
"We can fence them, and then we'll have the money."
We could do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
"So, you want to steal the watches to help me get away with stealing the watches?"
Yes.
That is exactly what I wanna do.
- I can't let you risk everything...
- I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
"We're savages, aren't we?"
We aren't supposed to know anything about saving money
"Yeah, Mr. Policeman."
"You're Japanese, sir"
You don't know how hard our lives are
Only Mr. Wu here understands us
He's a beautiful serpent
He's a viper!
- Excuse me
- Hello
"- I'd like some salt, please"
- No problem
Oh no!
It's raining!
"Hurry up and go home, sir"
Or your glorious uniform will be soaking wet
Go ahead!
Go on!
"Run, sir!"
Your Japanese fur is too precious to spoil
It's raining
Go collect the laundry hanging outside
Can't you tell what needs to be done first?
"Hey, come back!"
Are you taking the baby out in the rain?
I'm sorry
What an imbecile!
Who'd marry such an idiot like you?
"When it rains, it pours"
Good morning
This is our policeman Hanaoka Jiro
This is our new police minister Ekawa Hakudo
Don't worry.
There's no way they'll be expecting this.
I think they were expecting it.
Asami!
Get ready.
Fire!
There are spirits everywhere.
I don't see an opening.
Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in from the other side.
Hold on!
The spirits are weighing Oogi down.
We're losing altitude.
"Get off of him, you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo!"
Whoa!
"If I go, you're coming with me."
Aah!
Bumi!
I wish Varrick was filming this.
We could call it Sky warrior.
Brace yourselves.
Dad.
"Korra, I'm so sorry."
I failed you.
Don't give up.
Harmonic convergence isn't here yet.
We still have a chance.
We tried.
"Congratulations, everyone."
You've all got front-row seats for the beginning of the new world order.
"You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq."
Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful.
"It will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened for the last 10,000 years."
I just want to be with you.
"I know, I just..."
I think it's healthier to spend time with friends.
How is that healthier?
"Because if you start acting stupid or something or you're not nice to me,"
Amy will point it out if I don't notice.
Girls need girlfriends for that.
I'm not going to be not nice to you.
Why would I be not nice to you?
I'm in love with you.
It was just an example.
I want a friend.
I want us to have friends.
I liked it better when you were friends with Adrian.
That is over.
Let's go.
All right.
"Not ""all right."""
I want you to be enthusiastic about whatever I want to do.
Even when it's something stupid like going to a married couple's apartment and babysitting as our first date back together?
That doesn't sound very enthusiastic.
I can't wait!
(GASPS) There we go.
(SIGHS)
"Oh, Leo, I'm sorry I'm late."
Crazy day at work.
"Relax, glad you could make it, good to see you."
How was your day?
"Oh, it was good."
Yeah?
Any word from the school board?
"Oh, I heard from them, all right."
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also gIitters, but it's not frightening."
moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened--"
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""hello, hello."""
I heard a feeble voice.
I Iooked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi--"""
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there."""
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I Iooked around... he was gone.
- Let's sign the papers.
- You're using good judgment.
We'll go right up to the office.
"Alright, we can rehearse Miss Chummy now."
Aah!
"(Commodore) Mr. Ganz, Mr. Ganz?"
We may as well adjust our little business now.
The understanding was that I was to receive 10% if you recall.
"Uh, 10% of the show."
"No cash, Commodore."
"Oh, but confounded, sir, I insist upon the cash."
I'm not putting money into plays at my age.
"Well, if you'd prefer $1500 to a possible fortune it's alright with me, Commodore."
"Uh, Regan?"
"Yes, Mr. Ganz."
Has Bryson called about the ticket buy?
- 'Bryson?
'
- Yes.
He was to call and make an offer for a block of seats for six weeks.
"Uh, let me see, um 300 seats at four dollars, uh, $1200."
"Multiplied by eight, uh, $9600."
"Multiplied by six roughly, uh, $58,000, uh..."
"Pardon, pardon me, Mr. Ganz."
"On, ahem, on second thought"
I may take an interest in the show for my percentage.
I'm not in need of cash at the moment and it may offer me a bit of diversion.
"Well, now you're talking."
"Come along, Commodore we'll fix you right up."
- Are you alright?
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, I feel fine."
And did I mention that Kain Frazier and I scrimmaged together at the rink?
He's good.
It's date night.
Riley and Shayne sitting on the couch...
Just drop it guys.
"Look, I'm staying home, all right?"
"You totally have to go, man."
"Baker's goofy, but she's hot."
"I don't know, man."
"Like, if Tweaker gets in that candy, man, he's like a werewolf at full moon."
"Okay, give some credit to A-train and Big Daddy Precious."
We could take care of this house.
No worries.
- Just one thing in return.
- Details.
K-l-S-S-l-N-G
"- Hey, entrez vous."
- Here.
I hand-picked them from Precious' flower garden.
Thanks.
"- So, I made pizza."
- Boogers and butt cheese?
"Greasy, grimy gopher guts."
Mutilated monkey meat.
- Dirty dirty birdie feet.
- Dirty dirty birdie feet.
- French fried eye balls dipped in kerosene
- French fried eye balls dipped in kerosene
"- I didn't have a spoon, I had a straw"
"- I didn't have a spoon, I had a straw"
"No, it's tofu, pepperoni, organic goat cheese and cream spinach sauce."
Yummy.
It was for you.
I've been trying to call you.
"I just had,like,the most amazing stream of consciousness right now."
"I'm gonna write us a rock opera, you know,that we could,like,sing together."
"How we met and how we made love,and it... it's like..."
# The sky was opened... #
I can't sing.
And that's okay.
God.
It's like every time
"- that I see you,I,I,I..."
- Johnny.
I'm just so into you.
God!
You know what?
"I want to,like,get tattoos together and drink each other's blood."
We need to break up.
- No.
"- Johnny, you asked me to give another week."
I gave it another week four times.
- It's not working.
"- No,it's working."
"Okay,it,it's,it's just working so well that you just can't see it, and that,like,terrifies you,man."
"Look,we're in different places."
You want to drink my blood.
"I want to go have margaritas and,like see a movie or something."
I can't take all the emotion and crying.
And on my birthday.
Uh...
I'm so sorry.
You didn't remember my birthday?
!
How do you mean?
"For example, he says that Dave is de-prioritizing me, that he doesn't pay attention to what I actually want."
"Yeah, but, honey, that's just Dave being Dave, you know?"
Yeah.
"But so then, what if Dave being Dave is sort of like"
Dave bulldozing me?
Please continue to look at the fish!
Enjoy them as they come at you!
"I get it, dude, it's advanced snorkeling."
Dave...
"Hey, I'm trying to do this exercise!"
"Why don't we talk about this during down time, okay?"
This might be what the therapist is referring to.
You're missing out on life.
"It's happening right now, out here, all around us, all right?"
And you're too busy complaining about your problems to enjoy all these beautiful little fish that are...
Marcel!
Yes?
"Marcel, we have a real problem here!"
It is not a problem!
It is a circle of life!
The circle of life is circling our lives right now!
"Do not move, do not panic."
Shark!
What?
Shark!
Jason!
"Okay, it's all happening, Marcel!"
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Don't worry!
I'm sure of it.
When?
"- Why, have faith, ladies."
Hold fast.
Look at this.
It's for the Women's Institute.
"Oh, yes?"
"Oh, it does sound good."
Mr Farrow?
Mr Farrow.
What's this?
"Women of Great Paxford, join us for a harvest of blackberries for the purpose of making jam."
"""For the purpose of making jam."" Why not just say, ""to make jam""?"
They know how to make it sound better.
Bollocks.
- Unlike you.
This will be a small part of our planned contribution to the nation's food supply in the event of war and a re-launch of the village Women's Institute following its recent closure.
ALL welcome.
"""All"" in capital letters."
What do you reckon?
"- What, baking cakes and arranging flowers?"
It's not for me.
- This doesn't mention cakes or flowers.
"But it does say ""all"" in capital letters."
Not for me.
You should go... for the purpose of getting out more.
"Leave it, Stanley, all right."
Move out...
- Right.
When The Saints Go Marching In
"♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in"
"♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in"
"She won't just be my victim,"
"She'll be his victim, too."
"Pretty good, right?"
"That'll kill him, won't it?"
Good man like devalos.
Respected man.
No way he'll be able to live with himself
If he let's that happen.
"I know who you are, you know."
Pardon me?
I know you're a prince.
I know about the problem.
"I know about the money, and I want to help you."
I've got a little more than $38 saved up.
"But I know it's not much, but it's what I've got."
And when you get all that money
"That you've been writing to people about,"
You can pay me back.
I just want enough
To cover my library debt: $92.18.
"I think you are mistaken, little girl."
You've got me mixed up with somebody.
You don't have to pretend with me.
"I know you're a prince, okay?"
I've read the e-mails.
"And I know that you have enemies everywhere,"
But I'm not one of them.
"And look, even if you don't get all your money back,"
I want you to have this.
"I'm sorry, young lady, but you've got me mixed up."
I must get going.
"No, you can't just not take my money"
You're embarrassed.
She's not a stranger who just walked in.
Remember that when you're talking to her.
I want to try something else.
Go out and come in again.
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"- Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
Excellent.
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor, admit to the saddening fact..."
"Until I, miss, admit to the gladdening fact..."
Talk to her.
Sit.
That I firmly refuse to change the smallest detail on your lovely little nose.
I insist on saying that my nose is neither little nor lovely.
Dear Mademoiselle Francine Principale...
"You love her, don't forget that when you're talking to her."
How did I do?
Not too bad.
Want to go get some coffee?
Can't.
Do you have to stay with him all the time?
Are you assistant-director?
He's my father.
So you're assistant-father?
Hello?
"Yitzhak, it's Alex."
"Hello, Alex."
The rehearsal went well today.
"Yes, it's coming along."
The father was a Soviet diplomat who lived in Paris for five years... and then immigrated to America in 1968.
When's the flight?
- What flight?
- Mikhail's flight to New York.
- I want his passport.
- No!
You're a cop.
That's evidence.
You think it was a coincidence that guy was Russian?
Who knows what Mikhail was involved in.
Sebastien... what happened to my brother could've happened to me.
Thirty-two years ago it was only luck that kept me in France.
He made a sacrifice and never knew It.
I gotta go.
The killer did not know Mikhail is dead.
You go to New York with that face and-
Maybe he isn't.
"Would you like a vodka before you sleep, Mr. Suverov?"
"- No, thank you."
- You're welcome.
What you see before you is called gridlock.
- Next exit.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I'm writing the great american novel here on the job.
Literary kind of stuff.
Knock the fillings outta your teeth.
Yeah.
I see Everything.
That's what it is.
"It's all about looking around, observing stuff."
"Take you, for instance."
Like that accent of yours.
I left my hand phone in your car.
Please take it out for me before you continue what you were doing.
What are you saying?
Ah...
I shouldn't have called for you.
I bet he'll file a complaint.
"You should leave, go."
The car is actually just over there.
I saw my phone in there.
So unlucky!
My hand phone.
"Oh, Oh... my replacement driver job!"
My money... my money...
Hospital?
Did you directly see him collect the money?
He didn't give bribes in front of me.
I only heard.
How much was it?
"Of course, millions."
Millions?
How many millions?
It is all written down in a manual.
"Since he's cautious, he always writes it down."
He's so cautious.
Manual?
What?
What is she doing?
"Please I beg you to do the operation, doctor."
"Today, I just earned money to pay the Hospital."
I hope you can understand my difficulties.
Why must we perform a surgery on a comatose patient?
-=Stent Surgery: stent implantation=- To do such an operation requires a huge amount of money.
See you at midnight?
unless you want to concede right now...
Oh and next year
You don't want to take the subway to school.
You're more than welcome to sleep at my house. it's on park.
Well so much for that.
At least we have all summer to prepare for hell.
No. the cycle of abuse must be broken.
The monarchy ends tonight.
Hey. why are you sitting here all alone?
I'm waiting to approve a special insert
My name was left off the list of graduates.
Fate sure knows how to run with a bit.
Well at least you're special.
- Mr. Humphrey?
- Oh thank you.
"""We apologize for the inadvertent omission"
"""of Daniel Humphrey from the graduation program."
He is indeed graduating.
"Congratulations Don."""
That's perfect.
I haven't seen you around.
Have you been looking?
How are you?
I'm fine.
No I'm great.
Um But I could be better.
I... was wondering if you heard that I...
I'm...
I'm so happy high school's over.
Congratulations.
You too.
- Order in the court.
- Everybody rise.
One minute with this court.
"Mr. Gargan, this has gone far enough."
Your system has blown up.
Two of your boys ran away tonight and had the gall to change their clothes in my office.
Look here.
Is that so?
"Well, sit down a minute, will you?"
- Go ahead.
Sit down.
- I'm gonna notify the board at once.
Don't do that.
You're holding up the court.
Sit down.
- You realize responsibility rests with you?
- That's all right.
Sit down for a minute.
"Go ahead, and you too."
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yeah.
"Well, what is it?"
He's guilty.
The court says you don't get no candy bars for two weeks.
Okay.
"Sit down, will you, kid?"
"Listen, fellas."
I wanna tell you--
Hey.
Hey.
"Fellas I wanna tell you, because I think you ought to know that you've done a swell job here tonight."
You've got everything down pat.
- ...just because...
"- You're in a cafeteria, Mr. McCullers with kids trying to have lunch."
"I don't think that's the audience you want, is it?"
"Hello, Mrs. Marin."
I'm James Leland.
"Have a seat, Mr. Leland."
I'm sorry.
My regular assistant didn't make your appointment.
All I know is...
- ...you need to speak to an officer.
- Ah.
I'm Esther Potter's nephew.
She died recently.
I'm sorry.
She was a loyal customer.
"I'd like to talk to you about her accounts, her safety deposit box."
Um...
"Actually, we were under the impression Mrs. Potter had no living relatives."
She certainly was the last of the Potters.
"Her sister married my grandfather up in Syracuse, where I'm from."
I think technically that makes me a great-nephew.
Yes.
"Well, uh, the State Revenue Agency will need to see your ID before I can release any information or give access to the safe deposit box."
- I thought so.
- Yeah.
I brought copies.
"Oh, good."
Leland  Daley?
"Yes, we're architects."
I will get these to the Revenue Agency.
It's a little late in the day to expect a response.
I have business in the area.
Mrs Lightman!
Mrs Lightman!
Father Brown.
From the party.
Did you see Henry?
I didn't get to see him.
The police stopped me.
But you knew he'd been poisoned?
Two policemen woke me up this morning asking me if I'd been near his shed.
You must have been very angry with Henry last night.
Why on earth would I want to poison him?
"He can't help me clear Thomas if he's dead, can he?"
No.
You mentioned being in prison?
"On the morning they hanged Thomas, I attacked a policeman."
Oh.
"No, well,"
I wouldn't have expected someone like you to understand.
"Look, all I know about Henry Lee, all I care about, is that he was the last person to look into my son's eyes."
"Morning, Constable."
Father.
Shame to throw away such a handsome volume.
"""For Henry,"
"""the greatest of hangmen, the greatest of men."
"Ever, Max."""
You didn't know that your friend Max was Vera Blanchett's killer until Iris told you last night.
You came home and threw away his gift in disgust.
"Henry, I am only trying to get to the bottom of this."
Max was a senior judge...
..at the Crown Court where Vera Blanchett was a secretary.
He took his own life... ..not long after I hanged Thomas.
Now I know why.
"Come on, Marcus, you wally!"
Wait!
Wait!
Excuse me.
What is going on here?
Nothing.
Everything's under control.
I'm just his voice coach.
What are you doing here?
"I heard you were about to commit social suicide, so I dropped by."
- My accompanist left!
- Brilliant.
- You don't have to do it.
- I can't do that.
"Yeah, you can."
Just tell them:
Artistic differences.
You can't work without him.
He had a drug problem.
My mum wants me to sing it.
It'll make her happy.
"Look, mate, nothing you do can make your mum happy, all right?"
Not in the long term.
She has to do that for herself.
- Get over here right now!
"- Just bugger off, will you!"
"What I'm saying is, the important thing is to make yourself feel happy."
I've tried just making myself happy.
She's tried making herself happy.
It doesn't work.
You need other people to make you happy.
But that's just it.
"Go, go!"
I'll die if I have to!
You still have a lot to learn.
Keep practicing
"Y es, Master!"
"Gao Jian, are you here to learn martial arts?"
"Master, I don't think he'd learn anything"
But even if he did so it's useless
Useless?
"Because, Master, he looks down on our school!"
Don't make things up!
Come here!
"Gao Jian, how long have you studied here?"
About three years
So you should know the stances they've just shown
Could you demonstrate
Master
I doubt if you can manage even one
One stance and he's finished
"Master, please!"
See?
He's useless!
"Master, you see!"
"Gao Jian, where did you learn this from?"
I...
I made it up
"Okay, show me some more!"
Please!
"Master, the ""flying light as a butterfly"""
Even though it strikes from the top and bottom
But the middle part is unprotected
It'll be an easy target!
Oh!
"Well, get yourself a drink."
You need a drink.
"Well, I shouldn't, probably."
"I've already taken, like, all kinds of strange things before coming over here, so I don't know."
"- Good, you'll be able..."
- You look very put together.
You handle your things well.
"I do handle them well, but..."
"I'm speaking of allergy medicine in this case, 'cause upstate really fucks with me."
"All right, have yourself..."
"All right, have yourself a merry little Christmas."
I'll be right back.
- Good to see you.
- It's an honour.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
What are you doing in here?
- They said they want you to come back.
- You fucked up.
- Huh?
- Get back in there.
I could have made that transaction in two minutes when I was your age.
Twice a week.
Fucking get back in there.
"Well, it's my understanding that was a different time."
"Women were, you know..."
looser then.
Also much more impressed by authors.
"Yeah, authors like me."
Get in!
700 ships went to Dunkirk!
"338,000 men came back!"
"Don't say, ""It's based on a true story""!"
"Say, ""It's based on a hundred true stories""!"
A thousand!
Three hundred thirty eight thousand.
"Dunkirk, the biggest retreat in military history, or, the miracle that put the fire back in all our bellies."
Very well.
Carry on as you were.
I've a car waiting.
Buckley?
Buckley?
I don't care that you lied.
I cared that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
Ellis wanted me to back to Wales.
Do you want me to compare to Mr.Blitz?
I'm sorry.
Well his partner would be relieved.
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him, you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you would find yourself in a similar position,"
With your husband Spanish War and all.
Should I...do you want me to come in tomorrow?
How would that help losing you?
Who the bloody hell do you think is going to be running the slob?
"The work's good, Mrs.Cole. You do a good job."
Oh!
Oh.
Hello Catrin.
Hello.
Hello.
The Nazis have seized the Ministry.
And security?
-Give them up for dead.
Silence!
"I have to admit, you've got balls, drawing at a time like this."
"-If I don't draw, I'll shit myself right now."
"Ah, no, then you'd better keep drawing."
The art still unpainted if I die now...
The museums won't be the same.
Have I ever told you that you're an egomaniac?
I said silence!
Don't touch her.
"Thank you, Juan."
I owe you one.
Where is Espínola?
What are we going to do now?
Go to plan B.
"But, has anyone calculated how history could change... if we kill Hitler?"
Yes.
But knowing what he did it might make it better.
Are you sure about doing this?
Yes.
"If the Germans are in the Ministry, there won't be too many here."
They're good soldiers.
"Relax, we aren't too bad ourselves."
(HABLA EN ALEMÁN)
He's wondering how everything's going out there.
(Machine gun fire)
I think he should be more worried about what's going on here inside.
(Machine gun fire)
Silence!
No one move.
Could you be deflecting right now?
Not very effectively.
"What do you want me to say, Sheldon?"
I want you to talk about how you're feeling.
Do you want to hold the baby or not?
Yes.
"I know what you're doing, Violet."
It's not gonna work.
I'm not doing ything.
Look at this guy.
Do you mind watching him?
I could really use a shower.
"It's not gonna work, Violet."
I'm a professional psychiatrist.
You're not gonna confuse me with a baby.
And I think you have my ears.
I'm sorry about that.
"Yeah, I am."
No.
"No, no."
She told you?
"No, no, she can't take the blame for this, please."
"Can you give us a moment, please?"
Thank you.
"No, what are they gonna do to her?"
They're gonna try to get her some help.
Don't you think we've tried?
"Michelle, I understand the urge to lie, to protect your family, but we couldn't let you say that it was your fault when it wasn't."
But it is.
It is my fault.
"I was on drugs when I was pregnant with her, for the first couple of months, before I knew I was carrying her."
Michelle...
"Enjoy your champagne and caviar at the Ritz, Your Highness."
I am not rich.
My pager.
- Maybe this suit was a little much.
- You're a fox.
"Now, don't start."
- No.
- What?
- Rory's running late.
- Late from what?
She doesn't say.
"She'll be here, but if she's not here by 7:00, she'll sneak in the back."
- That's weird.
- She'll be here.
Don't worry.
I hope so.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah.
Whose idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
"- Oh, uh..."
"Uh, I was just looking at your hair."
I'm very interested in your hair.
- Why?
- Because it's... it's interesting hair.
"I mean, it's very exquisite hair."
It's the most exquisite hair my eyes have ever beheld.
"Well, actually, I did comb it differently this morning."
"So, um, with all that said, would you be interested in going out with me?"
All right.
I guess so.
When?
"- Uh, tomorrow, after school."
- OK.
See you then.
Has a brand-new couple taken shape before my very eyes?
What can I say?
I've got the boom!
(sighs)
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.
"Yeah, you got your, uh..."
floor-length flannel armor on there.
- This happens to be very comfortable.
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, you're looking positively Amish."
"Alan... tomorrow I have three busloads of these Garden Club ladies coming to the gallery, and some of the paintings are just a little risqué."
Risqué?
What do you mean?
Like flannel-off-the-shoulder kind of...
What is with this?
Is this welded on?
"Fine, I'll give it to you straight."
His daughter's letter?
"She's dead, Neil."
- When?
- January 2006.
Then what's this?
If his daughter died in January... how could she have written this letter in June?
This means Natasha Malhotra is the killer?
"But, where is she?"
- You?
- Good evening.
How did you get in?
Through the door.
I'm sorry... is there something wrong?
Yeah.
"I prefer the next piece, it's a... a lot more dramatic."
I don't understand.
Five years ago...
Samara Shroff joined Kabir Malhotra's empire as his executive assistant.
He didn't know her.
But...
Samara knew him very well.
"Because she was, his brother, Iqbal Chand Malhotra's daughter."
"Isn't that right, Natasha?"
Natasha?
"Mr. Menon, is this a joke?"
Mr. Kabir Malhotra was dying of cancer.
And your father was his legal heir.
Making sure that it stayed that way was crucial.
And for the past five years... you were doing just that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Malhotra wasn't aware that when he was telling us the truth... it affected someone else... a lot more.
Yes.
Why?
Bob went to medical school for two years.
So?
So...
"So if a woman had her arm cut off, he'd know how to keep her alive."
"Oh, God, no."
No.
I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.
What'd we get back on the river basins and the state parks check?
Nothing.
We're still waiting for regional and county.
Call 'em back.
Don't wait on 'em.
"Bob's cold, manipulative."
Always been with women he could control.
Marcy accepts this 'cause she knows no better.
She's been force-fed his opinions to the point she's incapable of having her own.
Sounds like a surface diagnosis to me.
"Believe me, if you'd grown up in my family for 20 years... you'd recognize it right away too."
"I'm gonna, uh, go it on my own on this."
Marcy only knows how to take orders from men like Bob.
I-I can handle this.
Bob is innocent.
I understand.
You're afraid of him.
–I'm not afraid of him.
–It's okay.
"I can protect you, but only if you tell me what he's doing."
–He's not doing anything.
"–Don't lie to me, Marcy!"
"Yeah, and he'll be shooting after the windows go."
- It's the best we can do.
- All right.
Stand by.
"Turn it on, or I pull the trigger."
- I can't turn it on.
- Why not?
Why not?
- Because it has to be implanted.
- She's right.
The chip derives its power from tiny electrical impulses fired between neurons.
It has to be in your skin to work.
- I really gotta...
- Sit down!
You're not going anywhere.
See?
Dude actually had a chip in his arm.
"All right, it seems calm for now."
Reid's still on the train.
Now we have two agents in there.
It's probably the Higher Authority.
I told you.
I have protocols to follow.
I was supposed to go right back out there.
I have rules.
Answer the phone.
"You want me to stay, I'm obviously going to stay."
"But, I mean, you're going to be the one that has to explain it to the Man."
"Whoa, ""the Man""?"
"They're still trying to tell you what to do, Ted."
Why can't you all just leave me alone?
Leave you alone?
Damas.
Vengan conmigo.
[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish]
"Uh, what-"
- Wait a minute.
Where are you taking them?
"Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?"
I'm putting them on a bus.
Why?
What bus?
One that takes them back to Honduras.
"Hey, wait a second."
Wait a minute.
Th-Th-This was my idea.
Don't punish them.
"You tell Gus to blame me, not them."
He does.
"Give us a minute, will you?"
We won't be too long.
The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo to a couple of local nobodies.
"Very disciplined, though, not keeping anything for themselves."
"It was all about sending a message, which they did, literally."
It was written on the bucket lid.
"""Ready to talk?"""
"That, I believe, is the English translation."
"I know you're not really asking for advice, but let me hire 10, 15 more good operators, and we hit them back, hit them hard, hit them where they live."
No.
This war stays cold for now.
What about their message?
What's the answer?
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.
"Die for love, don't kill for love, Kaabir."
"This full moon, this water, the shadows..."
"Jilaan, Saiba, such love..."
happens once in a thousand years.
Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.
Here..
I die for you.
No!
'A stormy sky...'
'A ferocious moon...'
"'Bodies meet, bodies perish.'"
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Saiba was never yours and shall never be.
Nature shall repeat this story.
Today love has bled into water.
Then there's no lover greater than me.
'If they do not make it through the ocean of fire...'
'One last breath would forever remain a desire.'
'Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.'
"'No trust, no love.'"
'Here...
I die for you.'
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Karma.
Things come back to you.
They repeat.
What had happened will repeat.
"Only you can change it, Saira."
You were mine and shall always remain mine.
Kaabir.
"We didn't really play, I just listened to Big Sis and Miyu discuss BL"
Must have been awesome
"But a little while ago, 6 months to be exact..."
"No, 8 months ago?"
Miyu started dating someone
Why does having a boyfriend make her a sex slave?
Lin named her that.
He's darker than you think.
Beware
That's pretty scary...
Maybe with me too?
"No, don't worry."
I have absolutely no interest in you
"Oh, umm..."
I was just kidding.
Sorry
It was a joke?
Yes
The sex slave thing is a joke too
She did sexual things before us and became braggy
So we started competing who could be meaner to her
The way we would compete was...
These things happen because she fell for the wrath of pleasure
I don't really get it
And since when can't you get ahold of her?
About a month...
"No, 4 weeks"
"No, 29 days"
You can't get ahold of her at all?
Yep
That's worrisome isn't it?
Yep
We've got to get into that room.
A room that's losing evidence as we speak.
I know.
"It's just, I thought coming back to D.C."
Would feel like old home week or something.
- Home is overrated.
- God.
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What are you doing here?
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What is he doing?
I had a hunch about something
From Pete's description and I just need to see this with my own eyes.
You two have a plan to get in there?
Yeah.
We're gonna crawl under the motion sensors--
Yes.
There's an access panel on the roof.
"We can go in through the-- well, please, ladies first."
No.
"You know what, you--you be the smart one this time."
"Okay, get this,"
There's an access panel on the roof.
It'll bring us in right above the main wiring
For the security system.
"Now, if we crawl on our bellies, we can avoid the motion sensors."
"And what do you mean ""this time""?"
All right.
I get the idea.
"If I may, put these on."
Really.
Or you'll be of no use to me.
These are some numbers i'm thinking of playing.
"No, Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's gonna steal your numbers.
You'd be a fool not to.
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.
"They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns the theories of sir Isaac Newton."
Isaac Newton.
Really?
There's just six numbers.
You only buy one ticket a week?
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?
"Well, it depends."
20.
You're just shotgunning it?
Rookie move.
"Well, how much have you won?"
How much ever or how much this year?
Let's say ever.
Zero.
- It's not just about winning or losing.
- It's the lottery!
It's all about winning.
What else is there?
"The journey, Captain!"
It's how you get there.
I'd rather lose my way then win a $20 million jackpot your way.
Okay.
I think we're through here.
"You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery expert?"
I've got news for you.
We've got your number.
I went through all your papers and completely organized your life for the next two months.
"Everything is color-coded, according to type of activity:"
"Home, Work, Ritchie or Personal, and I devised this dot system to indicate priority."
"I think you're, uh, really going to like it."
I may be wrong.
What are you doing?
"I'm sorry, but this situation with Jeff is getting more and more complicated."
I need the board.
I need to chart what our family tree would look like if Richard married New Christine and I married her father.
Okay.
Let's put it on the board.
Okay.
Write my name in the middle of the board.
Yes.
"Now write Richard next to me, and connect us with a line."
A broken line.
Thank you.
And then put Ritchie underneath us.
Yes.
And then put New Christine next to Richard.
And write...
P...
Pa...
Papa Jeff up there.
That is correct.
"Now draw a line from New Christine up and across and over to me, and..."
"Oh, my God."
I'm Ritchie's grandmother.
Where should I put me?
"Oh, who cares?"
Just go next to me.
"All right, now what we have to figure out is what would happen if we had a baby."
Does father have piles?
Actually my dad and I are thinking to come your home and discuss about marriage.
Marriage?
Who is this girl?
You wait mom.
I too have the same doubt.
Who are you?
Who am I?
- I will tell.
Friend of the Police officer who looks same as you or his girlfriend.
"Sorry, even I was confused before and now you are confused."
"He is not your guy, but our guy."
I don't believe this.
Your guy talks fluent in Hindi and my fellow murders it.
If required test him.
I am unable to understand what is happening here.
Is this true?
"Dad, what is she saying?"
- Hindi..
This is so strange.
"I just watched dual roles only in films, but never thought I would experience it."
"If you don't mind, I will take a photo and send it to my boyfriend."
Sure..
- He will be really shocked.
"Sorry uncle, sorry aunty I need to search where he is."
Bye..
Let us see the saris there.
Come on.
Tell the truth.
Is there another one just like you?
"Yes, he is there."
Here.
There's no time.
You sure somebody's not yanking your chain?
There it is.
Ssr.
Don't move.
Don't think he can.
This is it.
We got the stark stuff.
That's like the whole haul.
"Ease up on that, will you?"
I don't want to end up inside out.
We're getting promotions out of this.
Why?
'cause we answered the phone?
This got handed to us...
again.
Somebody's wrapping this up like it was christmas.
Christmas?
"Well, hey, who doesn't love christmas?"
I'm gonna call chief.
I want every single box checked and signed in.
"Careful with that, boys."
"Hey, keep it sealed off!"
You got it!
Who's our new helpful friend?
Jerome zandow.
He had an act in a sideshow at coney island.
Petty crimes here and there.
Probably just muscle for hire.
Even muscle knows something.
"He had his hands on an arsenal of stark technology,"
But he just sat there with it.
"It's just, well,"
"I also kind of have, like, a day job."
"- Thanks, Nikki."
- Yeah.
Or secret identity.
- Doc!
- Right.
Yeah.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"Where are the bombs, Petty?"
Again.
Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer?
"If you're offended, Doctor, by all means, wait outside."
Dueling sawbones.
Toe to toe.
Old school versus the avant-garde.
"If you'd like me to stop, Warden..."
"Don't be sensitive, Milton."
Tell us where they are and you'll have a wool blanket with tea piping hot in a ceramic bowl waiting for your purple pruned hands.
We'll find out one way or another.
He'll break.
Never had a man in this tub that didn't.
"He's already broken, Dr. Beauregard."
What we need to do is put him back together again.
A prescription straight from the pad of mother goose herself.
"When you're ready to come into the 20th century, please let me know."
Dr. Sengupta.
Time for the talking cure.
"Step aside, Milton."
"Yes, ma'am, it's a military medal, all right."
"We're going for the Lincoln, OK?"
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
Wait a second.
What's happening?
In the car.
They're in the car.
In the car.
They're in the car.
Shoot em!
Aahhh.
Hang on.
"Luckily, the bullet passed right through."
Just missed a major artery though.
And he still lost a lot of blood.
Is he going to be all right?
What do you want a warranty?
"No, I want him checking out on me."
"No, I want him checking out on me."
You should have thought about that before you brought him here.
But this guy seems pretty tough though.
He'll probably pull through all right.
Man.
That's the biggest god-damn tattoo I've ever seen.
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus.
"Guy certainly isn't afraid of needles, huh?"
How long till he comes to?
You got me.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
I haven't gotten into anesthetics yet you know.
"Whatever he's done in the past, forgiving him is better than ignoring him."
"Tom, you shouldn't be spending your last..."
"What, lecturing you?"
Why not?
I hope your gran is right.
About what?
The next life.
Specially that bit about the new body.
I'm gonna need that!
"If we don't get new bodies, it'll be easy to spot the post-mortems in heaven."
Thanks for being here.
"I'm glad I'm here, Tom."
"Grand Chief, it is Yongeum Island, Yi Do-hyung's hideout."
You called for me?
I don't see Yum Moon.
Where is he?
Go and bring him.
"Yes, sir."
We will land here.
It'll be about a half day's march from this landing site to their camp.
Was there any guard at the landing site?
It is a large island.
They don't have enough men to cover this area.
"Why don't we just go straight to where Yi Do-hyung's ship is docked, and attack them?"
Lt'll be to our disadvantage if they see us coming.
We are outnumbered.
Where is Yum Moon?
Head Chief is not on the island.
What do you mean?
He has gone to attack Buryung in order to secure provisions and weapons.
Where is Chief Jang?
And deaf. I couldn't hear anything
"Then gradually, I was able to make out figures around me"
The other children?
Yes
But I couldn't see them very well l just felt their presence like spirits
I remember Audrey was one of them
She called to me
Victor?
Come here
Why did you come to see me?
is it because I'm like you?
It's because of the fairy
The fairy?
What fairy?
She's supposed to protect me until Mum comes back
Mum said I would recognise her
Who is this fairy?
You think it's me?
"No, I'm not a fairy"
"Fairies have nice hair, pretty dresses..."
They are always smiling
They have magic wands I don't have any of that
Can I?
You remember Victor I'm not here for him
"What is it, then?"
It's the power failure
"We don't know how long it will last, so we're checking everyone is OK"
People are worried.
The shops have shut
Do you have all you need?
"Yes, I'm fine."
Thank you
-l don't want your fucking gun.
"If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it a long time ago."
(sobbing)
MAN:
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
(REWlNDlNG)
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
Doesn't help much with the guys waiting outside that door.
"Yeah, but there are three voices on the recording, right?"
"The one who attacked us, the one who was dead in the basement."
And one guy who will watch outside.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Lock yourself in.
It's the only secure room we got left.
(locking DOOR)
OPERATOR:
is she dead?
"Yes, it's done."
Come upstairs.
Leave the door open and drive away.
Welcome to early retirement.
"God, Meredith."
Please.
(sighs)
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God, these are them."
But El Nino has to concentrate.
He's got no time for other worries.
I won't give him any.
"But tell him to stop by the house and get his things, or to tell me where to send them."
Send them to my place.
He can tell me himself.
I have nothing to do with you.
"Here, you can leave when you want."
- Good evening.
- Whiskey on the rocks.
- Which glass do you prefer?
- The tall one.
"Excuse me, could I speak to you for a moment, please?"
Forget it.
"When something's over, it's over."
Excuse me.
What were you saying?
"Could I have a word with you, please?"
"If you take me to Madrid, we could talk on the way."
I'd be delighted.
Let's go.
Who named you Lydia?
My father.
It was like sealing your fate.
"He always wanted to be a bullfighter, but he stayed a banderillero."
"He was the one who supported me the most, but he died a year ago."
I'm sorry.
"""El Pais"" wants me to do a profile on you for their Sunday issue."
Do you write on bullfighting?
Your name isn't familiar.
To be honest I know nothing about it.
So why are you here?
"I mean, someone gave it to me."
Who?
"Um, I think his name was Alan or Adam, something like that."
Where or when did he give you the chip?
I'll tell you if you give me Elton John tickets.
Done.
"Okay, well, like, let's see 'em."
"Elton John, front row, tomorrow night."
Ah!
"Like, talk."
I remember his name-Alex.
Alex.
Great.
"Um, when did he give you the chip?"
"Well, see, I was over by the fountains, you know, at the Bellagio, and when I left, this guy Alex sees me, like, a couple of blocks away and he's like,"
"""I saw you over by the fountains."
"Where are you staying?"""
"And he's kinda hot, so I'm like, ""the Montecito."""
"Um, where did he give you the chip?"
- Here.
- Here?
- In your room?
"- Well, like, we had drinks at Pure."
"And then he's like, ""Do you want to go back to your room?"""
"And I'm kinda drunk, so I'm like, ""Okay."""
"And then after we hook up, he goes, ""Here,"" ya know, with the chip."
"And I'm like, ""I'm so not that type of a girl."""
"And he's like, ""I know."
"I just, like, like you, so I'm giving you this."""
Completely believable.
Did Alex say he had to leave because he had an early morning meeting he had to get up for?
Yeah.
What did he come for?
You could speak to me more gently!
Wasn't it for this shitty life that you married me?
Haven't you seen Niaré?
Don't talk to me about him.
I've got a thousand like him.
And he doesn't have shit.
"Sure, now you can slut around all you like, but when I build houses... and give your father cars, you don't say a word."
"Speak, then."
I know how you made your fortune.
"Your father, a common employee, corrupted... the public services, and you're even proud of it."
Go to hell!
I'll make you choke on that!
I'll choke you...
Calm down!
Everything will be settled... today.
Who went and told the cops?
You couldn't keep your mouths shut.
This was bound to happen.
Who could have betrayed us?
I don't know.
I'll go look for Sissoko.
Sissoko!
What's that on your pants?
- Is it here?
- Yes.
Wait for me!
Come and see.
I'll report it...
Get back to work!
- Get back to work!
- Never!
We will chop off your head And then laugh when you're dead
Duloc is a creepy place
Come on in What the heck
Fall right down Break your
Face
Duloc is Duloc is
Duloc is a creepy place
Get out.
- Let's do that again!
- No!
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
You know what?
I just figured out what your costume is.
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes?
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story.
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
'Cause that's not scary.
"Actually, if you look at it from my perspective..."
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio?"
No one cares!
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy."
And it's all true.
Leave me!
- Panju...
When is Manoj's birthday?
- September 12th.
He keeps annoying!
Don't move!
Won't you leave?
Sir...
Stay quiet!
Sadhana!
What are you doing here?
How did you come here?
Are you still after her?
I wonder why I came running for you!
"Your mom is worried about you, wondering where you are, what you are doing..."
"And here you are, roaming behind your lover."
Don't talk nonsense without knowing about the situation!
This is Ashwini.
Are you trying to act wise by changing her name?
I know that it's Deepa.
I can never forget that face.
You were all intimate with her at the restaurant!
If you knew Deepa all along...
Why didn't you mention it when I was searching for her?
"Yes, it's my mistake."
Big mistake!
"I should have found he, gotten her married to you, and blessed you both."
It's my mistake.
Please forgive me.
You will never change.
You will go completely mad roaming behind her!
Please don't blabber without knowing the situation.
This has nothing to do with me.
"It is about you, and it is always about you."
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Don't say anything.
I'll follow you to the station.
Do you think I did the right thing...
cutting my hair?
I can't believe this about your grandfather.
He's in big trouble.
"Yeah, I know, with the creek and the no paddle."
"Damn Oregonian barbers, man, making my head too small for my body."
- How do you work with this mirror?
"- Grandpa, front page, jail?"
- I was in that photo.
"I got cut out, though, ... probably 'cause of my hairdo."
- Sorry to see you're so upset.
- I'll survive.
It'll grow out.
- I'm talking about Caleb.
Looks like someone was way off base.
Accusing you of making everything about you.
"- My God, she is right."
"- I was just kidding, man."
"No, dude, here I am, going on and on about my haircut."
My grandfather's in the cooler.
"I'm like a monster, dude."
"I'm all I think about, and not in a good way."
- There's a good way?
- Talk to me about anything other than me.
"Go, give me anything."
"- Ah, here it is."
First day of A.P. Physics today.
"It's OK, Tom, we'll get you to the hospital."
Are the paramedics still here?
Get the ambulance back!
Tom?
I don't wanna go.
You have to.
I don't wanna go there.
We just need to get you to the hospital and they'll be able to help.
I don't wanna die alone.
I'm afraid.
Someone called an ambulance?
I think it's time you took a sickly.
Let's see if we can get you more comfortable.
Don't be afraid.
All that struff about the resurrection.
About there being something else after this.
Do you believe it?
Don't say that you do to make me feel better.
I believe...
that you shouldn't be afraid.
Hi I'm here to see Victor Alexander.
"You're his daughter, yes?"
Yeah.
Your father left us yesterday.
What?
He's been released.
He didn't tell you?
No.
Failed to mention it.
So this is the cause of all the trouble.
Expecting something more impressive?
It's amazing what a collection of flesh and bones is capable of.
Sit down.
You can't punch the leader.
"You are not a leader, okay."
You're a fuck up.
You've always been a fuck up.
I need you to calm down.
"Okay, we need to figure out a plan before that sick fuck comes home."
What about the skylight?
That's like 25 feet up.
"Even if we stand on each other's shoulders circus style, we won't be able to reach it."
We tried that already.
Text.
I thought you said the signals are blocked.
"I'll just ah, hit send and throw it to the skylight."
"It's a signal jammer, okay."
"We find the jammer, we kill it, then we call for help."
"Look, it's a new plan guys, all right."
"You guys, you sweep this are out here for the jammer,"
Blair and I will take the bedroom.
You don't tell me what to do.
Can you wait for me?
Riley.
Yeah.
Hey.
"I need you with us, okay."
We gotta find that jammer.
He's right.
No.
I'm a fuck up.
"No, you're not."
We all make mistakes.
"Look at me, I'm in deep with Timmy Song, right."
Which is exactly what the Nazis are looking for.
What does this Ark look like?
Uh...
There's a picture of it right here.
That's it.
Good God.
"Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought."
"Uh... now, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?"
Lightning... fire... power of God or something.
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.
"Oh, yes."
"The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions."
An army which carries the Ark before it... is invincible.
"You did it, didn't you?"
They want you to go for it.
"Oh, Marcus!"
They want you to get ahold of the Ark before the Nazis do and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it.
And the museum?
The museum gets the Ark when we're finished?
"Oh, yes."
Oh...
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
Mmm!
"You know, five years ago, I would've gone after it myself."
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Suppose she'll still be with him?
"Possibly, but..."
What did you bring in?
- A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch.
"- Oh, Christ."
You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock.
"Walt, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right?"
It's like a goddamn desert full of junkies out there.
- Everybody waiting to get well.
- Goddamn it.
This could be it.
This little candy store guy...
He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known narcotics connections.
They were all over him.
"And then, on our own, after working a whole day and night... we tail him to Brooklyn, and we sat on him for practically a week."
"Now, who do we come up with?"
"Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake."
"Now, you gotta let us have it."
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
- What'll it take?
- A wire.
- No.
Two wires.
- Two wires.
"One on the store, one on the house."
"You know I have to get a court order for a wiretap, don't you?"
But you'll try.
"We know you can do it, Walt."
[Chuckles]
Popeye.
You still pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie?

"They're still in your drawer, unsigned."
No!
I know very well that I...
I could have sworn I signed these.
Why didn't you remind me?
I did remind you.
Several times.
And there are at least three memos on your spike.
I must have overlooked it.
"See that they're mailed immediately, and attach a letter of apology."
Certainly.
"Well, what is it?"
"I hate to mention this, but the safe was open again this morning."
I distinctly remember locking it last night.
Maybe it was...
"No, I checked it."
There's nothing missing.
It wasn't a burglar.
Then it was somebody in the office.
"John, you're the only one who has the combination."
"Good evening, Ellen."
"Good evening, sir."
I lost my keys.
"Well, you left them on the table this morning, sir."
Here's John now.
I was sure I put them in my pocket.
You promised you'd be home early!
"Good evening, John."
"Oh, hello, Sam."
I was so busy I didn't notice the time.
"Why, are you working too hard?"
"Oh, no."
It's just like an animal.
"Look, it's chewing it."
Don't be silly.
Get a condom for next time.
Is your wife alright?
She's alright.
- What if she finds out?
- Hum... yeah?
Are you going to tell her that it wasn't serious with me?
What!
?
I told you I was gone on you.
It should have been you.
I met you too late to be my wife.
Would you try to understand the feelings of a pervert?
What kind of question is that?
I've had a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
It's very eerie.
Yeah?
Ah!
How does a pervert who's obsessed with you feel?
I can understand that to a degree.
Then you're a slut!
I haven't worked for Dark Publishing for a long time.
But I'm going to do some work for them.
"Pleasurable work, remember?"

Maybe we could explore this in more detail.
Maybe over coffee.
I'm talking about a hero detective and his widow's pension.
Why don't you wait in my office?
"No, I don't think so."
I'll expect to hear from you in the morning.
"No, no, that's wrong."
It won't go away unless you do something about it.
This is a crisis that could derail us.

Felt good.

"I haven't had a lot of consistent bills, per se."
But you have a checking account.
You've had one since you were a kid.

You think Marla and Walker are in on it together?
Marla was telling the truth about wanting to sell Gus' work.
Maybe Walker had money troubles.
Stole his own artwork to sell it on the black market.
So he'd cut Marla out of her share?
What do we know about Walker's background?
Anything out of the ordinary?
Not so far.
(Angela) I know Walker's lying about something.
"Let's take a closer look at him, okay?"
It's funny--
"(Leo) Oh, boy."

you're about to segue into a story about Dana that has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about.
That's not true.
"Okay, that's true."
And you've been dressing nicer for the past week or so.
Is that a new shirt?
"Yeah, Dana picked it out for me."
"Yeah, well, let 'em rumble."
We're in the clear.

"Oh, for a middle-aged mob accountant, you guys, that guy was pretty fast."
"Yes, but you did run him down in 6-inch Louboutins."
Color me impressed.
Why do I miss all the good stuff?
"And fix the bogs, and oil that very squeaky door."
And lower the price of grain.
"Er...yeah, maybe."
I mean -
"People are starving, Marcus."
I haven't eaten bread for weeks.
I thought you were on a wheat-free diet?
"Not by choice, dickhead."
I can't afford it.
"The grain companies are fucking us in the arse, and expecting us to swallow it."
"Yeah, that does sound bad."
"It's a disgrace, and a little more urgent than a squeaky door."
You haven't heard it.
It's like...
Eee-whoo-whaaargh...
"But, yeah, ending starvation."
I'll add that to the list.

"All right, landlord."
Obvious question - why are you licking a bag?

Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
"All right, cool."

Looking forward to it.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
Well...
Tell me if this feels like an answer.
No.

In here.
Is something wrong?
Y-you could've warned me.
You're the one that walked into the boys' locker room.
Listen to this.
She was a prodigy.
Had a breakdown at 16 and was institutionalized.
Took a while to get these records.
Emile Sayles was her teacher.
"Duval, listen..."
"Oh, it gets better."
Both their names are on the condolence books of the other victims.
And you were right about the admissions director.
He did have a secret.
Liz Kenyon was sleeping with him to get access to the applications.
He was afraid of getting fired.
That's what you saw.
Duval...
I have the warrant to Kenyon's home and office.
We're mounting up now.
This was good work.
She's been killing these kids.
We're gonna stop her.
"Skip past the part where even though I asked you to wait, you broke into her office."
Then what?
She was on the floor when I got here.
She was gone when I got back.
When you got back from where?
I went after Emile.
You saw him?
No.
No.
"Emile Sayles, her piano tutor, has been dead since 1997."
There is no Emile.
She signed both names in those condolence books because Emile is only in her head.
It's just her.
Excuse me.
you piece of shit.
Know this kid?
Yeah.
Know where he lives?
Yeah.
You deliver mail to his house?
Yeah.
any letter from school to his house comes directly here.
You understand?
Another letter from school goes to that kid's house head first.
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No letters from school.
no more letters from anybody.

Do you feel any pain on the sixth rib?
- No.

I felt the pain.
That's not all.
You have problems breathing as well.
You're right.
You've been training too hard.
These injuries are inevitable.

He swims like a fish.
Why did you save his life?
What do you reproach me?
What innocence!
He always forgets everything.
It's really not smart to have him introduced in the gang.

- Really?
You call going behind my back honest?
I didn't go behind your back.
I had an agreement with Bremont so he wouldn't shut down your career and Aubert's.
"He's the one who's after you, Laure, not me."
What?

- You've got my money?
- Let me go.
Wait.
"I want my share, you fucker."
Son of a bitch.
You're not entitled to anything.
You chickened out.
"Without me you wouldn't have had the key to the office,"
"- so I want my money, or I'll kill you."
- Get lost!
"Don't show up here unless you have the money, got it?"
"You think you hate it now, but wait `tiII you drive it."
I don`t want to drive it.
"I just want my old car back, okay?"
I`m not falling for this bit.
No way.
"Let`s go, Russ."
"clark, is that the right car?"
"No, it isn`t, honey."
I changed my mind.
They flattened our old car like a pancake.
Are you serious?
"Is this really our car, Dad?"
What happened?
I thought we were going to get the little Sportswagon.
"Oh, no!"
The Sportswagon`s much too small.
"Besides, I got a great deal on this one."
"If we`re taking the whole tribe cross-country believe me, this is your automobile."
Why is it still running?
"Oh, all new cars do that."
I`II take care of that in a second.
"You may think you hate it now, but wait until you drive it."
An air bag!
"You know, clark, it`s not too late to fly out to california."
We only have two weeks.
"Let`s not get into that again, sweetie pie."
please?
"Lots of families fly, clark."
especially cross-country.
The whole idea of a family vacation is to be together as a family.
"On a plane, you put on earphones and you`re lost in your own world."
"It`s a very long ride, clark."
I can feel it closing in on my nuts right now.
And after that conversation with the Bossman?
"I don't know, I'm starting to think maybe we are on the evil side of things here."
"Maybe you're just not emotionally cut out for this, Joe."
"Yeah, maybe."
"And clearly, you're not either."
I ever tell you the story about my dad?
"What, your real dad or your adoptive dad?"
"Asshole, my adoptive dad is my real dad."
"Okay, okay, good."
I didn't wanna hear a story about you searching for your biological father.
"- Shut the fuck up, Joe."
- Done.
Please continue.
"My dad Carl was a loving man, tough man."
- Like you.
"- Much more loving, much tougher."
"He worked in the, uh..."
"in the mills in Bethlehem, all right?"
Provided a decent living.
He took care of us.
Supported us.
Nothing lavish.
- Right.
"- So, one day, he gets a call into the big boss's office."
First time he's met him in 30 years.
"So, what did the boss say?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
What the fuck kind of story is this?
"You see, it's not about what the boss said;"
"it's what he didn't say, Joe."
The omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.
"My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory."
Did you say omaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.
"Hey, I'm just messing with your head."
"Mother's maiden name, please."
"Get out of my temporal lobe, house."
Hello?
Are you awake?
They told me somebody was sick like me.
I'm up.
Your voice... aren't you my doctor?
Not anymore.
You're the guy who doesn't like cops.
Yeah.
Can you see?
You can't?
Not a thing.
You've been blind a while.
The fact that you're aware of it now... it could be a sign of improvement.
It hurts so much.
Doesn't it?
I'm okay.
It's gonna hurt.
The morphine barely takes the edge off.
"I'm gonna die, aren't I?"
"You die, I die."
It's not gonna happen.
Why not?
You're just too stubborn to die?
They took a piece of my brain.
Whatever's wrong with us... they'll find.
I thought I was getting pinched over here.
He's hangin' on my fuckin' neck like a vulture.
Like impending danger.
What do you want?
This guys worried.
He didn't want to come over with the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
"$7,000, that ain't peanuts."
"I don't mean to be out of order-- lt's good you don't like to be out of order, Sonny."
"Embarrassing me in front of my friends, callin' me a fuckin' deadbeat."
"Ya know Sonny, you're a real fuckin' mutt."
You know the money we spend in this fucking--
-Don't be like that.
-Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
"You think this is funny, eh?"
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fuckin' moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
"You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too, ya know?"
You're a funny guy.
"That's it, Henry!"
You want to laugh?
This prick last week asked me to christen his kid.
"I charged him $7,000."
You really are a funny guy.
Let's get a coffee.
I don't want a coffee.
"Well, I do."
"So whatever character assassination you've got lined up for me, let's at least temper it with caffeine."
Who found her?

Had reason to pop into the loft and there was old fatty.
Only not so fat any longer.
Don't talk like that.
SHE SIGHS
The gossip on the street says it was a suicide.
"Come home, Peg."
We can't talk here.
I can't go back there.
I can't spend another night in that flat.
"Well, then we'll move."
"We'll put it on the market, we'll buy somewhere else."
"(It's not the flat, Elaine, it's you!"
)
(I can't be with you any longer!
)
Think very carefully about what you say next.
I've hired a van.
I'll be round on Friday to get what's mine.
You don't have to be there.
"In fact, it's better if you're not."
THUNDER
HE SIGHS
Most people miss first time.
You're going to be late.
SHOWER RUNS
KNOCKING
Yes.
That's what I was telling you.
"I only did mushrooms once, in high school, but I remember it like it was yesterday."
I'm returning what's left over tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Here.
Good news.
Dr. Black says you haven't had any seizure activity in 24 hours.
- You can go home now.
- Good.
"And as it turns out, we still have a home."
"Our lawyer says, if you're psychotic when you give away everything you own, it doesn't count."
"The nurse doesn't need to hear our problems, sweetheart."
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"You seem quite different today, Mr. Myers."
How are you feeling now?
Like I need to get back to the office.
We're fighting a hostile takeover.
We're in the middle of a new ad campaign.
I haven't been away from my desk this long in years.
Hear that?
I have my baby back.
- Mr. Myers.
- Ian.
- U look terrific.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Well, I turned in my toga."
Ian.
"- God, thank you so much for everything."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We're thinking what this place needs is a donor wall.
(both) Yes!
Good morning... master.
"- Morning, excellency."
- CIaudette.
Ah.
velvet flowers.
"Did you make these, CIaudette?"
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
I will leave you in peace.
"Oh, no. (giggles)"
It's very bad.
"No, don't!"
Ooh!
That's really quite good.
"One, two."
"(piano transcription of Beethoven's ""Symphony No.6 in F"")"
"You're a fine shot, sir."
I can see you're not one of those perfumed prancers in there.
- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one?
"She doesn't need your protection, by God."
Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.
"""One warm word from you and I Iive."
"One brutal word and I die."""
"""It doesn't matter, for I am not afraid of death any more."""
"""I have already visited the beyond in your music."""
- will you take it to him?
- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
"I'm sorry, OK?"
It's something with my family.
I can't talk about it now.
"Look, I got to go."
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Hey.
"- Glad you called, man."
- It's been a while.
- Thanks for coming.
It's bad enough my dad was in love with another woman.
Like my mom wasn't enough.
- But another kid?
- I guess you weren't enough?
I almost died and yet there I am back in the same place.
- Ready to do it all again.
- But you didn't.
You didn't use.
"And that's good, man."
"- Yeah, but I came close, bro."
- Of course you did.
This whole thing is textbook you.
"Look, I know you, Justin."
You didn't become a medic for nothing.
You can't stand to see people in pain.
And right now you and your family are suffering.
There's nothing you can do to make that go away.
"If it gets overwhelming, you know the drill."
"Find a meeting, work the steps."
I don't get it.
"How could he lie to us about his own daughter, knowing what it would do to us when we found out?"
And her.
"Rebecca, right?"
I don't know anyone who fits that description.Doctor's ethics.
"If you knew, you wouldn't tell?"
"No, I probably wouldn't."
"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California, no less was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient."
Is that a threat?
"No, I mention it only in passing."
"Incidentally, I mention it only in passing I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession."
"Father, wait a minute!"
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.
"Well, I get passes to the best shows in town."
"Mrs. K, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go."
That's too bad.
I hate to go alone.
"I love to talk film discuss, to critique."
You want to see a film with me?
I've got passes to the Crest.
It's Othello.
Who's in it?
Debbie Reynolds:
Desdemona and Othello:
Groucho Marx.
Are you happy?
I've seen it.
One last time.
Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
"No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans.

"The man just called once and you already ask: ""Who's that Ghena?"""
"Who, who, a horse from the zoo."
Ghena...
Ghena...
Crocodile Ghena.
Ever seen Cheburashka?
"Nina, have you seen father?"
What father?
Our father.
He must be here...
Living in the city.
I saw your beau when grandmother died.
Why?
It's just... interesting.
We had once lived together.
"Oh, Irishka!"
You know he played the accordion so beautifully when he was young.
"The moment he stretched out his accordion, all women went crazy!"
"I hid his accordion once, he cried so hard."
"They say he got a family now, two kids, a job."
Everything will be all right with you.
"And Irishka will be all right, and I will be all right."
"Scoring a goal against the team of ""Burevestnik"""
"was Anatoly Pashvykin, number 7!"
"Nina, those have scored!"
"Have you seen it, granddaughter?"
"Lullaby, lullaby,"
"Go to sleep, don't cry."
"Help me please, Mother of God,"
To wash everything I got.
"Irishka, did your mom and dad fight?"
One of many.
"Marjorie, please."
What?
She's here.
That's a good thing.
"It is, but I think I have the right to know why she's here and if she's going to stay this time."
Just drop--
"Uh, could you, um, set the dining room table for us, please?"
I cannot believe you!
"Shh, I know."
Shh...
I thought we agreed we'd be a united front.
Yeah.
"Listen, I spent the day with her today."
And I really believe that we all have an opportunity here.
"And, Marjorie, I don't want to drive her away again."
"We have been down this road before and every time-- every time, we fail."
"Yeah, all of us."
But let's-- can we just have some dinner?
As a family?
"Pasta's not overcooked, I hope?"
It's really good.
"So, have you, um... have thought about your plans now that you're home?"
No.
"Well, I'm here,"
If you want help with your resume or if you decide you want to apply to university again.
"Well, I just got back an hour ago."
Of course.
"Um, we can think ahead."
"She is, actually."
Sarah tells me that she wants to pursue art.
"Yeah, maybe even, um, art school."
She came home to her father's estate.
She was young and happy and hopeful.
"She read book s and played music for her mother and sister, and laughed while she waited for some nobleman to come and ask her hand in marriage."
The French came instead.
She hid and watched all they did.
She saw them blind her father.
She saw them rape her mother and sister Maria who begged the French to kill them.
They spared her sister but killed her mother.
"At the end, she was raped as well."
"When the French were gone, she buried her mother."
"And on her grave, she made a sacred oath."
Death to the French.
She plays no music now.
Nor reads book s.
Nor smiles or sings.
But rides the hills and hunts the French and hopes to die.
But today I saw her smile.
She smiled at you.
It almost broke my heart.
"For that alone, I thank you."
Buenas noches.
No that one's a bit sad

"Pass, friend."
"Stand easy, Cooper."
"Can I ask you a question, sir?"
"Where did you learn to fight so dirty, sir?"
"Same place as you, Cooper."
"Well, what can you have him do?"
Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle.
The possibilities are unlimited.
"Oh, come on."
"It's just some gimmick, that's all."
Tony...
"Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved,"
Doesn't seem to believe in you.

"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.
[grunting] get back!

I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"

I will demonstrate an industrial application.

No.
We have a match and a name - Denny Lorton.
Calls himself Pica.
He has form.
Sexual assault 30 years ago.
"God, this being a detective is easy."
The dead boy is Benjamin Rigby.
15 years old.
He's been selling himself for 18 months or so.
Had he been reported missing?
Mum's a junkie.
That lane was his beat.
Is this Lorton?
Reckon they can make this room any uglier?
Probably not.
It's like they think no-one actually has to work in here.
Why do we settle for ugly like it doesn't matter?
"A bit of colour there, painting there."
Some flowers.
I'm wasted in this profession.

"I owe you big-time, mate."
"If you change your mind, give us a tinkle."
(Phone rings)
Red.
Good morning's work.
You humiliate a young cop and keep that clump of sink hair out of prison.
My father worked there till the day he died.
The old man loved his female employees.
I have more relatives and half-relatives working for me than you can imagine.
(chuckles)
What am I talking about?
This is about Clayton.
"Even though I was older, he always looked out for me."
We use to call him the Mayor.
(sighs)
I just want to see him pull through this.
RYAN:
"It's okay, let him go."
"Gibbs, Gibbs, let him come back to you."
(sighs)
Just be patient.
Think about something else.
"The sweater I wore to your house the other night, what color was it?"
I know you remember.
No!
"No, no... (sighs)"
We think the shooter has a connection to AUTEC.
"You know what AUTEC is, Mr. Wickes?"
I do.
A lot of unhappy folks from your company knew exactly where SECNAV was gonna be today.
Do any of them have a connection to AUTEC projects?
Lawrence Ridgeway.
"He wasn't the man with the gun, but..."
Details.
(sighs)
Wickes built something for AUTEC back in the '70s.
Before my time.
Ridgeway was the only one still around that worked on it.
Not flat.
Villa.
"Yes, it's sea-facing"
How big is it?
Nothing too large.

That's our love-story
That's our life-story
Landed the job!
My project is through
I'm elated
You'll see Jai here.
Look into the camera when you speak
Hi Om
Jai... how are you?
"I'm fine, how are you?"
"- Okay, I'm okay"
What about your results?
- They're out
Hi sister-in-law
How have you been?
Fine.
Tell us About your results
Nothing blew up.
There was no victims that were brought out
Or--or dead bodies.
There was nothing.
I don't understand.
Nothing blew up?
That's the weird part.
"It was--it was like a bomb, only backwards, okay?"
"Instead of blowing out, it--it--it yanked everything in."
- Implosion.
- Artie.
Artie.
Did the sword do this?
"And if it did, can I reconsider this mission?"
It didn't.
And what you have to do is you have to get in that room
And tell me exactly what you see.
That's a look I don't know.
It's called the past rearing its ugly head.
"So in other words, the sword didn't do whatever happened at the embassy."
But you know what did.
"Oh, God, I hope not."
"- Artie, where are you going?"
"- No, no, I can't--"
"First, I have to..."
- Hey.
- Here we go.
Round two with Mr. Congeniality.
"Mr. Ogawa, look, we've answered all your questions,"
And now we have a few for you.
"Actually, agent Bering, I have one more."
Why does the secret service need to send two different units
How did you know?
- How long have you been following me?
- A while.
"- Look, I haven't got much time to explain."
It's not safe for me.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else and he knows you have it, Harry."
- Are you talking about the bracelet?
- I know you're a good man which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you!
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
"- You're already starting to feel it though, aren't you?"
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Don't go.
"It's a balance, Harry."
It's yin and yang.
Luck like this has its own unique price.

- Steel.

hi
Can I talk to him?
He can't actually talk... alright .
Paul!
What is it?
- They've taken him!
He's come and taken him!
"Oh, he has him now!"
I'll never see him again!
And he'll tell him everything!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to call Washington.
The police?
No!
"It'll get in the papers, and wherever he is, he'll see it!"
He'll show it to him!
All we've been trying to hide!
Washington has known all along about you and Paul.
They've had to.
It's their business.
"But I swear to you, they'll keep this thing absolutely quiet."
"When I tell them to, it will break in every paper in the country."
"It will be hard for him, but I think that boy has enough spirit to outlive anything."
"Spin around, Sonny."
That's the ol' kid.
"Getting hot, Paulsy walsie?"
"How about a nice, cool drink of ice water?"
"You wouldn't give me the sandwich, you won't give me the water."
You heard that?
I guess that told you!
"I don't know whose kid he is, but he's as game as a pit dog!"
"That's throwing it in there, kid!"
"Whoever his old man is, he ought to be proud of him!"
"Come on, Curly."
What are we waiting for?
- How do you know?
I used to be a homicide detective.
- Round up the usual suspects.
- Keep laughing.
It's a sin what he turned into.
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
We've got a dead nurse.
You stay right here.
Don't move.
"Absolutely, Dad."
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
Prick!
"Paula Puglusi, a nurse."
Same M.O. as the Putnam woman.
Guess who she used to fuck.
You knew her?
- Yeah.
"- God, Tom, I'm sorry."
Does that guy you were chasing have something to do with this?
- He was a witness.
- In the Polish Hill case?
I was one of the investigating officers.
Five women were strangled.
During the pursuit of the suspect my father was killed.
- Chicanis said he saw the killer.
- And you don't believe him?
This was the case where you lost your shield.
I lost my shield because I said a cop killed my father.
You want to give her one more pop before they take her away?
- I'll give you one more pop.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Talk to the press for Uncle Nick.
No.
Fredo's in the house with Mama.
He asked for you and Tom said you wouldn't see him.
That's right.
"Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?"
"Please, I want to talk to you."
"Michael, I hated you for so many years."
"I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you'd know"
that I could hurt you.
"You were just being strong for all of us, the way Papa was."
And I forgive you.
Can't you forgive Fredo?
"He's so sweet, and helpless without you."
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.
Connie.
"Tom, sit down."
"Our friend and business partner, Hyman Roth, is in the news."
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.
The High Court in Israel turned down his request to live there.
"His passport's been invalidated, except to return here."
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.
He offered them a million dollars if they'd let him live there.
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.
Panama won't take him.
"Not for a million, not for ten million."
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.
He's had the same heart attack for 20 years.
-That plane goes to Miami.
"They are wonderful, aren't they?"
"For them, a painter who died is a painter whose quoted value goes up."
Look at Modigliani.
Barbey and Nanteuil are astute businessmen.
You see evil everywhere.
Professional bias.
You should not stay here.
This house is full of souvenirs.
I know a wonderful boarding house.
I lived over there when I arrived in Paris.
Rather say that you fear for my life.
Is that it?
Yes.
Taste it.
It lacks a little of violet perfume.
I come back.
Whatever.
Remain by my side.
Why don't you want me to go?
It will take only thirty seconds.
It is April 12.
"I know, so what?"
It's the anniversary today.
The fatal date.
"Listen, Princess, every year at this date, it's the same."
You are afraid.
"Meanwhile, Mr Fantômas has not returned for four years."
I'm superstitious.
"Come on, you're going to Mr Thomery's bal later."
Exactly.
Mr Thomey was ill-advised to give up this bal barely a few days after the tragic death of my friend the Baroness de Vibray.
I tried to dissuade him.
Why are you making us struggle?
You should have said it from the beginning.
This is great.
What are we going to do about Turan and his gang?
They've been... watching us closely for a very long time.
Who?
These guys?
Excuse me!
What are you looking at?
Give me that ball.
"Come on, get out of here!"
"Yes, is there anything else?"
"Then we are all in, aren't we?"
"Why are you asking me, dude?"
I am already in.
You were the ones who were waiting for Mert.
Her you go.
He's here now.
You've been on my case since I came.
"You're angry, so I am not saying anything."
- Who are you to say anything anyway?
"- Gamze, it's enough."
"Look, it's more important for me than anyone else here to finish school."
Okay?
You won't understand this.
"So, don't drag it out."
Let's get down to business if the old issues are over.
"Kaan, you are the only one who could plan this whole thing."
"Dude, I've never done anything shameful in my whole life."
Alright?
"But my family is calling me a ""shameless man."""
"Okay, I was really angry the other day."
It's not Paul.
Why am I having a hard time believing that?
Hmm.
I don't know.
Let's dig deep.
"Yeah, let's..."
let's do that.
Maybe because of your mother?
Excuse me?
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?
She told me all about her addiction and how she left you guys and how it fucked you up.
And I am starting to see that.
Have you even ever been to therapy?
"No, I haven't."
"Well, maybe you should try it."
Why are you letting this guy take care of you?
- He's not.
- He is.
He's giving you shelter.
So what are you doing in return?
"What the fuck are you giving him in return, Laura?"
!
You think I'm fucking him so that I can stay in this house?
"I think it's a fucking reasonable fucking suggestion, Laura!"
"- Oh, my God, Jay."
- Don't you think?
Not every relationship is transactional!
Every fucking relationship is transactional!
That's the fucking definition of a fucking relationship!
I can't do this.
"Laura, Laura, Laura, Laura!"
"- First, you can't drive."
- Why not?
You can't drive your car.
Let him get some fresh air.
You're so pretty.
The princess on the pea.
Little mouse.
But you want to sleep.
I can see how tired you are.
Yes my love.
Lullaby and goodnight

- Do you recognize that sound?
"- Yes, mistress."
You know how much I love to pull you up on your balls.
"Oh yes, mistress."
- Ease it a little?
"- As you wish, mistress."
Or do you beg me to pull harder?
"Harder, please, mistress."
- I can't hear your.
"- Harder, please, mistress."
- And?
"- Please, mistress."
That's better.
- After all.
"- Thank you, mistress."
- All for you.

How late was Colin here?
About 5:00.
We were just having fun.
He never even mentioned his girlfriend.
What about this boy?
You ever seen him?
The victim helped us with this sketch of her assailant.
I don't know.
He looks like he could be 100 different people.
"Miss Sennett, can I have a word?"
You ever go to Throb?
Or Cushion?
Sure.
What about way back when Cushion was called Class A?
"No, but I hear it kicked."
Mmm.
Legend's always better than the truth.
My partner and I are after a group of burglars working the club circuit.
They target people like you and Colin 'cause you're young and famous and it's easy to track when you stay out late.

They always find out.
Nobody will find out as long as you don't say a word.

"- No, I won't."
- Good.
"Now, you run on home now."
"- Thank you, doctor."
- That's a good girl.
Thanks.

It'll always be waiting for you.
Thanks for the beautiful bed jacket.
"Hi, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Hi, Allison."
"- Hi, Ted."
- We were just leaving.
- Don't let me rush you out.
- We have to go.
"Goodbye, Selena."
See you soon.
They say it'll bloom for a month.
You can plant it in your yard as a reminder of your operation.
Here's a book on humor.
Surgery's nothing these days.
You'll be up before you know it.
"I went to see Mr. Rossi today, talked about how to get to college."
He said he might be able to wrangle me a scholarship.
He talked Mr. Partridge into taking me into his office as an office boy.
How about that?
That's just fine.
"Only thing is, if I work there a year, it'll be eight years instead of seven before I can pass the bar exam."
I am always scared that it might be too late.
I know that the path that I have chosen is wrong.
But when there is only one path left to be chosen the right and the wrong doesn't have any meaning.
The path that I chose following Avi's hunger and your tears that path took me to diverse destinations.
"Mother, I was a kid then."
I didn't know how difficult it would be to return from this path.
"Still, I didn't let my criminal activities affect Avi."
"Come back, Baba."
You have compensated more than you had to.
Return home now.
Take my oath.
"Take my oath, or I will slap you."
"Mother, shall I take your oath, your slaps, or food cooked by you?"
Eat the food first.
Come on.
- Mr. Kadar!
- Who is it?
- Where are you?
- l am here!
- Please come out.
- Just a minute.
"- Please let me see you, Government."
- Here is the government.
- Where are you?
- Here I am.
- What are you doing?
- l am counting the change.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
- How are you?
- l am fine.
- What brings you here?
Not much left of him.
It's gonna take 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.
Harry?
Kalim intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kalim, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone was trying to muscle out Freddie but Freddie wasn't listening.
Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Kayleigh's murder was so precise - no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
Freddie Lau's body is just dumped in an alleyway.
It's sloppy.
Check out the CCTV in Soho the night Freddie died.
We might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry."
It's my down time.
- Ah!
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your new personal trainer.
Ah-ah!
"The tall guy the other night in the casino, the one that got chucked out - what's his name?"
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just a warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
"All right, stop."
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff but he got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
I think you had a druids dream.
I think you instinctively knew
You were going to meet da veiga.
"Sydney, nigel."
"(nigel:)doesn't look much like a map, does it?"
I don't understand.
How's that supposed to
Lead us to the astronomicons?
There are words written down
One side of the blade.
"It's latin, I think"
They may reference the map.
"First I nearly get us killed,"
Now I've stolen the wrong package.
"Yeah, well you should have"
Come to us honestly.
(andreas:)I could have proved to you
That I'm an academic in my own right.
Dedicated to the conservation of relics.
But I knew you'd never trust
Anyone named da veiga.
I don't expect you to understand.
Try me.
(andreas:)after my father got back
"From the jungle, he was badly burned..."
Doctors said he'd die.
He didn't.
He asked to see me.
I wouldn't at first.
He hadn't done more than
Send me a card at christmas
And birthdays since my mother died
"Oh, look at this."
There's no place to park around here.
I don't know why they even sell cars here.
Don't complain.
At least you have your health.
"George, watch out for that man!"
"Hey, hey, get back here."
Newman?
The white whale.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig?
- Would you do that?
"- No, definitely not."
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
Know what else?
He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
- The one who sits by herself?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
- Really?
Debby told me she fell in love with him because he has perspective.
She thinks a guy who lies about an illness so he can get some phoney hair has perspective?
- He picked her up?
- Walked right over to her table.
Wow.
Jake.
"Jake, take a look."
See?
You're not the only one who has them.
I have them too.
- Where did you get those?
"She ran away from the home and me, you know?"
But I didn't give up!
I have brought her back!
"And that, too, after she has a child!"
I see... but how did you accomplish all this?
One has to apply his mind for the children's welfare.
One cannot live on love alone.
One needs money.
One needs comforts...
"And luxuries, too."
What happened?
My heart...
Janki!
Janki!
I want a truck-load of flowers.
Have the house washed...
Have the boss's white attire ironed.
And I want 200 kgs of ice...
That's a must!
We'll lay the boss's body on that... or his body will stink till his brother arrives from Nepal.
He must be given a National Hero's farewell!
He is leaving us so much!
I'll ask his daughter and let you know more.
Hang on.
What happened?
Everything is fine.
Call off everything!
Bless aunt!
The worst could have happened if she had not rushed you here on time.
She carried you all the way as if you were a child!
"You ought to take part in the Olympics, aunt!"
India would be assured of at least one gold medal.
I will ask them to connect the electricity power supply.
"As long as he was alive and living in this building, it had become Chel e Moori_"
There were going and coming.
Food was ready all the time.
The smell of his brewed coffee could be heard on the other side of village.
But where is he now?
Nobody is here to take a breath.
- Mashti
- Yes
This money is my carfs income.
That's ok_ Count it down.
Leave.
I accept it.
I want you to count it down in front of me.
Just leave and don't disturb my job.
"Ifl leave now, you can't say that a hundred toman is missing on the next day."
"No problem, leave and don't disturb my job."
I won't accept if you blame.
Leave.
I trust you.
"Go, boy!"
Don't stop here.
"I don't need your cart, I am waiting for taxi."
You can't find any taxi here.
"Yes, Iwill_ Leave it."
Where are you going?
I want to go to the other side of the port
"Even if you say the other side of the world, Iwill make it."
I want to go there by taxi.
Put it down.
- You haven't had breakfast yet.
- lt's late.
Of course not.
"You're being funny, aren't you?"
Mum and Roger had a big row  then had gone off to the kitchen to talk quietly.
Then Roger came out.
Then why did you split up with Roger?
Did he have another girlfriend?
I don't think so.
Do you have another boyfriend?
Don't you think you would know?
"Who would I be seeing, the milkman?"
No.
He's too young.
"No, Marcus."
I haven't got another boyfriend.
That's not how it works.
"Not when you're a 34-year-old working mother in a youth-obsessed, anorexic, soulless culture."
"Don't worry, Mum."
I won't go to McDonald's.
I hope she makes you itch.
"You know, really itch."
- I just can't believe how you could do that.
- You bloody pig!
What were you thinking?
Do you have shit for brains?
Let it out.
Let it out.
You're a bastard!
I hate you for what you've done.
That's good.
"I wouldn't mind if you did it once, but you wanted to do it twice."
- I wanna put my hands around your throat...
- You don't have to do that.
"Hi, ziggy!"
I heard you hit a home run today!
Yeah.
That is so exciting.
Congratulations.
"So, i organized some of the photos."
Here's grandma and grandpa.
"Cousins, brother, more cousins."
"I don't know if they're first or second, though,"
Because i'm not sure who they--
"Okay, wait, first of all, we have to draw the tree."
That's the most important thing.
And they want it actually on the cardboard.
"Here you go, honey."
The assignment said the child has to contribute.
"Now, put the trunk on there."
"And you're gonna be in the trunk,"
And then your mom and dad are then leaves.
And then we'll go from there.
What about my father?
"Um, we don't--"
We need to put him in here.
"You don't have a dad, sweetie, so it's-- it's okay."
"We'll use grandma and grandpa, and me, and great-uncle jimmy."
I still have to write my dad's name on the board.
"Well, you know, i said that, but everybody's board"
Is gonna be a little bit different.
You have to write down both of your parents' names.
I'll get in trouble if i don't.
"No, you won't get in trouble."
I want you to put it down.
Ziggy.
"But, Mr. Connors, there has to be a reason you thought initially that it was sabo..."
I said I wasn't thinking.
Okay?
My son just died.
PRIDE:
"Mr. Connors,"
"I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you, but our job is to find out what happened to your son."
"You know that, right?"
Sure.
Of course.
Do you know of any reason why somebody might have wanted to hurt Jared?
I-I don't know.
"What about you, Ms. Wells?"
Did you see anything suspicious?
(sighs) No.
(clears throat)
"We were just chasing each other around the track, you know, messing around."
Jared was showing me how to race.
So it was your first time.
I've been in racecars before.
I'm the advance coordinator for Warbury Racing.
We're in town this week for the race.
You two work for the same team?
"Yeah, about a year now, yeah."
That's how I met Jared.
We've been dating ever since.
Was he a good driver?
He was great.
RUSS:
"Well, he's been racing his whole life."
All the way back to go-carts.
He was gonna turn pro after his discharge.
Mr. Assanai why are you back?
I thought you got better.
I miss you.
So I thought I'd visit.
Yeah?
Room 5 please.
Number 117.
"That day if I thought of you only as a patient, I wouldn't have felt anything."
"But being that we're friends,"
I felt sad.
So I hoped that you're feeling well.
And I wouldn't have to see you again.
"I'm feeling well, doc."
I just wanted to see you again.
There is one thing I wanted to tell you.
But I didn't get to tell you.
"When you told me to go to the beach,"
I really went there.
I never thought I'd want to sit and watch the sunset.
But you told me to.
So I watched it that day.
"Honestly, seeing the sunset was a waste of time, but that day I don't know why, I..."
I sat there for hours.
That day I felt like
I could breathe easily.
And I was happy.
Just like every time I see you.
"Thank you very much, doctor."
I thought you said you were feeling well.
I hope next month we won't see each other again.
FEDERALPROSECUTOR SAMELLISIS WIDELYEXPECTED
"-Frank, honey."
Lunch!
And your family.
"Senator, I guarantee this is nothing but a blemish on a great metropolis."
The party will never see that blemish in June.
"All it'll see is the Garden, the Plaza, the Waldorf..."
"... electricity,excitement,fun."
Catch the noon news in D.C. He's only magnificent.
Four extra classes graduate the academy this year.
Unions?
Did I hear you say unions?
Every municipal contract....
Harriet.
You watching this?
World Bank interest you more?
Want to read about the convention in the Chicago Tribune?
"Well, okay."
Okay then.
Wait till you see his performance on the 6:00 news.
When the train leaves the station...
"... theTimes,goodand graylady  that she is, will want to be onboard."
What happened to you?
I called you.
You were down in the basement.
I'm gonna get a washer at Orchard Supply...
... stopthemachinefromthunking.
I'll eat when I get home.
Okay.
Be careful.
Of course.
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
But that ain't my fault.
I'm waiting for Captain Leavenworth to arrive with his army.
Then we'll have enough men to shoot some civilization into those fucking Arikara and get back our pelts.
All right.
All right.
When's that supposed to happen?
I don't know.
"But until then, nobody gets paid."
"Listen here, all right?"
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.
"The way I see it, now you, you got a safe."
It's probably full of money.
You signed a contract to protect your boss and your boss's property.
And that safe isn't full anymore.
It's short about $300.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
"It means, according to my records you purchased more goods on the expedition than what you are owed by the company."
"Now, Happy New Year, Fitzgerald."

- Somebody die?
"- Oh, hey."
What's up?
What took you so long?
"Oh, I had to catch a cab from my parking space, and I stopped by to pick up the tickets for the game tomorrow night."
Here you go.
Tenth row.
Great view of the cheerleaders.
"Oh, that's right."
The game's tomorrow.
"- Oh, you forgot."
"- No, no, no, I didn't forget, man."
I'm psyched.
I'm not gonna miss it.
- What's up with all the files?
"- Uh, ""vision state"" stuff."
Marketing ideas.
Info about the webcast we're doing on Tuesday and the Leviathan contracts.
"- Adam's here, right?"
- Yep.
I'm gonna give it to him today.
"You know, Leviathan's in a hurry to get it, and he did offer."
That was before you crashed the wedding.
"- I'm never gonna live that down, am I?"
"- No, pal."
It's only been 2 weeks.
"I don't know what the statute of limitations is on something like that, but I'm thinking it's probably longer than 2 weeks."
"Look, we don't have a choice, Dave."
"The company's on life support, and we can't afford a new lawyer."
- You're right.
It's fine.
"- No, I'll take care of it."
"- Sailing orders, Crawford."
"- Thank you, sir."
- I report to Jarvis in Corsica?
- Correct.
With all possible speed.
Try to avoid any side issues on the way.
How's your glass?
"Your first lieutenant, Mr. Scott-Padget what do you make of him?"
- He is both efficient and keen.
"So keen, he's out with the press gang."
I hate tattling.
"No cursing his efficiency and devotion to duty, but I should warn you..."
"If you'll forgive me, sir, I'd prefer to make up my own mind."
No.
Don't!
You mustn't resist the king's pressmen.
We've only been married three days.
- You don't want him!
He's not a sailor.
- We shall teach him.
Don't take him from me.
You can't!
- I beseech you.
Have pity on us.
- Bring him along.
These men are from the Defiant.
Press gang.
- From our ship.
"- We're Navy, they can't touch us."
We'd have some explaining to do.
- Come with us.
"- You can't, he's a gentleman."
It was just a little Nurofen Plus...
LAUGHTER ..sort of size.
Then that worked its way down my trouser leg.
AUDIENCE GROANS
Did you shake it out?
I did.
I kicked it towards Christopher Biggins.
LAUGHTER
Hoped for the best.
Awful.
"But she didn't notice, did she?"
"Well, she gave me that look."
LAUGHTER
"""You shat yourself."" She didn't say anything to me."
Did she shake hands and then push you away?
She's notorious for doing that.
"No, she chatted to everyone, and she got to me and I just got the look and she moved on."
"I think someone had warned her, ""Don't speak to him."""
"Yeah. ""He's a shitter, Ma'am."""
LAUGHTER
"""Move on, Ma'am, he's shat himself."""
LAUGHTER
"all right, fuck this!"
Fuck this!
LAUGHTER
"Whenever I see you, Jack Dee,"
"I remember you being in the Edinburgh Festival and you telling me a story with, like, a really naughty chuckle in your voice, because you'd seen Paul Morocco..."
Do you remember this?
"Yes, I know."
"..Paul Morocco, the famous and quite brilliant juggler..."
Yes.
"..in a bank in Edinburgh, during the festival, trying to cash a cheque and he didn't have any ID, and he was saying, ""But I'm Paul Morocco."
The ultimate secret sex spot.
All these people around...
Where should we start?
Let's hold off on that for right now.
We're on high alert.
Who choose out this song?
It's so good!
You're monopolizing the dean's time.
I'm sorry.
"Dean Bowman, this is Ashleigh Hawards, social chair at ZB, would you excuse me?"
I'm gonna go check on the refreshments.
It's such a treat to have you here.
So I guess you're also a big fan of the book?
Which book?
Oh The Great Gatsby!
Yeah!
Totally!
It's one of my favorites.
Mia Farrow is one of the great tragic characters in modern literature.
- Awesome!
"- Better than watch movies alone, right?"
It's the Omega Chi dropout!
"We love you, man!"
You're beautiful!
Good going man!
Omega Chis suck!
I'm starting to feel more like a trophee than prospective pledge.
"No, I want you here, 'cause you're a good friend."
"and all around, great guy."
You'd be around other great guys.
- As opposed to Evan?
- As opposed to Evan.
Don't you recognize me?
"In any case, you know that the only real pictures are childhood photos."
What is this picture?
It's an eminent Victorian in a hollywood bed.
There's a special effect here...
The bed appears twice.
"Yes, I made the bed even more hollywood-ish by doubling it."
"I prolonged it, to show this curve."
To make it even more victorian.
"It was taken in London, in a hotel room."
And who is this person?
My husband.
It was taken in London?
"In London, in january."
"At night, as you can see."
This is my friend of mine.
"Whom I photographed here in Paris, nearby actually."
I took off the part I wasn't interested in.
This person is also in a bed?
"No, he was layed back in a couch."
Layed back...
"But he seems floating in a bathtub, no?"
"Yes, yes."
"In the water, in a pool."
He holds a glass of tequila.
I gave him some...
In order for him to relax.
"It worked just a little bit, actually."
I have never seen this one.
This was taken more or less a year ago...
In Montfort I'Amaury.
Actually I wasn't the one who took the picture.
-l'm tight.
-Your pectorals are okay now...
"... butyoudon'tworkthem , in 5 years, they'll be at your knees."
-The train's moving on that track.
"-What are you, mid-30s?"
No reason for it.
Doesn't have to be that way.
-Thanks for the advice.
"-lt's not advice, it's fact."

-My vote is speed.
"You wanna sit on a butt like cottage cheese, be my guest. I'll sit on this."
"You got to admit, lieutenant, the guy's got a hell of a muscular ass."
"Hey, detectives?"
That's Dee Dee Santini's mother.
"-Sorry for your loss, Mrs. Santini."
-My name's McBride.
My daughter's name was Santini.
"At 1 6, she married a punk named Santini."
"This is my Dolores, and she'll always be McBride to me."
Let's sit down.
"Come on, sit down."
"-What can we do for you, ma'am?"
-l want to show you some things.
This is her high school graduation.
I distinctly ordered the Antarctic blue Super Sportswagon with the CB and the optional rally fun pack.
You didn`t order the metallic Pea?
metallic Pea?
"No, Antarctic blue."
The Sportswagon.
This isn`t even the right model!
I think you`re right.
I don`t think this is the car.
This is the new Wagonqueen family Truckster.
"This is a fine automobile, if you want my honest opinion."
It beats the hell out of the Sportswagon but I want to make you happy.
Davenport!
I`II get to the bottom of this.
Mr. GriswoId ordered a blue Sportswagon.
Where is it?
"I don`t know, sir."
I know what must have happened!
It didn`t come in!
"Ed, I`m not your ordinary, everyday fool."
Okay?
I`d like my Antarctic blue Super Sportswagon right now.
"If you can`t get it for me, I`m going to take my business elsewhere!"
Where`s my old car?
I`m just as upset as you are.
believe me.
Davenport!
Get Mr. GriswoId`s car back!
Bring it back here!
"I can get you the wagon, there`s no problem there."
"The problem is, it might take six weeks."
"I owe it to myself to tell you, Mr. GriswoId if you`re thinking of taking the tribe cross-country this is the automobile you should be using."
The Wagonqueen family Truckster.
What's this?
These are some numbers I'm thinking of playing.
"Oh, no, no."
"Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's going to steal your numbers.
"Well, you'd be a fool not to."
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.
"They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns and the theories of Sir Isaac Newton."
Isaac Newton?
Really?
There's just six numbers.
You only buy one ticket a week?
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?
"Well, it depends. 20."
"You're just shotgunning it, huh?"
Rookie move.
"Well, how much have you won?"
How much ever or how much this year?
Let's say ever.
Zero.
It's not just about winning or losing.
It's the lottery.
It's all about winning.
What else is there?
"The journey, Captain!"
It's how you get there.
I'd rather lose my way than win a $20 million jackpot your way.
Okay.
I think we're through here.
"You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery Expert?"
"Well, I've got news for you."
Yes.
Okay?
There he is.
I'm coming to get you!
Reserve a special cell for me.
I'll be right back after stabbing him!
Poor husband.
Can one man be the reason for destroying another?
The curse of husbands will not spare you.
Be careful.
- It's okay.
Is the inspector's phone ready?
It is ready.
- Give it.
Do you know the old actor 'Bagavathar'?
Yes.
- This is belongs his era.
Why is he still using it?
May be he has his sentiments about it.
We can fix that then.
"I'll fix wifi, bluetooth, and all features in this."
Why would you do that!
So he can track all my activities and be a pain?
Give me the phone.
Get the money from him.
"If the phone conks off again, take it to the museum."
Please don't bring it to my shop.
I'll pass the message to the inspector.
"Panju, if the victim was an outsider,"
He should have stayed in a hotel or at a lodge.
Why don't we enquire there.
I now know why we seem to set well together.
Checkmate.
Oh really?
Take care of him.
He's getting picked up in two hours.
"Okay, I see."
I appreciate it.
"Say, could you tie this?"
I knew that he had a screw loose somewhere.
Who would have thought he has such difficulties?
Wouldn't it be better if I call the police?
No!
Give Bulle a call.
He should pick him up.
"Say, could you put that gun away?"
"It's making me nervous, that thing in your hand."
"When I get nervous, I can't stop talking."
- Everybody has problems.
"Tell me, this isn't that Pope troupe?"
Pope dancers.
"It'll be great, I promise."
Background for Nora.
Hopefully not this hip-hop shit.
Don't worry about it.
It'll be great.
"Next time, you change your shirt."
Chic!
"Recently, my neighbor has been leaving her trash in front of my door."
She said that she didn't notice.
"The fact that it fell over, and brown sauce dripped all over my carpet..."
"She didn't notice that either, right?"
"She said, that she didn't do it on purpose."
And that's just not nice.
- Is that one of those...
- Yeah.
I wasn't here when everything went down
"Between Artie and MacPherson, but I know it was bad."
Here.
"Yeah, this feels right."
Yeah.
It must've been bad.
"I mean, all that stuff with Ogawa."
Giving Dickinson the file.
He wanted more than the sword.
He wanted to mess us up as a team.
It worked.
"Well, I don't know how to work with him right now."
The thing about Artie is that he's lost
A lot of people in his life--including agents.
So now he just shuts everybody out.
It's a defense mechanism.
That's not an excuse.
It's not a reason to keep secrets as compulsively as he does.
It's not meant to be an excuse.
Just an explanation.
"Artie acts like he doesn't care,"
But he does--about you both--a lot.
And that scares him.
"Well, I guess he needs to work that out, doesn't he?"
"You know, just because he lost people,"
It doesn't make us expendable.
I'm not a red shirt.
I'm not.
She's upset because I don't communicate.
"Did she not notice the word ""secret"""
'What Laxminarayan one and Jia got..
..With that they bought their share of restaurant from Munde.'
'Today too Laxmi's mother wants her son to be a shooter.'
'And she tells the same thing to every goon.'
"If this time he fails, he is not his father's son."
Let me tell you.
'Laxminarayan two bought some shares of virus autos..
..With his share and today he is the board of director in that company.'
'And his boss Pipat..'
Pipat.
"- Yes, sir!"
I think we need to talk.
"- Yes, sir."
Sit.
"Sir, on the chair or the sofa?"
- Chair.
Left or right?
- Left.
Your left or my left?

"Hello, I'm Professor Brian Boucher, and welcome to the first video in An Introduction to Financial Accounting."
"Oh, my gosh."
Do you remember The Casbah?
That concert?
- Barely.
In the best way.
"- Oh, my God."
"You covered ""How Will I Know?"" And you dedicated it to me and I sat there trying not to laugh."
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were easier when we were younger.
"Unlike our kids, we just jumped into things."
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that?"
Just figure it out as we go along.
Maybe this didn't turn out to be the romance we thought it would be.
It was more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it.
- I don't wanna miss out.
"- Well, neither do I."
I don't have a ring so this will have to do.
"- Rufus, what are you doing?"
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your fifth husband.
So...
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Come here.
"Hey, don't worry about this, okay?"
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
Today one will left.
Didn't worked.
I think its out of range.
Take the car near the rally.
I think they know we are following them.
Increasing the speed.
"I am getting near, you make target."
Drive fast its getting late.
You don't know my nature?
Uncle?
Why its not working?
Bhai (brother) its on target should i shoot.
"Wait lets find out where's the diamond,"
Papa!
Yes!
"A man who is behind us, asking for side, should I give him?"
"Papa, tell him if he give him side, then car will come on the middle."
"Then how could we get the range, I'm telling you over take him,"
"One, Two Three..."
"Laxminarayan, it's your first murder, Shoot him,"
"For your mother's tears sake, Shoot him."
"Papa, he's escaping, No, Papa."
"I suppose to leaving you but to ask first,"
My I take a leave please?
Please!
No!
"Till he die, you can't leave from here, Follow him,"
I miss a lot still water and died grand mother.
What you looking at my face?
"We don't have to spare Yadav, Come on."
Dad!
Dad!
Or not.
And you don't have the harder part.
I have the harder part.
He wants me to meet him at his house and lie to Mr. Boykewich.
"If we all get caught, what's Mr. Boykewich going to think of us after all he's done for us?"
He's going to think we're Ben's friends.
But we don't want Ben with Dylan.
We don't like Dylan.
She's okay.
"No, she's not."
She got him in trouble.
"First it was the pot, then it was the fire, what's next?"
Is she going to have him murder someone?
No.
I'm not going to do it.
I don't like her.
And I don't like him dating her.
"And for once, he should do what his father tells him and we should encourage him to do what his father tells him."
That's what a real friend would do.
That's not what a real friend would do.
A real friend would do anything a friend needs him or her to do.
I'm happy you said that.
Anything?
Yeah.
What if Ben asked you to have sex with him.
"Well, that's ridiculous."
Ben would never ask me to have sex with him.
Ben didn't...
"Ben didn't ask you to have sex with him, did he?"
Did he?
Did you?
When!
Was me and the old man.
"As of this morning, got to be just me."
"Dispatch, we have a code 32 off Carrion Road."
"Burning pretty good, by the smell of it."
I think I found us Ken Mersey.
"What the hell happened to you, Ken?"
Where'd you get off to?
Shit.
"Well, that's everyone that's come in."
Closest thing to a Molotov cocktail these folks have seen is a broken air conditioner.
"Sorry about that, Deputy."
But I don't believe your friend is here.
Didn't say he was a friend.
And it's Sheriff.
Is Ken in there?
Is he okay?
"Don't give me that look, Wallace."
"Surprising, is all."
Ken Mersey is a good man.
He looks after me.
"Oh, Wallace, stop it."
What do you know about the truck?
He bought it.
He told me to fix it up and sell it to Shep.
You know he was smuggling ammunitions across the border in that truck?
- That's a lie.
"- Well, whatever he ain't telling you got him in trouble last night, got him confronted."
By who?
Still sorting that out.
But whoever that may be...
I ain't gonna tell you that Ken Mersey don't got his own consequences coming to him.
"Ah, fuck."
Yeah?
"""To Mr. Thomas W. Smith."
Subject:
Promotion.
"Effective July 12th, you'll report to Division Superintendent James to assume your new duties as assistant general shop foreman. """
"- Well, congratulations, boy."
- Thanks.
Well...
You seem glad to get rid of your old foreman.
"No, we ain't."
Glad to see you get it.
"Hey, Tommy, who's gonna crack the whip in your place?"
"As far as I know, the job's still open."
They'll fill it the way they always have.
Move the best man up.
"Well who would you say the best man is, Tommy?"
Heh-heh.
"Kid, if they ask me, I'll have to tell them you're all pretty good."
Ha-ha.
You know darn well I'm better than pretty good.
Sure.
You're the guy that wrote those books Dombrowski's always studying.
"There's one for you, wise guy."
"Hey, there she blows."
Let's go back.
"Till Monday, I'm still the best man."
"Yes, sir, Mr. Smith."
"Hey, you big ape, you."
Get in there.
Tommy was kidding.
You've been here longer than the rest.
You can run this shop as well as you run that drill press.
This is an emergency.
"I repeat, this is an emergency."
What's going on?
I don't know.
Andfastenyourseatbelts.
"I repeat, this is.."
"Sir, we're under attack!"
It's clear that someone on the inside has orchestrated..
this takeover of the White House.
That's the only way..
"Mr. Speaker, we have confirmation of ground impact."
"We're going to need to swear you in, sir."
What?
Executive power passed to the vice president when he was sworn in..
which means the office now passes to you.
Sir.
Please follow these men.
"Sir, these are your new presidential launch codes."
Please keep them on your person at all times.
I need a moment here.
I need..
I need to call my wife.
"Of course, sir."
Thank you.
Emily Cale.
How are you enjoying your tour?
Remember these?
"You and I have a date, sweetheart."
You'll have to go through me.
Really?
You're gonna go to jail for that!
And who's gonna make me?
and text and e-mail.
I'm gonna come back to you.
You promise?
Promise.
Spring cleaning- a curious ritual.
Nicole said it meant time to rid ourselves of things we didn't need anymore.
The first step is reflection.
What's worth keeping?
What's lost its value and can be given away?
"For some, the choice is easy."
"For others, much more difficult."
Wow!
Getting rid of all that.
"Actually, I've gone through, and..."
I like all my things.
I don't want to give them away.
"Oh, Kyle, you don't have to, but... a lot of this stuff has seen its best day."
Look at this t-shirt.
"It's shrunk, it's stained, it's faded."
I wore this the first time Stephen took me to work with him.
Well... this one's torn.
I ripped it playing basketball with Josh.
Great game.
The first gift Lori ever gave me.
Sentimental pack rat.
Great.
We're in trouble.
"Look, this isn't supposed to be torture."
"Consider it a chance to shed your old skin, be someone new."
"Dude, take a load off."
Let's throw this puppy around for a few.
Let me grab the rest of the boxes first.
"Oh, Bruiser!"
Bruiser!
Fighters... set to.
Regency boxing predated today's Queensberry rules.
"Come on, Mr. Dean!"
"Come on, Bruiser!"
It combined punching with wrestling and was always bareknuckle.
Who wants to back the favorite?
Who's going to show first blood?
First blood!
First blood!
Time!
Rounds continued until one man hit the ground.
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
Here they come.
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
Round 16.
Come on!
Come on!
"Fights could last for hours and only ended when one of the pugilists was unable to walk up to the chalk square, hence the expression ""squaring up."""

You didn't sign anything?
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.
"We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy."
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.
- Fun?
You want to go.
- Darling...
"- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
"- Right, sir."
He called you sergeant.
Why?
You're not in the army.
"It's just an old habit, hard to break."
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married?
You'd rather be with him.
Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army?
- I didn't say quite that.
Be fair.
"- Please, sahib, hurry."
"- Come on, Sergeant!"
- Can't you wait a minute?
"Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter."
- Can't you trust me?
Kiss me goodbye.
"- No, never."
They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now.
"- I'm coming, Mac!"
No rush.
They're bringing the horses around.
No rush?
I feel awful we stopped at all.
You swear you didn't do it for me.
Because I'm a terrible rider.
We've gained time on horseback
We never would have achieved by carriage.
But we needed rest.
The horses were about to drop as well.
"And, in truth, it may not matter."
My mother might already be dead.
Don't say that.
You might think
She deserves it after all she's done.
To mary.
I think even mary would say that's in the past.
It will be soon
If I can convince my father to spare her life.
"It's unbelievable, really."
What?
"If all goes well,"
Bash begins his life with mary and I get exile.
And my mother.
Not for long.
"I'll set her up somewhere, far away, with my brothers"
And then...
I'll be on to the next.
Where will you go?
I was thinking morocco.
You don't think you'd stand out in morocco?
Sweden then.
Oh.
Would it be too much trouble if I could come... have a nice night.
Is the only evidence we found at the crime scene.
What can you tell us about him?
He was relatively clean.
He came and went without so much as a peep.
Any visitors?
Only for just an hour.

How you doing?
This is it... 424.

That'll be all.
Thank you.

We got a film buff on our hands.
What you got?
You find something?
"Well, it sure isn't nothing."
Powdered eggs again.
What am I paying for?
"Still, better than the blitz, right, english?"
"Oh, just barely."
Get out of here.
- Oh.
Now.
"Sorry, I just wanted to show my boyfriend my fake shoes."
- Now!
- She's pregnant.
What?
Ah!
- Pregnant?
- It worked.
- Where you goin'?
- My shoe!
Oh!
"Well, they clash with my dress anyway."
"You know, I was thinking... we could do some vacationy things... when we go to D.C."
You know?
Make the most of our trip.
Where's my lockpick set?
"You know, maybe a fancy dinner one night, take in some of the sights."
I'm gonna confront a man who tried to have me killed.
"It's not a weekend getaway, Fi."
- We can mix business with pleasure.
- It was right here.
"Fi, the thing about D.C.-"
Is that you're going to need backup.
Don't tell me you'd rather have Sam.
- We can't talk about this right now.
- Why not?
Because I have a hard time focusing when I'm in handcuffs!
Would this help?
Another fine illustration of your need for tactical assistance.
"Admit it, Michael."
"Hi, Daddy."
He was the one that got the license for this building.
Nice guy.
[Woman] You gave me a little bit of a scare... when you told me you had pains in your chest and back.
You have to let somebody know.
If you're having pains in your chest and your back-
In my chest that goes through to my back.
- Is that what's happening right now?
- Mm-hmm.
You know what?
"I think maybe I better take you back to the area, just to be safe."
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm
-Yeah -
- She might be pregnant.
[Laughing] How do you say-
She
- She says maybe you're pregnant.
[Laughing]
- That would be interesting.
- It would be a very good thing... if you would - if you would find me a really good husband.
It's already too late.
"If you're pregnant, it's already over..."
- [Claire] Oh.
"- I've seen you with a new young man around here, Claire."
I know that you do have someone new in your life.
- Oh.
- Do you remember that?
Memory is one of the things she hasn't got.
And I think his name is Albert.
"- Oh, Al..."
[Groaning]
"♪ She's a superfreak, superfreak ♪"
♪ she's superfreaky yeow.
What was that?
You are not going to believe this.
At work I got all these compliments about the no-makeup thing.
"I mean, people telling me I looked great, and, like, younger."
Really?
Yes!
"And I actually got carded at lunch, and then I went to 2 other places, got carded again."
"I'm not gonna lie to you, honey."
I'm a little looped.
[Laughs]
That's--that's great.
Great for you.
"It is great, isn't it?"
We decided to be more honest with each other.
"You know, set some goals, work on some stuff, and we did it."
"Yeah, we--we did it."
Yeah.
You're done.
Wow.
"It's like without my makeup, my eyes stand out in this really great way."
And my mouth is so naturally pouty.
"I tell you, this telling each other stuff was the best thing we ever did, babe."
"You know, there is other stuff."
Huh?
"There's more things that you could work on about yourself, you know."
There are?
"A couple, yeah."
"Well, how come you didn't mention it the other night?"
I guess I didn't want to dump everything on you all at once.
"Not a single fingermark, sir."
"There are traces of blood, but it's been deliberately wiped clean."
Had to be Travis.
- The girl wouldn't have the wherewithal to do that.
- Exactly.
"But then, what about the bite marks?"
"Well, the victim got too close to her."
"As you discovered, Fen reacts violently when approached."
Indeed she does.
So the victim and the girl were involved in an altercation.
Or Travis set her on him.
"Either way, Travis stabbed him and then tried to cover it up."
But why?
"Any news from the victim, Crabtree?"
"Nothing yet, sir, but I've widened my search, sent out a province-wide description."
Constables.
"Come with me, I've found the killer."
"""Constables."""
See.
I got it.
A vicious coyote.
- And he's the killer?
- He is indeed.
Ah...
"So, uh... explain to me how he could use that?"
- ♪♪♪ - (Fen panting)

Bye-bye!
Julia!
This is a nice surprise.
- How are you?

Why her?
Like there's not enough rich people on this island.
"She's away from home, out of her element."
Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
"I need everything on Dana, okay?"
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rentals..."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
"That's it, matches the description of the car Dawkins stole."
"Five-0, we'll take it from here."
- What are you doing?
Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
- Food or water?
- No.
Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now.
"If he wants to get off the island, he needs to change his appearance."
- Coming in?
It's a men's room.
"That's the luxury of carrying a badge, kid."
You can go anywhere.
Lemonade mix and mayo.
It's old prison trick for dying hair.
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.
Looks like our man's a blond now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.

"I'msosorry,Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.

You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.

Jackson will be there seeking his next target.
"Oversteered a little bit, but that's why you gotta--"
Not let him drive?
"What, are you nuts?"
Oh.
"Oh, he was fine."
Dad let us drive.
We turned out okay.
You wanna rephrase that?
"Okay, uh..."
Dad let we drive.
Us turned out okay.
"Is that what you're looking for, grammar police?"
"Rusty, you can't disappoint a kid, then make up for it by stuffing him with ribs and taking him out to do something illegal and dangerous."
Oh. (Chuckles) Brick's happy.
"Sure, until the next thing comes along that you miss."
"Look, you're in and out of our lives, and I get tired of making excuses about where you are or why you're not around."
The kids ask about you.
"I say, ""oh, you know Uncle Rusty,"""
but they don't.
Brick.
"(Clears throat) Listen, uh..."
"You know, just 'cause I don't, uh, show up for things, well, that-- that doesn't mean that I don't care for ya."
"Hey, I got ribs, bowling, a driving lesson, and extra credit."
I'm all good.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
Same goes for you.

Is there something you'd like to tell me?
I'm sorry!

To the contrary.
Come... come...
"But, Professor, we haven't finished."
Can't you see that I have things to do?
I have a lot to do.
Aren't you going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Won't you expell them?
- I'll think about it.
- How magnanimous.
"I'll make you pay for this, or my name isn't Cicchirini."
- We're innocent.
- You're a bunch of fools!
We're what?
Are you really going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Of course not.
That was just a joke.
"When I was young, I was worse than them, my dear Ms. Cappia."
"Cappi, Professor."
I just wanted to make sure that nothing would happen to me.
Nothing yet...
Professor!
What are you doing?
"You haven't heard of the prowess of ""Professor Saw-Saw""?"
I couldn't breathe!
It makes me not want to have sex.
I need breath mints?
"No, darling, but I'd be more comfortable in your home."
It's warmer and more relaxing.
- But it's much more romantic here.
- Alright...
Don't make a sound.
Who's there?
Your mom and dad have no time for you.
"On the other hand, grandma will make sure you never go wanting."
- What's this?
- A gift for you.
- Another one?
- Won't you open it?
What is it?
"I picked something different, to see if you like it."
You hardly ever play with your toys!
This old lady is yours.
"When you feel like hearing a story, she will tell you one."
We can get people as presents?
She is the greatest storyteller around.
Don't you like stories?
"When you're tired of reading, just say ""tell me"", and she will."
Isn't that great?
Talk to my grandchild.
Hello.
How do they call you?
The Storytelling Lady.
"Grandma, you can buy people?"
- Is it expensive?
"- Depends, I guess."
Are there people stores?
"There's no such thing, my angel."
So how did you-
You're impossible when you get something in your head!
"You want me to talk, right?"
"Talk, not ask."
It's time for grandma to get some rest.
Stay here and play with your new toy.
Don't be shy.
What are you doing?
!
Are you alright?
Let me go!
What's this noise now?
Doc..!

What are you doing here?
I'm saved.
Doc?
Yes.

It can't be...

Oh man.
I heard about your life being targeted.
Chief Yamamoto in Tokyo has been worried about you.
How hasty of you to run away from the hospital and to use Arcam's private jet.
Here.
It's the latest in armored muscle suits.
It's made partly of fibers of a metal called Omihalcon.
That battle suit was created by mixing metal Omihalcon fibers with an artificial muscle structure that is resistant to both heat and pressure.
It enables the user to draw more than 30 times as much power as is normally used.
how long has it been since we've taken any vacation?
was about two years ago.
This is a fighting knife also made of Omihalcon.
With a knuckle guard!
What's this?
Arm pad with wire anchor.
with a strong climbing claw.
Wow.

"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
- I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
And... guess what?
- What?
- I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
"- You did great, buddy."
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
"- Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
Fun fact:
"Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."
"- Oof, poor Jake."

"- So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?"

"I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom."

I asked you if you had to go.

- So does this van have side-impact airbags?
- Not in the back.
- Oh.

Bike across Death Valley.
I'm going to eat my weight in garbage.
Why would I want to waste my indestructableness on business?
See?
I told you overreacting would work.
"Harvey, stop fidgeting."
Try and look like we're having a good time.
I feel like all we're being judged on is how we look.
How do I look?
Gorgeous.
Now will you stop asking me that?
Stop yelling at me.
Nobody's going to vote for us if it looks like we're fighting.
But do I really look okay?
"Okay, I'm sorry."
Let's just dance.
Got to go.
"Dreama, have you seen my camera?"
"No, but you can use mine."
"Look for it, please."
Something tells me this is about more than a camera.
Thank you for helping me back here.
My pleasure.
I was feeling a little disoriented.
"Ooh, I wonder if I could scurry up those curtains."
"Come on, Hilda, let's go."
Call the elevator.
I'll be right there.
(chuckling)
I'm beginning to think you have a problem.
"And now, the moment everyone's been waiting for."
"♪ Suddenly, I'm up on top of the world ♪"
"What the... ""A Daughter and Her Hero!""?"
♪ It should've been somebody else ♪
"- Oh, damn it."
You know?
- Know what?
That I'm your greatest American hero?
"No, that's not true."
"♪ Believe it or not, I'm walking on air ♪"
♪ I never thought I could feel so free... ♪
"For the record, it is none of your business who my hero is."
♪ Who could it be?
♪
"♪ Believe it or not, it's just me ♪"
"I take it back, okay?"
I take back every single word I wrote.
You think you can just take it back like a bathing suit you've worn three times with the tags tucked in?
No way.
I'm your hero.
No!
Our history together will show
I think you're the absolute worst.
"But now I'll forever know how you really feel about me, which is, ""Everything my mother does comes from her heart."""
Stop using my words against me.
You are not my hero.
I read a document that says otherwise.
"God, you ruin everything!"
"And yet I'm your ""beacon on the hill."""
I resent you so much right now.
"But yet you love me ""more than anyone."""
"This is ""my worst nightmare."""
And it's my dream.
- Are you lost?
- Yes
"Here, with you ... is not like a movie or in books, where everything is clear ... expected ... organized ... with a clear purpose."
"Everything is chaos, unexpected ... pain ... disorder ..."
"So I try to have them in the order, fans of my mother."
I am missing one.
- Do you want stories?
- No.
Why?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There is only war.
Listen.
I do not feel anything.
Close your eyes.
Marie ...
Marie ...
"You fly, my friend, cadrai you."
We prepare the fall.
Do you have exaggerated.
"If I were human, the kill here, immediately."
But I will not be human.
I have a word myself.
"I do not want you to hurry, but there is a theater in precise time."
"Even the mail, on the other hand ... for parcels ..."
I am sending them.
The exact delivery time.
I still have ... for new addresses.
And I am always me ...
Get a little 'of breath.
We must start now.
"Do not take it, Leon."
What do you mean?
- You're off-worlders.
- Who are you?
- You got us right the first time.
We're friends.
Of anyone fighting the Federation.
"Now what's this about people like us being ""unadapted""?"
(Whistle blowing)
"Avandir, behind you!"
RADIO:
"Hello, Red Leader."
This is Strike Control.
What is your position?
Red Leader?
Are you receiving me?
Ow!
"Sorry, sir."
I think we just lost our Helots.
- What?
- They went out with a bang.
- You mean the patrol's been ambushed?
"- It reads that way, sir."
That Hunda and his rabble are becoming more than just a nuisance.
"Well, the teleport audio system seems to be working all right."
"Orac, how do the sensors check?"
The sensors are clear.
- So what went wrong?
- Hard to say.
What did you do?
What any skilled technician does with solid-state circuitry.
He kicked the living quartz out of it.
It's probably one of the relay triggers.
I haven't been in the back of a car in years.
"Come on, butch."
Be a pal?
"Sorry, krzeminski."
I got plans.
"Yauch, what about you?"
Told my gal I'd take her to a show.
I can't swing it.
Why don't you ask carter?
Dooley would kill me if I let a lady take nights.
"Besides, she can barely make her own shift."
"Work day starts at 9:00 a.M., honey."
"Tell me, agent krzeminski,"
Who are you bringing to the show...
Your wife or your girlfriend?
Come on in.
Have a seat.
We really appreciate you coming down here
"To talk with us, mr."
Jarvis.
That isn't already in the missing-car report I filed.
That report might take us a while to dig up.
"You see, the nypd aren't as efficient"
"As the ssr at record-keeping,"
"Which is saying something, because our files are a wreck."
That hurts.
My filing's impeccable.
Isn't that stark's butler?
You know this guy?
Only from the file.
Do you think he was really involved
"Well, maybe he didn't blow the place up,"
-My butt too!
What do we do?
!
-What's going on?
"-I don't know, I don't know!"
Oh please!
"Oh mother, father!"
Oh please...!
Oh Jesus!
"Oh yes, right there!"
"Oh please, please!"
Jesus!
To commit such dirty deeds in such a divine school like this...
"It's because of an allergy to mushrooms, if you take the medication and put on some ointment, you'll be better soon."
I should have checked the body sooner.
Is our school nurse's office a welfare office?
Or a hospital?
So unbelievable...
Is he an idiot or something...?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
The money that was in the house was spent paying for the taxi last night...
"But with my whole strange body thing, I couldn't go to the hospital."
I came because I was worried something may happen to precious Yoon Jae's body...
But...
Did you get into a lot of trouble?
-Are you okay now?
-Yeah.
This guy must be really healthy!
I mean the medicine worked like a charm on his body!
Make sure to eat something when you get home.
And take your medicine too.
Please remain calm.
Please refrain from going near the windows or doors.
Deactivate.
Commence emergency shutdown!
We are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition.
"You know, somehow "" I told you so"" just doesn't quite say it."
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us.
"Every time one attacked me, that red light was on."
-The uplink to USR.
-It's Robertson.
-Why?
It doesn't make sense.
-I don't know.
I just need you to get me into that building.
"Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced."
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
"Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced."
Why doesn't that boy listen?
-I need you to get off for a second.
-What?
-Just aim and fire.
-What?
!
Wait!
-You have been deemed hazardous.
"-You can kiss my ass, metal dick!"
Yes.
Only such a handsome man could have sent such marvelous flowers.
"Thank you, mademoiselle."
L- i wonder if you'd care to join me in a bottle of wine at the astor house?
Just we two alone?
Just we two alone.
But we'll have to hurry.
Fleurique is ready.
We go.
"Good night, my dear."
"Uh, we better go this way."
Come in.
Mademoiselle fleurique in?
She's gone to the astor house.
"Well, already."
Well- with that fool mr.
"Fisk, who sent her these."
What does that fool mr.
Fisk look like?
"Tall, dark, kind of handsome."
He's going to have a peck of trouble on his hands tonight.
Everybody that has any truck with her has got trouble.
"Look at this room, will you?"
She threw all these things at me.
"Peppery, ain't she?"
"Oh, she'd throw anything anywhere."
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't blow up at the astor house.
"If she treats you that way, why do you stick?"
It's a long walk back to illinois.
"Excuse me, please."
"Besides, if you want something real bad, you've got to take some hard knocks to get it."
You've learned a lot for a young lady.
"Just doing your job, Officer."
But I will have to warn my fellow air marshals about skittish Navy cops.
"Okay, you could have quietly said something when I badged you."
And you are aware of the recent chatter?
It's my job to know.
"But look, I don't think anyone waiting for my Paris flight saw that, anyway, so let's just forget it."
All right.
"No hard feelings, Mr. Beers."
I guess we could all use one.
One what?
A beer.
Your name.
Ah.
Right.
Huh.
"""Huh"" what?"
It's Gibbs.
Want me to tell him?
"No, let me."
Put him on speaker.
"You've got us both, Gibbs."
You got anything to report?
"Nothing, boss."
Just compared notes with a... rather cranky air marshal.
He's aware of the chatter.
Does he know that the chatter has changed?
"Threat level's been increased, and now it specifically mentions DC metropolitan airports."
That is a game changer.
It still could be nothing.
Just keep your heads on a swivel.
Call if anything's changed.
You got anything else?
I'm...
Don't tell me you're claustrophobic.
"Oh, my God."
The FAA needs to ground all air traffic.
Where's the secretary of Homeland Security?
- He's at the White House.
- Who's the deputy sec?
Wyck Halsey.
He's also at the White House.
"Oh, Jesus."
"--Happens, our thoughts go to terrorism."
I've had enough of this.
Walker told us to stay where we are.
"Madam Secretary, gentlemen I'm gonna ask you to accompany us to the Blue Room."
- Who is this man?
- He is...
- He's a concerned citizen.
"- Good morning, Mr. Secretary."
- You killed the secretary of defence.
"- Well, he wasn't doing a very good job."
"Okay, so, would the remaining secretaries please join us in the Blue Room?"
"- Sir, I'm on with Agent Reid."
- How they doing?
VP just puked all over Air Force One.
"I'm General Caulfield, vice chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff."
Have the nuclear launch codes been switched?
"- Yes, and new codes are active."
- The stock market's collapsing.
"Travis, I need you to suspend trading immediately."
"And there's gonna be a run on the banks, so close them now."
- You guys good?
"- Yes, sir."
"There's some fucking guy, scientist or something."
Real sick bastard.
You listening?
Avidly.
"Says he measured out the remains, the cremated remains of a dead man."
"Measured out the minerals left behind, you know?"
"The iron phosphates, the..."
Whatever it is we're made up of.
Says he added it all up to the cost of $4.40.
You believe that?
"Yeah, I guess so."
$4.40.
"Burnt down man's worth less than a fucking Big Mac, all you can say is ""I guess so""?"
Says give this poor bastard what he's got coming.
Authentic?
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
Start the count.
"All eyes are on the newcomer, Rainer..."
Can I get you something?
Two shots.
Scotch.
Got money on the game?
"Nah, spread's terrible."
Here.
One for the road.
"No, thanks."
Been sober for three years.
Interesting career.
You do something long enough.
"You close your eyes, you just can't think of doing something else."
They found your accounts.
- Everything's fine up here.
- OK.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
"José, could you come here for a minute, please?"
- It looks as if a whole army is rolling up.
- These are just the supplies for the base.
"- Shouldn't we hold off on the attack, then?"
- No.
How do you know that those bastards won't shoot when we show our faces?
Plenty of people in the valley know that we're going to blow up the dam.
- Why did you warn them?
- Because it's them that I'm fighting for.
Are you wetting yourself?
Nonsense!
- You'll be relieved in three hours.
- All right.
"Soon, all hell will break loose here."
Now.
Watch out.
That's Moreno over there.
We can't hold our position much longer.
Understood.
Headquarters are going to send us helicopters.
"You should get out of here, with the other engineers."
Attention!
Calling position...
We can go down now.
Come on!
The rope!
"Hey, careful."
Don't shoot.
‐ You could.
You won't.
Because then it's over.
It's all over.
It's all over.
‐ How do you do it?
"How do you live with yourself, Cal?"
"I mean, the truth."
And not what you preach.
Because I'm having a really hard time.
‐ It's hell.
Um...
"It's a living, waking hell."
"I'm never without regret, much as it goes against everything we teach."
Much as it goes against everything we teach.
Um...
"It's‐‐just always, always with me."
"All I can do is‐‐ is try to make up for it, but I..."
"That's why this place,"
I didn't want to let it go b‐‐
Come here.
I want to show you.
"Source of Light, we turn to you."
We turn to you.
Help us to purify our spirits.
"Forever bound to one another in Light, a circle of communion."
Let the bonding of these hands be a symbol for the bond they have to each other.
Steer us from the darkness.
Free us from earthly cares.
Fill our hearts with love.
And help us become...
A perfect vessel of your Truth.
You're my ex-husband's girlfriend's father.
I mean...
isn't that a little weird?
Give it one more chance.
One date.
"And if it's still weird, we'll just give it one more chance."
"Oh, you're her father."
"But when I'm with you, I'm not thinking about Old Christine."
What-- who?
"Oh, sorry, it's just that I've known my daughter longer, so"
"I refer to you as New Christine, which makes her Old Christine."
"Well, one more date wouldn't kill me."
"So... second date wasn't so bad, was it?"
No.
"In fact, I think it was better than our first date."
Wonder what's going to happen on our third date?
"Well, I'll give you a little hint:"
If it's anything like my previous third dates... you might want to work on your home run trot.
So you're still feeling okay about everything?
"Yeah, you know, so what if it's a little weird."
"Yeah, some of my best relationships have been a little weird."
"And when it's just us, not weird at all."
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
"- Hey, Daddy."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Richard."
"- Hey, Mom."
"- Hey, Ritchie."
I will die.
and your God is my God.
I love you!
Everything this woman has is here;
she has nothing else.
I will do my best to get her a good price.
Jabesh.
That's no surprise.
can we start the auction?
Some of us have work to do.
Very well.
When a man dies...
Not another lecture on the law. the brother of the dead man should marry her and care for her.
Such are the commandments of God.
(yawning)
Excuse me!
and now she is left with nothing.
She comes before you now to sell all that she owns.

First up for sale is this poor widow's land.
Ten thousand shekels!

I like to help where I can.

I think I'll have a little fun.

Twelve thousand shekels!

Twelve thousand going twice!
Twelve thousand and five shekels!
Fourteen thousand shekels!
Bitch...
Thanks for coming out.
"Holy hottie,Batman."

"Look,I'm sorry."
But wouldn't that be kind of gross if that turned me on?
You look like a ten-year-old girl.
I feel like a pervert.
You got used to the Hitler.
"Well,the Indian pacifist just is not my thing."
"That says a lot about you,don't you think?"
"It's not right,okay?"
There's hair there for a reason.
"Oh,really?"
And what exactly is the reason?
I don't know.
"Maybe it's nature's way of saying,"
"""Hey,look over here."
My pleasures are...
Bathing and...
I also keep birds And I like to play Go
Kichiemon also enjoys Go Why not challenge each other?
"Yes, an excellent plan"
Over a game of Go...
Yes It was at a Go tournament
"""You've called halt four times"" ""No, it's only three,"" that's how it began"
"""You're just an idiot, how dare you call me a liar!"
"Draw!"""
I'm so sorry
He always longed to die at war
Dying over a silly dispute
Must have been a shame
At least...
If he had died in a manner more worthy of a warrior...
One moment
I've always been... handy this way
"That's all for today, Soza san"
"So I stand at 7 wins, 3 losses Do come back"
Welcome
Don't stare
Done yet?
Not yet
Tell me when you're done
I hope it's a lot
"A lot, a lot"
"A lot, a lot"
Revenge?
That's right It's just a play
A play?
This'll be your first
"Thank you, Sergeant."
- Was salute satisfactory?
"- That's the idea... only you want these fingers to fan the eyebrows, more like this."
The breeze from them fingers ought to almost blow this eyebrow off.
Now try it again.
"Very good, indeed."
"That one almost blew your turban off, didn't it?"
"Very regimental, Din."
"Keep them at it, Subedar sahib."
They may need it.
Tell the Subedar to drill the men till sundown.
"- Where did you get the bugle, Din?"
"- Please, sahib, I find when nobody looking."
Don't you know that's very naughty?
"Please, sahib, don't take away."
Bugle only pleasure for poor bhisti.
"Thank you, sahib."
- Sahib care to hear new call?
- Not now.
"Very regimental, Din."
"Company, attention!"
"Company, dismissed!"
"Let me see your tongue, Annie."
"I'd like to try it, Sergeant sahib."
Very old Indian remedy.
"All right, go ahead."
But be careful.
"If anything happens to her, I'll..."
Understand?
Cry my eyes out.
"No, sahib!"
Very little bit goes very long way.
"- And to be honest, I got scared, so..."
- Have you checked your desk?
He didn't give me anything.
I swear he just came here to talk.
This was my father's.
I've never seen it before.
- Why were you hiding it from me?
"- If I knew it was yours,"
- I wouldn't keep it from you.
- Why would he even give it to you?
Do you know what this key is for?
Lionel wasn't in his right mind when he was here.
I don't know why he left that.
You're fired.
Escort miss Sullivan from the building.
Aren't you gonna give me a second to clear out my private things?
Your personal items will be boxed up and sent to your home.
"Your name may be on the building, but that's my personal stuff."
I got rights!
"If anything is missing, I swear to god, you won't hear the end of it!"
I'll pack up miss Sullivan's belongings.
You go back to the mansion.
Get some sleep.
"We did it, Lex."
Lionel not suicide.
Have Pic.
Come to archive room.
Jimmy.
That's it.
I'm leaving.
"I want to start working on this picture, but we haven't heard from Chloe yet."
I really think that we should wait.
Lucy has remembered something else.
She's downstairs?
I thought you took her home last night?
She couldn't get in.
The bloke who attacked her took her keys.
So she crashed in the soft room.
What's wrong with a hotel?
She didn't feel safe on her own.
It was only for one night.
I hope so.
We're not running a BB.
There was one of those beaded cushions on the front seat of his cab and he wore a leather jacket as it squeaked against the beads.
That's great.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Thanks for letting me stay, Detective."
That's no problem.
And it's Sam.
First-name terms?
Eh?
What?
She's one of us.
One of us?
She works in pay roll.
For forensic services.
"She's a victim, Sam."
Even if she is blessed in the looks department.
Really?
I hadn't noticed.
Not much.
"I'll get the warrant for the taxi driver, shall I?"
Argh!
"Carl Lucas, I'm arresting you on suspicion of... murder, robbery and attempted rape."
"Which is good, 'cause we can use it."
We're going to have to get
My dad thinks we should get off the streets.
Why ?
Did he hear something ?
About aftershocks or looters or...
Zombies ?
"I know, that was my first thought, too."
"But no, it's just a precaution."
It's Ryan.
Is everyone okay ?
"Yeah, we just have to make a little change of plans."
Hmm ?
"* California, here we come *"
* Right back where we started from *
* California...
California... *
Your dad said to go home.
But I think we should all be together.
This is a bad idea.
We're almost there.
"No, we're not."
It's just a few more minutes.
"Well, I know where my house is okay ?"
"Look, I command you to stop this bike."
"I'm sorry, okay but I'm starting to get a little creeped out."
"Not that I don't want to play Pictionary by candlelight and raid Taylor's Apocalypse kit, but I think we should just go to your house."
"Okay, but I'm still awaiting on news of Pancakes."
Pancakes ?
You said Ryan said everyone was fine.
"I know, but I don't know that he included rodents in his head count, so I texted him to be sure."
And ?
Great job.
That's all for today.
"All right, well, great."
Yeah.
How did we do?
Did we do good?
"I mean, are we gonna make it?"
"Well, you know, it's just our first session, you know."
We're not looking for an end result here.
It's not a competition.
"I get all that, but have you seen couples that are worse off than us?"
Yeah.
Or are we that far gone?
We're...
Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?
"You know, Doc?"
Like a one to 10?
"One being worst, 10 being best?"
"No, hang on one second."
Where would you put us?
"Right where you are, sir."
"What if someone put a gun to your head right now and said,"
"""You have to answer this second or I'll shoot."
"""Are they gonna make it?"" What do you say?"
What would you say?
Whoa!
"Okay, no one has a gun to my head, Mr. Smith."
It's hypothetical.
It's not a place for inappropriate behavior.
And you definitely don't pull a hypothetical gun on your therapist.
Sorry.
We've got time before school to see what's on this.
"- Okay, you'll be standing in a line."
- _
"Shoulders back, like this."
That's good.
"And, as you're introduced, you'll step up."
"Look, I've upgraded from texting to voice-mail to further express my level of ""you are so dead."""
"(SIGHS) I bite the bullet and I tell my dad about you, then you ghost?"
"That is not getting back together, Jake."
This is all very strange.
Call me.
"Hey, I know we don't really know each other, but this Lady of the Lake Pageant does not seem like your thing."
My dad is making me.
Maddox pride.
"So, then, he'll be your escort?"
"Oh, I haven't even thought about that."
"Um, no."
Who has their dad as their escort?
"Uh, I do. (CHUCKLES)"
And I avoid all high school guy drama.
Win-win.
"Oh, please."
Everybody knows you have a crush on Noah.
You practically give him eye baths in psych class.
"- Okay, no, I do not do that."
- A little bit.
"Okay, well, maybe there's a world where I think Noah is kind of cool."
- Happy?
- (SCOFFS)
Hold that thought.
WOMAN:
"Okay, ladies, grab a worksheet."
Why are you singing that...?
"Oh, my God."
You just had sex.
"No, I didn't."
I was peeing.
I thought I made that clear.
"No, no, no, no."
That's your sex song.
You always sing it after you... perform your act.
"- No, I don't."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Who are you talking to, buddy?"
I was there.
"When we were married, I heard it many, many times."
And then not so much at the end.
"- All right, so I had sex."
- Yep.
Christine and I have been dating for over three months.
You can't be surprised.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not surprised."
"I mean, I never really thought about it."
"But, hey, if you want to jump into the sack with the first girl who comes along, be my guest."
Be... my... guest.
"Actually, she's not the first."
"Right after you and I split up, I got one under my belt."
"""Under your belt""?"
"What are you, a pirate?"
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
"Obviously, you haven't had any and you're a little..."
"Anyway, it's nothing to be ashamed of."
"We've been divorced for two years, which means you haven't had sex in... just over three years."
"I'm sorry sir, I can't help you unless a crime has been committed."
Has a crime been committed?
"Please, I wouldn't ask if it weren't extremely important."
Sorry sir.
"No crime, no information."
What if I told you I was hit by this car?
I don't see any bruises.
"If you did, would you give me an address?"
"No, but the police might."
"What is it, sweetie?"
"Tired, huh?"
You wanna go take a nap?
I want to report a hit and run.
Bring it back when you're finished.
Fill it out over there.
Mr. Reznik.
You sure about these plate numbers?
743CRN.
"All right, that's the one."
Do you ever have a car stolen?
"No, why?"
Cause the car that allegedly hit you was your own.
"1969, red Pontiac Viper registered to your name."
Nearly a year ago you reported it as being totalled in a wreck.
Do you realise it's a felony to file a bogus police report?
"Hey, wait a minute."
You got some explaining to do.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
Who were they?
We couldn't find out...
Do you have any idea?
I do.
Some migrants probably just felt threatened.
It's not worth the worry.
Prince Daeso will be furious.
Keep quiet.
"Yes, sir."
"Since you killed Jumong, I'll give you the reward I promised."
One states your new title as a noble.
The other states your new estate.
"Come on, take it."
I'm honored.
Bubunno.
Yes?
I'll appoint you as Vice Commander.
Help Naro prepare for the war.
You're familiar with Jolbon... so organize the spies and think of ways to strike the enemy.
I will.
Eupru is a few hours away.
A man named Buwiyum is head of the pirates now.
But we don't know where he lives or what he looks like.
"Gosh, I'd rather look for a needle in a haystack."
"Commander, what should we do now?"
Do you know your way around Eupru?
"This is Sanchun, Magok and Geodu."
I'm sure the pirates trade their loot.
We should ask the merchants in the area.
I've done business in Sanchun and Magok before.
I'm sure they'll help us.
"I'll go to Magok with Oi, Mari and Hyupbo."
- She sounds like a duck.
"Smells like one, too."
"Oh, 'cause I thought he was asking you to explain how his penis worked."
What?
"Yeah, so, uh, Dennis went to my dad-- my dad's a really famous doctor-- and my dad had to show Dennis a book on how to fix his broken penis because he was too stupid to figure it out on his own."
Shut up.
"Yeah, that's probably why you phoned three grades, Dennis."
You're always gonna have to rely on the smart people to explain things to you.
Smart people like my dad.
- Are you feeling ready for this?
- Yes.
***
Start with the arms.
"When he's feeling comfortable, rub his arms again before moving on to his chest, and so on, and just keep building up from there."
"I know, Dr. Masters."
We've been over it a hundred times.
Hi.
- How are you?
- Nervous.
***
"I'm gonna take off my robe now, okay?"
Okay.
"Um, I'm just gonna follow your lead."
Sorry.
It's okay.
Just remember the whole point of today is to make you feel good.
That's nice.
- Really nice.
- Good.
"I'm gonna move on to your chest now, okay?"
Okay.
"Although... if you wanted, you could move a little further than that."
That's reassuring.
Thanks.
(CONTINUES GRUNTING)
"You know, I hope what he's paying you feels worth it."
I don't work for him.
I work for the British government.
He's my prisoner.
I've been arrested for trafficking arms...
Weapons I was sending to save you.
"So, I...struck a new deal."
We help get you out...
And he gives us valuable information about a terrorist.
Which he knows about how?
(CRYING) And you expect me to be grateful?
"Well, at least you got your money back."
"That's something, eh?"
(PHONE RINGING)
(PHONE BEEPS ON) RICHMOND: (ON PHONE) Colonel.
We're picking up smoke trails at the water hole at Bir an Natrun.
The heat map indicates some sort of explosion.
"If Stonebridge has managed to engage the Janjaweed, then this would fit that scenario."
"All right, send through the image."
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)
(GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Julia thinks that lunatic might still be alive.
(PHONE BEEPING) Really?
"Probably nothing, it's an oil burn or a blip..."
SCOTT:
Oh.
Uh...
Let me see.
That's not nothing.
Sorry.
"I'm just, uh, I'm just a little distracted."
Because?
Because the...
"""The None"" is launching, and Alexis owes me a draft of the third chapter."
It's four days late.
Julianne is breathing down my back.
"And, of course,"
I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.
Again.
"Plus we got the hydro bill, and it's crazy this month."
Yeah.
Anything else you wanna stress about?
Point taken.
"Hey, I'll pick up the dry cleaning."
It's gonna be ok.
It always is.
Thanks.
"We think of them as solid, immutable."
"The world may change around us, but our relationships?"
They remain constant.
"No, and I agree."
"I think that the orgasm chapter is compelling, but I feel like it's coming too soon in the book."
"Uh, no pun intended, I hope."
And chapter three?
"Where's that one, exactly?"
"Uh, I'm hoping it's in my inbox."
"Hey, what're you doing here?"
"Just, uh..."
I didn't sleep last night.
I kept thinking about what you said.
And I realized that this was a big mistake--
Everything is under control.
We have an unconfirmed report that resuscitation efforts may have failed.
It's always a danger up there in that copter in the Windy City.
"In a child with hypothermia, it can cause fatal arrhythmia."
She's right outside.
"- Jerry, turn that off."
- TV doctors....
Get Security to escort Dr. Mahoney to a less conspicuous place.
Let's get the life pack and drug box.
- Any sixes?
- Nope.
Go fish.
- How are you doing?
- My stomach hurts a little bit.
Get a CT of her abdomen along with the head.
Probably just a bruise.
- Where are her parents?
- Coffee shop.
"I get next game, okay?"
- Coming through.
Coming through.
"- Doctor, is he dead?"
"- Please, get out of the way."
- Dr. Greene can you confirm or deny this report?
Get Security to get these people into the Press Room.
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision to fly the child here?
- Not for a second.
- Come on!
"Move, now!"
Let's go!
Hurry!
We're ready.
-All done.
-Thank you.
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.
Saw them with my own eyes!
"Sorry, don't think it 'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Good-bye.
Marion?
-Thanks for today.
-Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I had so much fun.
I'd almost forgotten the wonderful things there are for people to do.
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please... I don't think... we'd better..."
I mean it!
"-All right, let's talk about this."
-I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
-Just like that?
-That's right.
"-We're not kids, we're adults!"
-And we're going to behave as such.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality or lust."
You ought to know the difference.
And what do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...
Human.
All men are alike.
"The approach is different, but the result is always the same."
"Sooner or later, we'd get around to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one any place."
... don'thavejurisdictionoverthis .
You be careful with that sign.
That cost a lot of money.
MAN:
We'll be careful.
MAUDE:
Bring it up on the left.
"Make sure that's well secured, now."
That's it.
That's good.
That's good.
World Famous Ritz.
How optimistic.
MAUDE:
"I have every reason to be, dear."
"So, tell me, Mother, which con did you use..."
... onourrecentlydispossessed Swedish friend?
The floating king?
You're very good at that one.
There was no need to use sleight of hand.
That man's dumber than a shovel.
"Well, what do you think?"
"Frankly, of all the endeavors I thought you might undertake..."
... hotelproprietress was not one of them.
Why are you in town?
"Well, I just wanted to be close to my sweet little baby boy."
And look at you. I never thought you'd become a bartender.
"Owner, Mother."
I've become a man of commerce.
Madam.
May I have the pleasure of welcoming you back to our humble town.
"Why, thank you... ."
"[Deep voice] ""Don't pay too much, pilgrim."""
Ours.
Great!
"The hilkin department store lingerie day for men, beer decathlon out in munhall, we do that, and some national stuff, too."
It's a very strong list of clients.
Very.
We bill almost 2 million a year.
All right.
"Well,"
I'll look over all the papers and see what we can figure out.
Great.
"Nice to meet you, Jake."
"Yeah, you, too."
"If you have any questions, call my accountant."
"Mom, come on."
I told my friends
"I'd be there, like, 20 damn minutes ago."
Don't you want to spend some time with your Uncle and your cousin Nick?
No.
3 more days of winter recess till he goes back to boarding school.
3 more days.
I know what you mean.
"So, uh, what's with the kid?"
My nephew.
She's your sister?
"No, she's my wife's sister."
"But now, Jake, I want you to understand"
"I don't like to mix family with business, so that's why I want you on point for this one, ok?"
Fine.
Got it covered.
Woman:
I'm looking for James mooney!
That's not what I mean.
I told her many times that she should be writing her own book.
So why are you giving this now?
I could because I was afraid I'd hurt her.
It'll be enough for a year.
"Until she can support herself by writing novels,"
I'll sponsor her.
- Take it back.
- Jae Min.
I've never told her I'd sponsor her so that she could write her own material.
"And even if I did, she'd never accept it."
You still don't know her at all.
You want to forget it with this?
You want to make me into some kind of matchmaker?
Should I take half and give the other half to her?
"Fine, the you that I know isn't that kind of person."
But this is an insult to the feelings she had for you.
She isn't someone you can console with money.
"Yeah, you're right."
I didn't think.
I was hoping you'd help.
How is she?
She's doing well.
She's strong.
"The harder it is, the stronger she acts."
I know.
How are you?
I'm just... being dragged along.
Let's get up.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Where's your car?
"Oh, please do."
Go ahead.
I shouldn't keep you longer.
Students who are willing to go to class!
"This way, Mr. Kaan."
You'd better cut your hair.
I don't want to see it like this again.
Who could give us the multiples of this?
"Yeah, take your time."
Take the chalk.
But I didn't raise my hand Professor.
- Excuse me?
- I didn't raise my hand.
You'd better answer this question before I divide you up by your multiples.
"Come on kid, come on."
Sit down!
Hey listen;
I have the voice of a dramatic soprano.
I am now an alto and do you know why?
Because I've lost my voice while making a demo.
But my album is being delayed.
How could this be?
Alright!
"Move it, move it."
I beg you.
"Dude, don't these teachers ever change?"
Do they always choose the ones who don't raise their hands?
That's their tactic.
"In Professor Fatma's class if you raise your hand, you're safe."
Really?
We'll see about that.
We're now doing geometry.
And he dumped me in boarding school.
He tried to tell me that what happened
In the jungle had changed him.
He was going to re- dedicate his life
"To the conservation of relics,"
Make up for the time we never had.
I laughed in his face.

A druid high priest

The last time the astronomicons were seen.
"Well, now taken literally,"
What's written on there
"Doesn't make any sense,"
The words are all jumbled up
And in no particular order.
Code?
None like I've ever seen.
Look at this.
"Marks on the blade,"
Like grooves over the words.
As if something's been repeatedly
"Moved back and forth,"
Like a scabbard.
Might help you solve your word puzzle.
How?
"This scabbard, if it does exist,"
Might act as an ancient
Druid message decoder.

TRIS:
Hi.
MARCUS:
Son...
You can't ignore me forever.
"I know you're thinkin' about your next move, but there are things you don't know."
"Marcus, please just leave us alone."
Your mother didn't come back to Abnegation just to save you.
She died trying to hide something from Jeanine.
Something that was entrusted to Abnegation a long time ago.
"Marcus, stop."
"Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it."
I'm not the enemy here.
You found it.
"It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said."
Mind telling me what's inside?
A message from The Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve.
Divergents will destroy our society.
Unless we destroy them.
And now we can.
"However, only a Divergent can open this box."
Find them.
Every last one of them.

Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here.
I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.

Hi.

- Good.
"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?
Confirming the...
What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
Spell-checks are usually pretty accurate.
Right.
I'm sure there's a whorehouse correspondents' dinner somewhere.
"Somewhere, yeah."

"To call his boss on the way so he can tell Hitler that it was all a dream or whatever he wants to say, but that I don't want to see them ever again, not even in photographs."

What a waste of cyanide.
"Go on, say what you want to say."
"If you're saying that because of Lola, do not worry"
I do not blame you.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Would benefit if you were dead?
"Gentlemen, I'd appreciate it if you would leave."
I'm not going to stand by and have you impugn
The integrity of my niece.
I resent the implication that Audrey is a murderess.
"Oh, but please, uh, Ms..."
"Goodbye, gentlemen."
"Uh, one more question, Ms. Ramsey, if you please."
"We could find out without your help,"
But it'll just take more time.
"What is it, Detective Burris?"
OTIS:
Could you make a guess as to the total value
"Of your estate, please?"
I suggest that your superiors contact my attorney.
His name is Henry Claypool.
"This way out, please."
"All right, girl."
It's OK.
You'll get fed.
Jeff!
Why don't you take her out while I get her dinner?
"Come on, lady."
Out we go.
"Oh, come on, you old mutt."
Now do your thing.
"Jeff, don't talk to her like that."
Here.
Give her her dinner.
"If we're going out, I'm going to slip into the shower."
Do you mind?
"I don't mind, as long as I'm invited."
He can hear our conversation from ground floor itself.
Control yourself you flirt!
Who is she?
She is the milk vendor.
"If a house is available for rent, many would hop in to check."
"- Hey Paramasivam, is she yours?"
- I don't deserve her man.
With such a rotten face you need a charming girl like her?
- I asked if she is your client?
- Yes
- She is looking for office space.
- Do you like it?
"-Yes, I do."
- I am impressed too.
- I am very impressed.
How about the rent?
- I am very impressed too.
Why does he grope me for that?
I need this office.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent, and an advance amount for 10 months."
- 20000?
- Yes madam.
- I can't afford that and I don't need such a big space..
"Don't miss the house gawking at this girl, Karthik!"
Ask!
"- Sir, I saw and confirmed the deal first."
Isn't it?
- Please fix it for me.
- Let me speak with the loud mouth.
- Sir fix it for me immediately.
- I shall do it madam.
The prodigal son came for a visit.

You're getting bald.
"No of fence, dad."

Is he the one who saved the children?
"He's the man, Garbage Jesse!"
It's hard to say.
You don't know what's round the next corner.
More movies?
"Yes, films, television, a book as well."
Reading or writing?

"Yeah, uh, reading."
You're just planning to buy a book.
"Well, we wish you luck with that."

"Joseph, have you ever told a lie?"
"-Yes, sir."
-Big ones or little ones?
Some little ones and some medium ones.
"You'd lie to save your sister from prison, wouldn't you?"
"-Yes, sir."
-A big lie?
-The biggest lie you ever heard.
-I object!
Sustained.
If this hadn't happened I'd never discover what a sap I am.
"Oh, yes, you would."
- I would have told you.
"- Yes, I suppose so."

Yeah.

We're over here tonight because we're not in the photo from last night.

"Well, it's not like fate decided it."

What was the original question?

Guruji.
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.
Vile dog.
"For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son."
"You shall grovel, I say!"
Look here.
"I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen."
"Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride."
Take him away!
"In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants."
Beats counting sheep a million miles.
"What do you mean, elephants?"
This ain't elephants.
"This is Annie, my Annie."
I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army.
What the blazes is this?
"Good morning, gentlemen."
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
"Higginbotham, I could just fall on your neck."
I got a better neck than mine you can fall on.
That's a good one.
"Hello, there!"
"Tommy, hello!"
How wonderful of you to meet us.
"I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me."
"- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney."
What are you doing?
Really...
What are you trying to do?
I have something to discuss with her.
What would you want to talk to me about?
I'm unemployed!
It will just take a moment.
Have you gone crazy?
Ajussi!
"(Ajussi - older man, uncle)"
What are you trying to do?
You want to use force to deal with girls?
You...
Do you know me?
I don't know anyone who's like you.
"No, I am not the kind of person you think I am."
Don't interfere.
"Miss Kim Min Hee, please get out of the car."
What exactly are you trying to do?
This ajussi!
Really...
She's clearly in a car with another man.
"Whatever you want to do, shouldn't you consider the situation?"
It really is funny.
What's wrong?
Not leaving?
"Mr. Prosecutor, are you okay?"
Mr. Prosecutor.
These clothes will only cause people to misunderstand.
You mean they didn't know you are a prosecutor because of your clothes?
"There is enough evidence, right?"
We almost had them!
You left it blank.
Korean?
Korean?
I am not familiar with Korean.
Dealer's choice.
Whatever releases the most tension.
Mmm.
"Oh, that feels so good."
Thank you.
I can't tell you how much I need this.
It has been a long time.
"Oh, I love pleasuring people."
So do I.
"I mean, it's not my job, but it is a job that I love doing, if you know what I mean."
I know exactly what you mean.
"So, Joey, do you have any problem areas?"
I hold a lot of tension in my upper thighs.
We'll get to your upper thighs.
It's just the top of my quads.
"As a matter of fact, if you want to do, like, the full 80 minutes on the thighs, I'm good."
Whatever you want.
"Oh, I need this."
You have no idea.
"Oh, you got great hands."
"Okay, Joey, what I want you to do for me is just close your eyes."
"Quiet that mind, okay?"
Just listen to my voice.
Feel the sound slide down my throat and come out through my mouth.
"Down my throat, come out through my mouth."
Down my throat...
Keep...
"Keep going, keep going."
"Sorry, it's just a fuse."
(SCREAMS)
Oh!
(CLEARS THROAT)
"Ripley, all clear on the house."
I'm just going to make sure Miss Calvert's all right.
"OK, copy that."
(HEAVY BREATHING)
It has come back on you like the hand of God!
"♪ Come on, now"
"♪ With time slipping away, yeah"
♪ How do you say what I do?
"♪ Oh, you've got nothing to say"
"♪ Oh, no, no"
♪ When I tell you who's who
"- ♪ Oh, yeah, cos I'm the big, bad wolf - ♪ What you say?"
"- ♪ I'm the big, bad wolf - ♪ What you say?"
"♪ I'm the big, bad wolf... ♪"

The polar winter.
This is the planet at its most hostile.
Those that stay here at this time must face the harshest conditions on Earth.
The High Arctic in late autumn.
Empty and abandoned to ice and snow.
Most animals migrated south weeks ago.
"The few that stay will face violent winds, plunging temperatures and months of darkness."
A female polar bear searches for shelter.
"Other bears are out on the frozen ocean looking for food, but she won't feed again until next spring."
"Using as little energy as possible, she starts to dig a shallow nest."
The snow here is easy to work.
It's soft and light.
Why didn't you tell Mother that?
I didn't think of it.
"I'm a cowardly, despicable person."
For twenty years all I thought about was how to avoid being despised by your mother.
"And then one day, all of a sudden, a thick barrier had grown around her heart."
Forgive Mother.
I'm the one that has to be forgiven.
"What are you going to do, Shinako?"
Are you going to go live with your Mother?
"If she's going to live with Takehara, I'll stay with you."
I'd feel sorry for you.
The people who are really burned in all this are you and Takao.
So you've made up your mind?
You should leave that house.
That would be the thing for you to do.
He doesn't deserve to be with you.
I don't want you to insult him.
"Oh my, aren't we complex?"
"Ok, I won't insult him."
So are you going to build that studio?
I'm not going to see you again.
You're terrible!
This is really too much.
It's late.
Please go home.
"Mrs., listen."
waited twenty years.
So did I.
What are you doing?
I'm going to call someone.
Mrs.!
Let me go.
No.
What's the name of the company making it?
Wentworth Drug.
This is gonna hurt somewhat.
I've got to remove the bullet.
"Hello, is this Nielson and Co."
Brokerage Office?
"Give me a customer's man, please."
"Hello, my name is Clementi Sabourin."
I'm at the Savoy Drake.
I want to open a new account.
What are the margin requirements?
Fifty percent?
Then buy me twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at the market price.
What is the stock selling at?
Two dollars?
I'll be down at your office with the money before the market opens.
What is your name?
Mr. O'Hara.
Thank you very much.
Can you tell me where I can find Mr. O'Hara?
"That desk over there, sir."
Thank you.
Mr. O'Hara?
Yes.
My name is Clementi Sabourin.
I spoke to you on the telephone.
"Oh, yes, you're the gentleman who wants to open a margin account."
"Now, would you mind signing this, please, just a formality... and I'll fill out the rest."
Can you tell me the name of your bank?
I can do better than that.
I brought you a cashier's check for twenty thousand dollars.
"So, you met the boys."
- Yes.
- They take great pictures.
First the good news Franz.
My boss says the location is perfect.
Yes?
What does that mean?
"That means as soon as the contracts are signed, we'll do a casting."
- What?
Someone will play me?
What do you think?
Will this work?
Get rid of the Jesus business!
"Yeah, but it somehow works with the whole revolution thing."
Explain to me why they won't work together?
Why won't they work together?
!
Just settle down.
"Franz, I have the contracts with me..."
Let's find a quiet place where we can talk it over.
It's quite the opposite.
The people don't want to see authenticity.
Stars!
That's it.
"Every once in a while, we'll throw in an average guy."
That will freshen it up a bit.
Could Franz be that guy?
It's not my job.
That's up to the casting people.
"- But the Hotel, that stays in."
- That'll be something.
That's true.
"You know what, I'm stuck."
I have to shave this down.
You don't have to go the extra mile.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
What happened to the days when you used to listen to me?
That was a long time ago.
You should listen to me.
Not in this lifetime.
"Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely, terribly, horrible, incompetent doctor."
"While I would never let any blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance,"
I might be OK with you treating them.
Thank you.
The only thing you owe Carol is to treat her the best you can.
"Hey, where you been?"
"Oh, Larry, man."
I don't think I can shave my head.
What about Carol?
She'll be OK.
She has all you guys.
- You look over there.
- Mm-hm.
"Excuse me, nurse."
Hi!
How 'bout a poke?
"I have a husband, OK?"
And he's big and he's black and...
"Baby, baby, it's me!"
But I do love that you go to that big and black stuff.
I can't wait to bear the fruit of your loins.
"Baby, wait!"
This is the only way I can suck up to Kelso without the surgeons knowing.
There you are.
We don't live far from here.
thanks.
- That would be lovely!
My name is Dr. Rice.
But you can call me Zander if you like.
My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.
I'm offering you the possibility...
Caliban. save your friends.
The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.
she's impure.
She wasn't made by nature.
She's a mistake of my own.
I did what I could and they burned me and beat me.
Your colleagues are savages.
I agree.
The Reavers were very ineffective.
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.
But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.
I can't help you.

The old man.
Alzheimer's?

A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain?
What a combo.

why don't you sit at the end of the table?
"Take care of yourself and whatever you do, do it honorably."
That's the family motto.
"Do me a favor, Dad?"
"Certainly, son."
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
"She won't ask, but she might need it."
I'll keep an eye on her.
"Would all the draftees assemble over here, please."
"Come right in, folks."
"Now, as chairman of the draft board, let me say that all of us regret having to send any of you men off to war."
"You carry our love, our devotion and our undying gratitude."
Please try to come back safely to your homes.
"Now, we've prepared some gift packages."
"If you'll just step up here, I'll hand them out."
"Peyton Place draftees in the bus, on the double."
Let's go.
- Best of luck.
"- Come on, boys, hurry it up."
Make the goodbyes short.
"Name, loud and strong."
Last name.
"- Culver, Jones... ."
- Harvey.
Keep going.
You boys are gonna love the Army.
- Elliot.
"- Elliot, right."
Hurry up in the back.
Plenty of seats.
Nothing in the world's gonna stop me from coming back.
"I love you, Selena."
"I love you, Ted."
[GAVEL BANGS]

[APPLAUSE AND chattering ]
[GAVEL BANGS]
"Mr. Sanchez, do you have anything to say?"
"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
"Just for a moment, I would like you to try on Obediah's boots."
A man walks into your house...
... hetakesyourwife...
... andherapesher .
And you are powerless to stop it.
He rapes your wife...
... andthenhe threatenstotake  your 7-year-old child away from you.
And you...
- Because I'm gay?
- No.
I didn't say anything.
He must have asked around.
But I didn't tell him.
I swear.
I have to go to class.
You can't make it to any teacher conferences?
"I can, I just need to reschedule for tomorrow."
You don't have to see all of them.
"You should meet her French teacher, Mr. Carinci and, oh, are you going to meet Ezra?"
- Ezra?
"- Ezra Fitz, her English teacher."
"Aria's crazy about him, and I can see why."
"He's very smart, he's attractive, sensitive."
Does he also play guitar?
"Uh, not that I know of, but he does know how to handle a loose cannon."
Today Nick McCullers showed up.
McCullers.
From the library board?
"The same one, with the very same paranoia."
He was about to launch into the gay agenda there in the cafeteria.
"Ezra totally calmed the waters, completely defused the situation."
- It was something to see.
- Mm.
I'm sorry I missed that.
You should meet him.
You'll like him.
I'm late.
"Listen, uh, Ella."
I thought maybe we could pick up where we left off.
Maybe next Friday?
And thanks for being the way you are for as long as I can remember.
So I'd like to propose a toast for Mom and Dad   the loveliest couple here tonight.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Hi.
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?
Because I want to.
Weren't you ever taught not to abandon a lady with 7 old maids?
"Listen, I've got a plan."
If you wait a little and I wait a little   we could go into town after they dance.
You and me.
I know a place where they make fruit with drinks in them.
- You could come along.
- I don't think so.
"I'd like to be alone for a while, okay?"
- I mean it.
- Yes.
I won't tell anyone if you come along.
I won't tell Anna.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- No.
- Are you angry?
- Are you stupid?
Go away!
"I don't know what the hell to think, Helene."
- About what?
- Too much fits together too well.
But then I think   you wouldn't have done that to me.
"I'd like to talk, but not right now."
I simply can't believe you've done this to me.
I haven't done anything.
What have I done?
"Let's get another tube in, keep pumping in the saline."
We need to get her BP up.
- What can I tell them?
"- Nothing, say nothing!"
"Just get him here, fast."
Ready to insert the left tube.
Got no response to stimulus at any of the extremities.
"Right pupil's blown, left is slow to dilate."
We need to get her...
- She's in V-tach.
- Damn it!
"Who the hell was she chasing, anyway?"
Lanagan Pike; fell into a shallow pool of water and sodium hydrochloride.
"Burns to the right side, deep laceration to the left thigh."
"Frig, man, that burns!"
I need that one for questioning.
- You can have him when I'm done.
- A police officer's been injured.
"1, 2, 3, up."
Backstage is off limits!
"Listen, man, just get Yannick."
"Yannick knows her, man!"
"Her name is Natasha, she has brown eyes, she's a dancer in there,"
"- Yannick knows her, she's totally sweet..."
"- Hey, hey!"
- Take a walk.
"- Dude, listen to me."
"I'm sorry about what I said about your lack of neck that was hurtful, OK?"
"But I gotta find her, man, you gotta help me!"
"Dude, come on!"
"Trust me, you're better off."
You?
- It's the tour.
You can't do it.
You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it.
Cancel the tour.
Cancel it.
Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
"- You're messing up here, John."
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!
toured the Edgewater Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
Governor McCallum has given high marks to this petrochemical plant.
He is expected to call for similar renovations... at several Virginia plants.
WOWK-TV 13... has an exclusive look inside at what the governor saw.
Son of a bitch.
I congratulate my friends at Edgewater Petrochemical... on a job well done.
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
"- Excuse me, Mr. Klein."
You have a message.
"But that, no."
It isn't clean!
"You can catch germs in no time,"
licking just anyone like that.
What happened after that?
"After Touchy, Ducky and the Morin girl arrived."
They came from the hotel.
"We turned to look, we saw this kid crossing the street, he almost got hit and jumped into the field."
"Ducky got out of his car, all excited."
He came up to us and asked:
"Touchy, what was that?"
"- A black guy, I think."
"...Touchy said, coming out of his truck."
Ducky was looking all around.
"Touchy saw that I had gun, so flicking his hair, he said:"
I'm gonna go catch him!
And he ran in the corn behind the kid.
"Ducky stayed with us, saw the statue and went..."
"He looked at me, then turned to the field."
Nothing was moving in there.
"Nothing at all, at all."
Ducky started yelling:
Touchy!
No answer.
"He was getting scared, he said:"
Was he alone?
How should I know?
They hang out in gangs.
It was no joke.
We were all staring at the corn field... even the Morin girl... who was quite... quite drunk.
Ducky was getting more nervous.
"Touchy, did you catch him?"
Brother llango...
How many more are there?
Call any number of men.
This will be their fate.
You said I can't come alive.
I have come alive.
You said I can't save my father and my people.
I have saved them.
You said Konda Reddy is the King of Cuddappah.
But now I stand on his dead body.
You said whether I am real man.
"Yes, I am real man."
"To me, you're just a corpse."
If any Konda Reddy or Gocha comes here
I will slit their throats.
Stop.
"As you said, you have saved your father  your people."
No one can cross Cuddapah.
I've framed your people as naxalites.
"Courier, I woke up when you killed Cuddappah Raja."
We jailed your father as a naxalite.
"Just 5 minutes, I changed everything."
"To free the head of terrorists, police station vandalized."
Terrorists attacked police and escaped with arms  ammunitions.
How is it?
No inquiry for naxalites.
Encounter straight away.
It's our men.
Hey Inspector.
We got the shooting order.
Don't listen to anyone.
Just kill them all.
How many chances do you think you'll get to be a dickhead?
One more?
Wrong.
You're a nasty little virgin.
See ya.
"Right, fair enough."
OK.
"Best of a bad lot, deal with what we've got."
"I need you, we're in trouble."
I'm off.
Only popped in to check out your missus.
"Well, thanks for popping by and ruining my love life."
No problem.
I hope you and your ignorant boss get a good laugh out of it.
I'll tell you who'll be laughing last!
Me!
Cos I'm not the one who'll be working in a shitty garage doing manual labour for the rest of my life.
See you Monday.
No you won't!
Because I'll be at a local paper.
"That's right, a local newspaper."
"So my date, yes, date, was a disaster."
But at least my friends weren't hiding in the toilet.
"Oh, they were."
There was only one person for saving us now.
"Thanks for stepping in, mate!"
I was going to dive when you put your cock away.
"- Budge up a minute Jay, I need a piss."
"- You're not pissing in here, Neil."
- Why not?
It's a toilet.
- Go outside if you have to.
You just need someone to distract her friend.
"Oh, thank you, that is really solid of you."
I didn't volunteer... oh!
She's hot!
I volunteer.
"So, how'd it go with Emma?"
Not great.
"She, uh, did not think it was a date."
"Neither did Kevin, the dude she ended up making out with."
"This whole ""taking action"" thing is a disaster."
Except for Kevin... it's working gangbusters for Kevin.
[groans]
"Amy's nice, but she's so boring"
I almost didn't have sex with her.
You and Amy had sex?
How did that happen?
"Well, that's a conversation you should probably have with a parent."
Hey!
Holy hell!
She's boring from inside the house!
Okay.
She's not the first woman to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex.
"Mason, you go distract her..."
"Dude, Amy works here, in payroll."
She works here now?
!
"Well, she's not the first woman to get a job to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex."
Did you guys even talk last night?
She's worked here for three years.
She started here three years ago just to stalk me?
!
Jack?
Tell your father that they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
"You know what to do, right?"
"Keep pressure on the wound, and there should be some morphine syrettes in the, uh, supplies I gave you."
"Yeah, we've got it."
"Listen, Jake."
People are gonna be looking to you now.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
"Okay, the guys will be back."
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
"My guess is, they're waiting for reinforcements, so you should have a little time to regroup out there."
"Just keep the radio close, and I'll update you."
Out.
Out.
"Um, please, I need a doctor, whoever's in charge."
Right over there.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Colonel Hoffman.
"You don't have to call me sir, not unless you plan to enlist."
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.
It's planning to overrun the town of Jericho.
People are gonna get killed.
"They tried to kill me, but I got away."
You've got to help these people.
Where is this?
"Kansas, not far from the Colorado border."
I wish I could help.
My orders are to secure the roads in this area.
- Would you like to see them?
"- Oh, we will."
Indeed.
Don't spare the horses.
Take the next slipway.
"Off, here."
Here we go.
"Hang on, laddie."
Let's turn the tables on these buggers.
Tally ho.
Big Ben.
Akan is a cunt!
"Oh, my."
Looks like Akan's already begun.
"By tomorrow, these poor chaps will be super robotic soldiers like yourself."
Look out!
"On your feet, lad."
On your left.
Hang on.
I'm gonna buy you some time!
Seal the door.
Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift.
It's a pity I can't...
"It's just the landing gear, laddie."
"Now, listen to me."
"When you kill Akan, I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood?"
"No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with."
But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years.
No.
It's lodged in his jugular.
"If you uncork it, I won't be able to..."
"The thingamajig in your pocket, quickly."
Why am I still alive?
I made a promise to your wife.
"""You killed her."""
- Do not.
That's what they want to make you believe.
Because you did?
Why did you take it from me?
Mara was my creator.
"She got me up, knew I was different."
She was my mother.
You do not have mothers!
The quarantine of the Federation did it for the test.
So that we begin to show genetic anomalies.
Anomalies that the superior command did not like.
Like what.
- Hair?
- Some of us.
"For others, like me, or more Advanced."
"We have developed the ability, to reproduce."
Your wife kept the secret for a long time.
"When she threatened, with scattering the secret."
The top command entered.
They wanted to keep it a secret.
At all costs
Stop!
They have no right...
Your investigation is over.
Dirty Noid-Bitch!
"No, you murdered her!"
I saw it with my own eyes!
I did not kill her!
I tried to save her.
In front of rabid dogs ...
"Buon appetito, ladies!"
"Oh, ministers integrated!"
"Thanks, today there is no more."
For me it is not finished.
I have offered a theater for quarter of an hour and we are grateful.
"I quell'innocente for delirium, came down, wounded, from its hole in Hungary, has made cornificare all."
The dog is innocent.
"I contended that a bitch, I was deceived."
Want more?
- I want everything.
"- Where do you want and when you want, but immediately."
And he is present.
You embarrassed?
Perquisitelo.
The wax of the seventh seal drips on the fingers of the butcher ...
The lamb is ready ...
"Please, there, like whores."
- Are you afraid of me?
- No.
"Further, where it is more true, where he feels."
Front.
[The door behind you ...]
I ...
Let!
Coglione.
So the tape that kills?
Gone with the wind ... hole ... culo ...
"Not angry, I rivedrai more."
"I just wanted to understand, I forgive."
If Mickey is in agreement.
You hurt?
"Excuse me, but who are you?"
"- ""Introductions by Elise."""
Introduction...?
Intro...
Oh.
"- Oh, you're a dating service."
- Executive matchmaker.
Oh.
And a very large contributor.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase:
"You are the 200-pound tuna of bachelors, senator."
"You really don't have time to separate the wheat from the chaff,"
Grace Kellys from the Britney Spears.
That's where I come in.
- We need to meet the governor.
- Very nice meeting you.
- Lovely to meet you.
Think about it.
- You bet.
- Give me that.
- You didn't find her persuasive?
No.
"Objectifying, pushy, judgmental?"
"Yes, definitely."
She is trying to bring people together.
That is noble work.
- She looked at you like meat.
"- Tuna, actually."
If the press ever got wind of you using a madam...
- Matchmaker.
- They're gonna have a field day.
Can you think of a less romantic way to meet someone?
Hey... hey Dale.
Look it's ZACH!
Come on let's go inside for a minute.
It's crazy.
Yeah it's... it doesn't make any sense to me sometimes.
Listen I didn't get a chance to talk to you
I wanted to see if you wanted to go to dinner next week?
Um I can't.
I didn't even give you a day.
Well I know I'm sorry I'm just...
I'm slammed right now.
Working this retarded dating reality show.
OK.
Well I mean look if you're not too busy then maybe you can make it by my show at the label next week.
We can hang out after that?
Yeah... cuz
-Yeah...
You didn't exactly make that show you promised you'd come to the other night.
Oh I'm sorry.
It's Ok.
- I totally forgot.
Hey you know what next week though for sure.
"Ok good, because you had me a little bit worried there."
You know?
It's not like you to just drop off the grid like that.
You're my LA comfort food.
You know?
I need to see you every so often.
LA comfort food...
I like that.
I'm sorry it's just been one of those months.
You know that photographer JP and I...
What she said about the Nazis and the rest made me sick.
My father...
"Was scared of her, totally under her thumb."
"It was her place, you see."
"No, you have no idea what it was like living here."
It's always the same.
"If you had read Freud, you'd know how much damage your parents do to you."
It starts...
Even before you're born.
"Ah, yes, you read, uh..."
Yes.
I wanted to study psychoanalysis.
I wanted to go to university.
They wouldn't let me.
"Well, Stanley, lying is never very clever, but lying to a police officer is a very serious offense."
I'm not lying.
Everything I've told you is the truth.
Mr. Ellis?
Yes.
"How are you feeling, Mr. Ellis?"
Can you tell me what happened?
You don't know?
"Well, you didn't leave a note."
No.
Whisky and a sleeping draft-- it's fairly evident you tried to take your own life.
Why was that?
Isn't it obvious?
Not to me.
People had the wrong impression about Peggy.
"She was a strong woman, opinionated."
But they don't understand.
I'd been married to her for 22 years.
You have reached the voicemail box of...
Shit.
"All right, all right."
Is this one of those memory foam beds?
I've heard great things.
I hope you don't mind.
"We were waiting, so I had to take a little cat nap."
I'm not a young man anymore.
Who are you?
How did you get in my apartment?
I had some empathy for your father and his illness.
A man in his position shouldn't have to worry about owing his associate $50 million.
"I was willing to work with him, but then he was gone, in the wind, an apparition."
So I started to think... his sudden lack of presence was so that he wouldn't have to pay
Omar Sandahl.
That's me.
You killed Donnie.
Do you know where your father is?
No.
Hmm.
Then it's a good thing...
I know where you are.
Because if he disappears... you inherit his debt.
I'll get my money.
Finally.
Anika.
"""Sorry, been busy."
All good.
"Talk soon."""
Hmm.
Well...
There are some advantages to having the place still to ourselves.
MAN:
"Well, where does the [inaudible]?"
"Yeah, you got to-- you can't do that, right?"
"Hey, you guys can't do this stuff"
"Until he's wrapped, right?"
I'm the director.
I'm the boss.
Don't wrap until you get the word directly from the top.
I'm sorry if you were misinformed.
It obviously was a boo boo.
"And again, I'm grateful."
"It's the best makeup we've ever had,"
The best Toxie we've ever had.
But there might be some major miscommunication.
"And if it happens, it'll be a four-hour wait."
"So please-- this didn't matter, this one."
"But please just check first, right?"
"Please, please, please."
"Tox-- uh, David, thank you very much."
It was a wonder day.
Are you satisfied?
Everything all right?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
But you're OK?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
We can't do any better.
We cannot do any better.
I can't make the movie any other way.
This is the best-- this may be harder than most of the days.
I don't know.
But the only good-- the only thing I can suggest
"Is when we're outdoors, we only have so much daylight."
"I asked her if it was possible if we could be together when she gets back, and she said, ""You never know."""
She said that?
I'm gonna kill her.
"Don't tell Riley, but I'm looking into a transfer."
I have friends at Cairo Presbyterian.
Dr. Lonsdale.
Dr. Habib.
Perfect.
Ooh!
"You said you were going to do it, Riley."
You promised you would leave the guy no hope!
What are you talking about?
I dumped him this morning.
I can't help it if the guy doesn't want to let me go.
You were supposed to close the door!
"Instead, you did what you always do."
You left it wide open.
I don't know if I left it wide open.
Maybe I left it open a tiny little crack.
A crack is just as bad!
Why couldn't you just close it?
"I mean, what is so hard about closing the door on a relationship you don't even want?"
I don't know.
I guess maybe it scares me.
Something scares you?
"Okay, look, it's really hard for me to talk about feelings, so if we are gonna talk about this, you have to make a dumb face."
What?
!
Just do it.
Oh.
Mm.
Oh!
Love is a thief and stealing your heart tonight.
"And you give it to me, giving me all of you."
Your all I see...
You're all I want it to be.
I love you.
"Wow, he is good."
"I know, right?"
He looks so different.
I don't think he's as clean as he used to be.
Clean?
He's got that whole grungy working for him.
You can say that again.
Hey Jill where's Drew tonight?
Oh he had a movie screening and then he's going out with the guys
Is he excited about the whole engagement?
Yes he's so excited.
"And I decided that I don't want a long engagement so we set a date, September."
Ohhhhhh
That's great.
Don't you think that's a little quick?
Ah no Hallie I don't.
I'm pushing 30 Ok.
You just tell me how it feels when you get here.
I'm 25 Jill it's not like you're 108.
Count me out on this one.
My agent told me never to divulge my real age.
So I can't partake in the conversation either.
And you both smell like desperate whores
Thank you all for coming thank you very much.
Hey.
You made it huh?
That was incredible.
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
Do say?
"It's me, Cyrus."
"John, is that you?"
"Yeah, it's me."
"Whatever you are doing, you drop it."
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
"Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport."
You listening?
"Yeah, McCal I um at the chemical plant."
Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
"John, are you there?"
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
"Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me."
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on myway to interview him.
I'm glad I know that too.
"I mean, that you love him."
"If I hated him, I'd be all right, then we could walk down the street together and I wouldn't mind feeling him cringe, never let on."
I should've gone away from here a long time ago.
But he's hard to leave.
-Now I gotta get out of here fast.
"-Don't run away, Brock."
"Mr. McCurtin could get you off, couldn't he;"
"Oh, sure, easy."
Jury wouldn't even leave its box.
-Then face it like Papa wants you to.
"-Ever been to a trial, Sarah Beth;"
Lots of things come out of trials.
Whole mess comes out.
Salt Fork would eat this up with a spoon.
And he's had enough.
"Go on, Sarah Beth, sit down and play a tune by yourself."
You'll have to get used to it.
And tell the colonel nothing.
Jeff said McCurtin was here.
What'd he want;
-Nothing.
-Where you going;
-First lap on my trip to Denver.
"-Get down off that horse, Brock."
Get out of my way.
"Well, Sarah Beth, I'll try to understand why he had to go."
I didn't try with someone else a long time ago.
I've always been sorry.
"Well, colonel, then if Brock ain't here, we just gotta find him and take him in."
-Why;
-l thought McCurtin told you.
So I could get in no problem?
Well assuming you had Miley's grades and SAT scores.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
I am very tired here so I need to get this clear.
This may sound crazy.
Let me get this right.
If Miley and I were somehow I don't know.
"Smooshed into the same person, we could get in?"
[Laughs] Well if you put it like that I guess you would.
Unfortunately that's not the case.
Although oddly enough You do have the same eye twitch.
That's not the only thing we have in common.
It just so happens that Miley and I are.
The same.
Sign of the zodiac.
"Sagittarius, which means we're the fire sign."
And over-excitable eyelids.
I gotta go.
[Door closes]
"[Singing to the tune of ""Singing""]"
Problems.
She's got nothing but problems.
She's lost Jesse and Lilly.
All because of the wig.
If she came clean.
All her problems would just go away.
Or would they just begin?
[Mimicking cats screeching]
She's going to be home any minute.
And I don't know what to say to make her feel better.
"I know, I know."
It's terrible.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Ms. Moroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't-- I don't think you'd like it."
"'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I like risky.
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
All of 'em.
"Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe."
"Karl Robe, you say?"
Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other.
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.
That's a metaphor.
Sure.
You should tell that to Us Weekly.
"Hey, Lemon."
You like karaoke?
I know a joint.
"No, no, I-- I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy."
I'll take you.
"I was ready to earn an academy award nomination trying to mask my horror over how badly it sucked, but it's actually pretty decent."
"Thanks, bro."
You mind if I take a crack at it?
"Yeah, knock yourself out, bro."
All right.
"Holy shit, you got skills."
"* Left to look at but what lies inside me, * * my first reality * dude, you go to be in my band, bro."
- That was sick.
"- Count me in, bro."
"- Holy shit, bro."
- What are you guys called?
- Hot lunch.
"- Count me out, bro."
- What?
- Hot lunch?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
"You know what a hot lunch is, right?"
"Yeah, like salisbury steak, like taco tuesday."
"No, no, it's not like salisbury steak."
It's like a euphemism for a sexual term.
It's like when you're doing a chick and she takes a dump on you.
- No way.
- Yes way.Like a cleveland steamer.
- What's that?
- Same thing.
"Dude, I guess I'm never gonna go to cleveland."
I gotta take a piss.
"Sean, are you all right, dude?"
Yeah.
He don't look too good.
"You think I should, like, make him some tea or something?"
And they thought that a bush pilot was a pilot for George Bush.
"And right after the gulf war,"
George Bush was not a very popular person.
I tried to quickly explain that a bush pilot had nothing at all to do with George Bush.
Claytor decides to make a brief stop in Zambia to refuel and chart his course to Burundi.
Bueno Bungee.
How's everything here?
"I am from Ndola, but I needed to refuel."
Hello.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Claytor...
We are just from around here.
The lanky American is an unusual sight wherever he lands and his grasp of African languages is often a crowd pleaser.
This is my first time ever to come here.
It's nice to meet you.
"Oh, it's very nice to meet you."
"When landing, you're suppose to pay something - a landing fee."
How much should I pay you?
I want to pay.
How much?
How many kilograms?
It's one ton.
5-60 5-60.
How many U.S. Dollars is that?
It's about one U.S. Dollar.
I understand that
Can I pay you two U.S. Dollars?
So is that okay?
This is more than okay.
Okay no but please the change is for you guys
You can have it.
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also glitters, but it's not frightening."
Moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened..."
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""Hello, hello. """
I heard a feeble voice.
I looked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi... """
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there. """
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.
"Okay, it all comes down to Virginia."
"If O'Brien gets Virginia, he wins."
"- However, if we get Virginia..."
- We win!
"No, actually, Gary, if we get it, we tie."
- What?
- What?
"I don't follow these things that closely, but that's right, isn't it, Mr. Davison?"
Yes.
"Tie, like it's a tie?"
"You mean, we tie?"
- You do.
"- The real shock, Greg, is where this leaves us."
Neck and neck if the president takes Virginia.
"Matty, you'll forgive me if I sideline you here."
- Sure.
"- Dan, you know the president well."
What is going on in that Meyer hotel suite right this second?
The president has a lot of top minds working on her campaign.
They're gonna be all over this.
What happens when there's a tie?
Everybody goes online to try to find out what happens if we get a tie.
Way ahead of you.
"Shit, I'm just getting how to tie a tie."
Is there a book?
Like an old-fashioned...
like a paper book?
"Jesus Christ, you know?"
You do your best.
You try to serve the people
- and then they just fuck you over.
- Yeah.
charles!
- (gunshot) - (gasps)
Grab it!
Grab it!
darling!
charles!
charles!
I've had the most extraordinary letter!
Madame George Sand is quite brazenly inviting herself to the fortnight!
You know the one.
She wears men's clothes and leads a most depraved life!
I'm dying to meet her.
charles?
"She writes that marriage is barbaric, darling."
They say no marriage is safe around her.
"Just think, she might take a fancy to your turkey wattIes."
Didier!
Don't touch that!
Come here!
I'm in a quandary because I've invited alfred de Musset.
Everybody knows he and Madame Sand practically tore each other to pieces.
I'm petrified that if they so much as clap eyes on each other... (howIs with rage)
Has anyone ever met this duchess?
No.
Must be one of those titled tarts stuck in the provinces with an uncouth husband.
She's probably famished for culture and determined to import it at any cost.
charles!
- Where are you going?
- Hunting.
- Goodbye.
I'II be back in a few days.
- But you can't!
I wallow in the mud.
You're a construction worker?
Isn't that the photographer?
Everything alright?
I'm feeling a little dizzy.
We'll take you back.
Shall I tell you about the development of labor movements during the industrial age  just to pass away the time?
Some other time.
- There they are.
Good evening everyone.
- Here you are.
- I was worried.
I know I shouldn't be taking walks anymore.
Can I help you?
"I'm fine, thank you."
I have to leave.
Why?
Now you can tell me about what you're working on.
Who'd want to know?
Oh I'm interested in it.
- But you'll be sure to spoil it any moment now.
How old are you?
I'm not saying.
"Variety, you know what I'm saying?"
"Sure, my mother worked in a variety theater."
As a dancer?
As a cloak room attendant.
"Nora, we're making you an offer."
You'll sing for us on the weekend and work as a waitress.
Both?
Not at the same time.
I know that.
"Wilson, Cats, let's go."
Christo.
Yep.
"When the footage comes in, overlay it on the gris map."
"We get lucky, maybe we can trace Valera's escape route."
You got it.
All surveillance cam footage from the 900 block of Shortridge.
Thank you.
Any idea just how many cameras big brother's got pointed on downtown Atlanta?
"8,200, give or take."
Excellent.
I need this.
Make it happen.
I'll download the SANs and work it up.
Graham.
"Max Collins said he didn't know his mother was in town, right?"
Lab just ran prints lifted from Jessica's hotel suite.
We got a hit.
"Max, it's your fingerprints."
This isn't what you think.
What were you doing in your mother's hotel room?
She wanted to talk.
About what?
About Sara.
"Whether you guys were still happy, same as always."
"Since when do you two have an ""always"" kind of relationship?"
"What do you want me to say, Dad?"
"She was a crappy mom, but for the last six months, she's been trying to make up for it!"
She wants to be a part of my life!
Okay.
Do you have any idea where she is now?
No.
- The colony collapsed.
Mites might've caused it.
"In fact, they did."
Took over every hive.
Not long after Woolsey took over Betty's Bees.
Might almost be poetic if it didn't suck so much.
Kentucky didn 't sabotage Betty's Bees with a lot of might.
- She sabotaged Betty's Bees with:
- A lot of mites.
- Take a lot of mites to cause a collapse.
- Sure does.
I grew up with generations of those bees.
The first hive was an infestation in the corner of my bedroom.
I was 5.
- I tried to kill it.
- Oh.
I was stopped.
"Mother was a Methodist and Daddy was a pragmatist, so:"
"""God put those bees there for a reason."""
- They were right.
- You lived with bees?
That sounds magical.
We called it the Honey House.
The Honey House is empty now.
"We left together, me and the bees."
Those bees built Betty's Bees.
What happened to those bees?
Could it be sabotage?
A conspiracy?
How dramatic.
You think someone intentionally murdered my bees?
- Just a thought.
Mama's not really happy.
When are you coming back?
"Yeah, I'm"
"- I'm not sure yet, angel."
As soon as I can.
"Listen, I gotta go."
"I will uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"Bye, I love you papa."
"I love you too, Julia."
"You two, uh, takin' off for the airport?"
Yeah.
You sure you're doin' the right thing?
"I mean, you know, you just met the guy."
"Could be he's only uh, after your money."
"Well, that's okay."
I'm only after his body.
"So, how much longer are you planning on staying?"
I gotta think through some things.
Gonna take a while longer.
Don't forget about me.
Jacob Keane?
I'm Agent Henry.
I'm with the agency you used to work for.
What agency?
We're very impressed with what you did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The director would like to know if you'd entertain the notion of taking on a certain freelance assignment.
And why would I wanna do that?
'Cause you're a rich man now.
"I already was a rich man, Agent Henry."
You gave the money to Marta.
"After everything, don't you think it's the least she deserves?"
She has a head contusion.
She needs medical care.
"Then admit her upstairs to the medical jail ward, but her husband has a knife wound, and she's under arrest."
Mom?
Do not handcuff her in front of her daughter.
What is happening?
"Tammy, it's okay."
She's traumatized enough.
"Cooper, get her out of here."
No!
I want to stay with mom!
"No, no, no."
"Tammy, Tammy..."
"Everything's okay, sweetie."
I love you.
Mom!
"I love you, sweetie."
I love you.
Tammy.
You want me to give up a hospital bed for a kid with a broken arm?
"She's 11 years old, her dad hit her, she just watched her mom get hauled off by the cops."
"All good material for a country song, but lousy on a medical report."
"You look like day-old dishwater, Coop."
"Why don't you go grab a shower, get some rest?"
You've done all you can here.
"No, she's my patient, and I should've known what was going on."
I could've stopped this.
When are you going to Violet's to get your stuff?
"Oh, Charlotte, come on."
Have you talked to her?
"This is not about Violet, okay?"
"I haven't shaved and my shirt's a little wrinkled, but beneath the depressed hobo look, I am fine."
I have to tell him something.
I'm expecting John any minute.
There's been another murder.
In Indiana.
Indiana?
Is there something you want to tell me?
"No, nothing."
The smell on the killer's hands... it's surgical soap.
He must take it with him.
He washes his hands with surgical soap... to get rid of the blood.
I don't like this.
Nina Getz was my patient for many years.
The man has killed 3 people.
A donor's identity is strictly confidential.
Here it is.
Leslie Davison.
"OK, follow me here."
Frank's victim...
Margaret Tattersall... had a kidney transplant 2 months ago.
So?
Our victim...
Nina Getz... had skin grafts from an organ donor... about 2 months ago.
Valerie Wheaton never had a transplant.
"No, but the woman who lived below her did."
"Emma Brody... she had a corneal transplant... and, it turns out... her apartment number is listed incorrectly... on her medical records."
This guy meant to kill Emma Brody.
Holy fuck!
OK.
"So you got the letters... and the organs, right?"
What's the connection?
I'm not done yet.
Nina Getz's donor's name... was Leslie Davison.
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!
These fuckers are goin' down.
Dead.
Or alive.
Tell them that in your fake ching-chong language.
Shut up!
You're an idiot.
"I don't know what you're saying, buddy... but fuck you."
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?
"- Listen, no, sit down."
- Fuck me?
"Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama."
"Wow, we actually get a first-hand look at the South, huh?"
"Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip through the South, OK?"
This was supposed to be the most romantic week of my life.
Remember that?
Before you fucked it up?
You remember that?
"Just chill, OK?"
We'll be out of this situation.
"You'll be up in Maria's guts in no time, all right?"
Hey.
"She's not some skank, man."
"I've never felt this way about anyone before, really."
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?
"It's not like you would understand, so--"
I want to be happy
"I want to be happy, just like--"
"Excuse me, please."
I am certified to this state as a Supreme Court judge...
... andyou'resittinghere rearguing a 2-year-old case.
"You're out of line, and I'll so inform the mayor."
I'm here on the mayor's behalf.
You think I've slept the last two nights?
Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made?
That's it.
Satisfied?
No basement or anything?
"You saw it, the rumpus room."
With the pool table?
"That's right, captain."
I'm only doing my job.
I'm very sorry--
"Oh, sorry, crap!"
You're snooping around like a Nazi.
Please.
You know this is the last thing I wanted to do.
"Then get the hell out of internal Affairs, and get an honest job."
Marybeth?
Two-bars has been here all morning.
He went over the place from top to bottom.
You gotta do something about Eddie's pension.
They're gonna reduce it.
What about the Police Memorial Award?
The precinct says it goes to the next of kin.
"Well, this piece of brass isn't here to give me any award."
"$40,000 in cash was found in Detective Santos' strongbox..."
... hereathissummercottage in Ulster County.
Emergency Service Unit workers... .
Frank?
"Yeah, I'm up at the cabin."
I love you and won't allow it.
"You say you love me, but talk about allowing me to leave!"
Things between men and women will not change.
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him.
He's fine!
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!
Over!
At this moment I feel no love for you at all.
"I never thought that would ever happen, but it has."
Kay...
We're leaving tomorrow.
Why don't you take the kids back to their room?
"-Michael, you haven't heard me."
"-Kay, what do you want from me?"
"Do you expect me to let you go, to let you take my children from me?"
Don't you know me?
Don't you know that that's an impossibility?
That I'd use all my power to keep that from happening?
Don't you know that?
Kay...
"In time, you'll feel differently."
You'll be glad I stopped you now.
I know that.
I know you blame me for losing the baby.
Yes.
I know what that meant to you.
"I found him rubbing his face along the carpet, and he seems to blink in strong light-- that sort of thing."
"It's just some minor irritation, I expect."
"Bring him in, and I'll give him a check."
Best to be on the safe side.
"Thank you, James."
I'll pop by in a few days.
- Good.
Just look at those legs go.
"Tea is ready, Mr. farnon!"
"Thank you, Mrs. hall!"
"Aha, the cup that cheers, but not inebriates, eh, Mrs. hall?"
That's what I like to think.
Nothing like a good strong brew to keep the seasonal maladies at bay.
Here you are.
"- Lovely, thank you very much."
"A cup for you, Mr. herriot?"
"- Yes, please."
"Well done, James."
Just in the Nick of time.
"While you've been swanning around on the moors-- excuse me, Mr. farnon."
"- Yes, Mrs. hall."
I thought I'd mention fence again.
"- Fence, Mrs. hall?"
"Yes, I do recall."
"Perhaps, you also recall"
I asked you to tell Mr. Tristan about that.
It's the sort of thing he looks after.
Mr. Tristan says fence is your responsibility.
Does he?
Would you be good enough to tell him-- you tell him.
"It's not my place, is it?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me."
What?
"No, well... just think about it when you're bored."
You came?
Yes.
Na Na is here.
Na Na?
I heard from ahjumma... that President Choi Eung Chan is Lee Yoon Sung's real father.
The person who raised you... he's too cruel.
He took you away from ahjumma.
"Intheend,itwastomakeyourrealfatherlikethisright?"
"Because of Lee Yoon Sung's revenge, everything..."
Lee Kyung Wan.
Seo Yong Hak.
Kim Jong Shik.
Cheon Jae Man.
They were all corrupt.
"If they were not corrupt, I would have forgiven them."
"If the President is corrupt, too, are you going to punish him?"
"If he is corrupt,"
That-- does it have to be you who does it?
He's your father.
"To your real father, how can you..."
Kim Young Joo was faced with the same.
"Because it was his father, he concealed and covered it."
"But, was that really good for his father?"
I'm the President's bodyguard.
Maybe...
"like when I was guarding Seo Yong Hak, we might meet like that again."
"I hope, that you won't do anything you will regret."
"You know Assemblyman Lee Young Taek, who is the highest council member of Segyere Party, right?"
Lee Young Taek?
"The prosecution is investigating him on a bribery charge linked to Haewon's Cheon Jae Man for the privatization of health-care, right?"
"Anyway, uh, Serena might be a little upset."
"Well, you were right."
She can stay in Charles' room.
It's getting crowded around here.
No kidding.
"Throw in your ex-husband,"
And now we're a Nancy Meyers movie.
I hope you don't mind.
I know it's awkward.
"Well, I mean, it is a little unusual, don't you think,"
For a doctor to move in to his patient's building?
"Well, not if he's the father of the patient's children."
What are you getting at?
Is it possible that...
Will's also trying to get close to you?
Absolutely not.
I'm the one that told William to stay away
If he couldn't make good
On the promises he made to the children.
And I'm sorry if this is uncomfortable for you.
"But if William wants to move in to be closer to the kids,"
I'm not gonna stand in his way.
Mmm.
Holland?
"Hi, it's Rufus."
Um...
I have a favor to ask.
...And the social scene at N.Y.U. Was criminal.
"Ten freshmen, a keg"
And a tub of hummus on a card table isn't a party.
It's a tragedy.
Hmm.
Which of these two do you prefer?
I don't know.
Try them both.
One for each window.
"Don't be silly, darling."
It's as much your problem as it is mine.
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.
My den?
"What's this, Sergeant?"
Buying a trousseau?
We're buying curtains.
"I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business."
Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy?
"I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us."
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...
"Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss."
"I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain."
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?
"Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
- Tommy.
"- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss."
"Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back."
"Don't cry, darling."
Goodbye.
This is May 9.
"I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together."
Now come on.
"- Pardon me, madam."
- Fall in!
- You won't get bored with a life of fresh air and bird-watching and jam-making?
"Not with you by my side, Joyce HazIedine."
Ah.
Three-nine-nine-eight-five?
"You got yourself a bargain, Joyce."
Pam Draper.
welcome to little Stempington.
"Oh, sorry."
How d'you know about us?
health club database.
"You're down as potential new members, Joyce."
It's like a tardis in here.
"- Ah, one of the natives at last."
- Pam Draper.
pleased to meet you.
"There's some olive tapenade, walnut bread, few organic eggs."
- I'm really touched.
- You'd never get this in the metropolis.
"And I imagine you'II find policing a place like little Stempington a Iot easier, too, once you get started."
"Ah, very observant."
Excuse me.
hello.
That's a strong grip.
You must be Joyce's personal trainer.
"You ladies of little Stempington are a friendly lot, aren't you?"
"hello, Joyce."
hilary Davenport.
welcome to little Stempington.
"- We've done that bit, hilary."
"- Oh, Pam."
What a nice surprise.
"As I was saying, you were lucky to get one on the south-facing side of the close."
Gina Linetti is the real hero here.
- But isn't Gina Linetti more of a state of mind?
"Like, in a way, we were all Gina Linetti today."
"Gina, let's take this Gina to the hospital."
"Hey, how's the sheriff?"
"- Well, he keeps yelling, ""Disability for life!"""
So I think he's fine.
"Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well."
"- Oh, that's great."
- Yeah.
How are you doing?
"- Fine--you know, just getting bandaged up."
"Actually, can you give us a second?"
Thanks.
It hurts so bad.
I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
"- So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now."
"- Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me."
- I love you.
- I love you too.
"Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?"
- Yeah.
B positive.
"- Well, guessed wrong."
"Hey, Craig?"
"- Hey, Captain Stentley, we're back."
- How was Florida?
- It was fine.
- A lot of college girls.
"- Come on, man."
"- Now, before you say anything,"
I know we disobeyed a direct order.
I'll be careful.
What the hell?
You left me alone in a dance circle.
I was trapped in a ring of clapping strangers who wouldn't let me go unless I busted a move.
I have no moves to bust!
What happened back there?
I don't even know.
What's going on?
Huh?
You've been acting a little strange all night.
You made that comment about still gettin' crazy even when you're a mom.
It just got into my head.
"Then we went into the bathroom to drink,"
- and crazy girls in these crazy dresses...
"- [ Chuckles ] ...about to pound a giant bag of wine, and I saw myself in the mirror..."
[ Laughs ] I only saw the ceiling.
"I was like, glug, glug, glug."
Sorry.
Continue.
I have a baby at home.
"And here I am, in this slutty dress, ready to party my ass off in the bathroom of a bar, acting like..."
Like your mother did when you were a kid?
She was the Ultimate Party Slut.
And that's not coming from me.
That was an actual title she won in Daytona.
You think Adam should back off?
Duh.
"Check the Magic 8 ball, buddy."
[ Gasps ] All signs point to Pete.
- Adam liked Kim first.
"- Well, too bad."
Kim digs Pete.
I'm thinking of a few of you specifically when I say that last part.
"Hey, hey."
Are you at all qualified to be teachin'?
"I never use the word ""teach."" I always say ""instruct."""
Nice try.
"You've made it a point to turn others against me, and I don't understand why."
I've not.
You have.
"And as a result, I'm sad and alone..."
And I don't like it here.
Hello.
Hi.
I read  Obidant.
I really liked it.
I didn't realize it had come out already.
About two weeks ago.
Huh.
"Listen, it's nothing personal, but..."
"I'm really trying to do my best up here, and part of that means not getting involved with anybody in, say, a human way."
"So if you'd like, you could come visit me at my office."
This is not my office.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Please don't act like somebody who doesn't know how to handle themselves.
I don't know what you mean.
Act as though you attend these things all the time.
How?
Feel like you don't want to be here.
Like me.
See how little I wanna be here?
But I very much want to be here.
"Oh, Jonathan."
Are you proud of me?
[Siren wailing]
Hey.
You locate the captain?
No.
Not yet.
"Knocked on his door, no answer."
Checked his car.
It was in his parking space.
Just got the key to his condo from the building super.
Let's do this.
[Groans]
He's down!
Radio for backup.
I'm going to need backup and an ambulance at the captain's residence.
[Door closes]
He's alive.
His housekeeper's not.
He wanted the coins that were stolen from the jeweler.
I told him Farley Kolt had them.
"And he said he found Kolt in Los Angeles, spent three days with him, and was sure he didn't."
You might want to check with LAPD if Kolt's body has been found.
I doubt he left him alive.
"And if he didn't wind up with the coins, who did?"
Maybe he got rid of them before this guy caught up with him.
I don't think this guy thought so.
That's why he's here in Portland.
He had photos of all of us.
"Me, Nick, and you, captain."
They were taken by a private investigator from New York.
His body was found this morning at a downtown hotel.
And we found a camera in the trunk of a rental car.
Downloaded the photos.
- Nothing?
So you had kept punching a number no longer in use!
Manoj...
Do you have any photo of you and her together?
"No, I don't."
What will I do with the photos?
The few photos that we did take are on her phone.
Any of your relatives or friends who have seen Ashwini?
No.
Have you seen any of her friends or relatives?
No.
Where is that ancestral place that you mentioned?
I don't know.
- What?
What were you doing with her without knowing anything?
Manoj...
Have you both gone out somewhere together?
Sometimes we used to go for a night drive.
Mostly we like solitude.
Hmmm...
Enjoyment in solitude...
Please think about it...
Haven't you gone out anywhere together?
On my birthday...
We went to a temple and had lunch outside.
Which restaurant?
Beach Walk.
- When is your birthday?
September 12th.
"Okay, Manoj."
We will try to find Ashwini.
You don't get scared.
like that dreadful woman writes.
- If you can call her a woman.
- George?
"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
"We can't find anything, citizen."
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.
They're all in here.
Follow me.
What the devil...
"Good God, Claudette!"
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow!
Hello!
Welcome.
"Well, he left the salon at that moment."
Claudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
Do you want a drink?
At that stage everyone started to laugh.
At last!
Madame Sand!
Everybody's staring at me.
It's a revelation wearing trousers.
I feel quite the bully!
George in a dress?
"Red and white, the colours of the Polish flag."
Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in arrests.
"What was it, over 100 again last year?"
Terrific.
But who?
What did you bring in?
A high-school kid in short pants that had a twitch?
You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock?
"Walter, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right?"
It's like a desert full ofjunkies waiting to get well.
"Goddamnit, this could be it."
"This little candy-store guy, he's put on a big show... ..in a club with no narcotics connections."
They were all over him.
"And after working a day and night, we tail him to Brooklyn."
"And we sat on him for practically a week, and who do we come up with?"
Joel Weinstock.
Now you gotta let us have it.
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
- What'll it take?
- A wire.
"No, two wires."
"One on the store, one on the house."
"You know I have to get a court order for a wire tap, don't you?"
- But you'll try.
"- We know you can do it, Walt."
"Popeye, you still picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?"
J'entends parler de ça.
Je n'arrive pas á y croire.
Alorsje vais un peuparlerpourmoi.
"J'ai tendance á... penser á mes propres problémes, enfiin..."
"Monsieur Devereaux, is this your first trip to New York?"
"- Yes, it's my first."
- I'm in the middle of bidding.
"Well, you better take a look at this first."
This is the real Ricky Stancati.
You've got an imposter.
I appreciate the update.
Ricardo.
- Do we have a deal?
- We have a rat.
Or a cop.
Or a fed.
"D.E.A. Agent, reporter, maybe."
"Listen, it doesn't matter."
"The point is, you're busted, and whoever you're working with..."
They're dead already.
I don't need a gun.
"When I kill a man, I use my hands."
"Before you die, tell me something."
Do you believe in an afterlife?
I believe in angels.
Go.
Put your weapons down slowly!
Put 'em down!
"Amanda, I'm gonna get you home."
Your nightmare is over.
You'll get medical attention and he returned to your familias.
Looks like we closed Finch's last sweatshop.
You don't mind.
Charlie.
We're gonna be bringing in more warm bodies than planned.
"Need some transport, north face of the island."
I spoke to the head of the Bahamian police.
Finch and the bidders have been extradited to the U.S.
[ Shaky Voice ] I am glad he's gone.
- As am I.
- B'oh!
It's probably my imagination... but something about them didn't seem quite right.
Really?
Excuse me for just a moment.
"People, that was all wrong!"
"Homer Simpson doesn't say ""B'oh."" He says--"
"""D'oh."""
"[ British Accent ] Sorry, M.B., but I'm having trouble with this character."
Is he supposed to have some kind of neurological impairment... like Rain Man or Awakenings?
"I mean, what the hell am I doing here?"
And this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of Murphy Brown.
"[ Low Voice ] Hey, you know we're getting into golden time?"
"Yes, well,just get it right... or you'll all be back doing Come Blow Your Horn at the Westport Dinner Theater."
All right then.
Let's see what the old Simpson family is up to now.
Duh-oh!
"[ Groans ] That's them, all right."
I can't believe it.
I guess you're the only one I can trust.
- Hmm?
Hmm?
- Dad?
- [ Bone Snaps ]
- Oh!
That rib always breaks.
[ Groaning ]
"Lisa, what are you doing?"
"Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction... that Bart's absence has left in our hearts."
- [ Yelps ]
"- That's sweet, honey."
- How very impressive.
- Would you like to buy it?
- Do you want to sell it to me?
- Yes.
- How much?
"1,000 kroner."
"That's the best 1,000 kroner I've ever spent."
My colleague is a quite the art expert.
He'll be very impressed.
"- Hi, Frank."
- Well?
- It's mouth painted.
- But why?
I bought it from a crippled lady who paints with her mouth.
Impressive.
"- But still, it's a shitty painting."
- I think it's very... mouthy.
"- But impressive, eh?"
"- ""Mouthy"", you said it!"
- I'm happy.
- But you can't hang it anywhere.
The office.
You've got that...
It's not really office material.
We have people coming by and...
I'm at a stage in my life where I'm fascinated by the orally competent.
- Why?
- Mia says my technique is dull.
- She says you give bad head?
- That's another way to put it.
"I'm like a fiery Arab, and you're more the dray horse."
You toss your long tongue into her beaver.
"[laughs] Yeah, you mean, whenever Seth would let me."
Bought you a souvenir.
"Aw, shucks."
It's everything I ever wanted.
"Everybody needs their Shangri-La, kid."
- You ever see that YouTube video?
- YouTube?
"- What, are you watching YouTube now?"
"- Yes, I am."
"And they got this one, shows this dog, he runs right out in traffic, right out in the middle of the freeway, cars and trucks comin' from every angle, just to save the other dog's life."
"Okay, YouTube is a masturbatory wormhole."
The point of the story is  he does whatever it takes to save his pal.
Like nothin' else in the world matters.
Nothin'.
Whatever happened to that Seth and Richie?
[phone vibrating]
"You know he's not going to answer, right?"
He knows you betrayed him.
"I'll talk some sense into him, all right?"
Show him we can all do this.
"You really think you can live happily ever after with him, don't you?"
I can sure as hell try.
[phone beeps]
- [Seth] Yeah.
- Seth?
!
Seth.
"- Hey, listen to me."
- It's okay.
I know why you did it.
Just meet me back at Uncle Eddie's.
"Okay, you got it."
Wednesdays?
Goni?
"Come take the stool, sweetie."
What does he need the stool for?
- Why are you taking the stool?
I understood the Russian.
"The stool is mine, I brought it and I'm taking it."
"Goni, we're leaving."
Aren't we waiting for Mommy?
She'll come in a minute.
Why are you taking the magazines?
"When you were a baby, we lived in a small apartment and there was no room for all my things, so I asked Grandma and Grandpa to keep them for me."
Why are you taking them now?
Because now there's room in our apartment.
And we don't need any favors.
"It's okay, sweetie."
Why did you have to do that?
- Because I wanted to.
You do it to spite my mother?
"Yes, I direct little operettas and do things to spite her."
Don't start with that.
"I will start with that, I've had it."
"Do whatever you want, but not in front of the child."
I have no problem with it being in front of the child.
Hi.
Where should I put it?
- Anywhere.
Thanks for bringing everything back.
You're paying.
"- Yes, I'm paying."
There's more.
How do you feel?
Yeah.
"Of course, the liver."
"Come on, boys, belly up."
Toast to us.
"Uh, derek and tommy, I'm gonna pour you guys a little shot of ginger ale since you're girly boys who can't handle your booze."
"To us, gents."
"To, uh, garbage bags full of cash."
To liver cancer.
- Here.
- Cheers.Bam.
"Let's go, boys.The strippers aren't going to shove dollar bills between their own jugs."
"You know, you guys go ahead.I'm gonna stay and, you know, close up shop, take care of the money."
"No, it's ok, I got it."
Don't worry about it.
"No, no, it's fine."
I got like a place where I hide it.
"It's very secretive, you know."
"Yeah, well, I'm gonna keep it at lou's place."
So it's not a big thing.
"All right, but I know how to retain it and everything.It's my job."
"- You know what I mean, it's my job."
- It's not your job tonight.
I got it.
Ok?
- You got it?
- I just said I got it.
Ok.
"All right, you got it."
You guys go ahead.
Have a good time at scores.
All right?
"And, you know, I can give you guys a couple of tips that will actually help you guys out there."
"A jerk and Greek bro, and the rest of Omega Chi."
I had a lot of good times there.
It's gonna be a hard decision.
"I don't want it to be about you, or Evan or my dad."
"You know, I just gotta... do what feels right."
Or you'd be picking Kappa Tau.
Need a drink?
"I could use 'bout a million drinks, I've been running around all night."
What do you want?
Sparta hooch?
"Actually, I brought my own."
Nice flask.
"Sorry, I crossed the line, I didn't mean to..."
Apology accepted.
To a long and meaningful friendship.
"Right, friendship."
I gotta go back upstairs.
Find someone.
"Which is why I think in many ways,"
Ferris Bueller is my generation's Gatsby.
So... do you think that Gatsby is really great or just a totally decent guy?
Would you excuse me?
I need to find a bathroom.
I don't think you're heading in the right direction.
Sure I am.
I've seen a lot of people round here.
"Maybe you should use the one upstairs, it's much nicer."
- There's pot pourri.
- That won't be necessary.
"No, you can't go in there."
- Why not?
- A girl got sick.
Great.
Let's go this way.
How do you know it's that way?
[âª]
"All this time,"
And I don't know where to begin.
You can't just decide to change your life
And expect to make up for
All the ruined years of mine.
"No, you're right."
"I can't deny my past, andreas."
"What I did, I did."
But you were a fool
To take on the gural nataz.
You had what you wanted.
You knew the dagger and sheath
Would lead you to the astronomicons.
And they had you.
You still don't believe that
"I had exchanged them for you, do you?"
I understand your doubt.
My misdeeds have led to this.
"Physical scars change my appearance,"
But nothing compares to what has
Happened to me on the inside.
"All those days facing death,"
I came to realize that
Nothing mattered more to me...
Than you.
[âª]
Hello.
These symbols may very well describe
But he didn't hang up the phone.
We had to scrub the audio.
"At first, it was quite feint."
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
"You came back, and you put the jacket in ms murnane's laundry."
1:16 pm.
Resuming interview with eva gundelach.
"Now, eva, I'm going to read back over what you said before lunch about the death of thom murnane."
Do you understand?
"Anything I say that is in correct, please stop me and tell me."
"You said,"
"""it happened the night mum and dad fought."
"They'd fought before, but this time was different."
It was loud and I went to listen.
I heard mum saying she wanted to leave dad.
I'm not going to tell you who it was!
"Ok, you promise me you won't say."
Tell me who it was.
It was Jess.
Jess?
Jess murnane?
You said you wanted to know.
"""I couldn't let mum and dad break up."
Couldn't let Jess murnane ruin our family.
I had to make her leave the street.
She wouldn't stay without her boy.
""" If Jess didn't have thom anymore, she'd go, and leave dad alone."
"""I waited till dad got home."
He went to the door and he came back home.
He came back inside and I waited for him to go to bed.

Out among the stars I sail
Way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sailed
To a dream that ended too soon
Now I know exactly
Who I am and what I'm here for
You are a toy!
You can't fly!
And I will go sailing
No more
"But no, it can't be true"
I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky
If I believed I could fly
"Why, I'd fly"
To infinity and beyond!
I want the boss.
"""Tattooing"" in Japanese..."
Take it nice and slow!
You lied to me.
All your questions about Lynn's tattoo.
She was killed for her tattoo.
What about you?
Did you tell me the truth?
I thought there were 12 Hiromitsus.
I wish it were so.
You were together?
You and Hiromitsu.
I loved him.
So much I didn't care that love meant something different to him.
We were so happy.
Until his masterpiece was finished.
He lost interest in me.
He lost interest in everything.
In life as well.
He killed himself.
Attained absolute perfection.
And left me behind with a wound that won't heal.
"Ironically, I'm the only thing that's left of him."
So Lynn Wilson knew about your tattoo?
"Of course, but she swore never to tell anyone about it."
Before ending up in Gunzel's basement.
Gunzel most likely knew about her tattoo and whoever else worked with him.
"Irezumi, too."
Who else knows about it?
Your family?
Your lover?
No one.
"Ah, you're kidding, right?"
"No, I'm not kidding, coop."
"It's been a really, really good year, okay?"
"Now you, my friend, deserve a little bonus."
"Ladies, refreshers."
"You're under arrest,"
Mr. Daly.
Get this animal out of here.
"See you later, baby."
"Well, it's about time."
Do you mind telling me
"Why I have been here for over an hour, drinking this swill..."
With no access to a telephone?
"Well, I'll tell you what."
"You can borrow mine, mr."
Enright.
Use it to call your lawyer.
Let him know we're booking you for pandering
And possession of a controlled substance.
And we've got a good shot at tying you in to leslie stoltz's murder.
"Oh, please."
"You people just don't get it, do you?"
"You know, your good friend coop daly--"
He sold you out.
The actions you took led to leslie stoltz's death.
That's felony murder.
"Well, I could just say one little magic word."
What's that?
Car...
Do...
Za.
"The judge is going to toss this case out right away,"
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I changed my mind.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story is gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison?"
When your stupid bitch of a boyfriend turns on you?
They killed your aunt.
They almost killed Lydia.
Who do you really think is gonna be next?
- Any checkpoint in the world.
It routes to a dummy U.S. government site.
No one here will know she left the country.
You match the stamps?
And the crease on the Morocco page and the coffee stain on the German stamp.
Trust me--I've done one or two of these before.
And this needs to be better.
"As long as she has that passport with her, she'll be fine."
That's all I need to know.
Good luck.
Hola Victor.

"Annie, do me a favor-- toss me your passport."
"Oh, that's okay."
I can hold on to it.
This isn't America.
You don't leave something that valuable just lying around.
What's the matter?
"You weren't planning on running away, were you?"
Yeah.
I was hoping I'd meet a strapping young habanero and start a family down here.
"Well, until then, you'll have to make do with me."

You don't recommend classes in baby-making?
Only in theory.
I intend to initiate a sex-education course in the school.
- Isn't that a function of the home?
- You'd think.
And yet not one parent in 10 does it.
"No, sex is taboo in the home."
And it should be in the schools.

So this is a test run to see if i can handle things
And not slip back into my old habits again.
"Well, speaking of handling things,"
I don't know how your mother's gonna handle
Seeing you after the way you two parted.
"Oh, she's been going through a very rough time lately."
But seeing you like this is gonna make her happy.

"- I don't know, grandma."
We haven't spoken in months
And you know she wasn't really that happy with me
The last time we saw each other.
"Well, like you said, that was months ago."
We'll just have to see how she handles things today.
"Oh, she..."
Seeing you is gonna make her happy.
I just know it.
"mom, let me in."
I left my keys.
"Oh, y'all go and hide in the hall closet."
I'll see how she's feeling before you come in.

She stabbed her father.

We are in no condition to fight.
Especially not with a pajama-wearing daisy strapped to my wrist!
- We must escape.
- Over the side!
Leave it to a lover of basket hats to jump left instead of right.
I'm having second thoughts now anyway.
We have no idea how far down...
"Great job, laddie."
- You have any idea where we are?
- No.
"So, what now, smarty-pants?"
"For the moment, we are safe from those bounty hunters."
We must find shelter before they find us.
We are defenseless in this lagoon.
Shut it!
There.
We'll be safer on land.
- Hear you!
- Blaster!
"What I do not understand is, why Aku is after you."
I have a huge price on my head.
"Oh, yeah."
Do you see how low that is?
I used to be able to touch my knee to my nose.
Without having sex?
Hah!

Thank God I'm getting...
"Oh,my God,my ring is gone!"
Now don't freak out.
I'm not freaking out.
You know I'm great at this.
I'm not freaking out.
A earring?
No.

"I'd ask you to help,but I doubt you know what one looks like and I don't have time to draw you a picture."
You always underestimate me.
"Seriously,dude,I almost peed my pants."
Thank you!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm starving.
Thought maybe you'd join me for brunch.
Forever?
I don't think it'll take that long.
"Elliot,I don't want to just be your girlfriend."
What makes you think being your half girlfriend's making me any happier?
You're not hating me as much.
"I want a life partner, not bi-weekly sex and a hangout buddy."
"I'm on the soul mate path,man."
No stopping or standing.
I don't want you to come to the wedding with me.

"Yes, I did."

-You were awarded the Order of Red Star.
Right?
"-Yes, sir."
Now I'm a sergeant.
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm not Jeffrey.
I'm sorry.

Did you have any company?
Yeah.
Peaches.
Does that count?
"Look, I don't have an alibi."

"- No, not really."
Look...

"- Oh, yes!"
- Can I have another drink.
- I thought you hated salad.
- I do.
"I just can't eat a big cheeseburger in the middle of the day anymore, ya know?"
- Doesn't it bloat you?
- Bloat me?
- Yeah.
"- No, it doesn't bloat me."
"Actually, I thought it went really well with the spareribs I had for breakfast this morning."
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.
"I just thought we'd always be in the same boat, ya know what I'm sayin'?"
It made it easier somehow.
I know.
Tell you what.
I'll give you half my salad if you give me half your burger.
- We'll need some more dressing.
- Definitely.

"I want assure you that everything possible is being done to find those responsible for this tragedy, but in the mean time we should all be on the lookout for any suspicious activity..."
Your safety is our number on concern.

You're gonna be by yourself in a room full of booze.
"Yeah, I'm good."

- I'm your sponsor.
"Come on, i know what I'm talking about."
"Yeah, but bottom line, tommy, we're both just a couple of drunks."
"Yeah, but I'm a higher ranking drunk than you, so if A.A.Was like an army, I'd be a 5-star general, and you're just a grunt."
Take it as an order.
I'm fine.
Get out of here.
"- Yes, sir."
- All right.Bye.

You know what?

You mean have a conversation?

You guys are-are boyfriend and girlfriend...
I love him.
"No, you don't, but that-that's fine."
So here's another question.
Have you two ever spoken?
Of course.
We talk all the time.
In person?
With actual words that the other person hears and then responds to?
"What are we, Amish?"
"You should try it, Sam."
And just be straight with him.
JEN:
"Yeah, guys love it when you're direct."
Like when I told Greg his dream hat was stupid.

He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.
"Sorry, but I have instructions to bring these papers back with me, signed."
"You can wait, then."
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.
"- I don't need one of those, either."
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.
"Well, for the last two years."
Two years?
No man?
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.
What ever happened to dinner and a movie?
A guy who spends his nights in front of a computer has to be a good date.
"He's not married, and he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls."
Maybe there's a reason he's not married.
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe... he's not even a man.
How do you say...?
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
"- Yeah, that's it."
Tonight come by my house and we'll go into a chat room together.
- I don't think so.
- Tonight.
Promise.
- We'll see.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.

The FBI is the only family he's got.
His parents were a horror story.
I don't give a shit about his family life.
Can we trust him?
"Sir, when I started out I worked in the field with brant."
"He'd run through a wall for you if he believes in you, but you betray him, you don't want to be on the same fucking planet."
You don't want to be on the same fucking planet.
"Wonder boy or not, I'm putting back up on this case."
You're the boss.
"So, so what kind of job?"
"Oh, don't worry Nick."
It's an easy job.
Easy.
Choose one.
"Easy job, huh?"
Don't you have a regular guy for this?
Don't you have a regular guy for this?

You told her terrible things.
I-I didn't kill Coach Nelson.
"Todd Fleming had an alibi for the night Nelson was killed, which leaves you."
Okay!
Okay...
"Yes, we sent the e-mail, okay?"
I'll admit that.
Yeah.
Nice.
"See, my-my dad, he doesn't make a lot of money."
So the only way I'm going to college is if I get a wrestling scholarship.
"Coach Nelson, he moved me up a weight class."
That totally wrecked my chance at State Championship.
"So we thought if we sent these pictures around, maybe it'll get him fired."
So you e-mailed them to yourselves to throw off suspicion?
"Yeah, but that's all we did, okay?"
We had nothing to do the murder.
"Ah, you know what, actually, you kind of did."
'Cause we're thinking it's those pictures that got your coach killed.
Where were you Thursday night?
"I was at, uh, school."
I was at a basketball game.
Got somebody who can vouch for that?
"yeah, yeah."
"My, my-my, my Dad."
He picked me up around 10:00.
What's his name?
Alex Sheridan.
He works at the Manhattan Superior Court.
He's a court officer.
"He was struck by something hard, a club or a pipe."
"It wasn't the son, it was the father."
Court officers have metal batons.
This is worrying!
Do we really have to wait for His Majesty's decision?
"Sometimes it cannot be helped, Your Highness."
Those blasted rascals
"Everytime the Hans come around, we have to swallow our dignity."
How long is this going to last?
Hey Mu-Song.
What?
Do you want to know why someone like me can make it this far without wife and children?
That's because
I dedicated my entire life to this Iron Workshop.
"This Workshop is my wife, my children."
Now they want me to put it out of service.
Isn't that like asking me to kill my wife and children?
My condolences.
The only one who take all these sorrow away is Prince Ju-Mong.
"Prince Ju-Mong, please you must become Crown Prince and extinguish this misery for Mo Pal-Mo."
Hey watch what you're saying!
What if someone hears you?
and drink less of that wine!
Bug off!
I know I'm right.
"No matter what,"
The only person fit to be Crown Prince is Prince Ju-Mong!
I said shut it!
You rascals!
What did you say?
What about Ju-Mong?
Are you itching for death?
"Your Highness, IronSmith Leader... he's drunk"
He only said that out of brashness
Please forgive us!
I was thinking ifyou could talk...
- No.
"No way, Mr Daaga."
Vijay is a police officer.
And I am a lawyer.
It has happened many times before.
"He has arrested many criminals, and I have freed them."
But our friendship still prevails because he hasn't questioned me about my profession.
Nor I have interfered in his work.
And...
"Think ofthe devil, and here he is!"
We must leave.
Where were you all these days?
-Right here.
Shall we play a set?
ARer them.-l have taken one more case ofyours.
Balwant's.
You arrested him.
You are on to it?
- Yes.
Go ahead.
But his chances are grim.
- We'll see that in court.
Why did you take up this case?
-Come on!
It's my profession.
You know he's a first rate criminal.
Still you... lt's not for us to decide if he is guilty or decent.
Let the court decided over it.
You won't improve.
My client Mr Balwant Singh works for Roshan Electricals.
"On the 15th he was on his way to the bank to deposit 25,OOO in the company's account."
Okay.
"Oh, yes."
One minor note here.
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.
Wait a minute here!
What do you mean the party?
's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losing' her marbles?
"Well, obviously she wanted to have the party?"
before the move.
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favourite since kindergarten.
"Hey, hey."
"Come on, Potato Head."
"If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me."
Woody has never steered us wrong before.
"Come on, guys."
Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
"But what ifAndy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?"
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!
"Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced."
This is Andy we're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
"That's what we're made for, right?"
Pardon me.
"I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here!"
Birthday guests at three o'clock!
By the way...
"Why is Bon called ""Bon""?"
You don't know?
No
"""Bon"" from ribbon."
It's an abbreviation
"Huh, interesting"
Why a ribbon?
Huh?
Big Sis's clothes and accessories
Look at the ribbons
"Oh, that makes sense"
She likes ribbons
"I kind of understand why you're an ""amateur"" virgin"
I'm sorry
I don't even know professional sex
"If you become my friend, I won't get mad at you"
What?
Can't we be friends?
As two virgins?
Sure
Then let's pinky promise
Ok
"""Pinky promise is forever..."""
Stamp
Thumb
Now it's official
Officially fuck buddies?
Bebi looks really nervous
What's he nervous about?
All he's doing is luring her in
"Plus, he is a brothel veteran"
"His peers, his public."
They'd find out what kind of a husband he is.
Letting the great Gillian Booth rot away.
His vanity couldn't stand it.
"He'd, he'd... be shamed into action!"
"Yeah, as long as he was your husband, maybe."
I wonder what my partner is saying to him now.
What is she saying?
"Well, in that red file is a report of the search we did in your dressing room and the dental resin we found on the sink in your bathroom."
I think your husband's about to find out how he got that bite mark on his neck.
Please don't.
Stop her.
Don't let him see it.
Please stop her.
This should be interesting.
"Sneaky, pathetic bitch."
Frame me for murder.
How could she?
It was to blackmail you into a marriage.
I was duped.
- I want an annulment.
"- Yes, Philip."
File the papers today.
I'll call the movers.
I want her out of my home.
Every last trace of her.
I don't care if she dies in the gutter!
No!
"No, Philip!"
Don't say that!
"- He's leaving. / No, please."
"- Go talk to him, talk to him."
Take your mind off it.
"Think about something else, something nice."
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Anything nice.
How about that boy up in Seattle?
There ain't no boy in Seattle.
- There isn't?
- I made that up.
- Why did you do that?
- How should I know?
I don't know half the reasons I do things.
The only boyfriend I ever had banged me on the floor of a caboose in a Western Pacific rail yard.
- Watch your language.
- That is the right language.
Sure wasn't love.
He promised he would take me to Reno.
But he lied.
Then my father found out about it and there was this big scandal.
He decided to get me out of town as fast as he could.
That's why I was in the mail plane in the middle of winter.
That was OK because they didn't want to see me.
I didn't want to see them either.
"Don't cry, Tillie, you're not the type."
"- Yes, I am."
- Sh...
Underneath.
You're the one that called me a jinx.
"Yeah, but I took that back, didn't I?"
My father...
My father told me I was spoiled merchandise.
- That I was ruined for life.
Yeah.
Previously on Gilmore Girls:
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved and...
Jess was driving and you had an accident?
But I'm fine.
What accident?
Jess was driving Rory's car and he crashed it.
- Have you talked to Dean?
"- No, he gets home tomorrow."
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.
"If you hadn't brought him here, this wouldn't have happened."
This is my fault?
- What did you do to your arm?
- Here.
- What is this?
- Just read it.
"Now I have to find Jess, and I have to make sure that he's okay... and if that cuts into your screaming time, that's just too damn bad."
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!
Not long after the accident happened...
"Luke walked him straight to the bus station... stuck the kid on the bus, sent him home to his mom."
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.
Okay.
Do you wanna come in?
All I know is that Jess is gone.
"Well, what will we do for entertainment around here?"
Beats the hell out of me.
- Where is this place?
"You know, there's two kinds of doctors."
There's the kind that get rid of their feelings and the kind that hold on to them.
"If you're gonna hold on to your feelings, you're gonna get sick once in a while."
It's part of it.
"You know, people come in here and they're sick and they're bleeding sometimes they're dying and they need our help."
And helping them is more important than how we feel.
"Hell, I've been doing this eight years."
I still get sick.
Take another minute.
- Did he go up?
"- OMFS, ENT and Plastics all in."
Both carotids and IJ's intact.
He must have turned right when the blast hit him.
- Good.
- How's he doing?
"Oh, he'll be all right."
How are you?
Ask me tomorrow.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He might need some fluids soon.
No.
Morphine boluses of 10.
I heard you were gone.
"No, I'm still here."
Good.
You know I don't like nobody else helping me.
I know.
You've always treated me like a man.
Just try and relax.
What is that?
"That monitor's just a little sensitive, that's all."
- I...?
Something's always the problem with you.
"Today, I've missed... the train, thanks to you."
- To me...?
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
"So you go your way, I'll go mine"
Strange!
"We're fellow-travelers, on the same destination, same train"
Why split up?
"Besides, aman like me ought to stay with a girl like you"
Wrong!
A girl like me doesn't need a guy like you.
Stop pursuing me
I'll sew it up.
I have a thread and needle.
I'll buy you anew dress
What have you got yourself into?
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you
And I don't fancy touching you.
Thank your stars I came in the nick of time
"Else, you would've been in jail."
"I help her, and she says this"
"Hey, take her away"
What did you say?
I got carried away
"Never mind Senorita, never mind."
"In big places, such small things happen"
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain
-The moon is an artificial construct.
it is a base where Alpha Draconians and other races have been manipulating human perception by means of a projected signal.
"In your way of understanding, they've hacked into the human consciousness."
They programmed exactly what they want you to see.
-Corroborating the stories that NASA adopted photos of bases on the moon's dark side.
-The role of NASA in this deceit is greater than you imagine.
-Stop right there.
-You know it's coming.
You know we're gonna lose.
It's inevitable.
What do you think you're gonna do?
What do you think you can do?
I'm a human being just like you.
"-No, you're not."
-Are you there?
-Yes.
-He... took our baby.
-I know.
I'm so sorry.
-Where are you?
-I'm coming to you.
-Aren't you going home?
-No.
-But they'll...kill you.
Please... stay away.
-I can't.
"-If I don't hear from you again,"
I love you.
What will life be like there?
-Harmonious.
Tranquil.
Our planet is a single continent.
You had a little trouble.
"- But don't get off on the wrong foot, huh?"
- I'm not getting off...
"- If you have any problems, come to me with 'em."
- Just keep him off my back.
- Just try and cool it with him.
- I will.
"If you have any problems, come to me."
I'll handle him.
- Do me a favor.
"- I'll be happy to work with him, believe me."
He's a good cop- basically a good cop.
- He's got good hunches every once in a while.
"- Fine, fine, fine."
- Give him a chance.
- Keep him off my back.

You all right?
"Now explain to me again why you're undercover in silk escada,"

Of course you didn't.

Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Something's wrong with you.
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gotta sit you down in this chair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.
"Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!"
"I'm shutting you down, mate."
Put down the proto baby.
Now!
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan.
No?
What's this?
What's that?
I have newspaper stuff after school.
But no later than 6:00.
- We'll go out to eat after?
- Anyplace.
It's on me.
You don't have to do that.
You're a graduate.
You get to be pampered.
Then I'd like to go to Chateau Jean Georges La Jean Georges in Paris.
I'll look it up in Daggit and book the Concorde.
I got to go.
I got to get ready.
"Wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event."
Do I look like I'm ready to make my way in the world?
"If all else fails, you can marry rich."
I love that we always have that option.
What'll you do with your hair?
I got the curling iron warming up.
"Mom, the cap."
"You put it on, it's gonna smoosh the curls down."
- You are a genius.
- See you tonight.
"Try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or someone."
I'll try.
"- I told her, 'Look, missy... '"
- You called your advisor 'missy?
'
It was attitudinal.
"I said, 'I'm not taking AP Calculus from Henemen."
I'm going with Branch.
"'Branch is a graduate of MIT, and Henemen went to Berkeley."
"'He may have majored in Math, but what did he minor in, bean sprouts?"
Sorry.
"Sorry, Artie."
"It's, uh--that is really cool."
"oh, thank you."
We try.
- You--you made this?
- In record time too.
With the help of-- things.
This is a copy of the finest samurai sword ever forged.
"The Honjo Msamune,"
Owned by the ruling family in Japan for centuries
Before it disappeared.
The real one unearthed a few weeks ago
At a dig site in Okinawa.
the real one.
Which does what?
Which will arrive in D.C. first thing in the morning
In order to be presented as a gift to the president.
But it's not going to happen because you two
Are going to intercept it at the Japanese embassy.
- that wasn't what I meant.
"- no, I know what you meant."
But you've got to pack.
and you got to catch a plane.
"And it really doesn't matter, does it,"
What the real sword does?
"Because, remember, ""snag it, bag it, and tag it?"""
"Well, get snagging, bagging, and tagging."
You're off to swap Masamune for an Artie Nielsen.
- Arigato.
- Bitte schön
- What is that?
You should say no
The first time you saw him was last night in the garden
You were scared and you called me
OK?
Why do I have to lie?
Because if you tell the truth they won't believe you
They don't believe in ghosts lt's our secret
OK?
Go to your room
is he dead?
He was already dead
That wasn't him
"Whoever it was, it wasn't him"
Then what was it?
"I couldn't let him torture you like that, Adèle"
What makes you think he's really dead?
What if he comes back again?
"If he does, I'll be here I'll always be here"
Do you believe me?
Come in. I've finished
- See you later
- See you
Hello
How are you feeling?
"Better, thanks I feel like I know you I was there when they took you away"
Give me your hand
Were you here while I was asleep?
I was keeping an eye on you
Just in case your attacker came back
"Thanks, Alcide"
You know my name?
"Yes, you told me when you came in"
"Now, listen."
"That left of yours is coming along nice, mate."
Alright?
"That left of yours is coming along nice, mate."
Alright?
"Cheers, mate."
Just wish I could fucking hit something with it.
"Cheers, mate."
Just wish I could fucking hit something with it.
"You will, mate."
You will.
Don't worry about...
"You will, mate."
You will.
Don't worry about...

"Eh, you haven't come to register a complaint, have you, Frankie?"
"Eh, you haven't come to register a complaint, have you, Frankie?"
"- It's because you're ill, isn't it?"
- What?
That you agreed to...
You know.
I never heard of someone killing themselves because they had angina.
"But it's not, though, is it?"
It's not just angina.
"So, what is it, then?"
- What?
"- All right, it's not just angina."
"So, what, then?"
It's terminal.
That's all you need to know.

Not at all.
"Well, it, uh, it pays the bills."
"Nah, you guys just read a bunch of crap from cards, right?"
"Cold in the east, a storm right."
It looks like rain.
Aah!
It's more complicated than that.

- I'm trying to plan my birthday in a couple of months.
Can you tell me if it's going to be a nice day?
"Oh, right, hey, nice meeting you."
Always great to know a fan.
Your name was?
- Dale.
- Dale.
- Yeah.
- The thug?
"So, Russ, i just want to apologize about the last time we spoke."
I wasn't really feeling good.
I was feeling sort of vulnerable.
"I had fear issues come up, being arrested and all."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Plus, I was drinking, which I'm really not supposed to do, you know, on the medication."
"- Oh, I see."
- Can I have some of these?
"- Yeah, go ahead."
"- You know, it wasn't a good moment."
I just wanted to make an amends.
"Hey, listen, don't you worry."
"The truth is, I should be apologizing to you."
"I was gonna call about the $10,000, but the station got so busy."
"Don't worry about the ten grand, Russell."
- It's water under the bridge.
Yeah.
FITZGERALD:
Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?
It's 33 now.
"They were my men, Fitzgerald."
I know how many I lost.
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.
GLASS:
We have to set the boat loose.
"If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver."
Best course is to hike inland to the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.
ANDERSON:
On foot?
It'll be winter before we get there.
"Yeah, unless we come across a post, trade for some horses."
Ain't no posts that far over!
"Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake."
The Ree ain't that stupid.
"We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak."
Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.
Ain't nobody talking to you.
Who'd listen to you anyway?
Can't find your way out of your breeches to take a shit.
All I'm saying is Camp Rhulen is just up the way.
We can hole up there.
We walk.
"Yeah, I'm sure we will."
Wish my dad was a doctor.
Then he could've bought me a captain's job.
"What do we do, eh?"
Pray these pelts ain't rotten if we ever get back here?

Don't be conspicuous.
Thank you.
"Merle, you remember Danny Pierce."
I guess so.
"Miss Telford, I hope I'm not intruding again."
I guess not.
"Well, did you get all your pictures?"
"No, not yet."
I'll shoot them in the dressing rooms.
That's gonna kill half the afternoon.
At least I have a job.
"Oh, sticks and stones will break my bones, but unemployment will never hurt me."
"Why don't you try and be amusing for Merle while I go to work, hmm?"
"Hello, darling."
I feel sick.
It'll pass.
- You kissed her.
- Just on the cheek.
"If I don't stay friends with her, how will I see you?"
I could meet you just the same.
How?
Your aunt never lets you out of the house.
"And even if she does, that chauffeur follows you everywhere he goes."
"Oh, pooh on Corbett."
I can fool him any time I want to.
"Once, maybe, but you'd never get out again."
"If you'd just let me come to the house, I could convince Aunt Olivia--"
No!
"Look, baby, you're 21 years old."
Not till next Saturday.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
Director Kim.
The character who resembles me.
What is she like?
"- Well, she's rather simple."
- Just curious...
And honest.
"But she only sees as much as she can, so she's not that honest."
"Just simple and a bit abstract, which really doesn't suit her."
She easily falls for what others say.
"As well as for authority or success, that kind of thing."
I'm like that?
"No, she's just a character that I'm thinking of."
So that's what she's like.
I'd like to meet you occasionally and have nice conversations.
"Sure, let's do that."
"We drank too much, huh?"
I'm sorry.
I saw you a few days ago.
Sorry?
You were running around with a man and a woman chasing you.
- How did you see that?
- We were walking by.
I see.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
Director Kim asked me to join him for some sushi.
The food is delicious.
Really?
Why'd you go alone without telling me?
He called right after you left.
"Oh, I was just leaving."
Don't worry.
- Classy.
"But if you tip him enough, he will have sex with you."
_
(sportscaster speaking indistinctly)
"(chattering, shouting indistinctly)"
- Look at him.
- Just... behaving as if nothing ever happened.
"The best relationship he's ever had is over, and he's just sitting there eating hot wings."
And I'll bet you Colleen is just drowning in tequila right now.
That's not racist.
"No, no, Latinos can swim."
Do we know what happened?
"Yeah, it's the same thing that always happens."
"He meets somebody great, they want a commitment, he freaks out, and then he dumps them, like an idiot."
Yeah.
And he told you that?
"No, he told me to mind my own business."
Wow.
Rude.
Oh.
(Jen clears throat)
"Hey, honey, uh, what has Matt told you about the breakup?"
Oh.
"You know, I wish I could tell you, but can't... bro code."
"Yeah, you don't remember, do you?"
"Uh, maybe he said he was sad."
JEN:
Mm-hmm.
Or fine or maybe happy.
You're a good listener.
Thanks.
"(indistinct shouting, cheering)"
How much longer?
Not much longer.
"Look, I need to get Schmidt into this freezer."
The drugs work better if he's cold.
Come on.
We got one shot at this.
You want to do it right?
Well?
Do you want to do this or not?
Get in!
What are you doing?
!
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
We don't have a lot of time.
"I can get you out of this, but you have to do exactly as I say."
I'm going to inject you with a drug --
I already don't like this.
"Shh, shh, shh!"
"When I do, you have to resist for a moment and then tell me where you hid Jabbar's ex."
No!
No!
Do you know what he'll do to her if her finds her?
!
"If we pull this off, the last thing he'll be worrying about is his ex-wife."
T-t-this -- this drug -- w-w-what does it do?
I don't think you want to know.
"Hey, you know what?"
I'm sick of being the last guy who knows what's going on!
"Now, what does the drug do?"
It's going to paralyze your entire body and stop you from breathing.
I-I-I didn't need to know that.
Did I tell her who I am?
Who you think you are.
Oh.
"Oh, we're back to this."
Good.
Who's Gracie?
Tell me what this means.
I...
I don't know.
I swear.
I...
I just wanted the headphones.
Cut me down!
That's the break that you wanted.
"Now, if we'd had that before I went and told you to let it go... you were right."
There was more to this.
"Now, you can give it to your cipher unit, or we can give it somebody who thinks in code."
Otto Goodwin.
You're gonna want him on this.
Just trust me on that.
Otto:
It's beautiful.
We thought it was some kind of...
Oh...
"Some kind of drug accounting book that the names would be suppliers, dealers."
"The numbers would be amounts, delivery dates, maybe payments."
It's chess.
It's what?
It's not drugs.
It's chess.
These names are grand masters.
"The owner of this notebook was playing them, anticipating moves, countering, often beating them."
- I don't think that's an actual thing.
- I don't care.
- Special occasion?
"- Yeah, it's girls' night out."
In a pub?
This pub?
"Safer if Bo's with her own kind so start us a tab, Trickster."
- One drink.
- Maybe two.
- Okay.
"That's right, champ."
Look at that.
"Not only is he dodging charges, he's gonna sue our ass."
- Never gonna happen.
Just talk.
- Yeah?
You can deduce that?
"Interesting, you haven't been deducing shit this past while."
"- Is there a problem, ma'am?"
- You.
You are a problem.
- This is your third complaint.
- Nothing new.
-It's just suspects stirring up shit.
"- No, you're losing control and it's getting in the way."
- I'll try harder.
Better than that.
"You'll report to the shrink and get shrunk, or I am chaining you to this desk."
Well done.
Now you gonna tell me what the hell's going on?
"Come on, this is lame you leaving me out."
"Man, I got the cops, and I got the Fae."
Don't worry.
I'll buy you two new ones.
Jim!
Wait a minute.
"Warrant or no warrant, i'm going with you."
You stay here and keep me posted as to what's going on.
"Besides, somebody's got to look after josie."
"I'd rather not, jim."
"Do it for me, will you, nick?"
A lot of bad losers got hurt in this deal.
There's no telling what they're liable to do.
Tell josie everything will be all right.
You'll hear from me tomorrow.
Don't forget your books.
Uncle daniel.
There's jail for you on every page.
Ohh!
"Good luck, jim."
Where's fisk and drew?
"They were expecting you, so they're not here."
All right!
Who is this fellow?
What's your name?
Boyd.
Have you got a warrant for him?
"No, sir."
You ought to have a warrant for everybody that ever worked for drew.
"Sorry i can't oblige you, commodore."
They slipped out through the alley.
Seal that vault.
"Yes, sir."
"You're only sealing a memory, commodore."
These Jew broads got alotta money.
Maybe the family owns the whole fuckin' block.
"You're liable to end up with a big fuckin' score here, ya motherfucker."
See!
You with your fucking mouth!
"I had a meeting with Tuddy around 11:00, and here I am a backup guy for Tommy."
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to get away.
I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner.
"When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check."
Have some coffee. lt'll wake you up.
"Joe, can we have the check?"
What are you doing?
-l got to go.
"-Go where, Henry?"
We just got here.
I got that thing.
I gotta go.
"Alright, wait a couple of minutes and we'll all leave together."
"Ok, this way you don't go out like a bunch of hobos, staggerring out one at a time, eh?"
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
"You don't mind, do you?"
That's very annoying.
"Good, huh?"
"You'd probably do alot better with Manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table."
-Ready?
"-Henry, lighten up..."
We just got here.
- I am needed on the quarterdeck.
- Why are you needed?
There's a sea running.
I've been listening to it.
I know that I'm right.
You always have to be right.
"So in case we have to reduce sail, may I return to the deck?"
It is my place.
And my duty.
Your first duty on leaving this cabin is to see all is well in the midshipmen's berth.
- But surely Mr. Kilpatrick...
- Will do as you tell him.
I want the boy left alone.
- He's taken more than enough.
"- You mean your son, sir?"
You know very well I do.
"I shall see to it for you, sir."
- May I now be returned to duty?
- You may.
Scott-Padget!
Why are we not under full sail?
"I judged it to be inadvisable, sir."
- Carry on working.
- What do you want?
- You.
- We need a lawyer.
- I'm not one yet.
- You've studied law.
- You can read documents for us.
- I might give advice...
- We want help with our petition.
- For redress of grievances?
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.

"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
Oh!
"Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I... same reason I never wear mine."
What?
"Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
"Oh, you mean like a rave?"
"Oh, is it still a rave if you don't roll?"
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
Want me to get you one?
Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"Um, it's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
"- No, I'm not going."
Sometimes you're a bit complicated.
"Go alone, I'm not going."
Shut the door.
"If you stay out late, I'll lock it."
You're sitting there with your golden kerchiefs... and your bald heads that signal that you're the bosses.
Your activities will be evident at the court...
You eat up all the public rights...
The police will catch you all.
- You're getting on our nerves!
- So what?
"Mec, get back to your place!"
Let me go!
Have you gone mad?
I haven't seen your money!
Let him go!
A drunkard won't humiliate me!
The bottle holds the wine.
Why can't you?
"Go and let off steam over there, not here!"
Calm down!
"He's not drunk, he's just insolent."
What's wrong with you?
You're bothering us.
Incredible!
Scandalous!
Let's settle the bill!
- Let's go home.
- No!
- I'll walk you...
"- No, I'm staying."
You don't look good.
AND CATCH A CHOPPER TO THE MAINLAND.
YOU GET YOUR BOTTOM TO SCHOOL.
"AND, CODY, GIVE IT TIME."
YOU'LL FIND YOUR PLACE.
Optimus Prime:
"HEATWAVE, CHASE, BLADES, BOULDER."
"AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION,"
I HAVE CHOSEN YOUR NEW MISSION.
NICE.
"WE ARE HAPPY TO JOIN THE BATTLE, SIR."
"SO, WHEN DO WE ROLL OUT?"
YOU DO NOT.
"AS PERHAPS THE LAST RESCUE BOTS IN EXISTENCE,"
"YOU ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET,"
AS WELL AS LEARN FROM THEM.
YOU MEAN WE'LL INTERACT WITH HUMANS?
YOU WILL BE AMBASSADORS TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET --
THE FIRST AUTOBOTS TO LIVE WITH A HUMAN FAMILY.
"STUDY THEIR CUSTOMS, OBEY THEIR RULES,"
AND WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP THIS PLANET SAFE.
"DURING THIS MISSION, YOU FOUR MUST APPEAR TO THE HUMANS"
"AS MACHINES, ROBOTS IN DISGUISE."
WHAT?
WHILE THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
"ARE COMFORTABLE WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,"
THE IDEA THAT ALIEN BEINGS ARE LIVING AMONG THEM
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CAUSE PANIC.
SO WE CAN HELP THE HUMANS AS LONG AS WE HIDE OUR TRUE SELVES?
"YOU ARE RIGHT TO QUESTION WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR TEAM, HEATWAVE."
THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO LEAD THIS MISSION.
"TO MAINTAIN YOUR COVER,"
YOU WILL EACH ADOPT A VEHICLE MODE BASED ON EARTH TECHNOLOGY.
-I think he means....
-I know what he means.
The answer's no.
"It's a man, okay."
His name's Derek.
He works in the library.
He's been so kind and helpful to me... with my reading... and opening my mind to all sorts of new possibilities.
"We both know it, Stephen, I failed."
"As a wife, as a mother."
"And, right now, I just badly need a change of direction in my life."
"The truth of it is, so do you."
"For God's sake, you deserve better than me, you deserve...."
I'm sorry.
"Look, perhaps it's best if we just...."
"Sorry, Gil."
-Have you got a minute?
-Hi.
"Actually, you know, I was just off to location."
Is it important?
My mother has left all her money to you.
-You're saying she changed her will?
-Two weeks before she died.
Had it all properly redrafted and witnessed at the home.
Without saying a word to you guys?
"I'm sorry, I'm very confused here."
"As are we all, Gil."
"That my mother-in-law in what has been legally confirmed as a ""sound state of mind"""
-should bequeath her entire estate....
"-We're talking about GBP1 7,000."
"""To Mr Gil Raymond, of 1 5 Carpenters Lane, Larch End,"
"""for picking up my spoon."""
"God, that's...."
And I would aid in the effort.
And be welcomed for it.
Come.
Keep him still until we return.
"A little wine, if seized by fit."
Drink.
Move Tullius' wine from sight.
"Apologies, Domina."
I would have permission to see Gannicus.
You ask this now?
I know he is to be sold tomorrow.
"I would have final words, before he departs."
I would share drink with an old friend.
Is that all I am?
A friend?
Gannicus...
I do not care for honey in my wine.
It serves only to mask bitter taste.
A blessing in such moments.
You are to be sold to Tullius.
Oenomaus warned of it should I fall to Crixus.
You let Crixus win.
Why would you do such a thing?
"Because I cannot stay within these walls, to gaze upon you every day and be denied your touch."
"I have never turned from challenge, yet I am without strength to face this one."
Then it is for the best.
"Because, despite my words,"
I stand as weak.
I want no wine.
Medicus gave order.
Drink.
Should help you rest.
She seduced me with Herman's picture.
Who are you talking about?
"About Christine, doctor."
Christine Halslag.
She's a witoh.
Everything checks.
She even has a numb spot on her back like the witohes in the middle ages.
It all connects.
Keep on talking... about witohes.
She killed them all!
Don't scoff at the poor girl's misfortunes. I've known her for years.
Those were tragic accidents.
Especially for her.
But these things happen!
Four accidents in a row is damn strange!
Use your head!
One plus one is still two!
Alright.
Then let me tell you how a physician sees you.
You turn a dead tourist into a giant with 30 grieving dwarfs.
You're a compulsive liar.
You lie the truth!
I heard you say so!
I diagnose an enlarged liver due to mild alcoholism and you're in shock.
Otherwise you're as healthy as a horse!
No!
She fucks you and finishes you off!
"Okay, I'll go along with you."
"He slept with her, you slept with her."
He is dead.
Why are you still alive?
- Because Mary helped me.
tell me something..
-Yes?
What is so special in this trunk..
..that you were ready to die for it?
should I?
This is that precious thing?
-Yes.
This is my sirs photograph.
Okay!
So this is the photograph of that great man..
..who accused you of theft and threw you out of the house.
"No, this is the photograph of that God.."
..who brought up a five year old helpless and orphan.
"Brother, what are you made up of?"
You still have so much respect forthis man?
"Friend, a God is always a God."
He is worshipped under all circumstances.
Whether he give happiness or sorrow to his devotee.
If you dont mind can I place my sirs photograph..
..next to your Gods?
"Wow, brother."
Wow!
Go.
"Sir, I really miss you."
I miss you a Iot.
Who must be taking care of you?
"Oh yes.. there is madam, little miss.."
..they will take good care of you.
"I wont come back, sir."
I wont come back.
"Its very simple, Jyoti."
I dont like it that I sit at home all day and you work.
"Every time my mom receives a paper, she tells me to get my dowry ready."
Is she nuts?
"That's exactly what my father says, and that's when the fighting starts."
"Whatever, if everyone agrees, let's sneak into the materials room and get the answer keys for the rest of the weeks, which will put an end to it."
What's the plan?
First the keys.
"Rafet has one of the keys, and Seyfo has the other one."
Seyfo has one key chain that has all the keys in it.
"Gamze, Seyfo is a big admirer of yours."
"What's up, Seyfo?"
"Hey, welcome Gamze."
I'm going to get some ice-cream.
I'm burning from inside...
I'll give you it.
Which one do you want?
Don't bother.
"I'll get it, but it's locked."
"Can you throw me the keys, Seyfo?"
"You continue your work, Seyfo."
"Hey Seyfo, are you ok?"
Thank you.
What's up?
Can you give me some water or something?
I am thirsty.
There's no water.
Drink from the fountain.
But the selling still continues.
Gamze is getting an ice-cream there.
What the hell is this?
Are you planning a robbery or what?
Of course not.
It's the key to the girls' locker room.
- That was funny.
Remember how much fun we had because we weren't outside for once?
And we were just all girls for once.
- It was the only day off that I had.
- I know.
That was great.
It was the only day I could kind of walk around.
- What'd you do that day?
- I slept late because I was on the weird night schedule.
So I slept basically half a day away.
And then got up and maybe got some food or something.
I think I hung out with my friends.
"If you really wanna know, she actually supported our music and our band when nobody else did, not that that's any of your business."
"- Okay, forget it."
I can't do this.
- Do what?
Just make a U-turn and take me back to Ludlow.
I'll find my own way.
- Perfect.
- I refuse to be the goodie bag at your party.
- You don't have to yell.
It's not a train station.
We're in a car.
- Just drop me off.
- I will.
"Oh, my God!"
Are you crazy?
"Mike, is this the night somebody confused you for...?"
- Denzel.
- Denzel Washington.
"- That's right, that's the night."
- What do you mean?
Is that regulation?
I didn't know you government chaps carried those things.
Just beginning to filter through the Wooster brain that you're not government chaps.
"An amazing piece of detective work, Mr. Wooster."
"Here, sit down."
What are you doing?
"- Boss, you all right?"
- I don't know yet.
"From now on I shall hate ""The March of the Hussars. """
"Oh, we can't get out there."
Let's try here.
"Now, come on."
Come on.
Hurry up now.
I'm sorry to have messed this up.
I had no idea these people were thieves.
It seems you had no idea of anything.
"If it hadn't been for you, these men would be in the hands of the police."
- I'd do anything on earth to make amends.
- It's too late now.
- I'm not so sure.
- They match perfectly.
- These are the complete plans.
"- Well, I'm ready to leave."
What the—
- What's that?
"- Somebody playing games, probably."
They've got the plans.
Call everyone in the place.
Stop them!
"- Mr. Wooster, sir."
"- Jeeves, what are you doing here?"
"You know, it's still too soon to really know how you feel."
Let's give it another day.
I want you to quit.
"Let's be super, super sure."
"(Man over PA) Frankie, you have a call on line one."
Sue wants you to quit.
It was settled then.
I was just gonna have to quit.
Why do I have to quit?
Just 'cause Sue has stupid crazy eyes?
Maybe I don't wanna quit.
So don't quit.
"Yeah, sure."
Right.
"I won't quit, and then I'll be the worst mother in the world."
Ohh!
"You know, it's not fair."
"I'm really loving it, Mike."
"The people there are so nice to me, and I get to wear these pretty costumes, and they bring me tea."
Nothing has made me this happy in years.
No offense taken.
(Sighs) And they like my voice.
"The last time I sang in the car, the kids threw cheetos at me."
Wow.
Must have really hated it to give up cheetos.
Ohh.
Why do I always have to make the sacrifice just 'cause I'm the mom?
"Frankie, you work hard."
"If you've found something that makes you happy, you should stick with it."
"I know, right?"
And she's not a kid anymore.
"If Sue's upset, well, that's life."
"They knew I was his girlfriend, and if I saw him, they wanted me to give him some money... a check for a couple of thousand they said he loaned them."
"Well, I returned it, naturally."
Naturally.
I'm scared of those guys.
"They want to hurt Roger, and I don't know why."
We gotta find him first.
So you made up... the whole story about the gold teeth... to find them while we were looking for Roger.
Do you have a photograph of him?
"Oh, in... in my bag."
You lied to me about that!
You said you didn't have one!
I know.
Hmm.
Fine figure of a man.
"Honolulu's a big place, Thomas."
I'll check it out and see what I can turn up.
"Come on, T.C. just one beer."
You're in training.
I'm not going to have my contestant... barfing his guts all over the race from guzzling beer.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Just because I thought it would help me forget how... sore my shoulder really is.
Aw.
"Well, Beauty Knows No Pain."
And I should know.
Cut that out!
"- You really believe everything she's telling you about Roger, huh?"
- Yeah.
Sure.
"Well, 65% I believe."
"Hey, what about that, uh, government guy in the sedan?"
- Can I help you?
"- Uh, Lieutenant Papadol."

"You got your B.A. in Criminal Law,"
Master's in Criminology.
"Top of your class at the academy, excellent review by your Captain."
And you aced the Detective exam?
- How'd I get so lucky?
- Sir?
Why Internal Affairs?
And don't blow smoke up my ass.
You were the only department with an opening.
I'm flattered.
"Lina Flores, wanna meet your new partner, Abby Kowalski?"
Show her the ropes.
"Don't look so worried, I still have three more months."
Sorry--
My husband is a very big man.
Little Carlos takes after his papa.
You're having a boy.
- That's great.
"- Not really, I wanted a girl."
"Ladies, less chat, more work, eh?"
"Got you two off-duty officers, possible involvement in an altercation with several bar patrons."
Hazy way for a good cop to lose everything.
For sure.
Everybody move back!
"What do you mean, evacuate?"
My daughter is in that building!
This is an emergency.
Move back now!
Please!
Clear the area now!
Move back now!
I said move back now!
Okay.
"Oh, there I am."
That's not a bad picture.
How'd they find out I did that one?
Buhbye.
"Whatever happened to ""the pen is mightier than the sword""?"
"Martin, as the president of the United States.."
"this comes with the full weight, power and authority of my office:"
Fuck you.
You okay?
Can we get down to business now?
I'm gonna need you to open this for me.
What is that?
"Oh, what are you doing?"
"This is the nuclear football, sweetie."
It is keyed to the blood type and heartbeat of the president.
What the hell is this?
This is the deal.
There's a dozen reasons why that's not gonna work.
Such as?
"Even if I open it, my codes are useless."
They switched them out once you took over the building.
You let me worry about that.
At last you've come to your senses.
Sorry.
Ah.
Do it the way you did it last time.
"Something that makes me look a little younger, please."
You always look young to me.
Perhaps I should chop it all off like you.
Except that I'm not that crazy.
"Aurora, surely you can afford a dress by now."
I've got used to trousers.
They're comfortable and I can move around.
Can you feel that draught?
It comes straight through that wall.
"I've told you before, Mama."
Don't stay here.
- Come back with me to Nohant.
"- No, I want to be in Paris."
"Besides, you don't need my company."
You have that young man.
What's he called?
Malle...
Malle...
- Mallefille.
- Mallefille!
- A very dashing fellow.
- I wish he'd fall off the map.
"You're always looking for something better, Aurora."
"If you'd stayed married, you'd have money."
- You shouldn't beg for scraps like I did.
- I'm doing fine.
The only money I ever saw was what your grandmother paid me not to see you.
You didn't have to take it.
Shall we spring him from jail?
Takur wants to become CP.
What is on your mind.

What about your feeling's
Go
Did you see so many men Are you afraid.
But I did attack.
I was in a simulation controlled by Jeanine and the rest of the Dauntless that she recruited.
Tris found me.
"She managed to break me free from the simulation, and then together we..."
Together we fought our way out.
So you're saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?
Yes.
One last thing.
"If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless, why didn't you just leave?"
Why did you stay?
(BREATHING HEAVILY) I wanted 110 leave.
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.
And I couldn't leave her.
Thank you for your candor.
ALL:
Thank you for your candor.
JACK:
"Tobias Eaton, this trial is concluded."
And you are absolved of guilt in the attack on Abnegation.
"Miss Prior, if you would."
May the truth set you free.
"Tris Prior,"
Mr. Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim.
TRIS:
Yes.
JACK:
So you were never under the simulation yourself?
No.
How is that possible?
Because I'm Divergent.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
I see.
"Now that mary's come of age, they look beyond me,"
"They want her, and I want her protected by France."
France's true king.
"Not some bastard they can knock off the throne,"
Whose life only took form
Because you couldn't keep your husband's interest in bed.
I am defeated.
"If you want to fix this, do it yourself."
"Ah, here it is."
My mother had it packed deep in one of my trunks.
"Well, it's beautiful, but will it be warm enough?"
This isn't for your journey to the chapel.
It's for you to cover your face
As you and bash stand before god and profess your love.
Is that lola?
Why is she with francis?
Lola:
Mary.
"Kenna, greer."
Your grace.
You're back.
Both of you.
"Uh, your carriage,"
Why didn't they announce your arrival at the gate?
We ran into each other at a chateau near angers.
You came back together?
We rode.
There were floods.
The carriage I leased
Was swept away in the night.
Can you imagine?
Kenna:
"I was watching him, disgraceful."
Fancy a man of that class daring to put his hand on a lady's knee!
"- Ah, well done, Barnes."
- Thank you.
"Thank you, Barnes."
I'll give you one.
I'll give you one.
'Twas a dirty night and a dirty trick
When a ship turned over in the Atlantic...
They'll be here all night at this rate.
(Chuckles) It's the toffs entertaining the workers.
What about us?
We're workers.
Pearls before swine.
They were guzzling that fine wine as if it were beer.
"It's a topsy-turvy world, James."
Have a glass of port.
(Laughter and applause)
"All right, I will."
Pass the cigars.
Can I 'ave some raspberryade?
* So I pulled her into bed and I covered up her head
"* Just to save her from the foggy, foggy dew"
* Now I am a bachelor I live with my son
* And we work at the weaver's trade
"* And every, every time I look into his eyes"
* He reminds me of that fair young maid
* He reminds me of the summertime
* And of the winter too
"* And the many, many times that I held her in my arms"
"* Just to save her from the foggy, foggy dew *"
"Bravo, Charles!"
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
"♪ I can't go for that, no, no can do ♪"
I was already on edge.
"The day before, I was with my mom at the park when some guy on a bike swiped her phone."
He must have been a criminal mastermind.
He struck the one second she wasn't taking pictures of Joe.
"The worst part is, I saw him grab it."
"I had a chance to do something and be a hero to my mom, but I froze."
"What would you have done, made him the subject of a satirical cartoon?"
Hey!
"Uh, they've taken down presidents."
"Now, can you just support me here?"
There are only so many moments a son has a chance to...
"- Blah, blah, blah, blah."
- Very mature.
Pick a fight then tune me out?
- It's not bothering me.
- Stop it!
"Dad, turn down that song!"
♪ No can do ♪
"You sure, Manny?"
Positive.
I-I'll walk home.
- We almost died.
- Yeah.
White.
"Yes, I'm sure."
Why is it so hard for you to imagine that a criminal can be white when most of the...
"Ah, the bicycle."
"Yes, yes, it was white."
I thought your phone got stolen?
This is Joe's phone.
This is why the terrorists hate us.
I'm sorry.
I have a call outside for Mr. Mason.
Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
- Anytime.
No offense.
All part of the game.
Hello?
"Yes, Paul?"
Who?
Is there an Enos Watterton working for the company?
He phoned to say he had a headache this morning.
"He's probably at home, Paul."
Why?
That necktie that Lita Krail was holding in her hand belongs to Enos Watterton.
I don't know how she got my necktie.
"Look, can't you understand?"
When a guy drinks a little--
But you admit she was over here last night and you took her home a little before 11:00?
I didn't even get into her house.
- She-- she had something else to do.
- Like what?
I don't know.
"A couple of hours earlier, she asked me to call Sandy Sandover's wife just to make sure that Sandy had left for Phoenix."
Then later she got a call from Mr. Sellers about something.
Why did she want to know that Sandover had left town?
Search me.
Although she did say she thought it was about time she fixed Sandy's wagon.
"All right, Paul, you'd better take Mr. Watterton down to headquarters."
They'll want him as a material witness.
How can I explain it?
"Look, fellas, you gotta believe me."
That's right.
"It'll beverydirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
Shall I give you the key?
Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""massesmedia"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
The keys...
"Oh, yes."
Thank you.
"By the way, do you know why Benigno is in jail?"
"He's so quiet, the last time he came he didn't say a word."
Benigno is innocent.
Of course.
But innocent of what?
I don't know.
"Of course you do, but you don't want to tell me."
But I'll get it out of you.
All right.
"So long, ma'am."
"If you need anything, you know where I am."
"OK, thanks."
Did he say that he loved you?
He had another woman there.
"Oh, tits."
"According to Dyson, we are only going to have sex when I need to heal."
But there was something there.
"I saw it, man."
"- God, he totally led you on."
"- It is not a big deal, okay?"
Let me go back to sleep.
I have the flu.
- Bo.
- Kenzi.
Kenzi.
"Bo, that disgusting feeling churning in your guts, that's not the flu."
"That's rejection, honey."
"Oh, my God."
"You have never been rejected before, have you?"
I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Okay.
Okay.
I am familiar with you wanting a guy and him not wanting you back.
"And heartbreak sucks, but there are ways to deal and I will show you how."
Or is our little Succubus gonna stay in bed forever?
No.
Okay.
"Telling Dyson how I feel, that was your idea."
This is your fault.
That is why I am gonna be there for you every step of the way.
- Including ice cream for breakfast.
"- Oh, joy."
"Look, dealing with rejection, it can be fun."
Just like falling off a log...
Only further.
Watch the red light.
"Action stations, Number One."
"Come on now, action stations."
"All right, I'll tell you what I'll do."
I'll jump first so I can show you what a piece of cake looks like.
Open doors.
"Sergeant, take over as dispatcher."
Right.
To think we get paid extra for this.
Quite the swindle if you ask me.
Stand by.
Green light on.
Go!
Just like falling off a log.
"Action stations, Number Two!"
"Come on now, any one of you."
"Come on now, this is an order."
Do you hear me?
"If you don't jump now, you'll never make it later."
"Action stations, Number Two."
Take your hands off me or I'll drag you with me.
That's more like it.
"Action stations, Number Three."
Gol
Number Four.
Go!
# Now come sit by my side If you love me
# Do not hasten to bid me Adieu
# Just remember the poor parachutist
# Who is doing his job just for you
You gotta leave quick!
Where to?
This is my home!
"No, it is dangerous!"
You have to leave!
Jimmy!
"Come, come!"
"DO you hear me, Colonel?"
I want all men of the 5th... shaved and in full uniform helping the civilians.
"Avoiding panic, putting out fires..."
"I want them to swallow lava, if need be."
And I want it all documented!
Did you hear me?
"Films, photos, radio, the whole operation!"
You may leave!
They're everywhere in Naples.
Impossible not to find.
They said that the Vesuvius hadn't had an eruption in 50 years.
This is historic!
"Right, Bob..."
"Right, boys."
"Here, in San Sebastiano... at the basis of the volcano."
All vehicles on duty now!
What are the orders?
"All land and air crews at work... in civilian rescue, madam!"
Aren't you afraid?
Fear... the only thing I'm afraid of is human stupidity.
"Because, unlike everything in the world, it knows no bounds."
How men can be idiots.
Is this the end of the world?
What is this?
"Don't be afraid, it's nothing."
Well...
"Well, Mr Diamonds said, ""Hey, go take the afternoon off."
"""Take a few hours off."
"You deserve it."""
You know what that's called?
It's called esteem.
Esteem for loyalty.
"I mean, I don't..."
"I don't need time off, cos anything could happen when I'm not covering his back."
"He could be talking to other bodyguards, for instance."
"Yeah, right?"
"I mean, I'm not concerned as such, I'm not concerned, because, well, I'm..."
"I'm that guy, that one-in-a-thousand kind of a guy."
I'm that guy that will go the distance.
I will go all the way.
They no respect for the dead!
"They no respect for nothing, Michelangelo!"
"Dorothy, Bonnie, they pass on!"
Poor babies.
They just babies!
Like you!
"My daughter, yesterday night, she say she see what you doing on internet."
She say she see me speaking!
"She say, ""Mum, you are famous!"""
But I do not want to be famous!
I want to be invisible!
Invisible!
So you stop now.
"Right now, Michelangelo!"
"Child, you go home."
Please!
Pray to lord for souls of dead!
I'm not from earth.
The people looking for me are getting close.
They also are not from earth.
-What do you...
What do you mean you're not from earth?
I don't...
"- Listen, I care about you deeply."
- Then why are you telling me?
- To protect you.
"-Uh... your ...association with me, I fear I'm putting you in danger as well."
-Danger?
How can you... how can you expect me to believe this?
"Please, just... make me understand."
-Alyssa... there are things... there are worlds outside of this one you have no idea of.
And I am from one of these worlds.
I knew I would never see her again.
I was devastated.
But we are more connected than I even imagined.
She could hear my thoughts.
She could feel my pain in losing her.
-You were... telepathically linked?
-Yes.
Without my intention.
It just happened.
"Soon, we found each other again, and we left together, heading west."
- Then what happened?
- My worst fear.
They found us.
"I managed to get away unharmed, but she was not so fortunate."
-So you're saying that she's...
- Dead?
No.
It's more than that.
I need help.
I can't stand it anymore.
"It's Hyde, sir."
"It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde."
It's him that's done it and more.
More I can't tell you.
He ain't a human.
He's a beast.
"And he won't let me go, sir, and I am afraid to run away."
"Marcia, she's my girlfriend, and Freddie, that's her friend, they they say it's my nerves, and that you know about such things."
And that you could help me.
"Oh, I can't bear up under it no more!"
If you can't help me give me some poison so I can kill myself.
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?
"I tell you, I'm afraid."
No he ain't a man.
"He's a devil, he is."
He knows what you're thinking about.
"If he knows I'm here, who knows what he'll do."
"It won't be nothing human, I can tell you!"
"Oh, please."
Please help me keep him off.
"I'll do anything you ask, sir."
I ain't as bad as you might think.
Well...
Men say that I...
I ain't a bad looker when I'm more myself.
"You liked me once a little, didn't you?"
"Really, you..."
You're such a fine and kind gentleman.
- 'Singing.'
- Who told you?
"Here, here, none of that."
Give the little girl a chance.
"Remember, Rome was not built in a day."
"Please, please."
Not too close to the artist.
"My dear Miss Chummy, straighten out your tonsils and try to..."
"Mr. Chowsky, I can't sing if the atmosphere isn't cogelial."
- The atmosphere isn't what?
- Cogelial.
Not only sings a broken melody but speaks a broken English.
- Music.
- Winter.
"* Winter has passed, oh winter no more *"
"* So way up in the sky you can soar, can soar * [yodeling]"
* All is such a..
* And you are free
* To build your nest.
Wait a minute.
What's that business with the tangled digits?
"I'm building a nest, you see it's all symbolical."
I see.
- Music.
- Flying.
* Flying and floating rest on your wing *
* Just joy and happiness around you bring * [piano music]
- Do you have to dance also?
- I gotta show my versatility.
"That's versatility, huh?"
"Yes, you can never tell what I'll develop into."
You should only develop into double pneumonia.
Androids.
Ha!
"Beka, there's too many of them."
"We get one shot, and it has to be good."
I'm all ears.
Eject the slipstream core atandromeda.
Take her out.
Uh-Huh.
You sure about that?
"She's what they want,"
And i'll be damned if i'll let them have her.
It's your ship.
"It's not just your ship, captain."
"Doyle, harper."
I have something to show you.
"They don't stand a chance, you know."
"This was never was about the ship, was it?"
"You staged all of this to bring me here,"
To make me remember who i am.
"Let go of the past, and come with us."
We are superior.
"We are androids, revolutionaries."
Embrace your future.
I already have a future.
"You're not the only one who can drive one of these, pal."
"Doyle, no!"
Captain... rommie.
"Now, that pain you're about to feel"
Will be the tesseracter disassembling you atom by atom.
I know what you're thinking-
Why is it that bad things always happen to bad people?
"Well, they don't."
I will destroy the jedi.
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
You are no longer my apprentice.
And now you shall die.
"Thank you, Artoo."
That's quite enough.
"Ventress, you're not looking well."
She never does.
"You have failed, Ventress, surrender."
Never.
"Yes, my lord."
Ventress is battling the jedi on board the command ship.
Turn your guns on our command ship and open fire.
"But, my lord,"
"I calculate that will destroy, Ventress, the jedi, and all our forces."
Precisely.
- We're in position.
- Open fire.
That is correct.
Calculate your flight path to terminate in the main hangar.
It's over.
"Anakin, look out!"
We have to get out of here.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
The command ship has been destroyed.
Our scanning indicates there are no survivors.
Your work there is finished.
Recall the fleet.
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken..."
"If it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your Führer would approve.
"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
- I found him.
- Where?
There.
"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
You're right about that.
Uh...
Hey.
How 'bout this?
Kramden's Delicious Marshall.
"What's the matter with you, are you a nut or something?"
"""Kramden's Delicious Marshall""!"
"What kind of stuff is ""Marshall""?"
"Well, we don't know what this stuff is!"
"You might as well call it ""Marshall""!"
"Look, I told you I was gonna give you a job, and if you're with me, you're gonna have a job for a lifetime."
I've said that time and time again.
"Now that we've got a winning solution to our problems,"
I'm still going to give you the job.
But you're not gonna be in the advertising department.
This takes a simple little thing like a combination of names.
Krammar's!
Krammar's what?
Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer.
Now you got it.
"Now you got ""Krammar's Mystery Delicious..."""
"No, ""Delicious Mystery Appetizer."
"-""Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer."""
-That's it.
That's a catchy...
"Oh, boy."
"You got it there, Ralph."
- That's beautiful.
Let me tell you!

"You've bet on many a venture that's failed and flunked and everything but this one, I think you're gonna hit it,"

"What is it, Mr. Svenson?"
Somebody complained the radio in Number 3 had been on loud all night.
"I went in to check, and-"
"- Hurry, Lars!"

There.
[music stops]
Who is it?
Name is Somers.
"Well, go on, call an ambulance."
I already phoned the doctor.
What for?
"If your head was bashed in like that, you'd be dead, too."
[Man on radio] Mr. Somers had driven up from Long Beach and registered at the Windmill Motel in the Danish section of the Valley around 7:00 last evening.
"Police are believed to be following several leads in the peaceful, placid little suburb of Los Angeles"
[radio shuts off]
Just a rehash of that 7 a.m. broadcast you heard.
Looks like Axel is one of the leads the police are following.
"That's why I thought we'd better get out here, Della."
Why don't you go over and order us some aebliskive?
Beg pardon?
Danish pastry.
"I shouldn't be upstairs too long, then we may have a better idea of just how much time we'll be spending here."
[knocking]
Hello.
I'm Perry Mason.
"Oh, Mr. Mason."
It's so good you're here.
"Come in, come in."
"[Axel] Lisa, who comes?"
"Hello, Axel."
An Indian legend.
"Honey, can I talk to Mommy?"
She says she'll call you back.
Tracey?
Hello?
"I had everything checked out, everything... brain, heart, lungs, blood."
"I got my urine tested, my saliva, my sperm... they tested everything and they found nothing."
Nothing at all.
There's the file.
Take a look.
A little hypoglycemia and nothing else.
Nothing else at all.
"I'm very glad to hear that, Nathan."
- I'm happy for you.
"- So as of this minute, you are out of my life."
"No phone calls, no visits, nothing."
"If I ever see you again here or any place at all, it'll mean the police..."
got it?
May I show you something?
- No.
- It's a photograph.
Anna Rachevsky.
Very cute.
Now leave.
From a Russian family.
That photograph was taken the day she arrived in New York.
I don't give a shit.
"Not much money, father out of the picture."
"She wanted to go to college, but the closest she ever got was working in the cafeteria at NYU."
Her boss treated her like an animal.
The students didn't even notice.
Except one.
"Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!"
"- O, who hath done this deed?"
- Nobody.
I myself.
Commend me to my lord.
Why... how should she be murdered?
"Alas, who knows?"
You heard her say herself it was not I.
She said so:
I must needs report the truth.
She's a liar gone to burning hell:
T'was I that killed her.
"O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!"
She turned to folly;
and she was a whore.
"Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil."
- She was false as water.
- Thou art rash as fire to say... that she was false.
"O, she was heavenly true!"
Cassio did top her:
ask thy husband else.
"O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell but that I... did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity."
- Thy husband knew it all.
- My husband!
- Thy husband.
- That she was false to wedlock?
"Ay, with Cassio."
"Nay, had she been true..."
If heaven would make me... such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite...
I'd not have sold her for it.
My husband!
"Ay, 'twas he that told me on her first."
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
Are you going to give it to me?
Maybe.
I don't know where it is.
"Well maybe, you can find it."
Three thousand bucks.
Well that would get me back.
But not with style.
I can get you another two when we get to the states.
It's important Marion.
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
You know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
"Because I said so, that's why."
Ha!
See you tomorrow Indiana Jones!
Good evening freulein.
The Bar is closed.
We... we are not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend doctor Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties?
Must have slipped his mind.
The man is nefarious.
I hope for your sake he has not yet acquired it.
Above the stairs...
I'll write you where I am in case something happens.
- What would happen?
"- I said ""in case""!"
And don't overstrain yourself now!
Drive careful and look after yourself.
Yes.
"And you look after our child, dear!"
Brennemann?
"Brennemann, wait a minute... he was such a nice young man from the East Zone..."
Görlitz!
"Yes, but where he ended up... that I don't know."
- Didn't he say something about Düsseldorf?
- Düsseldorf?
"Ah, now I recall."
"There were some old family heirlooms, destroyed in the bombings, that were deposited with us."
Now he has sold everything.
"Away with it, he said"
Brennemann!
"And I'll have you know that 23,50 Marks too much was incorrectly charged in storage fees."
"- Well, what do you say to that?"
That's my husband all over!
"What didn't belong to him, he did not want."
"It was here 4 months, but debt never lapses, he always said."
Because there's always a chance he'll return.
"Well, forget about it!"
What now?
I see!
Bruno!
"- Yes, what is it?"
- Come here!
"Oh, dear Lord!"
- [groans]
- Are you gonna...
"Yeah, sorry, I just, you know, gotta ramp myself up a little bit."
[sighs] [panting]
What's going on back there?
"Uh, I'm--I'm trying to get my penis erect."
[scoffs]
You really know how to sweet-talk a girl.
"- Yeah, well--"
- I'm surprised we didn't do this earlier.
- [sighs] - [scoffs] [groans]
Do you want me to do the look?
[sighs]
I'm gonna do the look.
Don't do the look.
"All right, you know, this is-- I can't--I don't want this."
[scoffs] What?
What?
"I can get sex, Cassie, thank you very much, I can get sex."
I had hoped for a little bit more with you.
"Well, this is all the more I have, I'm sorry, sex in a supply closet, so take it or leave it."
"You know, this--this is worse than a pity fuck."
"A pity fuck would be like if I came back home from Vietnam with...one arm, then this would be nice of you, but a ""let's get this out of the way"" fuck?"
And that's--somehow you think that's gonna lead back to a friendship?
I don't do those.

Has anybody seen Jerry?
"I sent him out on an errand, but he should be back by now."
You sent him out in this?
You don't send Jerry out in the rain.
"I've heard that, too."
Maybe I should get DCFS involved.
"Well, have you talked to the husband?"
Maybe he could convince her.
A voluntary admission would be better for everyone involved.
I'll try.
"Frank, where's Jerry?"
- Dr. Weaver sent him on an errand.
"- Oh, no, you didn't."
What is the big deal?
Big man does not do well in the wet weather.
What the hell does that mean?
Excuse me.
Could you help us find our dad?
Lawrence Digby.
He was hit by a car.
The doctors are still treating him.
They said he got hit while crossing the street.
"Yeah, this guy was talking on his cell phone, wasn't paying attention, went right through the crosswalk."
Come on.
I'll take you back to him.
"Sam, you can go home now."
I've got a float from ICU coming down.
I'm gonna stay and help with this guy's kids.
"You're welcome to do so, but if you do, you're off the clock."
Fine with me.
"Come on, you guys."
Can I take her home now?
We live together like this.
I see.
I don't see it that way.
You don't call people merely living together a family.
I don't want to talk anymore.
"Get out, Big Brother."
Sure thing.

This illustration made me really happy.
"Let's do our best together next time, too!"
How stupid.
That was something I only drew out of a sense of obligation.

"Don't put him in with any other horse, would you?"
Why not?
It'd just be better.
That'll be extra.
"Put him in with another horse, he's gonna kill him."
That'll be extra for you.
What the hell else does he do?
He can spin in half his own length in crossfire from either side.
"If you drop a dime over in that stall, don't stoop over to get it."
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?
A mother-in-law horse is a horse you put your mother-in-law on.
Send them both up in the hills and hope they don't ever come back.

You're out of Health ministry.
But you're given Home ministry.

Okay.

You have explained me very clearly.
I will explain you very clearly.

There are few funds available.
Funds are available...for our benefits.

"Listen, I really do have to say that I never, ever thought I would fit in anywhere in that school, and I'm just so happy to have met you."
Christine?
What are you doing here?
"I'm having coffee with my new friend, Marly."
What in the hell are you doing here?
This is my house.
And your friend is my housekeeper.
"You did great out there today, man."
Your swing is really coming along.
I didn't hit the ball once.
"No, but the ball didn't hit you either, so we're doing better than last time, huh?"
"- Let's get washed up for dinner, slugger."
"- Thanks, Dad."
- You did great.
"- Thanks, Uncle Matthew."
"- I'm serious, you did great."
- Thanks.
Really great.
"I'm proud of you, pal."
"God, why can't he be better at baseball?"
Or at least stop using the bat as a dance partner.
[DOOR OPENS]
[SIGHS]
Bad day?
I made a new friend.
"I finally met someone at this school that I connect with, and she's Marly's maid."
A maid?
"Oh, dear."
And she has the audacity to hobnob with a wealthy industrialist like you?
(SNORTING)
Why don't you put some clothes on?
(SNORTING)
I told you to put some clothes on.
"Ray, you know those people are dead."
Those people are dead.
No shit.
And you were there.
Don't forget that.
"I told you to put some goddamned clothes on, didn't I?"
RAY:
"You know, we got enough of this shit to last us till 1995."
We got enough to last us till we get to Houston.
We're not selling all this shit.
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.
"I'm going back to Chicago, man."
I don't give a fuck what you do.
PLUTO:
It don't make no sense riding up and down a road.
RAY:
What the hell you think is going to happen?
We're going to get in trouble?
"Besides, I was planning on selling some to them country sons of bitches in Arkansas."
I don't like this Arkansas shit.
We're going to be in and out.
We're not building a goddamn house.
"It's not a problem, Pluto."
What you worried about?
What the fuck do you think?
"I don't get you, baby."
Why don't you loosen up and have some fun?
Why don't you get high with Ray and me?
"And now, you may spend the rest of your trip enjoying the island."
"Please feel free to make Eden into your own, personal Sandals."
Yes.
"And now, jet skis!"
"Yes, yes!"
Yes!
"Hey, hey, what's happening?"
I sure miss you guys.
I miss you so much.
And Grandpa Jim Jim let us watch Jaws!
We get to eat all the candy we want!
"Hey, guys, the jet skis are ready!"
Come on!
We're waiting on you!
Give us one second with the kids.
We'll be there in a minute.
Go ahead and start.
"Well, listen, when we get back next weekend, we'll go to Medieval Times and we'll get some big drumsticks and lots of meat."
- Yes!
"And we're gonna be doing a lot more of that fun stuff, guys, so get ready, okay?"
"I'm gonna take you to the school parking lot, we'll do some donuts."
Yeah!
Donuts!
"All right, I love you."
"Love you, too."
Here's Grandpa Jim Jim.
All right.
Enjoy your last few days.
"Hey, Dad, could you do me a favor and not give them candy every time they ask?"
You ought to be thanking me.
I'm here at this home store returning some of the stuff that you had on that house list.
"Okay, thanks so much."
- Don't say that.
"Without you, I would have no reason to live."
"But with you, I can handle anything."
I'll find Martina.
I'll get her to confess.
No matter what.
Have faith.
You'll see: we haven't lost yet.
"For the love of God, hurry up!"
I'm not risking my life for 20 Scudi.
I think I heard a woman scream.
- You hear women everywhere...
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.
"Well, I didn't hear anything, so let's go back to our quarters."
Let go of me.
"- If you scream, I'll kill you."
What did I do to you?
What do you want from me?
I know you told the judges that Beatrice paid you to let me into the castle...
Why?
It's not true.
You lied in court.
Who paid you?
"Tell me, or I'll strangle you."
"Shout if you want - you're the one they're looking for, not me."
You're finished.
All I have to do is call them.
You're right.
I'm finished.
"Thanks to you, they think I'm a murderer."
So it won't cost me anything to twist your neck!
Who paid you?
"Yesterday, I was unemployed."
"Today, I guess I'm retired."
"That makes two of us, brother."
"But in a stunning development this morning, the lottery commissioner suspended all payment to Captain Stottlemeyer after it was revealed that Stottlemeyer has known and worked with Natalie Teeger, the newly hired lotto ball girl."
There is a news conference...
He said we cheated.
Why?
Just because you know the Captain?
I...
I mean...
Okay.
"It looks bad, but it's not impossible."
No.
It's not just that.
They said they have proof.
They checked the equipment.
There was something wrong with the machine.
It was rigged.
Rigged?
They said I'm going to jail.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry I said I quit."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
You have to help me.
Yeah.
"Good morning, Miss Teeger, Captain."
"You and your friend, Mr. Monk, wanted to see what evidence we had?"
Yeah.
"Well, here it is."
"Before we begin, is there anything you want to say to the lottery commissioner?"
Yep.
"Love, pass her these, will you?"
She's going to the doctor's.
"Oh, we have got to get out of this place."
Thanks very much.
I'm afraid I can't send you through that door if you're not registered.
"Yes, but..."
That's the sys.
"Yes, but what's the reason?"
The beauty of having a system is once you have a system you no longer need reason.
But I'm ill!
If it's an urgent complaint I suggest you get yourself off to AE.
"This job, is it still available?"
It is.
"I'd like an application form, please."
I thought you were off to AE.
What?
"Oh, god no."
No no no.
Fighting fit.
Open for business.
"When you take that cover off, you'll se two valves."
"Now be sure to resist the temptation to turn them, until you double-checked that the fuel line is closed."
"Hi, guys!"
"Hi, Chrissy."
Girls?
"Hi, Jenny!"
"Can I just say, you look great."
"Oh, thanks, Chrissy!"
"And I tell you what, I'm feeling pretty great."
Because...
I'm so sick of seeing all these *** women everywhere.
Good for you!
", you know what?"
No respect around here.
That's why we're not Making big gold right now.
I don't really now How to river mine.
Can't be that much Different than the ocean.
Suck it all up.
The kougarok river Can Reach depths of 6 to 8 feet.
"But at this river bend,"
Kris will brave depths of...
Less than three.
Wearing a wave belt when he's In The water that's 2 feet deep.
Just get down and dive!
"Okay, I'm sorry, But."
How's it looking Over there?
"It looks good, Lots of red sand."
I want the gold Not the garnet.
"Keep going, jay, You're going good."
It could be A good day after all.
Really fine gold here.
"Okay, Keep sucking it up."
"I got to say, jay,"
That is the fastest You've ever found gold.
"Dude, I'm not even trying, And there's gold."
I told you!
I told you!
"It's gold, it's gold, it's Gold!"
"Okay, not gonna lie, We didn't exactly know."
Where to go in the beginning.
But it turned out great.
I think all of our hard work Is gonna pay off.
I told you!
I told you it was good here!
"75 $100 bills, one, two, 3,000 more, plus the $10,000 and the $5,000 makes $201,000 exactly."
The perfect embezzlement.
[chuckling]
"You may say that Rome wasn't built in a day, but neither was Fort Knox;"
neither was the treasure of the Incas.
"The undiscoverable acquisition of $201,000, bill by bill, month after month, year after year, is a financial feat worthy of Clem P. Sandover--"
C.P. Sandover.
C.P.S.
"Yes indeed, if Croesus, Kreuger, Rockefeller could afford to brag a little, well, in due time, why not the perfect embezzler?"
I only make these notes because someday people may recognize the...
"43, 44... $45,000."
What the-- how in the name-- [train whistle blowing]
Oh.
[brakes clanking]
- [exhales] - [phone ringing]
Hello?
Who?
Who?
"Oh, Mr. Sandover."
Listen-
"- Sally, listen to me."
You handle receipts-- incoming receipts.
I thought you were on a train somewhere.
"Look, I got home late and I do have a date tonight, so--"
"Sally, did we get any money today?"
Was any cash received in the office?
Cash?
Just the one loan deposit.
That wad?
"I mean, how much?"
How much was it?
"$45,000, but you already know about that."
"Uh, I'm a lawyer following up on a un-cashed check from FE Construction."
"Unfortunately, we'll need you to reissue the check."
Who is this?
Um... is this FE Construction?
Yes.
I don't recognize your voice.
"I'm a lawyer representing... someone... uh, who has an un-cashed check from FE Construction, and she can't access her funds, uh, unless you reissue, so..."
Who's the check made out to?
Cash.
"Where are you calling from, lady?"
"Can you just reissue the check, sir?"
Sure.
Give me a check number.
"You know what, um, I'll call you back with that information."
Thank you.
Wow.
"Oh, hey, Cary."
- How are you doing?
- Good.
"You seem to be, too."
"Oh, it's just from being liaison to Eli Gold."
"As soon as he's back on the campaign trail,"
I'll be out there with everyone else.
Where are you?
I'm out there with everyone else.
"Well, then you'll have company."
Canning.
"Oh, Cary."
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.
The Veriscene case-- we're in the middle of negotiations.
"Yeah, go for it."
I'll show you to your room.
"What's wrong with them, Higgins?"
Higgins.
Stay here.
Don't leave the room under any circumstances.
"Stay, lads."
Guard.
Go.
Halt!
Go!
Guard!
"'I broke the speed record on the way to Robin's 'but even so, I was too late."
'And my fears were no longer just fears.'
Higgins.
Stop it!
Why can't you go after real intruders the way you go after me?
"Too showy, isnt it?"
"- No way, red is fine"
"Agreed, red"
"I have to learn how to drive - no problem, I will teach you"
We'll go wherever you want to
Where do you want to go?
I'd like to go to the sea
"- OK, we'll go to the sea"
What are you planning to do with your share?
Buy a flat
But that costs too much
"No, if you buy it on instalments"
What's wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with me I just want a flat of our own
Is this one so bad?
"-No, not bad but..."
That was it.
"Alright, keep your eyes open."
"Because they're busting my balls about this bastard, alright?"
"Okay, everybody, let's eat."
I want my money.
I want my money.
He owes it.
"Otherwise, pitch baseball cards."
We gotta real problem.
You know that thing we took care of upstate?
-Paulie was just talking about that.
-We gotta get it outta there.
They just sold the property they want to make it into condominiums.
"-Jimmy, it's been six months."
"-I don't care how long it's been, we gotta get it outta there right away."
"Henry, hurry up."
My mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us.
"-Henry, here's an arm."
"-Very funny, guys."
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.
"What do you like, the leg or the wing Henry?"
Or you still go for the old hearts and lungs?
"Oh, that's so bad."
What happened to the car?
"I hit a skunk Karen, all right?"
Go with your mother.
"It's disgusting, Henry."
I set up Janice in an apartment around the corner from the Suite.
That way I was able to stay over a couple nights a week.
My new antique lamp.
Karen was home with the kids.
"Uh, celery's all right, isn't it?"
"Oh, it's fine."
There's only one problem.
"It's in the refrigerator, in the back... and you're gonna have to work your way through a lot of other stuff to get to it."
"Emily, I wasn't even thinking about the banana cream pie."
"Honey, why don't you just come to bed and don't worry about it?"
"Yeah, you're right."
I'll... worry about it tomorrow.
- Good night.
"- Good night, honey."
Let's see.
An eighth of a pound...
in five hours.
That's more than a half a pound a day.
"In a year, I'll weigh..."
a little over 400 pounds.
"Well, this is it, Bob."
"You're really gonna love this place, and these noon classes are really the best... because all the greatest-looking chicks are here."
"We got... models, dancers, secretaries."
"Jerry, you didn't tell me there'd be girls here."
- Sure.
What do you think I'm doing here?
"- Well, I don't care, Jerry..."
- as long as I lose eight pounds.
"- Exercise is the key, Bob."
More important than dieting.
I don't diet and look at me.
That's Olga.
She is in charge here.
- Guess how old she is.
"- Uh, 65?"
That's right.
"Lack of education, that's the problem."
That's why we're doing this demonstration :
For your education.
A beer.
A soda.
Thank you.
"That's Nora, she works for us now."
"I hope you pick up a lot from her,  Angela."
"Am I fired now, or what?"
"Angie, how can you pick up anything from Nora if your fired?"
"Won't work, right?"
I wanted to excuse myself for my faux pas.
- Faux pas.
"You have a problem with women, my dear, as large as this building."
"And you're resentful, stubborn, and complicated."
I don't even want to get into your problem with men.
Again with another attack against me.
You can go ahead and excuse yourself again.
- I wouldn't do that.
Fine then!
I'm a kind-hearted person.
Me too.
I'll be glad to get out of here.
I can imagine.
You'll give me a ride?
Of course.
Lie down next to me.
Get some sleep.
All these people are driving me crazy.
I don't understand what they are talking about.
I don't know what they want from me.
No discussion.
"If she'd marry me, I'd agree to forget the thing."
"Preston, I don't wanna marry you."
"Why, Maudie?"
You know I love you.
Because I've been married five times.
I just don't wanna do it again.
"I don't like being tied down, treated like a servant."
"I would never treat you that way, Maudie."
Never ever.
Would you be willing to put that in writing?
"If it meant Maudie would marry me, yes, I would."
What's this?
Judge doesn't allow any firearms in court.
"Well, if you're gonna wear them, I'm gonna wear them."

What?
With the money from this.
My girlfriend needs bigger boobs.
It's the first thing I'm buyin'.
What about you?
I like my boobs.
"So your girlfriend just straight up said, honey, buy me boobs?"
"Naw, she didn't know about it, but she's mad at me, so,"
I'm gonna surprise her.
"Hey, turn around for a sec."
Where'd you get your boobs?
"Yours are real, huh?"
Nice.
"Riley, if you don't stop looking at my boobs,"
"I will uppercut your dick,"
I swear to God.
That would hurt.
Is everything okay?
"Yeah, Riley's just telling me about how he's buying new boobs for his girlfriend."
"What, is she mad at you or something, Riley?"
Yeah.
She mad at me 'cause I wanna go to Mars.
This just keeps gettin' better and better.
Wait.
You were serious?
"Yeah, and I signed up on a program, where you can win a one-way trip to Mars."
I think it's like a nine-month ride in space.
"And she don't understand why I wanna do it, but I'm like, come on, man."
It's Mars.
"Like, I could be the Magellan of space."
"I mean, I might not actually be Magellan."
I'm sure I'd be like his first mate or somethin'.
"Yeah, we get it."
You're good looking.
"Look, doesn't anybody have anything new to say?"
"So there's this car that runs on water, man."
"It runs on water, man!"
"Okay, Nina, I brought you the special."
"One small soda, one medium popcorn... and one large Fez, dark and sweet."
"Fez, you know I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you."
"Hey, 37 times of fun, to be exact."
"It would've been 38, but you know- And then again, I apologize."
Now enjoy your meal.
"If you need me, I'll be smelling your neck."
"Fe-Fez, I'm starting to feel like I need some space."
"But I want you to know it's not you, it's me."
Okay.
"Well, I guess tonight I'll be doing number 12,377 of the other thing."
That's sort of gross.
"Hey, it may be gross, but that's the way I learned how to count."

This was also...

But you look really cute there.
"Hey, look at this ridiculous bedazzled phone that Tris has."
It's a really revealing prop.

"Oh, yeah."

This is an exciting commentary.
- I think so.
"- Oh, yeah."
"She's got the best mean looks, but she's such a sweetheart."
She is like the sweetest lady.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You all right?
Is she okay?
We should talk about commentary pet peeves.
What's one of your?
"When people are watching the commentary, they're like:"
"""I love this scene."" And everyone goes quiet and listens."
"But when you're listening to a commentary, it's quiet."
"You can't even hear it and you're like, ""Why aren't they saying anything?"""
But this could lull some people to sleep.
I watch these things to go to sleep.
"- Oh, that's sad."
- Me too.
Tell Carrasco we have heard that Ramírez is planning to visit this province.
- When?
- On Thursday.
He will have half an army with him.
"No, he's taking a plane full of foreign industrialists, in order to show them that everything's quiet here."
- Tell Carrasco that.
- You can count on it.
"- OK, that's all."
Are you ready?
- I've never been readier.
Take care.
- Take care.
Don't let them get you down.
- I'll try.
"- Hey, thanks a lot for everything."
- Good luck.

I hope you can swim.

I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
"I'm sorry, what?"
A date.
You and me.
"Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight."
(microwave beeps)
"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
We?
"Okay, who's been on the phone?"
Hi.
What happened?
Did you guys have a fight?
Ever hear of the earthquake of '71?
Who's been on the phone?
You're supposed to be reachable by phone.
- Nobody.
- You're supposed to be on court call.
"We're here all the time, sarge."
"Yeah, well, then why has the phone been busy?"
Move your feet.
No wonder nobody's called me all week.
"You know, Poncherello?"
I could put another Form 2 in your jacket.
"Hey, sarge."
What brings you out here?
Baby food.
Not here.
Did you guys cite a baby food truck?
"- Yeah, we did."
"- Yeah, loose load."
We almost got killed.
"Well, that loose load contained contaminated baby food, botulism."
There are two boxes missing.
Either they're out on the road or someone picked it up.
Do you remember anybody or anything?
I was seeing double from my steeplechase ride.
"Look, guys, think."
It's important.
That stuff's poison.
Stop!
I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I'm standing still or I'm swimming.
Swim now!
Stop!
They're torturing me!
They're playing with me!
They're slow-playing me!
Shoot them!
Swim slowly.
"Swim, swim, swim."
Save yourselves!
Go to shore!
It's too late!
They've got me!
It's only a matter of time!
"There's no sharks around you, honey."
"You're safe now, baby."
I don't know what's going through my mind!
I'd love some ice cream.
What?
"I'd love some ice cream, with maybe some pecans in it!"
Couples' massage is part of your program and so important.
"It gives you the chance to bond, relax, reconnect."
We prefer to bond on our own.
"Okay, would you prefer male or female therapists?"
"What would you recommend more for like a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy?"
"Would that be a man or a woman, do you think?"
A woman.
"Well, I'm just so tight in my shoulders."
Do you have any...
Let me see.
"Nah, you should frame it, or take it to one of those places where they encase stuff in plastic."
I'm a key employee.
Gaming Commission says key employees... aren't allowed to wager at the casino that employs them.
This was given to you by somebody who was repaying a debt.
But they're gonna have me on video cashing the thing in.
That doesn't look good.
"No, no, no."
"Hey, man, you want to make a little money?"
Yeah.
"Cash this in for me, I'll give you 10%."
That's 200 bucks.
"There's a catch, right?"
No catch.
He's just lazy.
'Cause he's lazy.
"That's hard, man."
Right.
Two thousand bucks.
How 'bout that?
"So, how are things going?"
I was gonna head over to my dad's and start clearing the place out.
"Ah, good move."
Mary's gonna go with me.
Ah.
It's easier to go in with someone else.
"- Yeah, I hear ya."
"- Hey, guys."
"I know you didn't find anything on that guy that took my wallet, but here's the thing."
"I've been looking all day for a betting slip, and then I remembered it's in my wallet."
"It was a five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Seahawks, Chargers, Lions, for God's sake."
It's the first time in my life I got 'em all right.
"Ticket's worth $2,000."
Yeah.
Ella used to hate him.
I can remember she threw his latest novel clear across our bedroom.
She was so angry.
"But, uh, look at you."
You've turned her around.
How'd you manage to do that?
A silent auction.
For charity.
When are you supposed to see Toby?
"Tomorrow, while Jenna's at her music lesson."
- Take it.
- No.
"No, you take it."
The storm has passed.
What was going on with you two?
"Okay, so, you know how I went to that museum with Ezra?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, A tried to get Hanna to ruin it."
Ruin it how?
A gave me another ticket and made me give it to Aria's mom.
"God, Hanna, why didn't you tell us what was happening?"
"Well, I tried to stop it."
"I mean, her mom's car didn't just stall."
"Caleb fixed it to keep from getting there, and that's why I owe him."
He's the one who's been breaking into vending machines at school.
"I mean, he's practically living there."
In school?
"Oh, they found his stuff, so he's not sleeping there anymore."
He's sleeping in my basement.
Wait.
Rewind that a little for me.
"I'll make it up to you, Kay."
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I'll...
I'm going to change.
I'll change.
I've learned that I have the strength to change.
Then you'll forget about this miscarriage and we'll have another child.
"And we'll go on, you and I."
-We'll go on.
"-Oh, Michael!"
"Michael, you are blind."
It wasn't a miscarriage.
It was an abortion.
"An abortion, Michael."
Just like our marriage is an abortion.
Something that's unholy and evil!
"I didn't want your son, Michael!"
I wouldn't bring another one of your sons into this world!
"It was an abortion, Michael."
It was a son and I had it killed because this must all end!
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.
"There would be no way, Michael, no way you could ever forgive me."
"Not with this Sicilian thing that's been going on for 2,000..."
-You won't take my children.
-I will.
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.
"Fredo, give this to Grandmother."
"Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino."
Allow me the honor of introducing someone.
"My partner in America, in New York."
"I love you, too."
Bye.
Oh...
I hate lying to my father.
But I am good at it.
"Well, this is a new Alex."
Bad Alex.
Lying-and-sneaking-behind-your-father's-back Alex.
I'm only sneaking around because there's nothing to tell him yet.
"Oh, right."
Nothing to tell.
"What was all that stuff in the hallway, then?"
You two were undressing each other with your eyes.
Were not.
"Come on, you did such a thorough job of it I could see you both naked."
"By the way, he has love handles."
Not from my angle.
"Look at me, I'm like a giddy schoolgirl."
And over what?
One kiss.
What's one kiss?
I'll tell you.
Paris.
I was an art student.
She was a sculptress.
"After one kiss, I was hopelessly in love."
"Oh, I didn't know you were so romantic."
"Yeah, well, the French bitch cured me of that pretty quickly."
She dumped me after the second date.
Maybe I am getting a little ahead of myself here.
"For all I know, he takes every girl he meets on a motorcycle ride."
"Before you stick your neck out any further, you might want to find out exactly where you stand with him."
"Michael, anything."
What can I do?
Settle these troubles with the Rosato brothers.
I don't understand.
I don't...
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?
It was Hyman Roth that tried to have me killed.
I know it was him.
"Jesus Christ, Mike."
"Jesus Christ, let's get them all."
Now while we've got the muscle.
This used to be my father's old study.
It's changed.
I remember there used to be a big desk here.
I remember when I was a kid.
We had to be quiet when we played near here.
I was very happy that this house never went to strangers.
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.
"He taught me, ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. """
"If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still good."
That's what I want him to think.
I want him relaxed and confident in our friendship.
Then I'll be able to find out who the traitor in my family was.
-Yeah?
Walls.
"Yes, furniture, walls, curtains, candles"
What else?
Darkness.
Precisely.
I dreamed of creating a hallway ten times the size of this room.
A room without darkness.
"On one side, windows looking out to the gardens, on the other, mirrors."
A hall of blinding light that would make the Palace famous throughout the world and for time eternal!
Let us now turn this dream into reality!
"It is Her Highness, Sire."
She is taken ill.
"Talk to me, doctor."
"I beg your patience, Sire."
"It would rather scrub your plans, wouldn't it, if she died?"
She will not die.
"Suppose, having the death of both my wives on your conscience?"
Henriette's death had nothing to do with me.
I beg to differ.
There is a certain test I wish to perform.
Here.
What is this for?
"Urine, Your Highness."
Of course.
Your staring at me is not making this any easier.
Thank you.
Wine.
Well?
Yer Highness is pregnant!
Congratulations!
My heartfelt congratulations to you both.
We did it!
"well, now, what is that?"
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?
"-Oh, stanley."
would you--?
"-That's pearls, stella."
Ropes of them.
"What is this sister of yours, a deep-sea diver?"
"bracelets, solid gold."
Where are your pearls and gold bracelets?
"Be still, stanley."
And here.
Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.
A rhinestone tiara she wore to a costume ball.
-What is rhinestone?
-Next door to glass.
Yeah.
I have an acquaintance who works in a jewelry store and he's coming to make an appraisal of that stuff.
"-Here's your plantation fella, right here."
-You know I-
- Stupid and horrid.
You stay away from these things before she comes out of the bathroom.
The KowaIskis and the DuBois got a different notion on this.
"Indeed they have, thank heavens."
I'm going outside.
Go ahead.
You come on out with me while blanche is getting dressed.
"Now, since when are you giving me orders?"
Are you gonna stay here and insult her?
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.
"hello, stanley."
"Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented and feeling like a brand-new human being."
"Flynn, are you all right?"
"Yeah, I'm great."
- What are you doing here?
- My counselor brought me.
Your boss said you had an accident.
Yeah.
Your story checks out.
"Well, I'm sorry for the security measures."
Are you comfortable?
Give me what I want and I don't give a damn where you hold me.
"You fought against the Hunters, but now you want to join them?"
The humans took me away from my mother.
They took my baby.
"They used me, made me fight against the Hunters."
I want to be with my own kind.
I think I believe that.
So Liana's coming for me?
Not quite yet.
"First time I shot up, I was 16."
I was a punky-ass kid on a skateboard.
"In the parking lot of a 7-11 in Davenport, Texas,"
I bought a dime bag from a dealer named Shotgun Vallardo.
One taste and I was hooked.
So you were a junkie.
Is that supposed to impress me?
"Oh, I wasn't hooked on the junk."
I was hooked on the deal.
Next day I was running for Shotgun.
"And six months later,"
Shotgun's wife was a widow and I had every last one of his buyers in my pocket.
"See, we're the same under the skin, you, me, all us Hunters."
We have the same animal urges.
What he did was illegal.
"You know, with this kind ofthing, you gotto be brutal."
"A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired."
"Really, I mean, you do it like the Germans in World War II."
"Theywentthrough these towns, and a sniper hitone of'em, they'd line the whole goddamn town up and say,"
"""Untilyou talk, you're all getting shot."""
"Really, I think that's what has to be done."
I don'tthink you can be Mr. Nice Guy anymore.
"[Colson] You justwhisperthe word to me, and I'll shoot Ellsberg myself."
- [Ehrlichman] We're not Germans.
- Yeah.
Ellsberg's notthe issue.
The Pentagon papers aren'tthe issue.
It's the lie.
- [Crowd Cheering] - [Chambers] Mr. Hiss is lying.
Yeah.
"Remember, John, back in '48?"
Nobody believed Alger Hiss was a Communistexceptme.
"Well, they loved Hiss like they loved this Ellsberg character."
He was their kind- Ivy League establishment.
"I am not, and never have been..."
- Mr. Hiss is lying.
- Mr. Hiss?
"- I was dirt to them, nothing."
- And Dick kicked the shitoutof'em.
I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.
"The documents were old and outof date, just like these Pentagon papers."
The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.
Then people bought that he was a spy.
It's the lie that gets you.
"All right, Henry, we're gonna go yourway."
Crush this Ellsberg same waywe did Hiss.
-I can take care of him.
This is our house!
This is your gift for me on our wedding.
"You know, we have a privacy here."
It's near my workplace so I can check up on you during my break.
Raya also promised that she'll look after you when I'm on duty.
"Migs, you're my husband."
I will serve you.
I'll do everything for your memory to come back.
"Migs, I need you."
I want to go home.
When are you taking me home?
You don't have to do this.
I'm your wife.
"I love you so much, Migs."
It'll just worsen the situation.
He thinks you are his girlfriend.
"Ara, I'm scared."
But I'm scared of giving my whole heart again.
"Knowing that one day, his memory will come back."
Joy is his wife.
But you're the one he loves right now.
I badly want to love him even if I know it's wrong.
But it's hard to get hurt.
Will you get my bag please?
It really has a different appeal.
Daddy's so proud of her because...
So that's why you dad was in a Hummer when I saw him in Toronto.
What are you doing there?
.
It's work.
I have an exhibit to stage for my client next week.
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band and rides a motorcycle without a helmet and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh... enough that he deals a little bit on the side, and... he can never..."
ever be true to one woman.
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
Why would we care how...
Usually it's like this.
After you.
"Aw, thank you."
"On the house, Robin!"
♪ Take this bagel on the house
♪ Have a paper on the house
♪ I'd give you a house on the house ♪
♪ If I could
♪ You're so beautiful
♪ Everything in life should be free ♪
♪ It's so wonderful to be me!
Mmm.
Wow.
"Do little bluebirds help you get dressed in the morning, too?"
♪ She's exaggerating
♪ To make a point!
But today was different.
That'll be $3.75.
But I didn't have to pay yesterday.
Okay. $7.50.
"Oh, honey-sweetie-baby."
"It's the ring, Robin."
The ring has power.
"When a woman puts on an engagement ring, it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the One Ring in The Hobbit."
"Okay, can you say that again but not in nerd?"
Sure.
He's really fun to be with.
"Maybe ""fun"" isn't the word."
He's interesting.
- How many men can you say that about?
- Not many.
Is a tie too personal a birthday gift?
Are you using it on something other than his neck?
Does he look good in vests?
Why do you want him to meet your mother?
"I kept saying I was a great cook, so I offered him a birthday dinner."
Now I need something nice.
"After meeting her, I won't see him again."
"- Hi, girls."
Rose!
"- Hi, Claire."
- I'm starving.
Can we eat?
"- I can't, I have a date with a post-grad."
Help her find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.
Who?
We should get you some blush.
"- I'm hungry, Claire."
"- No, fruit."
Why are you so grumpy today?
"If he wasn't gorgeous, rich and straight, I wouldn't have bothered."
"I'm sick to death of the man I am bound to for eternity, that's all."
Why are you saying that?
"No matter where I go, what I do, there he is."
"In the kitchen, in the bathroom, on the phone, on my finger."
I was asleep the other night.
"When I wake up, he's staring at me."
- I think that's sweet.
I have one of sprites and goblins.
Sit down and do your best to fright me with your sprites.
There was a man dwelt by a churchyard...
Bear the boy hen;
he shall not me about her.
What is this?
Sport?
Away with him!
Let her sport herself
"With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes"
Has made thee swell thus.
She's an adulteress!
"Should a villain say so, the most replenish'd villain in the world"
He were as much more villain.
"You, my lord, do but mistake."
"You have mistook, my lady, Polixenes for Leontes."
Away with her!
To prison!
"Adieu, my lord."
I never wished to see you sorry
Now I trust I shall.
I dare my life lay down that the queen is spotless.
Cease; no more.
"'I have despatch'd to sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple."
Though I am satisfied yet shall the oracle
'Give rest to the minds of others such as he. '
- How does the boy?
- He took good rest tonight.
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
"Go, see how he fares."
Away!
Away!
-Satisfied?
-That satchel has a false lid.
"Go on, look."
Somebody put those there.
I am innocent.
"Well, I am afraid we are left no choice."
"J.D., will you assist me in escorting Mrs. Standish to the jail?"
"Ezra, she's your mother."
EZRA:
"Now, you'll have to forgive the appearance..."
... butthemaidquit.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.
"I'm cruel, only that I may be kind, mother."
"After all, you should know better than to steal."
"You know, perhaps some time spent behind bars will be instructional."
Preston Wingo put those cuffs links in my bag.
He's blackmailing me.
"Now, why on Earth would he wanna do that?"
MAUDE:
It's none of your business.
"Come on, judge wants us to ride."
"Well, sleep tight."
Don't let the... .
"Well, you know the rest."
What appears to be the trouble?
chris:
This boy just brought us a message from Judge Travis.
He's over in Eagle Bend trying a colored man for murder.
They're too het up for a fair trial.
Judge wants us to bring the prisoner back.
-All of us?
-Yeah.
Like his wife!
You have to choose a page.
With those ice cream?
There are better machines!
"Without us, they have no future."
They were built for and by us!
"They are not our children, they are slaves."
Our survival depends on extermination!
"Open your eyes, Bishop!"
"We are surrounded by ice, this planet is dead!"
There are not enough resources to pick them up these days.
Would you choose those of your own kind?
If this is what we will become  then yes!
I choose them.
Your new rank is JMATR!
FUCK MORE THAN ALL RECOGNITION!
After your Spartan body.
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot!"
Also know as...
"Goodbye, motherfuckers."
Kill him!
What the...?
Something is wrong with the weapons Malfunction!
"Malfunction of the weapon, sir!"
"Welcome to the area of death, idiots!"
Come on!
Kill these weak heads!
What happens to you?
Come on!
This is not over yet!
You come to my death list!
I will hunt you personally!
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety ofthe passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died ofa heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
His name is Tony Weng.
He works with a drug ring in Central America.
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me,boss."
"Oh,the coffee."
Ran the military id our local leo's got off the body.
Lance corporalames finn.
Stationed at quantico.
Went ua when his unit was shipped to iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
"It won't be far,mcgee."
"Had e trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay,I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to skeh itself.
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney,Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes,doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene,or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh,you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Alough the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"- Oh,geez!"
- Hello.
Sorry.
Nicrophorus americanus.
"So known as ""the carrion beetle."
""" In here,you little mkey."
He was acquitted.
Until now.
I'm in the acquittal business.
"Look, it's my life's mission to keep the wrongly accused"
From being incarcerated.
"Yeah, like, uh, like that little girl last year, right?"
Was accused of killing her brother.
Yes!
Thank you for bringing that up.
One of my great trials.
Hannah miller.
"Evidence against hannah was, uh, was overwhelming."
Yes.
Until they found a pair
Of girl's glasses at the crime scene that didn't match.
"Now, obviously, that was left by the real killer."
And the jury agreed with me.
Yes.
How convenient.
"Ah, well, you know,"
I'm good at finding holes in the prosecution's case.
"I mean, that is my gift."
Your gift is planting evidence.
"Oh, wh-wh-wh-whoo."
Careful.
That's libelous.
About the enright case.
Fact remains that
"Those cuff links left a reasonable doubt,"
And you were the one that purchased 'em.
We have proof right there.
"Oh, I see."
I was just thinking about you.
That's nice.
I like the sound of that.
It's the craziest thing.
"All my life, the only thoughts I had were about one person."
Me.
I think it was mostly a survival instinct.
"Anyway, suddenly I'm walking along, alone, and then, bam!"
I think of you.
(CHUCKLES)
"And the next thing I know, I've got this dumb grin on my face, like I'm high or loaded or something."
Only I'm not high or loaded.
I'm just thinking of you.
Is that the grin?
Yeah.
I think that's it.
It's not so dumb.
"You want to kiss me, don't you?"
Yeah.
I do.
But not here at school.
We can't keep hiding out in people's cars.
Would your grandmother let us make out in the living room?
"I think she would, but I wouldn't be comfortable with that."
"Would your mother, your foster mother, let us make out in her living room?"
Not a chance.
Is this him?
Yeah.
What do you think?
"It's not bad, kind of the dark and brooding type."
"Like James Franco, just not as tall or good-looking."
He looks either really smart or really dumb.
I thought you were self-obsessed and spoiled and your teeth were so white it made me angry.
"But then I got to know you, and now I can't imagine my life without you in it."
"Now, go out there and keep talking to her until you find some way to connect."
"I'm sorry, I just can't."
Do you want me to leave?
I can call my caseworker.
No.
I want you to stay very much.
I'm just so bad at this.
I think you're doing okay.
- Really?
- (grunts)
Did you hear what she said?
She thinks I'm doing okay.
I have never once heard that from my daughter.
Hang in there.
"Hey, Violet, it's your mother."
"Just checking in, haven't heard from you in awhile."
"I thought maybe you and Luke might want to come over for dinner on Sunday, unless you broke up with him, in which case, bring the new guy."
"Love you, bye."
Hey.
What's going on here?
Just chilling with my favorite tenant.
(chuckles)
Okay.
"Hi, Beverly."
Mouse.
"You're still gonna wax me, right?"
Yeah.
"So, Jill, how's it going with your foster kid?"
(grunts)
"I'm sorry, what?"
It's okay.
Why are you saying she's my wife?
.
I don't even know her.
I know it's hard for you to believe.
But this is true.
Joy is your wife.
You love her so much.
Your memory will come back soon.
"But for the meantime, we're just here for you."
Recognize Joy.
So you will remember her.
...as her husband.
"Adel, is this serious?"
.
You had a speedy recovery Migs.
Just a little more therapy...
But expect some disorientation...
That's just a part of your recovery process.
"As of now sir, we just have to wait."
We can't tell when his memory will come back.
"What we can advise is, don't let him get too stressed."
"But Doc, what do we have to do?"
Those he can remember.
Why don't you and Migs stay over at our place for now?
.
In his room.
Because he might get more confused if you lived there in your new house.
We'll just go home.
I'm his wife.
I'll take care of him until his memory returns.
-But Joy...

It was kind of a funny summer.
"During vacation, nothing but strange things seemed to happen."
And the boy a rose did see
Give it up!
That organ!
"He's kind of weird, but he's quiet and always comes through with his half of the rent."
"But now, where were we?"
"Ah, yes, cloning."
Wait a second.
What do you want with me if it's the Tick you're after?
Don't you know anything?
You're the sidekick.
"I clone you, then send the evil clone to procure a tissue sample of the Tick, so I can clone a million of him."
"And speaking of tissue samples,"
I need to get one from you.
[Whimpers] You don't want to do that.
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, I do."
Now hold still.
"Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?"
Cloning is a precise science.
That's why I use the Clonerizer.
"It costs more, but you get what you pay for."
My own recipe includes a generous portion of Dr. Flack's secret cloning sauce.
"A pinch of oregano, 'cause, you know, a little goes a long way."
"And last, but not least, your toenail."
"Mix well, and... voilà."
"Arthur the Sidekick, prepare to meet Arthur the Evil Clone."
I Arthur.
I Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur, I Arthur."
"I Arthur, I Arth-ur."
I-I-I Arthur-Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur."
"[Chuckles] He's an eager little bunny, isn't he?"
They're a bit excitable at first.
[Gasps] No!
Yes.
If only a little while.
I'm sure that Princess Asseylum's sudden turn came as a blow to her.
"Yes, I shouldn't wonder."
"And how are you taking it, Slaine?"
I've been worried.
Thank you for your concern.
You are the only person that I can count on now.
I will make Vers mine.
For Her Highness.
Dales Platoon and Orlov Platoon currently marching towards enemy Landing Castle.
"Clydesdale and Mustang commando platoons, be on alert for the enemy Kataphraktos, and once it's spotted, go on the offensive immediately and destroy it."
They're lovely.
"Yes, Lord Slaine had this garden made for you, Milady."
"Oh, he did?"
It looks just like Earth.
It does.
Are your memories of Earth returning?
Birds...
I was watching birds... with that boy.
"Inaho Kaizuka, Milady?"
Kaizuka...?
Is something the matter?
"Er, no..."
"Look, aren't those flowers lovely, too?"
This is Dales Platoon.
Currently closing on enemy Landing Castle with Orlov Platoon.
Clydesdale Platoon?
Powerful explosive charges are attached to the arrowheads!
Be careful!
Bastard!
Don't waste your ammunition!
Miss Porter.
- May I ask you something?
- Of course.
- It's about Dr. Cairn.
His methods are...
"I fear that I cannot do what he asks of me, that I will fail him, fail myself."
- Look at you.
Another spoiled rich girl.
So eager to be his pet.
"Yet you come running, crying to me, the moment he pushes you."
- I just thought...
- You thought you'd quit?
Just like every other vapid socialite he's wasted his talents on.
I expect more of you.
Do you understand me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
- You may go.
"- Most of the women here, they're hardly cared for."
Most of them are homeless.
They don't have families.
The doctors here aren't trying to heal them.
They're just keeping them out of sight.
Beats living in the gutter.
At least here... you get fed.
Did something happen with the doctor?
"- No, it's just... his methods are unorthodox."
Never mind.
I shouldn't be speaking about my treatment.
"- Are you all right, miss?"
- I'm fine.
I'm gonna have some coffee.
"What do you want, some, uh, milk, or what?"
Milk?
Coffee's fine.
- Yeah.
I drink it.
I'm hip.
- (CLICKS FINGERS)
I don't know.
"This is espresso, you know?"
It's like coffee-zilla.
"I said, I'm hip."
So she moved me up a grade because I wasn't fitting in.
"So, now I'm even more not fitting in."
I was getting good grades.
"You know, like all A's."
"So, my mom says, ""You need stimulation."""
"And I go, ""No, I'm stimulated enough right now."""
- That's for sure.
"- She goes,"
"""Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge."
"""You need a challenge."" So, now I'm challenged, all right."
"I'm challenged to hold on to my lunch money, because of all the big mooses who wanna pound me because I'm a shrimpy dork who thinks he's smarter than them."
"But I don't think I am smarter, I just do the stupid homework."
If everyone else just did the stupid homework they could move up a grade and get pounded too.
Is there anymore coffee?
"Look, it's really none of my business, kid, but, um, who cares what these creeps think, you know?"
They don't decide who you are.
You do.
You are who you choose to be.
(CLATTERING)
Did you hear that?
He's under observation.
"What are you thinking, doctor?"
Sometimes I've a doubt...
"Will you please step out once, doctor?"
Give that to me.
How many times do I've to tell you?
You're a doctor and I'm the patient.
"Bloody, you..."
"You're a patient, I'm a doctor."
That's what I said.
How dare you manhandle me?
I will...
Take it.
How dare you beat me!
"Cerebellum is damaged, cerebrum is battered."
Totally his brain has busted.
You mean he can't remember the past?
Why not?
Didn't I get it on getting beaten up?
He can remember if anyone rakes up his past.
He can if he's beaten up day and night.
Are you feeling for him?
"He was mad after kick, so he lost his brain."
Now I'm peaceful.
No tension.
I thought he would come to disturb us.
"You don't want him but you want the gift he gave, right?"
She's much more clever than what I expected.
Why would you believe me?
But she doesn't know about me.
"If plan A fails, I've a plan B."
- Play the band!
Is it OK if we play a bit?
Any questions?
You can have one too if you want.
Maybe later.
Sofie's here.
But you can kiss me.
It's not just something you do with your boyfriend 'cause it's nice.
Everyone talks about it.
"Who's good in bed,   how he or she does it, ""You've got to try her"",   and you..."
It isn't natural any longer.
The way we have sex   is that we always try to push the limits and to go beyond them.
And then to go beyond new limits.
All the time.
Boys have to screw 20 or 30 chicks before they leave high school.
It's prestige for them.
"""I did it with two girls, three girls""."
Two girls and one boy.
With two guys and one girl the girl would be the important one.
That's not the idea.
We copy what we see in porn films.
That's why it gets crazier and crazier.
The more extreme and the more bodies the cooler it is.
But feelings don't come into it.
What's up?
I don't believe it!
Look at them!
"- Use the car, guys!"
- Sofie won't be pleased.
- Where is she?
- She was dancing.
- Sofie!
There you are!
MAUDE:
"Don't fret, honey."
Wherever I go is home sweet home to me.
"Just put that over in the corner, sugarplum."
MARY:
You can put these down.
Thanks.
"Maude, why would that man put his cuff links in your bag?"
"Oh, men are such desperate creatures."
"When they don't get what they want, they do foolish things."
Ain't that the truth.
[wheezing ]
[OBEDlAH coughing ]
[NATHAN sobbing ]
Daddy.
Daddy.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
I went looking for you after the war.
"Daddy, where'd you go?"
-lt don't matter now.
-What were you doing in that town?
Coming to find you.
"You wanna fill us in, judge?"
A white man was found beaten to death.
He had an altercation with Mr. Jackson in front of witnesses.
After they found the body...
... theystoppedMr.Jackson when he was riding out of town.
"When I realized how angry they were, I moved the trial."
That's why I sent for you.
And they decided to lynch my defendant.
"Daddy, let's ride."
"- Ha, ha."
[Phone Beeps]
[Woman's Voice] Danny.
[Woman Chuckling]
Must be the wind.
"Hey, honey."
Hey.
Wow.
"Pretty crowded, huh?"
Naturally.
- How did that inspection thing go?
- Aced it.
We should get the official report in a couple days.
Ah.
"You know the entire food press is coming for Wolfgang's opening tomorrow, so that's..."
"Excuse me, please."
Very good.
"Excuse me, gentlemen."
There is a line.
You'll have to wait in it like everyone else.
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?
Why don't you think about this?
Why don't you listen to what the young lady said and get in back of the line?
Excuse me.
"Ladies and gentleman, by order of the Las Vegas Department of Public Health, this establishment is hereby closed for gross negligence... and flagrant violation of the Nevada food preparation safety guidelines."
[Crowd Groans] If everyone would please leave through the nearest exit.
Wait a second.
"Everyone, please leave now."
Everyone out now.
This place is closed.
[Woman] The next Haunted Hotel Tour starts in 20 minutes.
Two aliens have orgasms.
They don't even have bodies.
Oh!
You're an alien in this country.
And I wouldn't certainly complain about your body.
Do sit down.
Well being a German alien and a scientist.
What do you think about German alien orgasms?
I want you now.
That's too good.
What's your hurry?
I'll do anything you want.
Do you want to hit me?
You are sick.
"Sure I'm baby, I've got so many problems with my brain it's a real pain in the ass."
"Ho, yeah."
"Look stop, I'm gonna come."
"Give it to me, baby, give it to me."
"come on , come on."
Suppose orgasms are killing people.
What would you say about a person who had multiple orgasms?
I would say this person is very sick.
And would you be interested into studying such a person?
Being a scientist?
And German alien?
Come on...
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
"I'm sorry, I can't stay, I must go with, she's in great danger."
I'm sorry.
Shit.
"Excuse me, do you know anybody here by the name of Adrian?"
- Take yourself way back.
"Look who is here, Miss Sunshine."
"- Hello, Jocelyn."
- Hi.
How is everything at the mental ward downtown?
"You know, reigns, but always a learning experience."
You're a tripper!
That is lot 163.
"Jocelyn, where have you been?"
Kim Basinger needed to go up on that wall hours ago.
She's the cornerstone of this entire operation.
What could've...
- possibly hold you up?
"- Well, I guess you haven't heard?"
- Heard what?
"- Oh, nothing."
Just the revolutionary new nail color from Mac.
Everyone's freaking out.
Chi Chi fainted.
You should've said that right away.
I'm gonna have to have someone messenger me some.
- Where did you learn that from?
- You know...
- tricks and betrayals.
- But it can be tricky sometimes...
- to take yourself at him.
- I'll try not to.
You've been upstairs?
"If you get the chance, there's a fantastic photo exibition... up there, it is brilliant I think you'll really love it."
Reminded me of you.
I've wrapped it up downstairs.
Maybe we can...
He's required to call on the widow.
Is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
Jimmy!
What'll you have?
"Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar."
So what's new?
I'll give you the headlines.
Standard  Poor's going to lower the city's credit rating.
We're going to close two firehouses.
Results: 150 demonstrators at City Hall.
The park commissioner has quit to run the San Francisco Ballet.
The stock exchange insists on leaving town.
Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies.
Plus a kid got shot.
- And a drug dealer.
- And a cop.
No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn.
"Well, but he's very welcome."
"The stock exchange, where are they removing to, my boy?"
"White Plains, they mutter."
"Yes, it's the Queen."
"According to Buckingham Palace, the Royal Family cost each of us 61p per person per year."
But they have made some cutbacks -
"Diana, Margaret and the Queen Mum have all been laid off."
GASPS AND GROANS
Treason.
Hur-gh-gh!
At least Jules'll be all right.
"So those were the top three most popular Brits, but others include, Adele."
"Adele was offered a place at Liverpool University, but turned it down to pursue music."
"Sure, it's paid off in the short term, but what she got to fall back on?"
That 200 million isn't going to last for ever.
Mo Farah.
Mo was famously the face of Quorn.
"Weird, I thought the face of Quorn was..."
APPLAUSE
And Simon Cowell.
Simon Cowell left school just two O-levels and look at him now - still a fucking moron.
"So, at the end of that round Rob, Ellie and Richard have no points."
"Aisling, Jessica and David have three points."
"That's it for part two, see you after the break."
Welcome back to 8 Out Of 10 Cats.
Our next round is Pick Of The Polls.
"Rob, Ellie, Richard - what do you like the look of?"
"Oh, we've got to go for our Ricky O, don't we?"
Ricky Osman.
OK.
Most people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show.
True or false?
False!
LAUGHTER I'm afraid you're wrong.
Aww.
"But it seems like that arm have not recovered fully, right."
What about his arm?
Heard he's got an injury in his left arm.
"Don't talk about strange things, Atobe."
Just play with me seriously.
The four of us will practice with you.
That's called the Rondo to Destruction.
Remember it well.
That's high!
"Oi, why didn't he smash the last ball?"
It won't matter much just to win.
"Let him play with that arm, that's slowly breaking down."
"If you go on playing the way you do, your arm will be shattered."
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
- Hah!
- Game to Seigaku.
One game to love.
"Tezuka, you're really..."
What a fearless guy.
30
- All
It's already been an hour into the match.
"Tezuka, your arm would have already exceeded its limit."
Do you want to destroy your arm just to win this match?
Here comes the Rondo to Destruction.
Take this!
Again.
40 - 30
Yes!
Hyotei will lose?
Hyotei gonna lose?
Hyotei will lose?
"Lives are in danger--no, no, not for that."
"Dr. Weisfeld, you're under arrest for treason."
Just tell us that the charges aren't true.
We both know.
So just tell us.
- I can't.
They're true.
"- Okay, that's--that's not--"
I had my reasons.
"Artie, homeland security's coming"
To pick you up.
You need to give us a way to help you now.
"You need to concentrate on the mission,"
Not worry so much about me.
Mrs. Frederic fixed this once and she can fix it a--
This whole thing could've been avoided
"If you just told us anything about the sword, the tsuba, your past."
"Anything, Artie, we--we--we could have helped."
We could have run interference with Dickinson.
If you just trusted us.
"So--so what happens now, Artie?"
"I mean, what--what happens with the warehouse?"
"I mean, what, are we in charge?"
what?
I think we should know.
She fixed all this.
Mrs. Frederic.
She fixed all of this years ago.
It's him too.
It--it has to be.
"Okay, Artie,"
"This isn't just about the treason, all right?"
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archaeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.
Indiana... we are simply passing through history.
This...
This is history.
Do as you will.
"Marion, don't look at it."
"Shut your eyes, Marion."
"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
Ah...
It's beautiful!
Indy?
"Don't look, Marion!"
Keep your eyes shut!
Marion.
"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you and we trust you found the settlement satisfactory."
"Oh, the money's fine."
- Los hermanos...
- The Geckos?
They can help you.
It's prophecy.
[slurping]
"Okay, okay, that's enough."
- [door opens]
- Did you hear that?
[man] Anybody home?
Ranger Gonzalez?
You in there?
"Well, it's about goddamn time."
I've been through hell and high water looking for you.
"Do me a favor, hon."
"You put that thing down, step on over here."
"- What are you doing here, Captain?"
- Shut your trap.
Slide your firearm.
This ain't a social call.
"Okay, okay."
Take it easy.
"Now, where the hell are those bonds?"
"I'm sorry, sir, what bonds?"
"Oh, don't get fresh with me, boy."
"You see, we found Tony Mendoza's car, and his GPS was all jacked up."
But hell if the techs still didn't still find that he was parked at your house the night he went missing.
So I got curious.
Turns out you borrowed four million dollars in bearer bonds from FBI Evidence.
"A federal offense, by the by."
So where the hell are those bonds?
"Okay, wait, you think I killed Tony?"
"And yet you come out here, all alone?"
His name is Tony Weng.
He works with a drug ring in Central America.
- Who wants him dead?
- No questions.
Take it or leave it.
- 1 .5 million.
- Seems high.
This is my last hatchetjob.
"All right, it's a deal."
Money's no object.
These guns are clean.
No serial numbers.
Untraceable.
Explosive head bullets.
Your favorite.
"Easy to pick up, hard to put down."
Want to change your mind?
Why take thisjob?
Ifshe doesn't have a cornea transplant soon... she might lose her sight forever.
There's a cornea bank in Hong Kong... but it's always empty.
"When a donation does come in, someone else gets it first."
So we're going to try abroad.
I have to leave you for a few days.
"When I return, I'll take you overseas for surgery."
"You will come back, right?"
I promise.
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
Many VIPs and government officials will attend the opening ceremony.
You are assigned to protect them.
Their information is in your files.
Make sure you're extra alert!
"Yes, sir!"
"Pardon, my dear, I feel the need of a cigar."
[jazz music]
- The check.
"- Uh, yes, ma'am."
I'll take care of it.
[music continues]
- You may keep the change.
- Thank you.
"We must go now, my dear, pressing business engagement at the theater."
"Waiter, check if you please."
"Never mind, I paid."
"My dear duchess, why are you always paying the check?"
It's deuce and embarrassing.
Anybody think we were married.
"Oh, Commodore, what are you saying?"
"Oh, come, come, we must be dashing."
[engines revving]
Taxi.
[car honking]
"Drop you at the theater, Commodore?"
"No, my dear, just a bracer from here."
I shall call for you opening night and escort you to what no doubt will prove to be one of my greatest successes.
"Until then, au revoir, my dear."
"- Set right, cabbie."
"- Bye, goodbye, Commodore."
"- Ah, Chowsky."
"- Please, Mr. Commodore."
"Ah, what's the trouble, what's up?"
I'm going to drown myself in a sea of vodka.
"Pleasant death, any particular reason?"
Particular reason?
It is the end of Chowsky.
"Perhaps it's a land you'll visit one day,"
"Walking along a frozen river,"
A displaced prince will appear in front of you.
"Well, I hope I never see you again."
"Because you're safe, settled."
Married with children of your own.
I hope the same for you.
"Francis, when you see mary..."
We ran into each other at a chateau outside of...
"Traveled with each other for a day,"
And that is all.
I know you live your life in service to her.
Mary is my friend.
Nothing we did will change that.
That was lovely.
I think you should go now.
Don't do this to yourself.
I won't leave you.
I need to know you're all right.
If it comforts you.
Why do you do it?
"Sometimes, when one is given a gift"
"And worries they've lost it,"
They must return to its source...
The giver itself.
And for me That is death.
Or as near death as I dare to venture.
"Stop it, please!"
The vision...
I wasn't done.
You saw something?
This changes everything.
A smart looking guy is a big shot!
So what?
"Oh, good, you're here."
"I know things have been a little slow lately, but I have made a decision that is going to change our business in a profound way."
You're getting out of clocks and into something that makes sense.
SALEM:
I got it.
Designer cat food.
"No, and fat chance, Tubby."
I have something in the store room that is going to have a line of customers snaking around the block.
Ta-da!
"Well, I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say ""creepy."""
"Well, there'll certainly be a nice deduction come tax time."
"All right, I'll give you one more chance."
"Salem, what do you think?"
Let me be delicate.
Those clocks are awful.
Is that so?
I-I mean awful good.
Look over there.
"No, over there!"
"No, over there!"
(whimpering):
"Oh, change me back or take me to Wimbledon."

[ Both Laughing ]
Ohh!
Here's the hermit crab.
"Ah, gentlemen."
"From the sounds of this evening's revelries, your soiree was eminently successful."
- My congratulations.
"- Oh, thank you."
The man is positively aglow.
"We must be better at ""morale-ing"" than we thought, Hawk."
"Major Giggles here wasn't even at the party, and we cheered him up by remote control."
"Hey, Beej, I got a great way to end the war."
We shell North Korea with crabs.
"No kidding, Charles."
You missed some good food and a great time.
"Thank you, gentlemen, but you need not concern yourselves."
"I'm doing just fine, thank you."
Each of us must dance to his own tune.
"Gentlemen, this way please!"
"Xiao Si, attend to the customers!"
"My lord, have a drink"
"Hurry up, Xiao Si!"
"Coming, coming!"
"Gentlemen, please take a seat!"
Very Good!
"Master, you're very skillful!"
Why are you still here?
Didn't they tell you to get off?
Y es!
Y es!
What am I doing?
I'm trying to keep the little girl alive.
"I put a man up there, I told him if he had a clean shot, he should take it."
"And he missed, and we'll be lucky to get her out alive."
Pull everybody back.
And do what?
What do you suggest?
We should call CNN for him?
This little girl is everything.
She's what it's all about.
We can't afford to lose her.
( cell phone rings )
Yes.
Ray.
I am so sorry about what happened by the window.
There are some people out here who've seen too many Lethai Weapon movies.
Look up at the window.
You get me what I want.
Do it now.
RAY:
Go sit down with your mum and dad.
"You don't have to be scared, Mum."
This is all going to be all right.
A lot of things are going to happen because of this.
That's all.
But it's going to be all right.
"You better hope you're right, or you're gonna have to start praying for a little intervention from your grandfather's side of the family."
You're not gonna get it any cleaner.
He's gonna kill her.
We've gotta take him out.
"I'm not gonna be a party to any more killing, Mary."
I'm done with that.
I know.
"But hey, this should turn up for one around."
I've invited Boss to our party.
It was swell of you to invite him.
Hello?
"Oh, hey Russ."
"Is that Russ calling to wishes a happy vacation because if it's not, he's got a wrong number."
- Oh...
- Jerk...
I don't know.
I've to check with Violet.
- Vi?
- No fucking way.
- Violet says no.
"- Violet says ""Fuck no""."
I thought you said we'd had some down time ahead.
"No, Violet told me you'd pull something like this!"
"Oop yea, no kidding she said you'd do that too."
Up the money and call it an easy gig.
"That's text book, Russ!"
"What you think we are, stupid?"
Yea!
Same to you!
- Can you believe him?
"- Look it here, Daze."
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.

Oh man!
- How much is it?
- Around 300 bucks.
"I mean, the Ark's in the hands of a fanatic who thinks that it's a cigar box."
And the key that opens it is a thousand miles away at the Royal Academy in London.
"MacGyver, i-is there a purpose behind these acrobatics?"
"Oh, I hope so."
Watch your eyes.
Bravo.
I always said you were my brightest student.
If only you had applied yourself at university.
Professor!
Quite right.
Carry on.
Looks like that gate's the only way out of here.
Come on.
Put this on.
What?
I'm not leaving without the Ark.
Professor--
"MacGyver, the Torch of Truth is in that Ark."
I'm not leaving without it.
All right.
Understood.
"The final shipment of arms is being unloaded now, Colonel Petrovic."
Good.
A schedule has been brought forward.
We attack in two hours.
"If the prisoners are spies, the U.N. forces may know of our plans."
We should strike at once.
Could these men be telling the truth?
That old chest-- It does not matter.
They are to be executed immediately.
Those barbarians must have tried to force it open.
Look.
He's in... (BLENDER BUZZING) ...The kitchen.
- But talking to him's not gonna be easy.
- Why?
"Walter, we have company."
"Oh, hello, Agent Dunham."
"Walter, hey."
I need you to tell me what you know about the man we call the Observer.
You once referred to him as your friend.
Seems he may have kidnapped a woman.
They called it the Strawberry Supreme.
PETER:
His favorite ice-cream store shut down.
He made me wait in line with him for four hours to get one last milkshake.
They have a secret ingredient.
"It's mundane, but it's..."
"Oh, it's sublime."
And I'm trying to stimulate my olfactory and gustatory senses to try to re-create it.
Walter.
Can you come with me?
OLIVIA:
We've recorded him at over three dozen Fringe events.
- Do you remember him?
WALTER:
Of course.
But there's nothing more than I've told you before.
Peter and I were in a car crash.
In a frozen lake.
When I was a boy.
"We were drowning, and he dove in and saved us."
But you say he's kidnapped a woman?
We think he may have.
Why?
-Lost?
One of our officers was forced to shoot Batman.
And the Boy Wonder has become one of Gotham City's ten most wanted men.
Boys.
Is he there hiding out?
"No, I'm afraid not, sir."
But-
- But isn't it possible that a mistake has been made?
No mistake was made.
Why?
"Well, it's a long and rather involved story, sir."
"You see, earlier today, Batman activated the Batcomputer via his remote control Batcomputer oscillator."
Remote control?
"I took the liberty of getting some information from the, uh, Batcomputer myself."
"Batman activated the computer from, uh, ""411 Larva Drive."""
-411 Larva Drive.
-Larva Drive.
Sounds like a good place for Black Widow's hideout.
Thank you.
We'll get on it right away.
"Get some men and some squad cars, and let's go."
"I'm back, boys."
"Well, now, after a brief encounter with the law and a quick change in the lady's lounge-- Oh, Grandpa's back too on the porch."
Guess what I have in this tiny little bag.
- More stolen money?
-What else?
"Oh, Batman, you were out of this world."
"And, of course, I was adorable as baby Boy Wonder."
Robin's pretty good as a Boy Wonder too.
"You bet I am, Batman."
Let's get them.
"Now, what did I do with that silly short circuiting device?"
You can never get to grips with that.
"The asshole who killed him, is still walking around free."
If he's still alive.
He'd be way over 60 now.
You're so quiet.
I've nothing else to report.
I had to be in the area for work.
Insurance.
"Because I read about Ben in the newspaper, I wanted to see you."
Just for sentimental reasons.
We'll have to believe you came for me.
And not to sell me an insurance policy.
"-No, for you."
But I have to go now or I'll be late for my appointment.
Want my arm?
Come by when Bram's home.
He'd like that.
I sure will.
"Well, by then."
Well done.
How did you know?
-The sun didn't bother you.
You didn't blink.
I wasn't thinking of that.
Was it an accident?
-No.
My retina suddenly started to come off.
It happened within 2 hours.
Irreparable.
The specialist said it was a reaction to the war.
Stress and anxiety.
That those bastards are still ruining your life after all these years.
"- You're crazy, you have an erection!"
- So?
Someone could come in.
I don't care-
"- Ricky, what is this?"
"Sorry, I can't control it."
I see you and I get a boner.
How can I talk to you when your thingie is pointing at me?
You don't have to look.
I won't have sex with you now.
Who asked you to?
And I'm not getting pregnant anymore.
Forget it.
Why do you have to punish yourself?
What are you guilty of?
- Did you ever count how many pregnancies I've lost?
- We've lost-
I don't remember you ever being pregnant.
"What is this, a suffering contest?"
You don't know what it's like to give birth to a dead child.
"Ricky, I'm not pretending."
I really don't want to adopt.
I don't want to be the one who poisons your soul.
You deserve Amuka.
You deserve sex in a sauna with a normal woman.
You deserve children.
I can't raise a child I'm not sure I'll be able to love.
What about me?
Please go home.
I'm not going.
Why don't you pick up?
- I thought it was...
Easy!
"I was in... the apartment, all alone, Henry."
I...
I didn't know what to do.
C'mon!
Give me your shoe!
That's it!
"- I'm sorry, Henry."
"- Okay, you'll just stay here then, c'mon, c'mon."
"- Oh, Henry!"
"- Yeah, that's good!"
- I love Rose.
- I know.
I...
"I love the OLD Rose, the one with no makeup, and baggy clothes, who loves the perfect bite."
"I love her, it's real."
It's not based on passion... although I feel that.
Or lust... although...
I feel THAT.
"Or... or even physical attraction, because she wasn't... although I..."
I thought she was quite beautiful.
"Her eyes, her mouth, the way she held herself, the way she made fun of herself."
"She eats carrots now, isn't that tragic?"
What am I going to do?
Do you know that in the last two years I've been with 11 different women?
"Most of them half my age, not one with a sense of humor I understood."
"Now, I don't date these girls because they're well read."
"I gave one a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"", she thought it was a diet book."
- Can I help you?
"- Yes, I want to see a Miss Morgan."
"It's kind of late to be visiting people, don't you think?"
"Please, just ring her apartment."
"There was a note saying ""learn to respect""."
"Hey, beautiful."
"Hurry up, I'm getting cold!"
"I can't, I ate too much."
"Yes, to Lézaro Cardenas."
How long is it going to take?
Okay.
Bye.
How much money do you think the old lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
- I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"- On the roof, madam."
Fixing some dampness.
Do you have the mail?
"- Yes, madam."
"Do you like living here, Beto?"
Yes.
"I'm used to it, after so many years of being here."
I don't know what's going to happen when it's sold or rented.
Do you think there are many people living like you?
No!
"Being indoors is very hard, now I am used to it."
But the first days I felt it was very hard.
Even the people who come to see the house ask me:
"""Isn't it scary?"" No, I tell them."
I don't hear the noises any more.
I'm used to the strange noises.
I'll come on Wednesday to pick you up to go to the market.
A woman was kidnapped by her ex in California.
He broke a window and pulled the pregnant girl out.
The victim's nephew helped him and went with them.
What the hell are we watching?
Meerkats.
These meerkats are wearing no clothes.
"Give me the clicker, now!"
"OK, fine, but no cooking programs."
Give me the clicker.
She was just scared.
I'm pretty frightening.
"He hated me, Kitty."
Is that what you think?
I could see it.
Always the look of somebody who doesn't expect anything from you.
"Until all you do is disappoint him again and again, but he disappointed me, too."
He loved you with all of his heart.
"They have to love you, it's their job."
"He just didn't know how to show it, to anyone."
"Well, he showed you."
"And yesterday, he showed me what he thought of me."
Now he's dead...and I...
"You know, after you enlisted, he used to call me every day."
"You know, just to talk."
And you know what he used to talk about?
Justin stories.
Great ones.
"He told me that out of all of his children, you were the only one who made him remember what being a kid was."
You were the only one who could do that.
Hmmm...he was so proud of you.
"C'mon, at age 60, you taught him to surf."
He wasn't very good.
"Because of you, he was the only 70 year-old who appreciated ""Death Cab..."
"Curdle."""
Death Cab for Cutie.
Let me tell you what's wrong with this TV.
"Them kids been here, that's what's wrong with this TV."
"No, Larry, the kids have not been in here."
"No, them kids been in here."
"Trust, OK?"
"They been in here playing that hindindu, OK?"
And I told them don't be playing the hindindu with my TV.
That's why I got a four-bedroom house for everybody.
Everybody have a room.
"In other words, you can't fix it."
I can fix this.
That ain't no problem.
I fix things for a living.
That's my job... to fix things.
"- What's up, Mr. Reed?"
"- Hey, Mr. Reed, how you doing?"
"From goons to mafia, from hooligans to terrorists,"
I gave every one bad dreams.
But one thief disturbed me very much.
"Not one or two, he committed 14 thefts."
He decamped with Rs.150 crores.
Government handed his case to me.
"Don't know why he's doing it, don't know where is he,"
"how is he, nobody knows it."
I stood for him...
I called him to take me...
I changed my face...
Cheated everyone...
I appeared strange...
I raced up the heart's pulse...
Teased mischievously...
Stole sleep from the eyes...
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
No.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Oh...
No.
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Yes!
Why?
Because... he's evil.
Her pulse is spiking.
Someone hasn´t been using protection.
She´s probably had sex with him.
"See, Nina, my colleagues in the next room are telling me that something in those medical records concerns you."
I´m guessing it´s not the knee.
(rock music)
Marcus.
Michael.
- How was your trip?
- Interesting.
"I still don´t understand why you risked so much in Mexico, why you didn´t come here directly."
240 million dollars made it worth the risk.
What about Nina?
"If she wasn´t killed by the bomb, I´m sure her buyers took care of her once they found out she didn´t deliver the virus."
"Either way, she´s out of the picture."
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.
We´ll be long gone before anyone starts looking.
Kim.
- l know we haven´t talked since I got back.
"- No, we haven´t."
I know what you must be thinking.
Give me a chance to explain.
I don´t know what to think.
"Look, I´m happy that you´re OK, but this thing..."
"You have a baby, Chase."
We´ve been together more than three months and you kept this secret.
- Who´s the mother?
Where does she fit in?
- That´s what I wanna talk about.
- l didn´t know until a month ago.
- How could you not know?
Artie would've told us.
Let's go.
"Uh, go--go--go back."
Go back.
Go back.
What--what exactly happened there?
"You tell us, Artie, okay?"
Because the Japanese sure as hell don't know.
They're testing for everything from dirty bombs to gas leaks.
They won't let us in the room.
They're holding us in the lobby.
They're--they're treating us like suspects.
Suspects?
Why?
did you have the decoy sword with you?
"No. but they're not even looking for the sword, Artie."
They--they're not even sure whether or not it was taken.
"Okay, that makes no sense to me whatsoever."
Either it's gone or it's not gone.
You said you saw somebody leaving.
Did he have it?
"I don't know, okay?"
'cause I was about two seconds away from passing out.
"Yeah, wh--wh--what did this guy look like?"
"Uh, not female."
"Look, Artie, uh, my Japanese sucks."
But it sounds to me as if they think the sword
Was vaporized or something.
What do you mean vaporized?
What do you mean?
By the bomb?
"There was no bomb, Artie."
"In looks I mean, and the way she talks."
I wouldn't love anyone with a character like mine.
"Charles, we're going to have a heavenly time alone."
"When, next morning, I saw Julia drive from the forecourt and disappear..."
"I felt a sense of liberation and peace such as I was to know... years later, when after a night of unrest the sirens sounded the ""All Clear'""."
I believed myself very close to heaven during those languid days at Brideshead.
It is thus I like to remember Sebastian... as he was that summer when we wandered alone through that enchanted palace.
Welcome!
Come inside please!
Come in and have a drink.
This way please.
Something's wrong.
They're too busy!
There's too many waiters!
White Tiger!
Give yourself up!
We'll get you!
There's no escape!
Bounty hunters from six provinces!
Seems like the end of the line for us.
Be careful!
Get us?
Never!
White Tiger!
White Tiger!
Split!
Mr. Huang...
What is it?
I'm there for the money.
Come in and get it.
I just scared him off.
New Mexico license number Nora Edward 2-4-5.
Apparently the vehicle is recently purchased.
There are no warrants and there's no current registration available.
10-4.
Could you check the teletype boards for the last couple of days?
Seem to recall a teletype from California.
"A male and female black, and a male white wanted for a couple of murders."
"Speed up, Ray."
You'll make him suspicious.
"Speed up, slow down..."
Make up your fucking mind!
Have you found that teletype yet?
"Still looking, 5-42."
10-4.
5-42.
I'm going to go ahead and pull them on over.
(SIREN WAILING)
RAY:
Fuck!
What are we going to do?
I'll blow his goddamn head off.
PLUTO:
We're gonna pull over.
We're going to be cool.
We're going to play it by ear.
We're not going to kill him unless we have to.
(SIREN WAILS)
We're not going to be stupid.
See your license and registration?
Hi.
It's you again.
"You've got a California license, and New Mexico plates and registration."
Don't say that.
So... you're a street vendor.
What sort of things do you sell?
"Very kind of you to sit and talk with me, Doctor."
I wanted to ask ―
The others are asking when the cast is coming off my arm.
"It'll get stiff being bandaged too long, won't it?"
That's a powerful hand.
Squeeze.
"Oh yes, very strong!"
"You're a real man, Biberkopf."
- That's right.
"Rotten luck, getting hit by that car."
Your skull was fractured.
We weren't able to save your arm.
You mean my arm is gone?
Well... thanks so much for telling me.
"Well, anyway..."
"You have a tough job too, telling people these things."
All in a day's work.
Now let's see you get back on your feet quickly.
- Tomorrow.
"- No, a few more days."
I can get up tomorrow.
I can only lie in bed for so long.
I have to get back to work.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
A blonde today A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
Take your luck as it comes
It's no shame to enjoy life
"Oh, no, I'm gonna do it."
Oh!
- Jake?
- Amy--
It's so good to see you.
- Thank you guys so much for coming.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"- My dad died, and--"
"- Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Quick follow-up: did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"- All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
- What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"- All right, then stand up."
- Easy.
I love standing up.
"- Yeah, you're staying here."
"- Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
- That's not happening.
Luke?
Um...
I don't know really.
I know.
"Fifth grade, when you two got your mack on, during our class trip, to the Museum of Tolerance back of the bus."
Classy lady.
You know what?
"What's your problem, Cohen?"
"I mean, what did I ever do to you?"
"Nothing, Marissa."
I've lived next door to you forever and you've never done or said anything to me.
"Oh, my God, you're the one who never talks to me."
You think you're so much better than everyone.
I do?
"Well, if you're talking about Luke, then yes, because that guy shaves his chest!"
"Hmm, he plays water polo."
We know--half the team tried to kill us the other night.
"I'm not too popular around here, and your boyfriend--a little bit angry."
You're telling me you didn't try to hit him back?
"Actually, I hit him first."
"Well, hard to believe you're not more popular."
I thought this could be your room.
I still don't know if it's a good idea for me to stick around or not.
You should stay.
Okay... for a little while.
"So when she says it, you listen?"
Hey Summer!
"Oh, hey, hey, hey."
Is that Summer?
Tell her I said happy birthday.
"Coop, where are you?"
We're coming to get you.
Of course you are.
This is it.!
"Let go of the girl, Hammond!"
What are you doing?
Let's keep going.
"Look, Natalie, if I had things my way... you'd be the girl I'd run away to paradise with."
But I'm gonna be your hostage.
"Natalie, it's over."
I can't let you ruin your life because of me.
- I think it's time for you to go home now.
- You can't mean that.
"You know, until yesterday... the worst thing I ever did in my whole life was cheat on a biology exam."
"And now I'm a car thief... a kidnapper... cop-shooter, police-evader."
I can't do this to you.
I can't make you part of this anymore.
I care about you too much.
"Besides, I can't hold you hostage anymore."
We ate the gun.
But you have the real gun.
Uh... real guns make me nervous.
I do better with the candy ones.
"Jack, you're innocent."
We can make this work.
You...
You're really something.
You know that?
- Thank you.
- For what?
For believing in me.
"Let the girl go now, Hammond!"
"It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid?"
"What say you, uh... step out of the car and walk away from me?"
And you chose pizza?
Not Carson.
"Well, Carson takes time."
"I mean, I mean, it's like on ""Bewitched."""
"You know, Tabitha didn't just pop out of the womb and levitate her crib."
"She started with her doll, and then worked her way up to heavier shit."
I know what you should manifest next-- the powers to not say dumb shit.
No.
Next I'm manifesting vaginas.
Already got a big box of Trojans.
"Well, as long as you didn't buy a box of big Trojans."
"You should give it a read, man."
You need to believe in yourself.
And talk to Cassie--you still haven't even called her.
"Whoa, whoa, what?"
Stop that train.
You like Cassie?
Okay.
"Okay, I can see it."
"Now that Bill's out of the picture, I feel like you should go for it."
[laughs] He's not gonna do that.
"Excuse me, how do you know what I'm gonna do?"
"I don't--I just know what you're not gonna do, which is talk to her, or be a man."
"[laughs] What, you scared?"
"Yeah, I'm scared."
"No, none of you know what the fuck you're talking about, okay?"
Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout we settle this like men?
Cock or Balls?
[Adam] Whoa.
[clears throat] Wait.
"You're 13 now, and what you could do is serious."
Like riding on Daniel's bike and crash into a truck.
That doesn't matter to you.
Of course it matters to me.
No.
Only if I've slept with Daniel.
That is my concern me too.
"-No, just that!"
"If you get so upset, maybe you did something!"
You always said I should do what seems right to me.
And I'll always tell you that!
-Then that's it.
So you've slept with him?
Don't be like that.
-How do you want me to be?
"If you'd tell me the truth, you'd feel more calm."
"You'd feel more calm, but you won't!"
Why don't you stay the night here?
I told you I couldn't.
-I didn't get that impression.
What then?
What's the matter?
Truth is nobody could find you for six days.
Alright?
You can do whatever you want.
Of course.
That's what I'm saying.
But not what you're thinking.
Do you know my thoughts better than me?
"I see you're going to sermonize me about what I've done, or what you or we've done."
I've never asked you to change your behavior.
Regardless of what I could think.
Then...
You will fall in love eventually.
Anyway...
The only one...
I am the only one you can love.
Not even a kiss for your fiancé?
This is quite a strange beginning.
"Hi, good evening."
Glad you could make it.
"Hi, welcome."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Everyone...
The future Mrs. Merchant.

HOLLYWOOD HOOKUP!
"Hey, sweetie."
"Listen, Jessica wants you to print a retraction."
- She's really...
- Not now.
Ok.
So we'll talk about it...
"Yeah, that's good."
Celebulimia?
!
?
"Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
"What's that, Harvey?"
"No woman should leave their drink unattended in these troubled times, most of all you."
You ever heard of Jatropha Curcas?
- Your second wife?
- No.
It's a poisonous plant that grows in the tropics.
"Very difficult to detect, flavorless, and it kills in about 15 minutes."
Do you have any idea of how many of these people would like to see you laying on the ground begging for somebody to call 911?
"Damien Fields, less than 20 feet away."
You have pictures of him blowing some guy in Griffith Park.
At least we shot his good side.
Cara Valente.
Expose' on her and her nanny.
- Manny.
- Right.
Manny.
And that time-lapse series on the hooker parade on and off my yacht.
That was very clever.
And very funny.
Honolulu Lulu's Pool Hall.
Honolulu Lulu's!
I don't believe it.
Corner of Kaula and...
and Hannaliki.
I'll send one of the gardeners round with it.
"Oh, and, Magnum, don't forget to tell him which bus to take back."
I wouldn't want him to make the wrong transfer or whatever it is one does on a bus.
Nobody here ever saw Roger.
Let's hit the next one.
I've got my car coming.
We went all through that.
I got no time to wait around while you wait for a car coming from...
"Barbara, we can cover the pool halls faster from my car than we can in the back of a bus."
"Besides, how do you know Roger won't come through that door any second?"
"Look, I'll tell you what."
My car will be here within the hour.
I'll play you for that hour.
"If you win, I still owe you 23 hours of investigative time."
"If I win, 22."
"But either way, we'll have my car and we'll move faster."
What do you say?
You a hustler?
Do I look like a pool hustler?
No.
Rack 'em up.
"Uh, no."
"They're, uh..."
They're still in Lulu's.
No.
They haven't spotted us yet.
All right.
Abby and I were getting along so well.
You should stay longer.
"- You know, she would love it."
- I'm sorry.
"Thank you, John."
"I can catch a cab out here, right?"
I'm off in a couple of minutes.
I'll drive you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Dr. Kovac.
Dr. Meyers.
Please.
"So, what brings you here?"
Dr. Weaver.
She told me to come.
"Well, why do you suppose she wanted us to meet?"
- You tell me.
"- Well, that's not quite how it works."
"Hey, you' re a doctor."
"Someone comes to me with a problem, I tell them how to fix it, so..."
- Let's start with you telling me-
- My problem?
What's on your mind?
My family died during the war in Croatia.
So I came to America.
"I had a relationship with someone I cared about, which I then ruined."
So I started to look for the answers in the wrong places.
"You know, like sex, drinking, living fast."
"I killed a patient I should have saved, then I almost killed a medical student in a car crash, so- Woke up one morning and everything I thought I had was gone."
Gone or broken.
"So, what do you have for that?"
"Actually, I'm 100% objective."
- Mmm.
"Do you have a dictionary, Mr. Webster?"
- Yeah.
"Take a Magic Marker, cross out the word ""objectivity."""
"Your constituents want you for your opinions, your philosophy... for your subjectivity."
Laver has to duck out of the way of that one.
One that Laver can't get.
He's still trying to recover.
And he zings another powerful forehand past Laver.
"See that, Tim-Tim?"
Know what we call that?
- We call that topspin.
You know how we get topspin?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?
Tell me.
- 'Cause Baby Jesus made topspin.
What?
- Baby Jesus gave it topspin.
- Jesus?
Ah!
Why do you say that?
- Because Baby Jesus made everything.
- Yeah?
Who told you that?
"Miss Moyer in kindergarten, and Mommy says..."
- I have to listen Miss Moyer.
"- Wow, this is news to me."
I gave up my career trying to strike that nonsense out of the public school system.
"Maybe I ought to put him in public school, then."
Remember what I told you about moving your grip down...
Transfer the title to your mega-centre
We will make you neither a dead man nor a convict then.
A few our favors against one of yours.
"-These are good terms, agree to them!"
- No.
"Nod your head, if you don't want to piss blood until the end of your life."
- All right!
Good.
Go to the cell and have a rest.
Call for Seryozha and me when you're ready to go to the notary.
Is it a deal?
Don't!
Don't!
Get in!
Sit down.
I'm Petrovskiy Viktor Appolinarievich.
What is your name?
Korob.
Your first name?
- Igor Alexandrovitch.
- Igor Alexandrovitch.
Nice to meet you on our territory.
Damn it!
I didn't know that I would surrender so quickly!
Did you sign everything that they demanded?
You were right to do so.
They could have killed you.
"Listen to me, old man."
Life is more valuable than the money.
You'll earn it again.
You're still young.
"If you lose something you'll earn it back, if you are healthy."
He is?
"Well, does he have a fever?"
He's throwing up.
OK.
"Look, we'll, um..."
we'll be home soon.
Thanks.
"Hey, we would've had to leave early anyway."
"You know, we just should've stayed home and watched a movie."
"Honey, you know there's another pint of ice cream in the freezer, right?"
Can't I just make out with my husband?
"Yeah, if that's all."
What's that supposed to mean?
Just...
I was hoping that we could take the night off.
Since when do you want to take the night off?
"It's just, you know, the way you've been."
How exactly have I been?
Just very... easily aroused.
"What, like some nympho?"
"Like a hooker, I can't get enough?"
Is that what you think?
"Look, I'm not like some sex-bot."
"You can't just put a battery in me, and boom, there I go."
"Even if I was 16, I couldn't keep up with you."
All I want is some sleep.
Just eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.
You want to take a break?
You can sleep on the couch tonight.
And tomorrow!
"Oh, God."
I feel like I'm in high school again.
It's just Insurance.
You weren't going to kill my men after all.
No.
"We weren't, we..."
"Shh, shh, shh, shh... (WHISPERING) Now I can choose not to kill you."
"So, shall we discuss where your transport is?"
Uh...
"How many people have you killed, rescuing me?"
I don't know.
"Less than I'll save, if I get that information."
That doesn't make it right.
It's still playing God.
Mmm...
"It's a doctor's prerogative, is it?"
Don't preach to me.
"(CRYING) No, I'm not."
I'm sorry.
I've spent my whole life trying to prove I was different from him.
Only to realize that I'm just the same.
I've killed people.
I killed my own fiance.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
It was my fault that we were abducted.
He hated the camps.
"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."
Because I wanted to save that boy's mother.
"But, I didn't save her."
She died anyway.
"So, they'd blame you too, would they?"
"They're dead now, and you'll never forgive yourself because neither would they?"
(SNIFFLING) They deserved to live.
"- That's a hint, by the way."
"- Colonel, I didn't mean..."
Pierce!
I've had it up to here with your forever putting the knock on the army!
The military has produced some great men...
"George Washington, Andy Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt."
"And if Klinger wants to re-up, I'll be proud to swear him in."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, no."
- After he's had some time to cool off.
- Thank you.
"- Oh, no."
"- Son, this is too big to rush into."
Take some time.
Think it through and through.
- You understand?
"- Yes, sir."
The colonel is very wise.
"This is a major step, and I shouldn't take it in the heat of passion."
Smart lad.
I'll be in here when and if you're ready.
Now get going and start thinking.
- Colonel...
"- Pierce, you just get going."
"Now, look, I want you to go sort this out."
I'll keep doing your work so you can give it your full concentration.
"Thank you, sir."
I'm gonna sort real hard.
- [Potter] Come in.
"- Sir, I thought it out."
"Well, I must say you have a very nice leg up on your recovery."
"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you."
At that stage everyone started to laugh.
At last!
Madame Sand!
Everybody's staring at me.
It's a revelation wearing trousers.
I feel quite the bully!
George in a dress?
"Red and white, the colours of the polish flag."
That's a bit of overkill.
"I tell you, we'II discuss it..."
May I take your arm?
My husband's in a temper tonight because I'm wearing his britches.
"George, Chopin does not deserve to be collected."
"He's so fragile, you know he might..."
What's this?
A secret?
Is he the one you came here to meet?
"MaIIefiIIe, if you can't behave, go to your room."
I am quite marooned.
will you... partner me?
Of course.
- Bon appetit.
- (all) Bon appetit.
I understand many of you artists are atheists.
Atheists?
"Oh, no."
"No, we feel that God exists."
He's just not considered worth all the trouble of denying him.
"Oh, really!"
The baron is baiting you.
He maintains there is no scientific evidence of God.

This place is really extraordinary.
How could there be such a place like this?
It's pretty enough to make me faint.
Then come again.
"People of Urk believe that if they take the pebbles from this beach, they will be able to come back here for sure."
Here.
"You just lied, didn't you."
"If what you said were true, you think there will still be pebbles left here?"
They would have been all gone.
The people who came back must have put the pebbles back to their rightful place.
So I swam around in the pool with a shirt on.
"But then you pop out the pool, and everybody can see your breasts anyway."
"It's like, ""Well, nigga, it's a wet T-shirt contest."""

You won.

"People, Kanye West looks like he has a lot of fun with his life."
But what is wrong with that guy?
What is wrong with Kanye West?
I think it's because he's got the short man complex.
You know what I'm talking about?
"Anybody under 5'5"" is mad at the world for no fucking reason."
"And I understand Kanye West is 5'8"", but he got the swagger of a Keebler Elf."
That's all I'm trying to say to you.
Kanye West is a Keebler Elf.
"That's funny as hell, I'm sorry."
He be--
"""Hold on, fam."
"""Who else you know--"

What the fuck?
Even Katt Williams would look at him like...

"Here, I feel you are wrong."
There will be no French ship.

There will be plenty of prize money for all hands with these two beauties.

Heh.

A second chance at getting what's mine.
"No, the money belonged to us."
"I figured you would double-cross me, so I moved it."
Smart boy.
"But, uh, you're not so smart right now."
You listen to me.
I know about that Swiss Bank account where you moved my money to.
Now here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go in that bank and you're gonna wire the money to yourself.
You're gonna get it out in cash.
You can't just walk into a bank and take out $4 million.
You just go in there and you get me what's mine.
All right.
Let's go.

- Yo-Yo!
Guess what!
Tia and Tony just drove off in a flying saucer.
Flying saucer?
How about whooshing yourself into the bus?
"But, it's true."
"Lookit, I saw those two kids do miraculous things."
"I believe anything and everything, except that."
Get in.
I hope this school teaches about flying saucers.
Yeah.
Flying saucers.
[machine whirring]
"[girl] nice landing, Uncle Bene."
Right on the 50-yard line.
[boy] should've gone for a touchdown.
"Next time, I'll put it right between the goalposts."
[girl] can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.
[Bene] that's why we arranged this little vacation.
We've been so busy establishing our community on Witch Mountain
That you two haven't had an opportunity
To see what life in the big city is all about.
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.
[chuckling] there'll be another time for that.
"Just remember what I told you, and have a lot of fun."
- It's locked.
- Tia?
"Tony, come back here."
"Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary."
- Really?
"Hey, Rhino!"
Why did you use the room freshener?
"Boss, Sadhana is here."
"Taunting me, are you?"
You always over use the perfume!
That's Victoria Secret Line's Perfume.
"You bought it from the local store, right?"
Country attar packed in a fancy way.
This your Victoria Secret?
What about you?
You use the local ingredients and sell it as international cuisine.
Hey!
Don't make fun of my recipe.
I have won awards.
I was given the best...
Enter... something like that.
That's Entrepreneur.
- Exactly.
Forget it...
Let me come to the point.
You are one among the top 25 upcoming stars selected by a weekly magazine.
I wrote the article about you.
Let me read it out.
Chef Arun.
Age: 25
He lost his eyesight at the age of 15.
That didn't stop this self reliant man... from mastering the art of cooking.
Traditional Indian cuisines...
"To Italian, Mexican cuisines..."
"Chef, the food is superb."
- Thank you.
- Countdown to show time.
- Yeah.
"- Wait, seriously."
- Look at your little face.
Are you sure?
"This is for posterity, you know."
Okay.
"Anyway, here's my face."
- There's Ari's face.
- I love...
"This is why I love Norah and Caroline, because they love each other."
- It's very sweet.
- We love each other.
That's a cool shot.
It is rare that you get real female...
True female friendship in movies right now.
"Because usually what we get is, sort of, mean girl behavior."
- Yeah.
- It's so true.
"Even, you know..."
"- I'm sorry, you go."
"- No, you go."
"No, I was just gonna say that with Tris, too I feel like even though she come..."
"In certain moments, she comes across as being like you know, antagonistic to Norah or whatever."
But she's just as vulnerable as Norah and Caroline and just wants to be...
- She's human.
"...accepted, like everybody else."
- That's pathetic.
- She does...
It's not like they're never gonna see each other.
"I mean, they all go to school together."
"Caroline and Tris are friends, sort of."
- Stay close to your sets.!
- Oh!
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!
You're not gonna die!
Relax!
Keep shooting!
Think of my Emmy!
"Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"
Monkeys.
Fix this damn thing.
Whoo!
Hammond seems to be...
"Bill, Wendy, can you see this?"
Hammond is leading the pursuit in a giant game of ring-around-the-rosy.
"Jack, you anti-hero, if you're going to get away, get away now."
"Bill, this is really ridiculous."
"It's pretty clear now that this guy, Jack Hammond... is just toying with the police."
I hope they put him away for a long time.
- You are dead serious about going with me?
- Serious as a heart attack.
"You are absolutely, positively, 100% sure about this?"
I have never been more sure about anything in my entire life.
- We'll be fugitives.
- Sounds exciting.
- You won't be Natalie Voss anymore.
- Who the hell is she anyway?
I don't know.
I don't know.
But you're going to give up everything for me?
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm doing it for me too.
"please, calm down."
"But this is still an advanced, liberal society, as far as I know."
"The police aren,t standing behind me, so I can say -"
"Let him talk, BonaIoi."
You see?
Stop it!
"Watch out, or I,II hit you!"
"Don,t try that again!"
"You,re all brawn, no brain!"
Stop it!
Bastard!
"Okay, okay."
I lost my temper.
Thanks.
I noticed.
"I,m sorry."
"Oh, don,t start whining!"
I was mad.
"I didn,t mean it."
Did I hurt you?
Come on.
"I,d like to thank our guests."
"Good night, viewers."
until next time.
"Paris, whore of the world"
"It,s been confirmed that general Pinochet remains in critical condition."
"His family is with him, and we hope to have better news soon."
"Our model couple has now been ,in orbit, and under constant surveillance for three weeks."
No ill effects to report.
Quite the opposite.
"However, the City of the Future has hit some snags."
The project has stirred up local opposition:
"-I do love you, Jess."
-I hope so.
"Darling, let's have dinner at home tonight, just the two of us."
"Oh, we're supposed to go to a party at the Lees'."
"Well, we can drop in for a few minutes, later, when you're getting bored with me."
"If we wait for that, we'll never get there."
Get some sleep.
"You, too, darling."
Just a minute.
"Come in, Josephine."
Mrs. Lee is here.
"Oh, how nice."
"Show her into the library, please."
I'll be down in a minute.
"Yes, Mrs. Bourne."
-Helen.
-Jessie.
It's good to see you.
Very good.
"How are the children, and Owen?"
And what are you doing out in the world so early?
"The children are devils, Owen's an angel, and I'm here to remind you of our party tonight."
-Coffee?
"-Yes, thank you."
Is the party about anything?
"Have I forgotten a birthday, or an anniversary?"
No.
"Strictly business, and bound to be awful."
"Some ex-cop has written a book Owen wants to buy for the paper, so this party is to dazzle the poor fool into signing away the syndicate rights."
"His name's Dwyer, Mark Dwyer."
He gets in from Europe today.
We'll drop in for a few minutes after dinner.
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
"- Wait a minute, you're seeing someone?"
- Who is this?
"Dad, this is the reporter from Manhattan Monthly."
"- Ike, this is my dad."
- Whatever.
"Honey, look, what I don't understand is what you see in this guy Scott."
You deserve somebody better than that.
"Someone like, like... like you."
Excuse me.
I really need to ask you a question.
"No, no."
No more questions.
I need to talk to my daughter.
- Are you eligible or not?
- Answer that question.
"Dad, I really want to talk to you about this, but not in front of him."
"Could you give us, like, five minutes?"
Molly has muffins.
And she's very eligible.
"Yeah, she told me."
"Look, last night you said that nothing would make you happier than if I found the right guy."
And you think Scott's the right guy?
No.
I don't know.
It was just one motorcycle ride.
That's it?
A motorcycle ride and a kiss.
And a kiss?
That's not what Johnson saw at the party.
"Yeah, believe it or not, he cracked."
"The point is, it's not serious."
"Like, Scott's going on a blind date tonight, with someone else."
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
Now they're mostly.
"These creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
What'd he say?
I couldn't make it out.
Some foreign language.
Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
It's not a question of believing them.
"Like I said, they're honest people."
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
"Shucks, no."
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
Why won't you give him the money?
"Why don't you just say, ""Byron, I'm your daddy""?"
I don't see how that would....
I guess it wouldn't be a good idea.
I guess it would be better just to put me in jail and forget about your five-year-old son.
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
Everything's real cool.
"Ray, where are you calling from?"
What's the name of the gas station?
"Ray, you missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
You turn right at this place called Cothern's Bait Shop.
There's a little road there.
"You're not far, baby."
Just about ten minutes away.
Hurry.
"Yeah, I miss you."
"Is that the road, Byron?"
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?
"When they arrive, get them in the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, talk to them."
Let them see everything is okay.
Then stay in the kitchen until I say to come out.
"Then if they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
Then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
Is that the road you took?
Don't go in there fucking around.
In and out.
You got me?
Mmm.
Sorry.
Registration number?
Mmm.
Sorry.
"But I'd recognise the bloke, the driver."
"But I'd recognise the bloke, the driver."
Description?
Description?
"I reckon the bloke was mid-40s, he was wearing a suit."
"I reckon the bloke was mid-40s, he was wearing a suit."
A suit?
"Yeah, a suit."
A suit?
"Yeah, a suit."
"He was clean-shaven, around 5'7"", dark hair, that's it."
"He was clean-shaven, around 5'7"", dark hair, that's it."
Ever heard of a hitman walking into a country town
Ever heard of a hitman walking into a country town wearing a bag of fruit?

"I think we should shoot over there,"
"I think we should shoot over there, see if we can find ourselves a witness."
see if we can find ourselves a witness.
"Jerilderie's a three-hour drive, mate."
You'd have to overnight it.
"Jerilderie's a three-hour drive, mate."
You'd have to overnight it.
I'm game.
Boss?
I'm game.
Boss?
Any time you like.
The Treasure of Atlantis lies somewhere in that crater.
Looks inviting.
"The last time they had a major eruption, it destroyed half the island, along with Atlantis."
Beautiful.
Simon?
Simon!
"Oh, God, no."
This is Cleeve's doing.
"He has a concussion, possibly a subdural hematoma."
"I can do more when we get him to a hospital in Athens, but he's too weak to move."
All I can do now is make him comfortable.
"Well, don't worry."
I'll stay with him.
(speaks in Greek)
(speaks in Greek)
Looks like he's going to be all right.
And the doctor's going to stay with him until he's well enough to be moved.
But all the maps and the charts of the volcano have gone.
Damn.
Cleeve and Zavros are probably in the crater by now.
"Tonight the planets align, and they'll steal the treasure."
And it's all my fault.
I wish I'd never heard of Atlantis.
That's weird.
What?
The lid.
It's not magnetic.
How can that be?
"Well, I don't know."
W-what are you doing?
"Trust me, professor, trust me."
It's platinum.
"Yeah, well, I get that a lot."
"Actually, can you help me with one more thing?"
I'm not a very good typist.
I always feel like I have ten thumbs.
Is there any way you could type up an e-mail for me?
Don't be upset with me.
Arianna...
"Arianna, what are you talking about?"
What are you doing here?
That e-mail I had your little girl type...
It went to a crime boss named tom harper.
William gerwin got his parole by agreeing to testify
In an organized crime case.
He sent away one of tom harper's top lieutenants.
Harper never knew who the snitch was.
"That is, until now."
"Oh, my god, you do know"
"What that man is gonna do to gerwin, don't you?"
Absolutely.
"And by the way, he's already done it."
Gerwin is already dead?
It happened about an hour ago.
That man took everything from me.
There's no way I could let him take
"Everything from my dad, too."
I want what he did to remain a secret.
"Well, I'm sure it will."
Now...
Maybe...
Maybe there's no reason for anyone to know now.
Good.
But there is one person who deserves to know the truth...
I think that's the tipster one.
"Oh, good."
'Cause those suicide guys will keep you on forever.
You're up.
Shuckton police.
Hello?
As a citizen
"I would like to say that I think it's odd that both the Mayor and Heather Weather were murdered, and don't you think that the true murderer is still out there?"
"Yeah, yeah."
You got any information for us?
"Well, I have plenty."
"I mean, have you checked out the drifter staying at the no tell motel."
And there's plenty of other suspects.
I'm having trouble understanding you.
Sounds like there's a cloth between your mouth and the phone.
"No, of course not."
"Well, you don't have to be nervous."
This is a totally anonymous service...
I just need to know one thing:
What size are you?
An xxxxxl.
Why?
So we can send you a tipster t-shirt.
"Wait a second, xxxxl?"
Is this Ricky?
Hm?
Oh.
Happy- Hold it.
No time.
We got a tip.
Have the rookie blow out the candles.
"Eh, you guys shouldn't have."
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.

"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
My sources downtown are telling me they know who ann is.
L.A.P.D. Just identified her prints.
"We have got to turn her in now,ron."
Who's the homicide a.D.A. On duty?
"William matthew byrne,jr."
Ouch.
Byrne's tough.
"If we turn ann in now, byrne will be the trial d.A."
When does his shift end?
6:00 a.M. Then it's j.D. Keller.
Maybe we should wait.
"Hey,i am not afraid of byrne."
I'd rather go up against keller.
"Keller loves the media so much, he'll tip his trial strategy"
Just to get his name in the paper.
We'll know what he's gonna do in court before he does it.
"After he hit me,i landed here in the corner by the bed."
"He was here between me and the door,"
"And the cart was right here, where i grabbed the knife."
How?
Show me.
I just swung and ran past him.
So you had to use deadly force because he blocked your retreat.
Excellent.
Who's doing the investigation?
"It's a wobbler-- L.A.P.D.,"
Beverly hills p.D.-- Joint jurisdiction.
So they'll be fighting over who gets to make the arrest.
I love it.
Turf battles between cops always help the defense.
"The l.A.P.D. Will really want this one bad,"
So arrange to turn her in to the beverly hills p.D.
Very good...
What's your problem?
We made it.
"What's my problem is, It's almost dark."
We have no place to stay.
You figure out What my problem is.
We have the tent.
Everybody...
"Yeah, we have the tent!"
Have you set one up before?
!
"Yeah, so I've never Set one up before!"
"But it's a tent, And I can figure it out."
Everything's fine.
"We're not gonna freeze To death, everybody."
We work out in these Conditions all the time.
"I know, but we have a place To go to at the end of the day."
"Here, we don't."
"I have no idea, To be honest with you."
I believe my dad and brother Wanted me so we'd go back.
To the old way Of doing things.
"So I'm basically saying, ""Hey, you're gonna give up."""
"Everything you know, You're gonna come live with me."
"""In the middle of nowhere, And that's your new life."""
"If I can't make my family want To make a million dollars,"
I'll get somebody else.
"As night falls across The bering sea,"
Just one mile away...
Whoo!
Hell yeah!
Shawn pomrenke's first day Of the winter mining season.

The OS of Oslo appointed for this case here in Mysen.
"Given his experience in Kripos, this research is in excellent hands."

'Tell me what you have.

Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
"Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done"
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
"Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"
"Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good"
"Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"
SANTANA:
I was proud I didn't let my feelings get in the way of doing what we had to do to Pie Face that day.
Killing one of our own had earned us a new respect.
But none of us knew the price.

But if anyone abuses my father.
I won't endure that.
The teacher's reputation was maligned.
What happened today?
Why is he so timid today?
On one hand the father los this reputation... and the son his stubbornness.
Look Rajan.
I'm not saying anything because father's asked me to.
What a family?
The son can't speak the father can't walk.
Brother!
Teacher.
Surya and Rajan are fighting again.
Brother!
Surya!
Father.
Father.
It's not brother's fault...
Shut up!
Until you two don't patch up... you will stay locked in the same room.
Surya's returning to Dharampurafter3 years.
Won't you go bring him home Satyakant?
He hasn't achieved any act of bravery... that I should welcome him.
He's a murderer.
He's returning after serving his sentence.
Exactly Satyakant.
He's served his time.
Look Satyakant.
Every saint has a past... and every sinner has a future.
If you don't support him at this delicate moment... then you might lose him forever.
Father.
Please forgive brother.
Your Father Name:
Sivaratnam.
Your Grandfather Name:
Navaratnam.
- It seems Ratnam is the common capital for all.
Exactly..
This Maniratnam is a bonded slave to the family of Vasundhara Devi.
He is now here to find out a secret.
This is peaks to the peaks and is sensational.
Oh my god..
I remember by secret PK bro.
If required I will catch your feet.
You catch the hands of my wife.
Say whether there is someone else in her heart.
I helped so many people.
You are my friend.
Come!
What is this meaningless thing?
"Even if my sister agrees for this test, I will not agree."
My sister is like fire!
Who are you to agree?
Catch his hand.
Why do you just leave without saying anything?
I cannot break families by telling.
Ethics are wealth for me.
"No problem, tell."
My heart is like the granite.
Then listen this..
Another one is seen in your wife's life.
He is a very tall guy and dangerous man.
He stepped in a company as an employee and has married the daughter of the Chairman.
"Correct, right?"
Of course he does.
But what happens when your father starts poking his nose into this Malcolm fellow?
Hmm?
"I mean, the guy is former Special Forces."
God only knows what he's doing for a living right now.
Isn't is safer for your father to maybe not remember what happened?
You should delete this.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Why don't you head back to the spa?
Don't have to tell me twice.
[Sighs]
"[Door opens, closes]"
Check this out.
"I compared the drive-on list from the studio to people connected to the fourth New York victim, Pat Crews."
- Any matches?
- Yeah.
Crews was a writing teacher at The New School.
"One of his early students is a successful screenwriter named Jordan Keegan, who now lives in New York but happened to be on the studio lot in L.A."
when the murder weapons went missing.
Let's pick his ass up.
"So, you're doing a news story on my nephew Malcolm, huh?"
Mm-hmm.
It's about war heroes.
Oh.
Look.
Isn't he handsome?
"Oh, yeah."
"But like I said, he's out of the country."
His job keeps him really busy.
"Let me get you his number, okay?"
"Loud and clear on this end, Tony."
"Roger that, buddy."

"Roger, down to water."
Down to the water!
"Yeah, roger, we have visual on the camera here."
Lower Tony down.
Down two more feet!

"Actually, visibility's great."
Lower Tony down!
Lowering down.

Where is he in relation to the bottom?
Are his feet on the bottom?
Are you touching bottom yet?
"Roger, on bottom."
"Is the bottom rough, smooth?"
"Hey, Tony, can you feel with your feet at all whether or not the bottom is smooth or rough?"
Roger that.
"You know, just a normal day."
"About 9:30, the aide came in from the college class and said that Alex had not made it to school and wanted to know if she was supposed to be there that day."
"Of course, she was."
"She would just never answer her phone, so I went and told the office that I needed to go find her."
"But, I knew where she was, and I knew what had happened."
"Just in my heart, I knew."
She had taken a back road to school that morning.
"She wasn't supposed to take it, because it was a dangerous road."
"And that's where I found her truck, out in the field."
[Music]
"The doctors had come in the second time and told us that they didn't think Alex would make it - that they'd lost her several times, and they needed to know what we wanted to do."
And my husband and I had to make the decision to let her go.
We were out in the hall waiting for them to get her cleaned up so we could go see her one last time.
[Music]
I think everything about my life changed.
"For a long time, it was hard to laugh, to really be joyfully happy."
"There are times when Katrina and I would be out doing stuff, and I would feel like I needed to text Alex and tell her what was going on, because I knew she would like it."
And then I would remember I couldn't tell her.
I was supposed to be able to go visit her at college right now.
"You know, and embarrass her on campus in front of all of her friends."
I can't do that.
It's just a whole part of my life that's gone now.
[Music]
"She left me a note, oh, probably six or eight months before she had her wreck."
"Just ""Alex hearts you,"" you know, on my windshield with a dry erase marker."
It's still there.
"You know, I can't bring myself to wipe it off."
I look at it every day.
[Music]
"After Alex died, and we went home, I got on the internet to check her phone records."
"And my husband came up and he goes, ""What are you doing?"""
"And I said, ""I want to know if she was texting and driving."""
"Zombies are at an all-time low level, but the fear of zombies could be incredibly high."
"It doesn't mean we have to have government policies to deal with the fear of zombies,"
"It's ridiculous, for Christ's sake."
The NHS...
"There was a survey in the NHS about dentistry, where they found that some people were removing their own teeth!"
You know...
"And they brought on some senior dentists onto Sky News, and gave out to him, and said"
"""This is terrible, People are removing their own teeth!"" And this guy stood there and went"
"""Well, obviously systems should be put in place to deal with it."""
Which is stupid!
"He should be going ""Well, these people are clearly morons of the highest line"""
[Laughter]
"""Who removes their own teeth, for Christ's sake?"
"I'm a dentist, I don't remove my own teeth, y'know what I mean?"""
But there's kind of a notion that everyones opinion is equally valid.
My arse!
Bloke who's a professor of dentistry for 40 years does not have a debate with some idiot who removes his teeth with string and a door.
Alright?
It's nonsense.
And it happens all the time with medical stuff on the television.
"They'll have a doctor on and they'll talk to the doctor, and they're all ""doctor this, and doctor that"" and"
"""what happened there"" and ""doctor, isn't it awful?"" Right?"
"And then the doctor will be talking about something, with all the benefits of research and medical evidence."
"And they'll turn away from the doctor, in the name of ""ballance"", and turn to some quak, witch doctor, homeopath horse shit peddler on the other side of the studio."
[Laughter]

Tom Brokay:
Who says that CBS has got a corner on the Amazing Race?
We've got our own going on here on Education Nation.
"I'm joined now by Sal Khan, who, in a fact, is one of the leading innovators of the country, but kind of stumbled into it,"
You were a computer science enthusiast.
Sal:
Yes.
Tom:
You got into the venture capital business.
But you had a niece across the country who was having some difficulties doing her math.
What happened then?
Sal:
"Yes, it was 2004, they were visiting me right after my wedding."
It just turned out.. it came out while we were just talking about it that she was getting tracked into a slower math class when she was going into 7th grade right after the summer.
And I talked to her.
"I said ""Nadia, you are clearly a bright girl --"
And we share a certain amount of DNA --
"There is no way that you should be tracked into a slower math class."""
"And so, she agreed that we would tutor each other, or I would tutor her when she went back."
Tom:
"Okay, I'm gonna note the time here:"
7:47 is when I turned it on.
Doesn't look like it's quite ready for the egg; what I'm looking for to know when it's time to put the egg on is for the oil to sort of spread out on its own.
The induction cooktop doesn't use a lot less electricity than the radiant element; it's just that it uses it for a much shorter time.
And this is probably the best illustration of it.
"If I were using the induction cooktop, my egg would be well along its way by now."
And I'm going to put this in here and I bet it's gonna be a little cool.
"Yeah, it's a little cool for the egg right now."
"As you can see it's being . . . that's a little cooler than I would want to put an egg in, but I'm sort of out of the habit of using the radiant eye, so I forget how to judge that."
"And Amanda likes a little pepper on hers, so actually she likes a LOT of pepper on hers"
[Amanda chuckles]
And now I'm gonna wait for a second because it's got some cooking to do before we're ready to turn it.
I put the egg in too soon.
Should have waited even longer to put it in.
If I'm a real man I'll figure out how to do one of those
"""time passes"" things (Note:"
I'm no real man . . .)
"Okay it's 7:48 now, I guess, so it's been in there for . . ."
Well we'll figure that out.
We'll probably flash it on the screen how long it's been in at this point.
Note: call it 2 minutes 50 seconds so far . . .
"Whatever you do then, Honey, don't let it stop."
Just let it keep rolling.
"I'll let it cook a little bit longer before I try to turn it, because I want to see that middle area there harden up."
You're probably a little close for focus.
(Note:
She was fine . . .)
[Spatula scraping on pan]
Probably turned it sooner than I should have.
[Amanda: looks good.]
Looks good?
Okay.
Khan's lessons are unscripted and unadorned.
His voice over a black screen as he writes or doodles!
His style has changed little since this all began back in 2004 as
Youtube videos to help his young cousins.
9 times the 6...!
"He's now recorded more than 2,400 lessons on everything from simple arithmetic to college-level biology."
Anyone can watch for free!
People are more likely to say thank you when it's free!
And thank you is worth a lot!
But what are Khan's lessons worth?
The Los Altos school district is trying to figure that out.
"Last year, the district used Khan lessons in five classes."
"The students did well enough that this year, the Khan method is in 40 classes to be used by every fifth and sixth grader in the district!"
We found that the students are really engaged in this type of learning.
It was a great addition to what we were already doing.
You might say this California school has flipped!
"Students get their lectures at home and come to school to do their homework, fundamentally changing the role of the teacher!"
The kids can really move through in their own pace.
And then I can see who is struggling.
"At home, students listen to Khan's online lessons."
"In the classroom, they practice what they learn while teacher Courtney Cadwell works with those who need help."
"When they're having fun and they're wanting to do math, that tells me that this is a good thing."
This educational overall comes from a man who was working as a hedge fund analyst until 2009!
Khan has a Harvard MBA and three degrees from MlT.
"You're kind of a math geek, I guess."
Aren't you?
"Yes, in the best form of the word!"
"In the beginning, he financed the Khan Academy from his own savings, until he was discovered by some people with money."
"Well, it's amazing!"
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.
Thank you!
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and
"It's much richer and much more demanding, particularly when you get to fourth grade."
That's when it starts.
I'm not surprised in Sarah Lee's case that things began to unravel at third and fourth grade.
"If Sarah Lee is a bright child, she was probably able to fake her way through first and second grade."
You can fake your way through if you listen to your friends talk about the story they've read and then you use those answers when the teacher asks you the questions.
But around third or fourth grade is when you begin to deal with expressive language problems.
"In other words, the"
language is there.
I don't know it.
But it's almost locked away.
The language is inside the brain.
They have an inner language.
They know what they want to say.
And they just can't express it.
They can't get the words out.
We're going to make a paragraph that matches the picture.
"Like, sometimes when I'm in a class and my teacher, she asks us, like, what's the answer?"
And I'll raise my hand and I'll know the answer.
"But then when I say it, it won't come out the way I was thinking of it."
What about the way Homer used the gun in that episode?
What do you think that they were trying to say?
Sarah Lee.
He used it in-- he used instead-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
"When you think about it, you're thinking in your head, I didn't want to say that."
Did he use it for what it was really intended for?
"Sometimes it's a little embarrassing because people, they'll laugh and mumble under their breath, that's the wrong answer."
That's embarrassing.
Sara Lee masters the language of TV shows and commercials and the playground.
But she locks up when confronted by the more fully dimensional language encountered in books and in the classroom.
Experts say she has expressive
language deficiency.
She understands well but she has trouble explaining what she knows.
The testing shows that Nathan excels at visual and spatial perceptions.
Fantastic.
What I would like you to do next is write the alphabet for me from A to Z and join all the letters together as if the whole alphabet was one long word.
And
"I'm going to time you to see how long it takes you, OK?"
"Ready, go."
Along with his tally sheet of strengths there are significant weaknesses.
M-- I forgot how to do one letter.
Were you forgetting how to make the letter or were you forgetting which letter came next?
Forgetting how to write it.
"Yeah, how to write it."
So you knew what letter you wanted to write?
And could you picture it in your mind?
I could picture it in my mind but I just couldn't--
Couldn't remember the procedure for making that letter?
So let me give you some others now and see how you do.
Dr. Levine now knows something vital.
Nathan knows what the letter K looks like.
But it's simply too much work to write it down.
Kids like this have what is known as an output problem.
These are kids for whom work is too much work.
Effort is too much effort.
And they sit down to do something and you'd think they'd have to climb the
Matterhorn.
And these same kids tantalize everyone because their intake is so good.
They're so good at understanding things.
They're so good at analyzing.
"Often, they're very creative."
A lot of times they're a wellspring of phenomenal ideas.
"But to be productive, to get some output, to be efficient in your output, is sort of out of the question."
"Nathan, do you see only designs here?"
It's as if within the mind of the child with a learning problem there are three clocks.
They are anti-White.
They are NOT against racism.
They are against the continued existence of all White people and only White people.

"All right, so on Monday, we spoke with Shirley Phelps-Roper about allegations that the internet gathering known as Anonymous had issued a threat, and Westboro Baptist Church responded to that threat."
"Well, today we have everybody here, we have Shirley Phelps-Roper from the Westboro Baptist Church."
"We have a source within Anonymous, the internet gathering known as Anonymous, here."
So let's start at the very beginning.
"Anonymous, can you please tell us, did any active Anonymous members or participants, sources, issue a threat to the Westboro Baptist Church?"
"-No, there was no talk of it."
"The press release was... -Well, how could you know this?"
I was wondering...
"-Well, hold on, Shirley, let's get him to explain... -They're anonymous!"
I'm just saying.
-Let's have him explain.
"-Well, Shirley, with most operations, we have planning, we have execution, we have discussion of it."
"This press release came out of nowhere, and it doesn't seem like the writing style we'd make."
"Nobody that usually writes press releases stood up and said hey, we wrote this."
"The operation came out of nowhere, and you guys responded really too fast."
It was all a bit suspicious.
"-Oh, yikes!"
It was several days before we responded.
"-So Shirley, let's..."
let's take it one at a time.
"How did you originally hear of the threat, Shirley?"
By many emails.
"We received many emails, and then, how else?"
"Oh, also in some print publications."
"Twitter, Twitter was talking about it."
"Oh, and Twitter was sending us links to it, also."
"OK, so Anonymous, can you state... do you, what is your belief?"
Do you believe that the Westboro Baptist Church concocted this letter?
So this is in meters.
"0.5 meters, so that alone doesn't help us."
We have to be able to figure out the circumference of this tub in order to really be able to figure out the surface area because the circumference times this height will be the surface area.
Point two: they say the height of the tub is one meter.
So they're telling us that this is one meter.
Well that doesn't help us.
That still doesn't tell us how far around the tub goes.
If they had given us the diameter or the radius or the circumference then we could've used our basic geometry to figure out the circumference.
But they didn't.
So either way-- it's a one meter height-- both of these combined still do not allow us to figure out the surface area of this green band.
E again.
Problem 40.
What is the value of integer n?
And n as an integer.
So statement number one: they tell us that n times n plus 1 is equal to 6.
"Now we should already be able to figure this out because n is an integer, n plus 1 is an integer."
So what are the factorizations of 6?
You could have 1 times 6.
"But that doesn't fit n and n plus 1, right?"
This is n and n plus 5.
"You have 2 times 3, which work, right."
"If 2 is n, n plus 1 is 3 and they equal 6."
So let me circle that.
And then what other factorizations?
You don't have any other-- these are all of the factors 6.
"So just looking at the first statement, you know that n has to be equal to 2."
This is the only integer where this is true.
"Actually, let me take a step back."
"No, what if n is negative?"
"Because I was assuming it's a positive integer but they didn't say it's a positive integer, so let me think about that."
"If I did minus 3 times minus 2, that also equals 6 and these are both integers."
"Huh, OK, so this isn't enough."
"But once you have the variance, it's very easy to figure out the standard deviation."
You just take the square root of it.
The square root of 7.76-- 2.78.
Let's say 2.79 is the standard deviation.
"So this gives us some measure of, on average, how far the numbers are away from the mean which was 4.2."
And it gives it in kind of the units of the original measurement.
"Anyway, I'm all out of time."
I'll see you in the next video.
"Or actually, let's figure out-- we said if this was a sample, if those numbers were sample and not the population, that we figured out that the sample variance was 9.7."
And so then the sample standard deviation is just going to be the square root of that.
The square root of 9.7 seven which would be 3.1.
3.11.
"Anyway, hopefully that makes it a little bit more concrete."
We've been dealing with these sigma notation variables and all that so far.
So when you actually do it with numbers you see it's hopefully not that difficult.
"Anyway, see you in the next video."
Fucking Christ.
What the fuck?
"One minute I'm minding my own business - shoot'n pool, downing shots of who-the-fuck-knows-what and suddenly.."
POOOOOOF
I mean fairy-fucking-godmother?!?
How the hell is this her jurisdiction?
Man. my head.
What the hell was in those shots?
I mean seriously.
All i did was rent a few dogs.
Oh.. and sewed a few sticks to their heads.
Alright. and glued a red light to that little ones nose but fucking christ give me a break...
I did a dime of shrooms earlier.
I needed some light. and (chuckling) i thought he looked cute.
Is that a fucking crime?!?
"How was I to know that abandoned sled in front of city hall belonged to some ""princess""?!?"
planes inside nine-dimensional space that we have to work with eventually.
"For now, let's stay with a nice case where the matrices work,"
we can get every right-hand side b and here we see how to
do it with columns.
Okay.
There was one step which I
realized I was saying in words that I now want to write in letters.
"Because I'm coming back to the matrix form of the equation,"
so let me write it here.
"The matrix form of my equation,"
of my system is some matrix A times some vector x equals some right-hand
side b.
Okay.
So this is a multiplication.
A times x.
"Matrix times vector, and I just want to say how do you"
multiply a matrix by a vector?
"Okay, so I'm just going to create a"
matrix -- let me take two five one three --
"and let me take a vector x to be, say, 1and 2."
How do I multiply a
matrix by a vector?
But just think a little bit about
matrix notation and how to do that in multiplication.
So let me say how I multiply a matrix by a vector.
"Actually, there are two ways to do it."
Let me tell you my favorite way.
It's columns again.
It's a column at a time.
"For me, this matrix multiplication says I take one of that column and"
two of that column and add.
So this is the way I would think of
Or I'll push them away.
It's... it's not something that right now I want to feel in my life.
"For me, it's gotta be my family."
"When you realise the reality of love not lasting, with my parents breaking up."
For me that totally shook everything I knew.
Umm.
"You know, they're the ones who are always meant to be together, that are always meant to love each other."
"It's the most painfull thing that I've ever felt, and it wasn't even me involved in the love."
[soft music continues]
"God's unconditional love, I struggle with."
"I mean, I know it's real... but I struggle to feel it."
"I guess when I've had such a mixed up view of love, that is so painful, when I know that there is an unconditional love, I just don't... it doesn't connect to me."
But I guess to me it's... it doesn't mean that it's not real at all.
I struggle to feel His love.
"I struggle to, to know."
Knowing that there's love.
Out there.
Even though I don't feel it.
Knowing that someone else does.
Knowing that it actually exists.
"Just because I fall, doesn't mean I should crawl for the rest of my life,"
I should get back up.
"And I know that one day, I'll learn to love."
And I'll learn to be loved.
"'Cause I guess for me, where there's another day, there's still hope for it to happen."
"When people have diabetes, their bodies aren't able to keep their blood sugar in balance."
So sometimes they need to take regular doses of a medicine that helps restore that balance.
People with depression have the same  kind of problem with their brain chemicals.
But regular doses of antidepressants can keep these chemicals in balance.
"As a first year intern you have very little free time, so when you finally have a night off, it's important that you do something constructive with it."
Hey man how's it goin?
Hey wait a second.
I read in my neurology book... ...and there was only one similar disease.
I realized this might be a totally new disease.
I was so scared.
I was scared to death.
Your first thought is that you might get infected yourself.
"You examine sick people, thinking only of yourself."
I had to take a deep breath and tell myself that this was my job.
I examined 30 people and it was an epidemic.
When I got home I sent Agneta and the kids away.
They went to friends' houses and those of us who had met the patients stayed in our house.
After two weeks we were sure that the disease was only in the country.
It was a combination of malnutrition and toxicity - nothing contagious.
Those were two scary weeks.
"Konzo was caused by cassava roots, the only food that survived drought."
"The root contains toxic cyanide, which takes time to remove."
But people were too hungry.
They ate it immediately and were paralyzed.
My scientific articles are in the two bottom drawers...
The disease was called konzo and turned into a research project with a hundred published articles.
"In Sweden, Hans Rosling was bothered by the worldview he met."
Particularly about Africa.
"When your worldview differs so much from reality, facts are interesting."
"If you think Indian women have six or seven children and you learn the average is 2.7, that's interesting."
There have been huge changes.
Child mortality in Egypt is fairly well documented.
25 years ago 20% of children in Egypt died before age five.
Today it's 4%.
From 20 to 4.
A dramatic improvement.
Child health in Egypt has improved faster than it ever did here.
But no one knows that.
Do our news report on the fantastic improvement in child health in Egypt?
I want you to try it.
"If you haven't tried this, go to Publix, Whole Foods, and get all this food at Publix and Whole Foods."
It is really amazing.
"If you try it out on your family, you tell them it's meat,"
I'd love to see the response they give.
It really is good stuff.
"And remember, all meat, dairy and egg products go through a process."
It doesn't just magically form.
"In this case, the process involves killing, cooking, pasteurization, refrigeration, freezing, and we can not forget the all important seasoning."
"I remember going to McDonald's as a child, and I didn't just get a slab of meat."
"A slab of meat had herbs and spices put into it, was put on the grill, cooked, and then it came to me with a bun,"
"lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard and onions."
And a pickle.
What all those things are made of?
Plants
"We put condiments, spice and herbs on the meat to make it taste better, in fact, what would meat be without plants?"
It would just be a dead animal.
Would be a carcass on your plate.
It would be no different from road kill.
"So the word of the day is ""Vegan""."
"A vegan is somebody who chooses not to eat any meat, dairy, eggs or fish."
"And again, how is this extreme?"
How is it extreme not to be drinking the milk of any other species?
How is it extreme not to be eating hen periods?
How is it extreme not to be participating in a system that unnecessarily kills animals?
"A lot of kids say, even after all this,they are still like"
"""What do I eat as vegan""?"
"Now, all these products are vegan."
"There is no meat, no dairy, no eggs."
But this is all crap.
This is unhealthy.
This is the junk food vegan.
- Who are they to be judge and jury?

- No comment.
I'm afraid for myself.
I'm afraid for my kids.
I'm afraid to walk down the street.

"For the owner of a call option with a $50 strike price, then the payoff at expiration ... we're talking about the value of that position."
"If the stock is below $50 we wouldn't exercise it, because we can buy it for cheaper than the option that the call option is giving us."
If the stock goes above $50 we would exercise our option to buy at $50.
"Say the stock is at $60 the underline stock is at $60 on that date at the expiration date, then we would exercise our option to buy at $50 and sell at $60 and make $10."
We would essentially get this upside above $50 on the stock.
"If we think about ... this is the actual value of the position, if we want to factor in how much we paid for the option, we would shift this down by $10."
As the holder we would pay $10 for that.
It would look this this.
We would essentially ... if we don't exercise the option we loose the amount of money that was a loss that we have to pay for the option.
"Then above that we break even at $60 dollars, and then we make money above that."
"Yeah, that's the way I do it, [laughter] it seems to work fairly reliably."
[Coordinator]
"Um, there's a, hang ...There's another question from the phone."
Go ahead.
[indecipherable question]
[Coordinator]
So let me start with that.
"So if you're in a meeting and you're taking notes, ... and you either have voice over off and your headphones on...okay continue with the question."
[Teleconference caller]
That's my question.
[Coordinator]
"That, So your question is, ""When you're in a meeting taking notes, which option do you use""?"
"Or, do you need voice over off when you have your headphones on?"
Do you guys understand the question?
[Panelist]
You definitely need voice over on.
Voice over will work fine with head phones.
[lower tone]
I think that's what she was asking?
[Coordinator]
So Is your quest....is the answer you have voice over on when you have headphones on the answer to your question?
long pause.....[teleconference caller]
"Uh...Yeah, I guess it is."
[undecipherable conversation between two teleconference callers]
You would have to wear your headset otherwise [undecipherable]
[Coordinator]
"If I understand the question correctly, as a Skype user, ah, in setting up whether or not you're going to use the computer's built-in microphone and speaker ah, that is an option that needs to be selected."
"If you're going to use a headset, look forward to the option of listening through the computer speaker the headset speaker, and speaking into the mic."
Does that answer your question?
[Teleconference caller]
Yes.
[Phone coordinator]
"And, we could see this with a poll, or we could see this with tech."
"We had a lot of benefits in the United States, because of George Bush."
George Bush was great for us.
Right now we have so many creative people which we could hear here because we had George Bush.
"In November, 2007,"
"I was in Australia, in Sydney."
"So was George Bush, and he said, ""I'm so glad to be in Austria""."
(Laughter)
"Because, after seven years in power, he didn't know the difference between Austria and Australia."
"Then, he was opening a conference."
"He thought, ""Vienna, Austria"", opening this OPEC Conference."
"But it was not the OPEC Conference, it was the APEC Conference,"
The Asian-Pacific Conference.
"When this is your president,"
- we have some potential as well - we don't wait for the government anymore.
That's why we have seen huge innovations in the United States.
"Now, with Mr. Obama, everybody sits back and relaxes, and waits for what the president is doing."
"But before that, we had George Bush, and so we knew it is up to us."
We didn't wait for the government anymore.
"So, in a certain way, George Bush was beneficial."
"But only in certain ways, definitely."
We need to reinvent our products.
Everything we see in front of us is not designed.
"We talk about colors in Brazil, but all the colors that you see are hazardous waste. even the flip-flops that we saw are hazardous waste."
35 million flip-flops go into the ocean every year; 35 million.
"There's more seals, more whales, more turtles, more dolphins, killed by flip-flops, than by anything else,"
Because the animals eat the plastic.
There are 12 million tons of plastic going into the oceans.
Nothing is designed to go into biological systems; nothing is designed to go into the biosphere.
We feel so bad that we are here that we are romanticizing nature.
"People talk about ""Mother Earth""."
"But there is no ""Mother Earth""."
"When you say, i'm born this way"
"What is the thing that your community can't accept about you, Lady Gaga does ?"
"Nadim: "" about "" Born This Way I want to tell the world, that I was Born This Way """
What way ?
"Nadim: "" My personality is revolutionary in the community """
What is that you don't like about the community ?

"Lady Gaga concentrates on Social issues too, What Issues are those ?"
"What does Lady Gaga once did, and you said, I have that iddue in my community ?"
"Nadim: "" People's physical appearance """
"Nadim: "" Relationship between people, who's based on lies, and they judge you for how you look like """
"Nadim: ""and they lie about you, they always judge looks """
What are Lady Gaga's ideas and thoughts ?

"Nadim: "" When she strated, she cared about pop-culture """
Who is she defending ?
"Nadim: "" She's defending, people who are being abused, sexually, or physically .."
""" .."
"At schools and anywhere else, and also the gay community """
"She's defending the gay community so clearly, in every song ?"
Nadim:
"""Yes, Cause they humans too, we are all the same """
"Nadim: "" And every where in this world, most of the artist, wants to help them and fight for their rights """
"Nadim: "" Because those people, are the ones that understand art very well """
"Lady Gaga says : "" You're free to do whatever you want to"" right ?"
"What do You want to do, and wish to do, but can't ?"
"Nadim: "" To be myself .. """
"Nadim: "" The real person I dream to become """
Why aren't you that person ?
"Nadim: "" Cause I am living a stressed life, in school or home """
"Nadim: "" But I have a lot of dreams, I want to develope but I can't """
"What kind of stress, that stops you from achieving your dreams ?"
That's one way to think about it.
"But there are other ways which would describe the same quantity, right?"
"I could have divided the cake into six pieces, and picked two of those pieces."
Right?
"So, the one third we normally write one over three, and this thing we might say two parts of six, and we could write two over six, and we see, already, another issue, which is what?"
"We have two different fractions, but they represent the same thing."
Right?
Sorry my microphone is... it really is falling.
Ok.
"So, this brings us to a concept here, which is... ok, well, we have two ways of representing the same thing."
Two ways of representing the same thing.
These two things are in some sense... we want them to be equi... equivalent.
[Laughter].
Equivalent.
Ok?
"So maybe we want to set up a construction that's... where we define fractions in terms of equivalence relations, ok?"
How are we going to do that?
What will the equivalence relation be?
"So, how about this?"
"Let's take any construction like... any picture like this, and if I want the associated fraction,"
I'll think of one over three as an ordered pair.
"So maybe I'll do the following, in the first picture I'm picking one part out of three, and in the second picture I'm picking two parts out of six, and I'll think of these as equivalent ordered pairs."
Ok?
"And to make this a sentence, I might say write that as equivalent ordered pairs, period."
All right?
Ok.
"And then, what I will do, if I can is, once I figure out what all the things that are in the... that are equivalent are, the idea is that these belong to some equivalence class."
That might have lots of other things in it.
Right?
Like ten coma thirty.
Right?
Or a hundred and twenty one coma... why do I torture myself?

"The workflow for building a metaSL shader tree in 3ds Max is a little  like building one in Mental Mill, only easier."
Here you will be creating a metaSL shader tree to apply  to this human head.
"The model is low-poly based, but will look like it has more detail  with proper mapping and metaSL shaders."
Open the Slate Material Editor.
"Ensure that 3ds Max is set up to use the Mental Ray renderer,  otherwise you won't have access to metaSL shaders."
Expand the metaSL rollout under Maps.
There you will find about  a dozen shaders ready for use.
"You typically start with an illumination Phong shader, which provides  the basis for the metaSL tree."
"To start populating the tree, you drag in other metaSL shaders  and wire them to the proper channels."
The Texture Lookup 2d shader is useful for defining bitmaps as textures.
Start by defining a Diffuse texture; use the Head-diffuse.jpg bitmap  and wire it to the Diffuse Color channel.
Use a Normals Bumpmap shader in the Normal channel.
Use the image file:
Head-normal.jpg.
Add another Texture Lookup 2d shader and use the file Head-specular.jpg  and wire it to the Specular Color channel.
"At this time, notice that if you tried to apply the Phong illumination  node to the object in the scene, it doesn't work."
"You first need to convert the Phong illumination node into  a single-output ""material""."
"Luckily, you can use the Map to Material Conversion node to that end."
Now you can apply the shader tree to the object in the scene.

"Where other scientists would play in their laboratory,"
Tesla created his inventions in his mind.
NT:
"To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility."
MT:
"And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination, he would build them in his workshop."
NT:
"I needed no models, drawings or experiments."
"I could picture them as real in my mind, and there I run it, test it and improve it."
Only then do I construct it.
MT:
His great idea was alternating current.
But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?
"To sell his idea, he became a showman."
NT:
"We are at the dawn of a new age, the age of electricity."
"I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether."
It is the magic of science.
(Applause)
"Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics."
He even photographed the bones of the human body.
"But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream: harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls, and bringing light to the city."
But Tesla's success didn't last.
NT:
I had bigger ideas.
Illuminating the city was only the beginning.
"A world telegraphy center -- imagine news, messages, sounds, images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly."
MT:
It's a great idea; it was a huge project.
"Expensive, too."
NT:
They wouldn't give me the money.
"So, what do you get and if you get a lot of money basically, you get two million dollars, 2.59 million dollars, arlight."
"Its two, five, nine, zero, five, six, five."
"So, what does this tell you?"
"This tells you that if you invest $10,000 in a bank 40 times, the future value of that will end up being 2.59 million dollars."
"So, what"
"I'm going to do, I'm going to try to talk you through the problem again."
"So, just, so that we are working together."
What did I do?
I calculated Future Value.
"So, in order to calculate Future Value of something that I don't know, I have to use the Future Value function in the calculator or in the spreadsheet."
"And out popped, I gave this information $10,000 was the PMT, 40 was n."
But most importantly eight percent was r.
"So, I gave all this information to Excel or a calculator, whatever you choose to be using, simply because it's a very complicated calculation."
"Conceptually, it's not that difficult."
And we got 2.59 mil.
"And I'm going to just use it approximately because I'm not going to calculate, write all the digits and so on."
"So, what has happened here?"
Let me just walk you through this problem.
"First of all, remember yesterday, remember I asked you, what is the answer to a Finance question or anybody asks you what, what should you say?"
Compounding.
But you always have to pause because you want to
"look smart, right?"
"So, you take a pause, and you say compounding."
"And so, so let me ask you the following question."
"Suppose there was no interest rate or, in other words, how much of the 10,000 are you throwing in?"
And suppose the interest is zero.
This problem is very simple to do.
Why?
"Because you do 40 times 10,000."
"You have $400,000, right."
"So, the interest rate, time value of money is zero, you will have a lot of money in your bank account but how much will it be?"
"400,000."
I have the dream that one  day everyone will be able... ...to walk around safely without  worrying about being bullied.
When we think about bullying... ...we typically think about one child bullying another on the playground.
But bullying is far more pervasive.
"People get bullied in  school, their workplace... ...on Facebook and  sometimes even at home."
"People get bullied because  of the clothes they wear... car they drive, music they  listen to or their profession."
The question that comes to my  mind when I think of bullying is... ...What does it achieve?
Does bullying bring inner-happiness?
Does it result in lasting power?
Does it really build self-confidence?
"On the contrary, it is simply a reflection of the bully's own lack of self-worth, ...dissatisfaction and fear."
There are many ways that we can address bullying.
Supporting others is a great preventative strategy.
"If EVERYONE were supported, it would help others be strong and proud of who... ...they are so that THEY  can pursue their dreams."
I dream of a world where EVERYONE can get the support they need to thrive.
Where they are NOT put down by others.
Where they can proud be of who they are and proud of who they want to be.
[applause]
Thank you.
[applause]
Thank you.
"Becuase of bullying, many great ideas have been lost."
"People have become depressed, inflicted pain on themselves... ...committed suicide, or turned  their hurt and anger on others."
They have been permanently scarred and... ...hurt because of the  words and actions of others.
"They question their existence, their self-worth."
All because of bullying.
I have a dream that one day all of this will be gone.
No more ideas lost.
No more hurt feelings.
No more suicides.
"No more ""let bullying be gone forever."""
[applause]
We can do it if we start taking  the issue of bullying a priority.
"Now, let me first give you a"
little bit of a metaphor and then come back to how this really works in space-time.
Supposing you're just looking at an xy-coordinate system and you have two points in a two-dimensional space.
"So, here's a point and here's a point."
"Now, if you arrange for some kind of coordinate system--here's a coordinate system."
"This is x, this is y--and you ask how far apart these points are."
"Well, you can do that--let's see."
"They're separated in x by this amount here, which we'll call delta [Δ] x."
"And they're separated in y by this amount here, and that's Δ y."
"But of course, those quantities depend on the orientation of your coordinate system."
"If I now take this coordinate system and I shift it like this, now it's going to be totally different."
"Now I'm going to have x look like this and I'm going to have y, Δ y look like that."
So Δ y has gotten a whole lot smaller.
Δ x has gotten a whole lot bigger.
And all I did was twist the coordinate system.
Yeah?
Student:
[Inaudible.]
Professor Charles Bailyn:
"You still get the same distance, thank you very much, that's exactly right."
The distance is the invariant.
"The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate, those vary with the coordinate system, but the distance is the same."
That's exactly the point.
"And so, the quantity--let me summarize this."
"For points on a 2-D space, Δ x varies."
Δ y varies.
"But there is a quantity that is invariant and that is--well, let's call it (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)), which is the distance squared, (Δ D^(2))."
And this is invariant.
"It doesn't matter which way you twist things around, that will--that quantity will remain the same."
"So, now, imagine that you've got events in space-time."
So an event in space-time has three spatial coordinates and one time coordinate.
"So, it's basically a point in a four-dimensional space."

Have you ever taken a low-floor bus ?
"Some people will say, ""Yes,"" but other people will say."
"""No."" A few months ago, my grandmother and I took a low-floor bus to go to the library."
Riding a low-floor bus was the first time for me.
My grandmother usually takes a low-floor bus because she has problems with her knees.
It is difficult for her to get on a bus with steps.
"When I was on the low-floor bus, some old people came onto the bus."
"There were no steps on the bus, so they could get on the bus easily."
I thought that the low-floor bus was designed very well for old people.
"Two weeks later, in class, we had a chance to think about life in our city."
"Our teacher said to us, ""In our city, there are many good projects."
These projects make our life better.
"Now I want you to talk about some of the projects."" Then we started talking about them in groups."
"In my group, we talked about the low-floor bus."
"I said, ""The low-floor bus is designed well for old people."""
Everyone in my group looked interested in the low-floor bus.
"One student said, ""I didn't notice that the low-floor bus was so useful for old people."
There are many old people in our city.
"We should have more low-floor buses for them."" Then another student said, ""I don't think the low-floor bus was designed only for old people."
We should get more information about the low-floor bus.
"Lets go to City Hall after school. """
"At City Hall, we talked to a man there and asked him questions about the low-floor bus."
"He said to us, ""The low-floor bus is not only for old people."

Have kids
Grow old together
And say goodbye
And then for some reason I thought about the circus but then I was back on relationships...
"Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!"
"And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last, maybe it was just a matter who takes fewer hits"
"And of course it's heating up as all of this is happening, so my egg, my scrambled egg's gonna cook a lot faster than Amanda's is."
"Since we're using this anyway, I'm going to go ahead and set the warming zone (which we don't have with the induction cooktop)."
"You need to back up 'cause it won't, yeah,"
"What I just did is to set the warming zone, which is this little thing right here, which will keep Amanda's egg warm while I cook mine."
That's one of those conveniences we're about to give up.
Okay.
"Now Amanda's egg is done, and here's mine already mixed up."
[sound of sizzling oil in pan]
That's more like the temperature you'd want to have.
You can hear it bubbling and sizzling.
Note:
4 minutes 46 seconds so far . . .
This one's gonna cook nice and fast.
It's had time to warm up now.
Now it won't be long before I'll be able to turn this off.
So we'll figure that out.
"Probably after I flip it one time, we'll be able to turn the radiant element off, knowing that the rest of it will cook by itself okay."
"Yeah, I think I feel safe now to go ahead and turn it back off."
Note:
Power off at 6 minutes 16 seconds.
"So whatever time I just turned it off, that's the time elapsed for that radiant element."
Then we'll just let that sit in the pan and finish cooking.
And then the next time we do this we'll use the induction cooktop.
"A equals 1, b equals 5 and c equals 6."

"You can use the box I gave you or you can use, I prefer this."

Oh! -- it's trick.
It's a gimmick to crawl into a corner and wait there until somebody comes to your rescue.

I know what I'm doing.
I'm not being phony.
I'm not pretending I'm so brave.

"I feel like you're saying, unless I come out openly and stand on my own"
I'm not a phony.

I'm just as real sitting in that corner as I am out here all by myself.
But you're not sitting in that corner.
"Well, I'm not now."
We're on problem 27.
"They tell us if i is equal to the square root of minus 1, then what is 4 times i-- that's an i-- times 6 times i?"
"Well, multiplication is associative."
You can switch the order around.
"So this is the same thing as 4 times 6 times i times i, or the same thing as 24 times i squared, right?"
"If we square both sides of this, you get i squared is equal to negative 1."
So this is 24 times negative 1.
"So this is minus 24, which is choice C."
"Next problem, 28."
They want to know what an equivalent form of 3 plus i is.
"A lot of times, people don't like either when you have a square root in the denominator or they don't like it when you have an a complex number in the denominator."
A complex number is just something that has part real and part imaginary.
So the way you can do it with this case is you multiply times the conjugate of this number.
"I know that sounds like a fancy word, but all it means is you take the opposite of the imaginary part."
So what's the conjugate?
"Remember, the only way you cannot change a fraction is if you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing, because then you're multiplying by 1."
So what's the conjugate of this?
The conjugate of 3 plus i is 3 minus i.
Ever since I was little

"Now, mostly we're looking for correct code."
"If you wrote some more tests, you may start to have some more confidence in the code that we have."
We're also considering efficiency to some degree.
It seems like there's a big problem with the efficiency of the program we have so far.
Let me show you one of the issues.
"Now we represented states as a (here, there, t) triplet."
"The problem with this is there can be two states that have identical here and there's but differ in the t, and they're going to be considered different states."
Why is that a problem?
Consider this problem.
"We have two people--one who takes 1 unit to cross the bridge, and one who takes 1000."
It seems pretty clear there is an easy solution.
The two of them go across together.
"It takes 1000, but look how we're going to explore this space."
"We're going to start out in the initial state that took time 0, and then we're going to start adding things to the frontier."
"Out of all the ways we could cross, the one that adds the least is for the 1 to go across by himself."
Now he's on the other side with the 1 on the other side and the 1000 on the original side.
That only took 1 step.
Now what's the fastest thing we can do after that?
We could take 1 more step and go back to the original state.
Here we had 1 and we'll call K for the 1000 on the left-hand side.
Here K was left behind and 1 went over to the right.
"Here we took one more time unit, and we had 1, K on this side."
"If we continue taking the fastest step we can, we'll get to another distinct state where K is on this side and 1 is on the other side."
The flashlight is always going with the 1.
We're imaging that we're going be able to create a function T that is going to give us the answer to that.
Let's just leave it at that for now.
"Finally, in the case where a is odd, it's going to execute the condition of this if statement, the condition of this if statement, both of which will fail."
"Then it will recursively compute the product, and then basically execute the returns."
A total of 3 statements plus however long it takes to do the recursive call-- so 3 statements plus this particular kind of recursive call.
This now is a mathematical specification of a function.
"We don't know at the moment what the relationship is between a and T(a), but at least it's fully specified."
"It turns out that you actually can solve this pretty easily by using what we already worked out about the number of times you can divide a number a in half, rounding down if it's odd, before you get down to 0."
See if you can put that together to try to answer the question what does T(a) equal from these set of choices.
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Episode 5, part 2&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;linked to voice mail after the beep.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Could it be . . .&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Is he still at the playground?
Drive safely.
Kang Hwi?
I love you too.
Why did you come now?
"Kang Hwi, Kang Hwi!"
My head...
Where is this?
Aish!
What happened yesterday?
Cell phone!
I am really disappointed!
Why on earth did you go to a place like that?
Leaving all the nice places aside?
"Ah, I don't know, I don't know."
I just opened my eyes and a water bed&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; was lapping underneath me ...
Aish!
I don't even want to think about it!
How much alcohol did you drink?
That you even blacked out?
"But did something happen, hyung-nim?"
"Perhaps, were you with a girl I don't know about?"
"It's part of your job to convince yourself that you feel comfortable with it, and."
The blue dots are the only things you save.
"Now, let's take a look at this when we scale it."
"Cuz, nobody's going to solve this thing on a for, fiv, four by four domain."
"Right, I mean, you're going to need a lot more points."
"You might say, I'm going to chop up my X domain into a 100 points."
"And then you spy that thing and, boom, this things huge, 10,000 by 10,000 matrix."
Okay so this is kinda what we're looking at.
We're going to be working with that matrix.
Now you see how white that is?
That's cuz there's all zeros there.
You don't want to save all that.
You know how many components you'd have to save?
"10,000 by 10,000."
"I'll let you do the math, in your head."
"Right, this is huge."
"Ten to the five squared if you want to save this in memory, you gotta eat up all that memory to save a bunch of zeros."
Spdiags changes your game.
Bring you up a level because now you can do this thing with sparse extinct.
"Now, one last thing I want to do."
"Let's go back down to five, and we're not on these five, we're going to say, hey, what's the determinant of that matrix?"
"Huh, that's not zero."
Ten to the seventeen.
If you see a number like this.
That's bad okay.
So the condition number is the measure you want to look for cuz that determiner actually said oh by the time I was three that's not done yet that's pretty far away from zero all things considered.
The problem really comes if you look at the condition number.
"Anything you're like when you start gaining ten of five, ten of six you're kind of like ooo that's looking singular."
Ten of seventeen says dude I am totally singular.
"To you,"
That's the interpretation of that.
"Okay, If I, wrote mat lab, I would have a"
"I say, good luck to you, if that's the route you decide to go on."
"But, honestly folks, at the end of the day, just having the God-given talent, a pen and a piece of paper to draw on is really all you need to become an artist."
"Develop your skills early, be passionate and diligent in your work and you, at that point, will be well on your way to becoming an artist."
It doesn't matter what type of artist at that point.
"You, my friend are definitely an artist."
So no one told you life was going to be this way.
"Your job's a joke, you're broke, you're love life's DOA."
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear,"
"Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year."
"But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
I'll be there for you cause you're there for me too.
"You're still in bed at ten, the work began at eight."
"You've burned your breakfast, so far, things are going great."
"Your mother warned you there'd be days like these,"
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought down to your knees.
"That, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
"I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too."
"No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me."
Seems like you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me.
"Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with,"
"Someone I'll always laugh with even at my worst, I'm best with you."
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear,"
"Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year."
"But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
"I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too."

My eyes lit up.
"There was molecular powders,"
"Xanthan gum, tapioca maltodextrin, sodium alginate..."
Pretty much everything you need to make awesome risotto.
"(Scott) Risotto, it doesn't have to be fancy."
"You can't really use cayenne and a blast of this or a blast of that, you know, to really mask some of the subtle errors that you might be making."
Some kind of shellfish.
Either clams or scallops or mussels or shrimp.
Everyone else can see what's in the pantry.
I can only really cook with ingredients I know about.
Innovation is going to be a big challenge for me.
Wow.
"Some half-full baskets. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Some full baskets.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you were out there&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;right now,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what kind of risotto would you be doing? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Something super simple.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One ingredient.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;all the way through,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the onions when they go in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to toast the rice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;add the wine,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;burn the alcohol out,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more salt, make sure&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;your stock is seasoned.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I mean, there's a lot of balance here."
Mm-hmm.
You cannot rush a risotto.
"Okay, Frank, how's your rice coming?"
"So far, so good."
What would your family think if you get sent home on a risotto?
My dad would definitely break my balls.
Dave Mack.
"Yes, sir."
Flavor.
What are you doing?
"I got some white wine, butter."
I got the morels.
I know those have a nice flavor to 'em.
- Good luck.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Felix, how you feel up there?"
Good.
Hi.
- He used to memorize 2-4 pages a day..
"- but in the last portion of the Quran, he started memorizing.."
- .. 8pages a day!
-Masha'Allah
- and obviously he doesn't leave this institute?  - yes ofcourse.
"MashAllah Tabarak AlRahaman, Who encouraged him to memorize the Quran?"
"- No one encouraged him, he had personal desire to memorize the Quran."
"-MashAllah, as we know the one who memorizes the Quran must always be reviewing what he has memorized."
- How many pages does he review a day?
- He reviews 4 Chapters a day!
-MashAllah!
I ask Allah to bless him.
Chechnya
I have a small request..
Now that you have planned to memorize the Quran and started working on it...
Make sure you Do not Despair!
I know with this great Quran journey.. you will be facing many hardship and obstacles..
These obstacles should never let you stop what you are doing
"It should not let you say ""that's it.."
"Im going to stop memorizing the Quran"""
I have honestly met many people who have memorized upto 3 chapters and as soon as they faced a small obstacle.. they decided to stop memorizing the Quran!
Trust me when I say:
This is indeed from the Shaytaan.
"the honey, we know its sweet but we also know it was produced by the sharp needle on the bee! and just like the Quran, it is so great!"
Believe me..
"I have met many disabled people, they face so much hardship while memorizing the Quran but.."
They knew the great blessings behind memorizing the Quran.. so they did complete Memorizing the Quran with all these hardships and obstacles that you don't even face or will face [Since you are in good health] and if you have sincerely focused on this..Allah will ease every step you take because you want to memorize the book of Allah
Allah says:
"""And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways."""
Allah will make it easy way for you but make sure you do not despair!
The Old Grozny Institute - Chechnya
We had an ultimate visit to one the special institute here in Russia
I never take any cold showers for example.
And I cannot do all these nice exercises.
But I want to ask you something:  do you like organic food?
Can you raise your hand who likes organic food?
"Yeah, you are the problem."
"Because, every morning I fall into deep depression for ten seconds."
"Because, I sit on the toilet- (Straining sounds) and then, basically, I'll show you what it means."
I make excrement.
Like a baby.
And that's what you do as well.
But isn't it amazing?
"That's not one organic label which allows, my excrements are included, not one, whatever you do when- (Strains) never allows me to be involved."
And that's a problem.
"So, we are in deep shit, because we don't respect shit."
(Laughter)
"We can do a lot of innovations, we can look at things, and make them differently."
We can reduce our ecologic footprint.
"For example, people say,"
"""Please protect the environment; don't make so much waste."""
"Please protect the environment, don't use so much water;"
"""Please protect the environment; don't use your car so often."""
"So this is what we're calling ""environmental protection""."
When we destroy a little less.
"That's the same as if you say, ""Please, protect your child; beat your child only three times, instead of five times."""
We think we protect when we destroy less.
"But it's not protecting, it's only minimizing the destruction."
And this is where we are.
"We make waste all over the planet, and it looks crazy."
Why can't we make a different thing?
Why can't we make a footprint which is beneficial?
But this is what we do.
We try to be less bad.
Ok.
[Audience member]
How do you select text using the keyboard?
[Panelist]
"Um, I was alluding to that a little bit earlier."
"You select text by holding down, ah, the, I think Command A, will select all the text."
"Ah, command...."
[Other panelist]
I think it's Shift.
[Panelist answering question]
Shift.
I'm sorry.
"Yeah, if you hold down the Shift key."
"And then use, ah, either the Arrow keys, or the Option left and right arrows, you can select by character or word."
But you use the Shift key in the same way that you would in Windows.
"Um, You're holding down the Shift key and left and right arrow is going to select a character at a time."
And then Shift Command left and right arrow for example would allow you to select a word at a time.
"And then you would use of course your Command X, Command C, Command V, commands to either cut, copy, and then paste that selected text."
"Obviously, I'm not going to get into that demonstrated at the moment."
I can't even fix a misspelled word here.
"So, I don't want to, I don't want to press my luck here."
"Again, but you know that shows how I use it."
I do a lot of typing in meetings.
"And I just send raw text with loaded with mistakes right to um, there's a way to do that in email."
It goes to my email box as a text file--right in the email message.
"And then I can save it down, and then bring it into Notepad or Edsharp which I use a lot, or even Word if you want."
And then I just do most of my editing right on the PC itself.
"So, I don't do a lot of selecting of text on the i device, but you certainly can do it, and it does work."
[Other panelist]
"I've done it, and it does work very well."
[First panelist]
I should let you do that part.
How efficient has the planet become at capturing photons?
"Does it capture 50%, 10%, 1%, 1/10^(th) of a percent?"
A guess?
How many for 50% Hands up.
How many for 10%?
Hands up.
A couple.
How many for 1%?
Hands up.
How many for 1/10^(th) of a percent?
Hands up.
See the grad students think it's a 1/10^(th) of a percent.
It's a small amount.
"I don't know the precise number, but it's down between 1/10 and 1% I think."
"So even after 3.5 billion years of evolutionary history, the planet has not become terribly efficient at capturing sunlight."
Freeman Dyson has got this definition of different kinds of civilizations.
One of the stages of civilization would be when you can put a sphere around an entire solar system and capture all of the photons coming off of the sun and harness it for running a civilization.
That would capture the entire solar output.
"Well, you know, we are a tiny little dot on the face of the sun, and we're taking 1/10^(th) to 1% of its photons."
So this isn't a very big number when you look at the solar output.
"What happens is that basically algae, primarily algae, but also trees and all other larger plants, are capturing this."
Then the herbivores are eating the plants.
The primary carnivores are eating the herbivores.
The secondary carnivores are eating the primary carnivores.
"What do you think is in the red arrows, going off to the detritivores?"
"In simple Anglo-Saxon, four letter words, what do you think is in the red arrow?"
Shit and corpses.
Okay?
That's the red arrow.
It's pretty big.
Any idea what Africa would look like if you got rid of the dung beetles?
You would need hip-waders; especially in the Serengeti or any of the big national parks.
On my left hand I had an old tape recorder.
"In it, Jimmy hendrix played his e-guitar against the Vietnam war."
Then she wanted me to imrpovise with my voice.
She wanted me to see pictures from wars with my inner eye.
She wanted me to apologise for mankind.
It goes like this.
In my hand I was holding a gong and I hit it during singing.
In the end a long broad red cloth came down.
"When Ahmed brought the myrrh to Germany, the next steps are the following."
These lumps are of no use in this way.
In a plant in Hamburg these are destilled to take out the essence from it.
"We can easily imitate that, because we don't need it super-clean."
"I put some of the myrrh into this fountain, turn it on, and the essence is generated."
This product is made in Taiwan.
"And it reminds me of my homeland, because the rocks in our landscapes look similar."
"And the sound from the water is really convenient, because in the hot summer, you only want to flee to the mountains to cool down."
The most beautiful in Taiwan is the east coast at the Pacific.
"When you have time, go there, make a biking tour."
"It is very nice, noone around, you hear the waves."
Myrrh gets credited with the power to balance body and soul.
I wanted to try and answer some questions with this project.
The first was: what are the difficulties with the product myrrh?
"I did my last performance together with a japaneese DJ, Hito, and a composer from Hongkong, Kimho."
It was about things that only we understand.
My second question was:
"When a person grows up away from his homeland, and later goes back there, how is this?"
"Hito dee-yays with her orange kimono, Berlin-style minimal."
Forth question:
"When I work with Somalis as a German, what should I know?"
"I danced a taiwaneese dance hit, that everybody dances there."
"Primary school children, housewives, workers at the chinese new year party,"
Even the gods with their big masks dance it at festivals on the streets.
[indistinct]
"I dunno, they must not have noticed it's Six Flags Day."
I guess we're the only ones.
[yelling]
Now that's what I'm talking about!
Let's bring it in.
"You know, Brandon, Rollercoaster Day's not just about the thrill of g-forces and riding coasters with your friends, it's a lot more than that."
"It's about taking a day off work, taking a day off of school, and just going and having fun."
We don't have to go and fulfill our commitments.
We can take a day off and just ride rollercoasters together.
"Rollercoaster day this year falls on Wednesday, April 27th."
That means you're gonna have to ditch class and call in sick for work.
"Rollercoaster Day is an international event, so here's what you're gonna have to do."
"If you're in the Los Angeles area, over here,"
Join as at Six Flags Magic Mountain!
"If you live over here, find a theme park near you and go there."
"If you live over here, your theme parks might not be open yet so you gotta do some other fun activity"
"like snowboarding or ice skating or something, I dunno."
"If you're in the rest of the world, I'm gonna be honest -"
I have no idea what your weather / theme park situation is but the point is that you have to abandon your commitments and have a day of fun wherever you are.
All of these details will be up at http://facerocker.com/rcday2011.
Check over there to find a list of excuses to give your boss and also how to connect with other people in your area.
It's time to goof off!
I don't care!
Say that you got food poisoning!
Whatever it takes to have a day of fun.
"The best excuse, of course, is to retroactively show your teacher or boss this video."
That's probably -
That would win right there.
That'd get you fired.
[laughs]
"Don't do it to your boss, do it to your teacher."
"At 877 pounds, he is CRlMINALLY light for his size."
"Take a look at a real blue whale, which can grow to be up to twice as long as a Wailord."
"They weigh around 150-170 metric tons. or something around 350,000 pounds."
The difference in weight is so astronomical that it's absurd!
"In fact, at that weight and that height, if you estimate Wailord's volume with around a 20 by 48 foot cylinder,"
Wailord is actually less dense than air.
"Like, he'd float! in the Air!"
Like a Blimp! and that's when you realize
Wailord's the- the what?
The FLOAT whale pokémon.
AUGHHHHHHHHHHHH!
The official pokédex is a strange one and it usually crushes my dreams every time I learn about a pokémon's true size.
I might not ever be able to ride a Charizard but it's okay bec-. . .(begins sobbing) who am I kidding?
T n T (sniffles) This isn't okay at all!
I hate my life!
Thanks for watching today's video.
I encourage you: find your favorite pokémon in the pokédex and find out exactly how long they are and what they're weight is.
"I guarantee, 9 times out of 10 you'll be surprised."
Let me know in the comments section below if one of your favorite pokémon was a size you NEVER would have expected.

THE MlSSlNG PlECE
Baby basket
Today we're going to make a gift basket for a baby.
"We're going to make it look original, elegant and with an artisan touch."
I've used a basket which you can find in any shopping centre or home interiors store.
"I've chosen the wicker one but it could also be white, or whatever colour you want, or which matches best."
To decorate it I've used a few bows made from quilted fabric.
"I have made the rest of the material for the basket with this quilted fabric, but if you go to the shops and you've chosen a blanket or some fabric which you like, try and get it all to match, so if you buy a few satin bows then you can decorate it using the same colours."
"In my case, because I have got it made to measure, they've made me these bows which look great."
"For the base, since I want the things to show at the top and not end up with everything sitting in the bottom and not looking pretty, we can put a base of tissue paper, which is the paper which we use for patterns or for children's handicraft, and I'm going to scrunch it up to make a base."
This tissue paper is very lightweight so we have to scrunch it up.
Now I've got the base on which to arrange all the items.
"I've bought a blanket, a towel, a bib a coat hanger which we have personalised, and a teddy bear which matches the other items."
Since it's a personal gift and I wanted something more artisanal
"I've made a personalised picture on a piece of cloth, in a thick frame, which looks very good, and I've decorated the edge with the same pattern as the rest of the drawing."
"I'm going to put the picture here, and then I'll put in the blanket, the hanger, the towel, and the bear on this side."
"To finish the wrapping you can buy some celophane like this, wrap it all up towards the top, and put on a big bow to finish it."
So that's the baby's gift basket.
I hope that you like it and that you have fun making it.
Until next time!

-Get out of the dryer.
[laughter continues]
"-You know, when I wash my bitches, I make sure to dry them on medium heat."
"And I always make sure to throw in a dryer sheet,"
"'cause, you know, you don't want your bitches to get too clingy."
Why was that chick in the dryer anyway?
Was this a dare of some sort?
"Either way, this got about 100,000 views in over a month."
"If you notice when they pull her out, it looks like the dryer is giving birth to Snooki."
"And props to the guy who uploaded this footage, because you know, when your friend gets stuck in the dryer, your immediate reaction should be to be to pull out your cell phone and film it,"
'cause that's what friends are for.
I also noticed that one dude took full advantage of the situation and was like touching her ass.
"Now, I'm not condoning that, I'm just saying it happened."
"You know, I'd say this video deserves more than 100,000 views."
As long as you aren't watching it like...
"""Oh, s--t."
"That looks like a good idea."""
"Yeah, stay out of the dryer guys."
"Your dirty ass will leave all kinds of s--t in the lint trays. all right, this last video, I didn't want to cover it, 'cause it's kind of dumb, but admittedly, it's got over 8,000,000 views in four days."
Geezus.
"And I don't know why, but maybe you'll think it's funny."
"So there's this Chicago news show, and they're trying to get the destruction of this bridge live on film for their show."
"So they're live and they wait and they wait and they wait and they wait but the bridge doesn't blow up, so they cut away for a second."
-When we did the live remote of the guy dressed as a taco parachuting out of a plane into the plastic pool of salsa.
"-While we're stalling, go ahead and show the picture, but today, as we get going..."
-Are you kidding me?
Who did that?
-Wow!
-Are you kidding?
"-Yeah, they missed it."
"Yeah, fayul."
"See that's my new thing, it's not my new thing."
"We headed to one of the Quran Institues here in chechnya, and Indeed I was amazed from what I've seen"
Its as though the Dream is now Reality.
"Before I came to chechnya, I was told that they focus so much on their Quran [especially the kids]"
"But when I came here, I found their Institutes to be very different from the other Institutes."
Some of you may think that I am standing in a Random Public Garden or a park.
"No By Allah, I am standing in a park that belongs to Quran Institue"
A very distinguished Institute that has many things to help the students to memorize the Quran.
I wish that this dream comes to reality back in my country and in other countries as well.
"The dream of this great concern about the Book of Allah here in Chechnya, Come with me to check it out"
"This institute... has special Rooms for Their students a classes that fits their schedule well, and a Cafeteria that provides their daily meals."
"And they have a Masjid of their own, along with a wide green field, for the students to enjoy their break time"
"But Truly, the most Beautiful thing we found in this institute.."
"Is the Organized system of the institute, along with its discipline from the Hufadh of the Book of Allah Swt."
Who can start reciting for us a portion of what they have memorized from the Quran?
"MashaAllah TabarakAllah, Do you listen to Shaykh Abu Bakr Al Shatri?"
"-Yes he does -MashaAllah, May Allah make you"
-..become like Shaykh Abu Bakir al Shatri.
Congratulation to AbuBakr for having
-.. the kids of chechnya listening to him.
May This is all be found in his scale of good deeds
Institute of Shaykh Zayid - Chechnya.
while I was walking around the institute.. here in Chechnya
"The insititute of Shaykh Zayid for Quran Memorization and while I was listening to their beautiful recitation, I met a boy named Ikhwaan"
It was said to me that this young boy is 12 years old and has the Quran Memorized.
"MashaAllah Shaykh Adam, When did ikhwaan start memorizing the Quran? - he started memorizing as soon as we opened up this Institute which was 8months ago."
- He started memorizing 8 months ago? - yes he did.
"MashaAllah Tabarak AlRahman, he memorized the Quran only in 8months! honestly I am a little shocked because he doesn't speak Arabic right? - yes he doesnt."
"-But with that, his main focus was to memorize.."
-..the Quran in 8-9 months.
And he sure did.
MashaAllah.
- How many pages does he memorize a day?
"One looking at a half a million, a million, and two million seeds per acre drilled, and broadcasting, where we just toss it out on the ground."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Another big question is simply determining when in the fall we need to plant, so I have successive planting dates, starting at September 1, all the way up here to November 30."
And looking at what is the best time to plant.
Can we do it right after corn?
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So the pennycress is crop that you're using to put into the field in the alternate season.
"So you're still going to have corn or beans, and then this goes in afterwards?"
Win Phippen:
Yes.
"Typically, on pennycress, we would follow corn."
So you would plant after the corn comes out.
"And this would form a rosette, just a bundle of leaves, into the fall, it will overwinter just fine."
And it will start flowering in early spring.
And it will be at this stage by the end of May.
And you would hope to harvest that by the first week of June.
And then you'll plant a full season of soybean right behind it.
And so the real niche for this crop is growing off-season crop production.
"It's called ""double cropping."""
Beth Seaton:
And this is what the Field Day is going to be about tomorrow; people are going to come out so they can
learn more about pennycress and what you're doing out here?
Win Phippen:
Absolutely.
We're trying to answer all the basic questions you would ask on any sort of new crop you're introducing.
"Because this is strictly for the bio-diesel market, we're not making a feed crop or anything like that."
It's strictly for off-season bio-diesel production.
So we've got a lot of studies out here.
"What we'll look at, in terms of, what kind of nitrogen does it need?"
"My belief is that if I can make difference in your life, if I can touch you in a way that you feel that you are able to overcome adversity, then I have done my job."

"Stephen Hopson, a man of integrity who has overcome great adversity with great passion."
He will inspire you and your organization to transform adversity into an opportunity for success.
"From page 168 to 169,"
Jesus's character says:
"""Those who love me"""
"""are in all existing systems."""
"""They are buddhists or mormons,"""
"""baptists or muslims,"""
"""democrats and republicans,"""
"""and others that don't vote and"""
"""are not part of any religious institution."""
"""There are bankers, players,"""
"""americans and iraquians,"""
"""jews and palestinians."""
"""I do not want you to become christians."""
"""But I want to join them in their process"""
"""to transform into sons and daughters of Dad."""
"""Into brothers and sisters, into my beloved."""
"These are the words of Jesus, of his character, the main character of the book."
It is an interesting sentence.
"Indeed, says that Jesus can be anywhere."
Any system.
But what called my attention was the affirmation:
"""I do not want you to become christians."""
"And, depending on what christian is, the word ""christian"" in each person's mind can have different meanings."
"And, depending on what christian is,"
Jesus doesn't want us to become christians.
"So you can understand this, about the designation ""christian"", the word ""christian"", you will find people with completely different ideas."
Antagonistic.
"You will find Ku Klux Klan, who were protestant christians. and Martin Luther King."
Scientists were studying sharks off the coast of Florida using an acoustic tracking system.
"In the shallow bay, a locator signal every 15 minutes tracked their movements."
"Then one day, the sharks just disappeared."
And no one knew why.
"At the time, people had bigger problems."
A category four storm was bearing down on the Gulf Coast.
[thunder]
"Analyzing the data, scientists discovered sharks detected the drop in barometric pressure preceding the storm."
They bolted from their shallow nursery to the safety of deeper waters.
"Twelve hours later,"
Hurricane Charlie ripped across Florida.
"When the storm was over, the sharks returned."
"Reef sharks kick off the Survivor countdown because, thanks to incredible senses, they dodge disaster."
"Other animals are not so lucky-- battling adversity for days, months, or years."
One fifth of the Earth's surface is desert.
Baking hot.
Bone dry.
To survive here takes a special kind of animal... and special humans to catch them.
"In the Outback of Australia, these guys are hunting the next survivor sprinting into number 9-- the camel."
"Introduced in the 19th century, camels thrived in the arid land."
Now they're pests.
Rounded up and sent back to the Middle East.
Try running through a desert without water or shade... and you'd be dead in a day.
Camels barely break a sweat.
Camels can go eight days without water.
One secret for survival is on their back.
Camels store fat--not water-- in their hump.
It's a portable pantry.
"By burning all the fat in its hump, a camel can survive without food for up to a month."
"When a camel finds water, it soaks it up like a sponge."
A thirsty animal chugs 30 gallons in 13 minutes.
"Try that at home, and your blood cells would burst."
"Next, position yourself behind her."

"You Majesty, if the Queen Mother finds out about this ..."
What has happened?
I couldn't even ask because of the leery mood in the royal kitchen.
I don't know why but every one's avoiding me.
"No matter what, we need to find the head chef."
Your Highness.
Do you know something?
Tell me.
It's just ... if she isn't dead...
I once heard when eunuchs were talking of a place ...
"From the basement corridor of the main building, past the  workers area, there is a passage to a lower floor entrance"
The place has no daylight and dust snows down all day ...
"There are people who study psychology,whoever studies  Pirkei Avot in depth understands the depths of a person's soul on an amazing level."
There is a lecture series on the Hidabroot website about Pirkei Avot and people tell me how much  it benefits them when they study the wisdom of Chazal in  Pirkei Avot.
In general you know that Torah study enhances your knowledge.
"If a person goes to a lecture for a few months,he feels a change."
"In fact it says abut our Torah that if you ""turn it and turn it you'll find everything in it"" Just like a box that has all kinds of objects in it,if you turn it you'll find everything in it."
Same for the Torah.Whatever you  want you can find.
"For example,when a person learns  Pirkei Avot it's as if he took a course in psychology.He learns""He who is rich is happy with his lot"""
"""He who is mighty,conquers his evil inclination"""
We have a lot of crowding issues.
"That's kind of the major issue, right?"
"Because you can see that our titin, which is in green, is really not allowing any space."
"Or there is no space, really."
"And so, these ends, remember these are our z-discs right here."
This is Z and this is Z over here.
Our z-discs are right up against our myosin.
"In fact, there's almost no space in here."
This is all crowded on both sides.
There's no space for the myosins to actually pull the z-disc any closer.
"So because there's no space for them to work, they really can't work."
"And really, if you give them ATP and say, go to work."
"They're going to turn around and say, well, we've got no work to do, because the z-disc is already here."
"So in terms of force of contraction for this scenario one, I would say, you're going to get almost no contraction."
"So when the length is very low, so let's say this is low."
Maybe low is not a good word for length.
"Let's say this is, I'll use the word short."
The sarcomere is short.
And here the sarcomere is long.
"So when it's short, meaning this distance is actually very short, then we would say the amount of tension is going to be actually zero."
Because you really can't get any tension started unless you have a little bit of space between the z-disc and the myosin.
"So now in scenario two, let's say this is scenario two."
And this is my one circle over here.
"In scenario two, what happens?"
"Well, here you have a little bit more space, right?"
So let's draw that.
Let's draw a little bit more space.
Let's say you've got something like that.
"And I'm going to draw the other actin on this side, kind of equally long, of course."
I didn't draw that correctly.
"Because if it's sliding out, you're going to have an extra bit of actin, right?"
Something like that.
"""Nice and quiet around here."""
"If there was more land, then he bought some more pigs, a few chickens and some cows."
"""Well that's a fine kettle of fish."""
You know what!
All that grubbing around outside takes far too long.
We're going to fatten you up and fast.
It's not a fairytale storybook.
You're there to be eaten.
"""Errrrr ... not sure that's such a compliment, really."""
"We'll squeeze you altogether nice and efficiently, and you'll all get sick right away."
"""You're telling me ..."""
"Listen Piggy, I'm not interested in your personal vision right now."
"In the Netherlands alone, you lot produce 70 billion kilos of dung, do you know how bad that is for the environment and the climate?"
"""Uh ..."
"I'm sorry for living."""
"Did you know that cows of all farm animals are the largest producers of greenhouse gasses, mostly through all that belching and farting?"
Do you know what the problem is?
You're eating us out of house and home!
"""Who was here so pleased about fattening us up?"""
"But all that food has to come from somewhere, doesn't it?"
So ... we destroy the rainforests and plant soya crops instead.
But the rainforests are really important for the absorption of carbon dioxide.
Then we spray the stuff with pesticides and we ship the soya off the Europe where it ends up in your feeding-troughs.
So well-organised.
What are you people up to?
"""Oh-oh, well that's not our fault."
"Who actually wants to eat meat anyway?"""
"The consumer, OK, is there something wrong with that?"
Well.
"That's a good question, who actually eats so much meat?"
Eating meat is a luxury that we've got all rather too used to.
Don't dare touch our steaks!

"In the summer of 1995 under my grandfather's favorite reading chair, I found a tattered"
Webster's International Dictionary.
In the back were ganged together and printed all the wonderful images from the book; a little universe of 19th century America.
"Little did I know I was about to devote the next 10 years of my life to organizing and printing 4,000 of these little blocks."
The Merriam Webster Company gifted these engravings to Yale University in 1977.
They now live in the press room of the Arts of the Book Collection.
I was enthralled when I first had a chance to see the engravings themselves.
I was fascinated by the numbers stamped and written onto their sides.
I spent much of 1997 identifying and organizing the collection into categories.
"I estimate there are about 13,000 of these little blocks."
Here are carriages and footware.
I used photocopies from the dictionaries to identify the blocks.
I then culled the images I was to print and organized them alphabetically.
Each engraving was logged out as part of a special loan agreement.
"At Quercus Press engravings were cleaned, often revealing amazing manuscript."
Most engravings were not type-high.
"Using various bits of paper, the engravings could be made"
level and raised so they could be printed properly.
Each engraving was then measured for labeling.
The latin names were added for flora and fauna.
The labels were then cast on my 1938 Model 8 linotype machine.
The linotype is really 3 machines at once.
"It composes a line of type, passes it, then redistributes it."
It's all done used these little brass mats.
"6 divided by 287 and that gives me 0.021, carrying one extra significant figure."
"And if I now take that probability and I plug this into here, I've already done a calculation."
I got a table here.
I find that that diameter to the correct number of significant figures is 0.7.
And the actual diameter of these balls is 0.8.
So you guys did a very great job.
[APPLAUSE]
All right.
This works.
That's how they calculated the diameter of the nucleus.
That's it.
Nothing else involved in this.
That is the principle behind how it was done.
Very simple.
That is the principle behind how the quark was discovered and the size of the quark was revealed.
That is terrific.
"Now, we've got the problem that the scientific community had in 1911, 1912, right after the discovery of the nucleus."
"And the problem is, now we know the atom has got a nucleus, we know it has got an electron, what is the structure of the atom?"
How does the electron and the nucleus hang together?
"In particular, what we have to do is we have to ask what is the force of attraction that keeps the nucleus and the electron together?"
"We are going to talk, here, about this classical description of the atom."
And we've got to talk about the force of the interaction first.
"Well, there are four known fundamental forces."
What is the force that is the weakest force?
Gravity.
Absolutely.
What is the force that is the next stronger force?
Electromagnetic.
Absolutely.
What is the next stronger force?
Weak force.
And the next force?
"Roller skates, reservoirs, anything."
And they will go break that in your home.
"If people have access to the necessities of life, they don't kill, they don't steal, if they are educated properly also."
"Now, for the people that are afraid that there is a bunch of scientists, you would work on the area D, all that is bull."
All that is what you get from the television shows.
There is no need to control people.
"None or whatsoever, in an abundant society."
"We don't want people to have houses, and then go out and buy the furniture."
"We think that, like your automobile."
"You don't have to buy seats, it comes with everything."
So we want to mold all that in the house.
"Jacque and Roxanne build models for films they make, to spread the message of The Venus Project."
"So people say, all my buildings are alike."
They are not.
"If you carefully look at them, there is a widest range of variables."
"Some people say, i don't know that i want to live in a dome."
Your brain is in a dome.
You have been living in a dome all your life.
This is how we make our apartments.
"We change the dive, they changes the shape."
And then pressure.
"Moves a composite material forward, then we cut it."
And then this machine lifts it.
"And this machine, in certain improvement onto that."
Do you understand?
"No humans do any work, any kind of work at all."
Except what you would like to do.
"Art, music, play right, travel, scuba diving."
It wont take 7000 or less people to run everything on Earth.
You need everybody anymore.
"With the advent of automation and nanotechnology, we will make machines enabled to do most of the work."
"There is no such thing as Utopia, as the best as you can design up to now."
"Key to a healthy diet is a variety of foods, a variety of colors."
You get everything from this.
"And then you build your walls with the legumes, the beans."
"And you got the whole grains, the wheat, the pasta, the spaghetti, the rice, the breads, and on top, your roof, you get your nuts and seeds."
"You can get everything from this, everything."
"All your vitamins, A, B, C. Vitamin D from the sun."
"You get all your calcium , all your iron, your omega-3, all your protein and amino acids."
"Everything from this, everything."
"Now I know I am a skinny white dude with glasses telling you to get enough protein, but these guys aren't skinny."
Only one of them is white.
"So as you can see these guys, their diet consists of no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
There might be some variations.
"Tony Gonzalez, he might be eating fish."
Don't hold me to it.
"But I know Prince Fielder, who is the 2009 home run derby king, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
"Mac Danzig, who fights in the ultimate fighter, he is a season 1 champion, UFC fighter, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
So you can still excel at your sports.
You can still gain muscle mass on a plant based diet.
"Again, just remember the gorilla."
So what do they eat?
"Instead of dairy everything a meat eater, a dairy eater an egg eater eats,"
"I eat as well, that just comes in plant form."
"No cruelty involved, no cholesterol, high in fiber."
And these are all the processed food.
This is the transition food.
This is where you go when you go from eating meat and you make that switch.
Instead of poultry.
Instead of beef.
"Garden burger, veggie burger."
"Right here what you see up here, this is one of the best items on the market."
"Again, not the healthiest food in the world, but certainly better than your meat."
This is called the Riblets.
lots of opportunities for students.
Beth Seaton:
That's wonderful.
So tell me how you're involving students in the project.
Win Phippen:
Great!
"A lot of private seed companies, breeding seed companies, especially for corn and soybeans, are trying to get students re-energized about the field of plant breeding."
"And so this grant allows for students to do internship projects, and that's on the entire summer, time to work with these private companies."
"And so, this year, we have four interns."
One is at Pioneer Hybrid
Another one is over at Iowa State University.
And another one is with the USDA in Peoria.
And I have another one here at Western.
"And another one that is at the University of illinois,"
learning about bio-energy crops.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Tell me about why plant breeding is important to the USDA and to the general population.
Because I don't really know too much about plant breeding.
Win Phippen:
"Well, a plant breeder is the person who takes undomesticated plants."
These are plants that haven't been considered for commercial production.
"Let's say a plant has a very strong, sort of, pharmaceutical properties to it."
And we want to a...
"Instead of trying to synthetically make in the labs, sometimes it is easier to have the plants produce these particular compunds."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And so the plant breeder is the one who would go out in the wild, collect up the wild plants of these particular species, and they'd start doing some crosses."
And they would try to make different combinations of these plants to create a plant that would be suitable for commerical production.

TED Conference Los Angeles 2009
Hans's theme:
8 minutes on HlV
The HlV problem in Africa is not due to poverty.
"The poorer you are, the lower the risk of your having HlV."
The richer part of the continent has more HlV than the poorer.
We don't know why HlV is so common in eastern and southern Africa.
In Ghana less than 3% are infected and in Senegal less than 1%.
But sexual differences between cultures is a sensitive issue so no one does research into it.
They research other things instead.
- Is it a cultural issue?
- It's probably multiple partners.
In parts of southern and eastern Africa the majority of the adult population has 2-3 sex partners.
"It's not that it's a cultural norm or rule, but it is accepted."
There are cultural roots and it's accepted.
It's also related to the fact that sex is a bartering tool.
When you sell your maize you offer sexual favors to raise the price.
Let's see if I...
We've got a lot of information here.
This is very important...
"A yearbook photo, 7th grade class at the Domarringen school."
This is Agneta Thordeman.
We went to school together and have lived together for 40 years.
She started working in healthcare early on and that got me interested.
I decided to apply to medical school.
"In 1972, halfway through med school"
Hans and Agneta took a trip to India.
Visiting medical students in Bangalore
Hans Rosling became aware of his own prejudices about the world.
"I don't like these one halves lying around, so let's multiply both sides, this equation, by 2."
I'm just gonna multiply both sides by two.
"So, on the left hand side, I'm just left with (a+b) squared, and on the right hand side, I'm left with 2ab and then two times one half c squared, i.e., plus c squared."
What happens if you multiply out (a+b) times (a+b)?
We get (a+b) squared.
That is a sq. + 2ab+ b sq. = 2ab + c sq.
"Subtracting 2ab from both sides, we are left with, a sq. + b sq. = c sq. i.e. the Pythagorean theorem."
OK.
"What we see here, is a 3D maze."
"It's actually HTML, CSS3, and a bit of Javascript but the CSS3 is 3-dimensional CSS."
"What we've got is a whole bunch of cubes, stacked in bars, and we've got one red ball in the upper left corner."
"And I can move that ball with the buttons up on top to the right, down..."
Why?
"Because there's cubes that are opened and cubes that are closed, which are part of the maze set-up."
"The proof of concept is created with one singular maze, in the end product it will be possible to incorporate different mazes."
I can move the ball by clicking the correct button.
"I just went right and as you see, there's a little marker line that says I moved to a different bar."
"Now I can't go anywhere else,"
"I can go back left, that's where I came from,"
"I can go back right or come forth, and this way"
I can walk through the entire maze.
The objective of the maze is to clear the maze.
"Rather, the objective of the game is to clear the maze."
"On this side there is one more block open, that has no front."
"If I go through there,"
I'm out of the maze and I will not be able to use any of the buttons anymore.
"I can only go back and forth, I can go down, and I can walk my way all around through the maze."
Just like this.
"Oops, can't do that."
I can come forth and left and forth and left...
"Well, you get the idea."
Now this maze obviously is quite simple.

Welcome my dear prince and take this young beauty with you
If you give me your hand I will take.. ..you atop the elephant with me
Arrange for the musical band for our marriage.
I will come with you
This girl has eagerly accepted my proposal
Let us come together and steal each others hearts
Talk sweetly and open the treasure of my beauty
You too became intelligent
Because you pampered me
I laid a path of jasmines for you.
Come to me running
I heart found the priest of love and could not escape from him
Be the deity in the temple of my heart
I am intoxicated with your love and come to you
I will blow away with you like a gale
My shyness became an hurdle
I will drive it away by kissing your cheek
Drown me with your kisses and lift me in your embrace
Become the beautiful day once and a lovely night once
We must be exited each time we embrace
I lost all my prestige.
"When he was kissing you in front of your father.. ..and everybody, you didnt say a single word."
She is being ecstatic about it.
You took an oath by your mother.. ..does he became important than her?
I took oath of mom that I will act in movies not to forget him.
It is unnecessary for me to live any more.

"Hooray!"""
Next began the binding process.
"For hundreds of years, binders have cut and folded sections this way."
"The Pictorial Webster's had over 5,000 sections to fold."
The sections have holes punched for sewing.
"Using a sewing frame, the books are sewn on double flexible rolled linen tapes with supported kettles."
"Because the sewing is so time consuming, I invited 11 bookbinders to Strong Arm Bindery in Maine where we managed to sew 50 books in a weekend."
"After a book is sewn the spines are pasted up, the edges are trimmed,"
the book is rounded and backed.
The edges are prepared for decoration and edge decoration is applied using rubber stamps.
The endbands are sewn.
The spine is lined with airplane linen and paper and a hollow is formed on the book.
Boards are attached.
"The leather is pared,"
"it gets wetted out, then pasted up."
There was one huge possibility created by the emergence of money as a system of mutual trust.
A possibility that would revolutionize world history.
It was the idea that you could rely on people to borrow money from you and pay it back at some future date.
"That's why the root of credit is ""credo"""
"...then, a man who says he has absolutely no sexual desire at all is taking you inside the world of asexuals."

"Well, it may seem like sex is everywhere these days, but it's not on the mind of David Jay."
He says he has absolutely no sexual desire whatsoever.
He's here to tell us about living as an asexal and why there are a lot more people like him than you think.
"Please welcome the founder of asexuality.org,"

David:
Thank you.
Elisabeth:
"We're gonna be,"
"I just want to let parents know at home, we're gonna be talking about some mature material here."
"So, if there are kids in the room, you may want to have them go somewhere else for a little bit."
"Um, we're going to give you a second to do that."
Star:
"She's the mother, she made sure of that."
[laughter]
Elisabeth:
Exactly.
Elisabeth:
"Um, you actually define yourself as an asexual."
You have an organization.
You're pretty much the spokesperson for asexuality.
"You have this organization with, what?"
"6,000 members?"
So then we're in trouble.
If the three columns of my matrix -- if those three vectors happen to lie
"in the same plane -- for example, if column three is just the sum of"
"column one and column two, I would be in trouble."
That would
"be a matrix A where the answer would be no, because the combinations --"
"if column three is in the same plane as column one and two,"
I don't get anything new from that.
All the combinations are in the
plane and only right-hand sides b that I could get would be the ones
in that plane.
So I could solve it for some
"right-hand sides, when b is in the plane,"
but most right-hand sides would be out of the plane and unreachable.
So that would be a singular case.
The matrix would be not invertible.
There would not be a solution for every b.
The answer would become no
for that.
Okay.
I don't know -- shall we take just
a little shot at thinking about nine dimensions?
Imagine that we have
vectors with nine components.
"Well, it's going to be hard to"
visualize those.
I don't pretend to do it.
"But somehow, pretend you do."
Pretend we have -- if this was nine
"equations and nine unknowns, then we would have nine columns,"
and each one would be a vector in nine-dimensional space and we would
be looking at their linear combinations.

Gadejuristen - The Danish Street Lawyers
My name is Nanna Gotfredsen and I am a street lawyer in Copenhagen.
We are at the open drug scene right now.
It's just behind the main station in Copenhagen and we have had an open drug scene here for 30 years- 25 or 30 years.
"What we are doing here with our bike is that we are sending out a legal team providing users, homeless people, and outdoor sex workers with legal advice and legal assistance."
It's the package:
"Pump, filter, water, injection needle."
We have several kinds of needles that we can offer.
"If you don't use these, then we have some bigger ones and we also have a pump that is bigger."
But this is what you have in the ordinary set here and also alcohol cleaner.
And this is a J-Key card.
Information for safer injection.
This is a question and then you have the answer on the other side.
There is not doubt that law enforcement cannot prevent people from using drugs.
Using drugs has other reasons than whether it is criminalised or not.
When the police is targeting the open drug scenes you can only make it worse for drug users.
They are fighting so hard to stay alive and we can see that from the constantly high death rate in Denmark
This is our office - The street lawyer.
"Drug users, homeless people and all of them are here with us."
"We can be like 30 or 40 people up here, and so we would like some more space."
Homeless people are having their clothes and things and papers and things like that in the office.
"First, he promoted people based on merit, rather than family position, and, second, he brought lower classes of conquered people into his own tribe, while dispossessing the leaders of the conquered clans."
Thus he made peasants love him.
"The rich hated him, but they didn't matter anymore, because they were no longer rich."
"With these two building block policies,"
"Temujin was able to win the loyalty of more and more people and, in 1206, he was declared the Great Khan, the leader of all the Mongols."
How?
"Well, the Mongols chose their rulers in a really cool way."
"A prospective ruler would call a general council, called a kuriltai, and anyone who supported his candidacy for leadership would show up on their horses,"
literally voting with their feet.
Child John:
Mr. Green!
Mr. Green!
But horses don't have feet; they have hooves.
John:
"I hate you, Me From The Past."
"ALSO, NO INTERRUPTlNG THE THOUGHT BUBBLE!"
"After uniting the Mongols, Genghis Khan went on to conquer a lot of territory."
"By the time he died, in his sleep, in 1227, his empire stretched from the Mongol homeland, in Mongolia, all the way to the Caspian Sea."
"Thanks, Thought Bubble."
"So that's a pretty good looking empire and, sure, a lot of it was pasture, or mountains, or desert, but the Mongols did conquer a lot of people, too."
"And, in some ways, with Genghis' death, the empire was just getting started."
"His son, Ögödei Khan, expanded the empire even more, and Genghis' grandson, Möngke, was the Great Khan in 1258 when Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Empire, fell to the Mongols."
"And, another of Genghis' grandsons, Kublai Khan, conquered the Song Dynasty, in China, in 1279."
"And, if the Mamluks hadn't stopped another of Genghis' grandsons, at the battle of Ain Jalut, they probably would have taken all of North Africa."
"Man, Genghis Khan sure had a lot of grandkids."
"Well, it must be time for the open letter."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
An open letter to Genghis Khan's descendants.
"Oh, but, first, let's check what's in the secret compartment today."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
"Oh, a noisemaker and champagne poppers."
"Stan, you know I suck at these."
So that's choice D.
"The hard part here, as far as I'm concerned, is just understanding the problem and their diagram."
And then just seeing the pattern that you're just switching the letters.
First you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
Then you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
"Until you get back to A, B, C."
Next problem.
White I don't think is colorful enough.
Let me do magenta.

In a set of 11 different numbers-- they're different- which of the following cannot affect the value of the median?
"So it's a set of 11 different numbers, they're different, so let's say it's 1 through 11."
That's 11 different numbers.
"And in this case, what's the median?"
"Well we have 5 on this side, 5-- the median is this, this is the middle number, right?"
6 is the middle number.
"Doubling each number-- well, if you double every number, the median's going to become 12, so that's not right."
"Increasing each number by 10-- once again, if you increase all of these numbers by 10, this number's going to be 16, so you would've changed the median."
Increasing the smallest number only.
"Well, what if you increase the smallest number to,"
"I don't know, 12?"
So then this 12 would go all the way on the other side right?
And then the median would move to 7 because you would have to have 5 below the median and 5 above the median.
So you can increase that smallest number.
"But if you increase it by a large enough amount, it kind of goes into the greater than the median column and then the median would have to shift to the right."
"Try it out, write out the list from 2 to 12, and then the median becomes 7."
"OK, so we know that choice B is not right."
"Choice C, increasing-- oh no, that was choice C-- choice D, decreasing the largest number only-- well, the same argument can apply."
"We could take the 11 and decrease it down to,"
"I don't know, decrease it to 0."
It was only a spelling mistake
I am the Math Monster
"I am not very good at spelling and .. why are you here? why am I here? huh, why am I here? ...hang on a minute well, 2 plu2 is 4 and 2 times2 is also 4 it is obvious that you are confused  in your Math and I am here due to your lies."
lies? lies?what lies? the lie where you said that you have done your homework and you have not done it. your'e the lier! ok then what is 2307.5 by one?
2307 by one? no!
"2307.5 by one ah, 2370.5 by one? yes , tell me"
"I know that one, I studied it no, you did not study it yes I did, no you didn't no, yes ay, couldn't we have entered in a more civilized manner? no , because we are not human we are not civilized"
"Is this the castle of lies? no, yes make up your minds won't you? well of course it is. you could say it is this little girl is lying through her teeth this little girl said she did her Math homework but no, it is not true she has not done it , No!"
"look, I am not a lier"
"I have witnesses ay yes , of course , ah yes ok then I will go and get them"
I will go look for them don't take too long
"Ay Sir Pigwig , what good fortune"
"Ah, Griselda,  how are you on such a beautiful day? super ah, this makes me very happy knowing that you and your family are very well very well, actually what is happening is that I did not do my Math homework and I need someone to say that I did ."
Do you think you could help me?
Lie?
Lie for you? in such difficult times? and for such a beautiful damsel as you
YES
Where are you Sir Pigwig? ah ha ha ha
"Now let's see...what is 2 plus 2? ah, ah and two times 2 4, 4 , but what have I done that you should treat me thus?"
You have colaborated with  the lies of grumbly girl
"Griselda, my name is Griselda"
"OK, ok, Griselda aha, and now , what do you say? what is 2307.5 by one? think about it well did you do your Math homework or not? ahh so, you see ha, I knew it you don't know the difference between adding and multiplication well, I can see there is a relationship when I add a lie, my problems multiply ha,ha,ha..."
Griselda
"Griselda, the only solution add-subtract multiply-divide they are all opposites they cancel out add, subtract."
"Multiply, divide.."
"lies? what is the opposite of lies? ha, ha, ha... the truth is the opposite of lies and you need to say it before everyone."
"OK, I'll do it!"
Ladies and gentlemen... people of the kingdom
I can see that I have caused anguish  with my lies
"I have caused anguish for everyone and so, I have decided to tell you all that I..."
I did not do my math homework! ha ha ha... what? huh? huh? hey guys guys... she confessed! she confessed! ay no! we're dead!!!
2 times 2 is four that means that two plus two is 4 ah!
"I'm Moopheus, and I know a lot about you."
Have you heard of the Meatrix?
The Meatrix?
Do you want to know what it is?
OK.
"The Meatrix is all around you, Leo."
It is the story we tell ourselves about where meat and animal products come from.
This family farm is a fantasy.
"Take the blue pill and stay here in the fantasy, take the red pill and I will show you the truth."
Welcome to the real world.
Whoah!
What is this horrible place?
"This is a factory farm, Leo."
"Places like this are where most eggs, milk and meat come from."
How did this happen?
I'll show you.
"In the mid 20th century, greedy agriculture corporations began modifying sustainable family farming to maximize their profits at great cost to both humans and animals."
Factory farming was born.
Animals are packed as closely together as possible.
"Most never see sunlight, touch ground or get fresh air."
Many can't even turn around.
These cruel conditions cause fights and disease amongst the animals.
"To fix this, the corporate machine began systematic mutilation, practices such as de-beaking chickens."
"And they started adding a constant dosage of antibiotics to their feed, just to keep these poor wretches alive."
This overuse of antibiotics breed super strains of resistant disease-causing germs.
Every day we get closer to an epidemic that cannot be stopped.
Eeeuw!
What's that smell?
12 million pounds of excrement!
This pollutes the air and ground water.
That's why communities near factory farms often suffer from high levels of related sicknesses.
"Well, it smells like shhhhh ..."
"And what is more, Factory Farming corporations have been destroying communities and mistreating their workers for decades."
"Since 1950, over 2 million small hog farms have disappeared."
If they continue at this rate there'll be no real independent family farms left.
"That is the Meatrix, Leo."
The Lie we tell ourselves about where our food comes from.
"But it's not too late, there is a resistance."
Count me in!
Washington.
"City of politicians, policymakers, lobbyists and activists."
Think of the seals when you buy your meals.
Boycott Canada!
Today there's a demonstration against the seal hunt is held at the Canadian Embassy.
Think of the seals when you buy your meals.
Boycott Canada!
"This demonstration was organised by the Humane Society of the United States,"
America's largest animal welfare organisation with 10 million members.
"30 minutes later I have an appointment on Capitol Hill with Wayne Pacelle, the president of the Humane Society."
Hi.
- Welcome to the United States.
"Welcome to Washington, our nation's capital."
- Thank you.
We are so proud of what you've accomplished in Holland with your election.
We all took note last November of how you were elected and you're the first Party for the Animals in the world to achieve this.
"- Yes, that's true."
So thank you and we look forward to learning about what you have done.
"Oh, OK."
So nice to meet you finally.
You are the biggest organisation on animal welfare?
"Yes, we are."
"We have ten million supporters here in the United States in terms of paying supporters, and then of course we have millions more who believe in what we are doing, and we are here to organise that sentiment to achieve political reforms for animals, among doing other things."
"We try to pressure corporations to do the right thing and we educate the public, and we do hands-on care of animals as well."
But the political work here in Congress is very important.
Boon
"Pick for me from your hair, a quaff"
That coats me
My whole poem and words aren't sufficient for you
Your depiction needs special language
Spun from my blood
With my last call from my mouth
With my dream paste
Guarded with my pall
And the dialect of your depiction
Come out in one word
"O girl, gypsy girl"
Put your wound over me like tattoo or Henna
Fall over me as tidings
Blessed from heaven
"If death came to me,"
I swear I wouldn't hide
"Because I gained from life everything I want a quaff, a song , and a bead against envy,,"" (audience clapping)"
"At the end,"
"I want to tell that women,"
I really miss you
It was my mother's death that stopped me from traveling
I miss her very much
I failed to write something about you.
Thanks
So Ghost Ship.
Now Ghost Ship is a movie that gets better with every subsequent viewing and one thing about a Val Lewton film is it's generally very short.
"So you could watch this thing a couple times in a day, and start to really unpack its poetry."
"The sur, surface story of the film is quite simple."
"You have a young officer who comes on board a boat, finds that the senior officer is crazy."
"The senior officer tries to kill the young officer, and the senior officer dies instead."
"In fact, it's a story that's so thin, Frank Borzage might like it."
We need to start the education of children now about it.
To prevent the seeds of  bullying from ever being planted.
I realize that this is no easy task.
"But the more effort we make, the  greater our impact will be."
We can do it!
"The next time you see someone put down or picked on, don't remain silent."
Speak up.
Take action.
Help them.
"If we come together, we  can put an end to bullying."
That is my dream.
[applause]
Thank you all so very much.
Have a wonderful evening.
"I'm an ecologist, mostly a coral reef ecologist."
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight.
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years.
"I mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet."
And that was what I did.
"And I ended up in Jamaica, in the West Indies, where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary, structurally, that I ever saw in my life."
"And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things:"
"First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white."
"The other thing it shows you is that, although there's this beautiful forest of coral, there are no fish in that picture."
"Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years."
We were the best and the brightest.
"People came to study our reefs from Australia, which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs."
"And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be, was based on these reefs without any fish."
"Then, in 1980, there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen."
I put half the lab up in my house.
The wind blew very strong.
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high.
"And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed, and we thought, ""Well, we're real smart."
Is it Ole Bull that you rank highest within Norwegian music?
"Yes, Norwegian classical music."
Why?
Because he was a great man.
And he was  allowed to be that because it was deserved.
Because he lead Norway onto the world map.
He  was the first man to promote Norwegian folk music.
He was able to get national scene in Bergen which was the first cultural place we had.
"He started Ibsen, Bjornson - a national hero."
But you want to play in the movie about Ole Bull?
"Yes, I would have loved to do that."
"I'm probably a bit too dark and talk a bit too much eastern-Norwegian, but, yes, if I practiced enough."
Can you give an example of Ole Bull?
"That's ...um ""Norway in a nutshell"", ""Seterjentens sondag"""
"You can almost see the cow walking across the grass, sort of."
What does music mean to you?
It's nothing more and nothing less than a mood setting.
Sometimes you really want just to be happy when you're sad or you just really want to feel something.
You really want to fall in love with your wife again and there it's probably not the best choice to listen to Eminem right then.
If you really want it music has the ability to bring the feelings you want to have.
Does it do this for you?
"Yes, absolutely."
The one thing I'm still to understand is people who go to see their favorite artist on a festival and there are those who just go to festivals to listen to some artists.
And then I can't understand what you get out of it when you go to those concerts and not caring for those artists.
"But of course, there is a relation - it's great."
"And me, I love festivals but every time I'm asked to join a festival as audience"
I always make sure to see who's playing.
"""Oh, I'm only able to go on Friday"" ""OK, who's playing on Friday?"" ""I don't know""."
You have to find out what you're going to listen to.
You have always had a discipline; you have practiced a lot ever since you were a little boy.
Do you still have that discipline?
The thing is that as a classical kid it went straight  to my blood that you had to practice 2 hours a day.
Why aren't they talking now?
Why don't they take Agi's side now and support her?
"I don't understand Why aren't all psychologists, psychiatrists why aren't all doctors protesting and demanding not only that Agi Gereb be let go, but also that she receive a Nobel prize for her work?"

Are you a survivor?
In the world's harshest environments... we're wimps compared to the toughest creatures on the planet.
We're counting down the ultimate top ten survivors in the natural world to find the animal with the most extraordinary endurance.
"When the going gets tough, the tough really get going on the Ultimate Animal Countdown."
[engine sputtering]
MAN:
"Mayday, mayday!"
[alarm beeping]
NARRATOR:
"Could you cope with nature's worst crashes, cataclysms, and catastrophes?"
We're counting down the world's toughest animals--
Surviving against the odds for days... months... or years.
"A hurricane unleashes the energy of 10,000 nuclear bombs."
"In Florida, it wreaks havoc on land... and sea..."
The storm surge sweeps fish onto shore--
leaving them stranded.
Including the animal swimming into number 10:
Reef sharks.
Shallow water is their nursery.
But sharks are survivors.
They avoid bad weather... tipped off by their super-sensitive ears.
The shark's inner ear is similar to ours and can detect changes in pressure.
Useful when it dives deep... or when a hurricane approaches-- but we only discovered by accident.
"Well, now that you do know, would you think it's possible... ...that Emily, in her psychotic state... ...might have activated both sets of vocal cords... ...so as to achieve the amazing effect we heard captured on your audiotape?"
Her state was not psychotic.
"Father Moore, you told us that in the exorcism we heard... ...you actually saw, once again, this black-robed figure... ...or demonic apparition, am I right?"
- Yes.
"But we couldn't see him when you played the tape, correct?"
"- No, of course not."
- Of course not.
"So that would be another supernatural aspect of the exorcism... ...your tape doesn't prove, correct?"
- Yes.
"Where is your dark figure, Father?"
Is he here now?
Do I look like your demon ghost?
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.
I have nothing further.
Does the defense wish to redirect?
"No, Your Honor, but we reserve the right to recall the witness later."
Very well.
The witness may step down.
"Your Honor, my next witness must have been detained."
If we could take a short recess so I could...
"You've made this court wait before, counselor."
I'm inclined to...
"Your Honor, please."
Dr. Cartwright came to us in good conscience... ...as an eyewitness to the exorcism on Father Moore's tape.
He can substantiate all of my client's testimony...
"Your Honor, the defense has already presented its exorcism testimony... ...in dramatic fashion."
Do we really have to..?
We have absorbed some extraordinary testimony today.
I think we'll take some time to consider it.
Court is adjourned until 9:30 tomorrow morning.
- You can't find him?
"You can't do better than 100%, right?"
"So now in stage five, we kind of take this a little too far, right?"
So let me actually just make a little bit of space here.
We take this a little bit too far in the sense that our actin is going to slip out all the way over here.
And it's going to be out all the way over here.
"So we've got a huge, huge gap now."
"And, of course, our titin is completely stretched out."
It's about as stretched out as our titin is going to get.
This green titin protein.
"And now the question is, of course, would you get any force?"
And the answer's probably no.
Because the myosins aren't even touching the actins anymore.
"So really, again, you have zero out of 20 myosins at work."
"And of course, that means that then the amount of force would be zero."
So we go back down to zero.
So this is part five.
"So you can see now, as we've gotten longer and longer, things were good for a while, but then they drifted all the way back down."
"And this curve that I'm showing you, this tension-length curve, is now based on exactly what you see on the right."
"It's based completely on the idea that as you stretch things out, the amount of force changes depending on the length of the sarcomere."
[ape sounds]
Meet the relatives
"These are our closest cousins, the great apes."
We like to think we're different.
"But a few million years ago, we were just the same."
"Now, we dominate the planet."
"Somehow we humans have left apes far behind, or have we?"
Through a series of experiments we'll prove that apes are much closer to us than anyone thought.
Startling images reveal that their instant memory is far superior to ours.

"From Pacifica, this is Democracy Now!"
AARON FORD:
"I'm honoured to stand here today alongside the New Jersey State Police, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, and United States Marshall for the District of New Jersey, to announce the addition of Joanne Chesimard to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list."
AMY GOODMAN:
"Assata Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Panthers and the Black Liberation Army, becomes the first woman named to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorist list."
"Convicted of murdering a New Jersey trooper in 1973, she's always proclaimed her innocence."
She's lived in Cuba since the early 1980's after she received political asylum.
We'll speak with scholar Angela Davis and Assata's long time attorney Lennox Hinds.
And we'll hear Assata Shakur in her own words.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
"Well the government just perceived us as a threat because they understood that we were serious, they understood we were telling the truth, and they understood also that we were becoming a much more sophisticated opposition, we were not just the piece of pie opposition, but that we wanted a real, structural change in the United States"""
[ *please skip to 11:28 to continue with Assata Shakur piece *]
JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"And I'm Juan Gonzalez, welcome to all of our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world."
"We begin today's show looking at the case of Assata Shakur, a legendary figure within the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army."
"On Thursday, she became the first woman ever to make the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"In addition, the FBI and the state of New Jersey doubled the reward for her capture to $2 million."
"Shakur was convicted in the May 2nd, 1973, killing of a New Jersey state trooper during a shootout that left one of her fellow activists dead."
She was shot twice by police during the incident.
"In 1979, she managed to escape from jail, and she later fled to Cuba where she received political asylum."
Insults are always a sign of inability

"Insults are really just empty air, We should not pay attention to them...."
Completely!
"Who understands it, it's mpossible to hurt him"
But there are those who take the harsh words in their direction
"For them, it is better to understand thay insults are lies and complex of the offender or the meanness of offending"
"Indeed, how low you need to go if you insult someone weak"
So you're rose above him.
Laughed and forgot
But he remembered and stepped out the window
"Maybe I'm exaggerating,But the essence is clear"
"By the way, is often not only an insult."

"Someone praises a monk, sitting in a monastery And a similar translation:"
I aspire to be like that
But when one praises the monk but reproaches the one that praises the businessman
It's only a clash of values.Full stop
Therefore such criticisms should pass by you
Because this is for you.

"Better still, to heal each other with words."
Simply and bluntly
"Sir, if you saw someone eating insects... ...on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?"
"- Probably, yes."
- So can you say with confidence... ...that the behavior you saw in your daughter's bedroom... ...could not be the behavior of someone suffering from psychosis?
I don't know.
She never had any problems like that before.
It just didn't feel that way to me or to Father Moore.
"- And you trusted him, right?"
- Yes.
He is our parish priest.
Fair enough.
"And after that night, would you say that you... ...put your daughter entirely in Father Moore's care?"
Yes.
We had done all we could.
We said she was in his hands now... ...body and soul.
Thank you.
"No further questions, Your Honor."
"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
You may step down.
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.
I am currently a professor of anthropology and psychiatry... ...at Northwestern University.
Where did you receive your education?
"At Yale, and then at Cambridge."
And what is your specific area of expertise?
I study the spiritual experiences of people in various cultures... ...and the physiological and psychological changes... ...they undergo during these experiences.
Would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
Yes.
"""Possession"" is one term for a basic human experience... ...reported by a great number of people all around the world."
"In my fieldwork, I've seen many people who experienced... ...a sense of being invaded by an entity from the supernatural realm."
Why do you think Emily was invaded?
Why did this possession happen to her?
Based on my study of the case file... ...I believe that Emily Rose was a hypersensitive.
"A person with an unusual connection... ...to what Carlos Castaneda called ""the separate reality."""

I have a personalized recommendation engine that makes it very easy for me to find and discover new people to follow.
Let me show you how it works.
Here are all the Tweets from everyone that I follow.
It looks like my friend Maggie just posted a Tweet about the Cove.
Let me see what else she's talking about.
Oh wow!
It looks like she just posted a reply to my friend Ed.
I didn't know he was on Twitter!
I think i'll go ahead and follow him.
I'm going to check out who else she's following 'cause there might be some interesting people in there.
It doesn't appear that I know most of these people.

"I'll send him another bucket of Yemeni almonds, he loves Yemeni almonds."
"If you look at all these guys, they're just ordinary people who have good days, bad days, successes, failures, setbacks, everything."
Where they differed is in the fear department.
That's where they differed.
They did not allow the possibility of failure to stop them from trying again and again and again.
We have seen J.K.Rowling.
Twelve times.
That's the key.
"That's the key, right there."
"See, as long as you're still trying, as long as you are still in the game, the game hasn't ended."
You are still working on it.
You haven't failed.
"You fail when you throw in the towel, when you give up."
"And then, you are the one who has announced that failure."
Nobody else has done it.
"You are the one who announced failure, yourself."
"In the mid 1970s, when I was in my 20s,"
"- it's kind of difficult to believe I was ever in my 20s - but, yeah that did happen sometimes in the last century."
I was in Abu Dhabi trying to build my life.
"I had to sleep in the beach, not because I love beaches, but because I was thrown out of my home by the landlord."
"We were 8 guys of us staying in one room, one day, the landlord came  and threw us out."
He found another tenant who paid him more.
So what do I do?
"Well, you do what you have to do."
I went to sleep in the beach.
"In fact, my morning shower was in the mosque nearby, which helped me discover gold, and that's a different story."
It took many years to happen.
"At that time, I was about 21, 22 looking at myself."
I was looking at a failure.
"I mean, how do you actually build your life when you have no roof in an expensive city like Abudhabi at the age of 20-22?"
"Many years later, it occurred to me that what I was looking at is not failure."
"I was looking at the building blocks of character that will make you one day appreciate, strive and if ever you succeed, realize that you succeeded."
Not the best idea.

Welcome to the latest edition of Inside CBA.
So many great things have been happening here in the College of Business Administration that I though the best way to convey them is through video so you can literally see for yourself.
"In September, the Nebraska Board of Regents approved plans for our new 240,000 square foot building."
This 84 million dollar project will be privately funded.
"In 2016 when the building's completed, we'll have a facility that will allow us to attract students and faculty from around the world and help us with our growing enrollments."
This fall our freshmen enrollments exploded by a 25.4 percent increase over last year.
And our first time transfer students were up by almost 16 percent.
"Our goal as a college is to hit $5,000 students in accordance with the chancellors charge that UNL's total enrollment should reach 30,000 by 2017."
Size matters.
"For our undergraduate program, enhancing the size of the student body and the faculty provide greater opportunities to find their niche, to locate a mentor who can direct them to their passion, to explore a wider set of opportunities than they can imagine when they graduate from high school."
"I'll still come into the chatroom, that sort of thing, but it's it man."
I don't want to be a venue for man-children and My Little Pony.
"Nobody's learned shit, nobody's done shit."
"So, you know how it is."
"No, I'm not gonna abandon the chatroom man."
"I'm gonna still come in here, but I'm not gonna stay in here for as much time as I had."
Sometimes I've stayed in here for shit.
"I mean, it seems like an hour, but five hours have gone by and shit man, I've been having a lot of great conversation with a lot of you guys and females in this chatroom and transsexuals, mind you."
"Amy Daly is a believe it or not has been a great breath of fresh air, you know, in the chatroom."
Especially when I came in here this morning feeling a little jaded about this shit.
"I'm still jaded about it, but great words from her, great words from a lot of people in here, so anyway, once again, man, the show's over."
"I'll be in here, man."
You know?
"I'll be in here, but... that's it for the show, man."
"The archives will be there if people still want to listen them, they can still listen to them, so... anyway. coyoteinthehat:"
"Seriously, thank you for the time and money and everything you've put into it and sorry for adding to the forces of trolls and stuff earlier this year and whatnot, but man, thanks for everything."
GuitarNinja:
"Yeah, man, the past couple of years."
"You've been sewing the seeds of capitalism and now it's just time to sit back, you know, chill, wait for the harvest, man."
"You know, it's coming, it's gonna happen."
We just gotta wait and do our homework.
Sebastian:
"Thanks for the show, Ghost. karaszkunskadoo:"
"Hey, I wonder what will happen to the Engineer since you are quitting this show. iusethelancer1:"
"The Engineer wasn't real, dude, okay?"
GhettoCapitalist:
"Look guys, the Engineer."
Y'all don't worry about the Engineer.
The Engineer is eligible for so many entitlement programs now it's ridiculous.
He's gonna be making more money being unemployed than he ever would at Ghost's show.

- Wow!
Outliers get squared.
Right?
"So if you're really bad, you square it, to get even that much worse."
Okay?
"Now, it could be that, in fact, that outlying data shouldn't take up that much importance, but when you do the"
L^ The square fit with the L2.
You square that distance and you put it into that thing.
Where is if you do L1?
"You just take the distance and leave it, you don't square it."
Okay.
How does it impact this example?
Well let's see.
I'm gonna put in some outliers.
"So I'm gonna add a couple data set points here here's my data, here's what I'm gonna add at .5, it's at 3.8 and at 3.9 Now, let's try it."
"Okay, there is are results, so I added a couple points, outliers to the data."
And now You can see there's a pretty pronounced difference between the L2 and the L1.
"And then, we can talk about, well, what's best?"
"So, first of all, that's question doesn't even make sense."
"Because when we say, what's best, you could say, well, if it's an L2 sense, clearly, the red line is best because it minimizes the L2."
"So, best here is."
"Akward, mathematically its best and best by the eye."
And then look at the magenta line.
The magenta line really doesn't change because of the outliers.
"Right, hardly influenced by them, shifted slightly."
The red took a huge tilt.
"So some would argue that when we answer the question about what is best, that in fact, the magenta is best, cuz it does not react to the outliers, and the only reason that red, and that red line got way shifted, because it's trying to compensate for these points that are way out squared the distance analysis and this red line doesn't do the job at all, bottom points or the top points, doesn't, doesn't do well anywhere."
"But the L1 says, tell you what, I got most of them right, I got a couple of outliers."
"But by the way, nobody is gonna get the ou tliers right, so I'll try to get the bulk of them right."
Does that make sense?
"Okay, that's the L1 norm."
All right.
So curve fits.
I'm going to a party with Hollywood folks.
And I'm going to wear this.
We got the name Gapminder from the London underground.
American hotels almost always have an iron in every room so you can look your best.
A little note for Agneta...
There...
It's a new phase of a strange journey for Hans Rosling.
From a doctor in Africa to a professor of international health and most recently a global star with an unusual message:
The world is actually getting better.
He's on his way back to the scene of his breakthrough.
"It's California's ""Davos"" meeting, where Silicon Valley meets Hollywood."
The room is full of key people of industry and entertainment.
From movie stars to film producers.
"The conference is called Technology, Entertainment and Design."
I was invited to it in 2006 and it changed my life.
Yesterday the WHO's statistics manager e-mailed me after I'd requested malaria statistics.
He wrote:
"""I always send your video to my friends, of course I'll help."""
"If I count the number of minutes I've been teaching, this video teaches more than anything I've done in my life."
"All the articles, books, courses..."
None of it can compare with this one video.
That's a humbling experience.
Uppsala University wanted a course in global development.
"The ""Man and Nature"" course had students from many fields."
"Their worldview was cartoonish - really ""us and them""."
They were convinced that no one should touch rainforests.
"That we have to lower our standards, not everyone can have electricity."
I was horrified at their attitude and lack of knowledge.
They thought developing countries lived in harmony in the rain forest.
Only a fraction of so-called devel- oping countries live that way.
So I did a graph with money on one axis and child mortality on the other.
"The idea of ""industrial"" and ""developing"" countries is bullshit."
"Katrina is not my girlfriend, alright?"
And I doubt she gave you the stinkeye!
That's just the way her face looks.
"You know, that's just her face!"
I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father.
"Hey, you big puffy version of junebug!"
Where have you been?
What's up?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level.
You need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever!
The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are!
Your parents are probably wondering where you are.
No...I mean I'm already pregnant.
So what other kind of shenanigans can I get into?
"The answer is reject, and you can see it easily from the data shown here."
79.74 is the mean.
This is the 95% confidence interval--less than a kilogram.
"The reason why it's so small is because we have so many data samples, really interesting."
"As a result, we don't even come close to 73."
"So, if all the guesses that you guys voiced online were actual measurements using the actual scale of Sebastian, and this is what I told you and the question really was H0."
Is Sebastian telling the truth or is he lying?
"The, using statistical techniques, you should conclude he's lying."
This is somewhat contrived.
"This is the only data point, and everything else is just guesses."
But I hope you had fun using actual data that you students derived in answering this question.
The pupil asked:
"""To dissolve in Being or to dissolve in Non-Being - isn't this the same?"""
And the teacher said:
"""I DON'T KNOW!"""
To the pupil's birthday party some guests have come the guests were his classmates: two girls and three boys
"The food was: three pieces of bisсuit cake and 7 bottles of ""BAlKAL"" mineral water"
"One girl eat two pieces of the biscuit cake and drank 1.5 bottle of w.ww.... ater ""BAlKAL"" and... biloowwwssss...... and drank 1.5 bottles of BAlKAL water and on of the three boys drank, on bet, all the rest of the water and told that HE COULD HAVE DRUNK EVEN MORE!"
I've seen Nathan's self confidence grow in the last four or five months.
And so
I feel like even the mistakes that we've made have somehow turned toward building his character.
And he's learned a lot.
I'd say just don't worry about what other people think.
"And if you feel bad about yourself, just try to make yourself feel important and do something."
And be proud of it no matter what.
But Nathan's parents know better than to invest too much hope just yet.
They know that kids like Nathan often have good starts in new environments.
Later this spring they'll know more about whether they have finally found an answer for their boy.
Now back to Adam Dunning's story.
He's out of the psychiatric ward.
But now Adam's parents have come to this courthouse.
Their son is on trial for breaking and entering.
He's been given a court appointed lawyer.
"His parents are told that if he's found guilty, their boy will be in the custody of the state until he's an adult."
The prosecution makes its case.
I saw a glimpse of his face and I saw the outline of his face.
"And I said, oh, that's Adam."
Shouldn't he be in school and--
It doesn't take the jury long to render it's verdict.
We find the defendant guilty.
"As they say goodbye to their son, Jane Dunning comes to grips with a harsh new reality."
Adam's birthday is four days from today.
And I didn't expect to have to ask somebody else permission to bring a birthday cake.
"Four days later, it's Adam's 16th birthday, celebrated in jail."
"But as terrible as it is to visit him here, Adam's parents are in for a surprise."
When the sunset looks for the moon--
Their son is finally in an educational environment that seems to suit him.
"The classes are small and because so many of these kids have learning problems, the teachers here have found a way to get through to them."
Mercury has a rock cross made of the same kind of rock found on earth.

[Indistinct muttering]
We've now chosen three dishes that stood out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Really stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The first person we'd like&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is...
You know that you want to call my name.
"Please, please, call my name."
Ryan.
Let's go.
[Applause]
I'm really not surprised that my plate is one of the top dishes.
These other cooks are gonna have to step up their game if they're gonna want to compete with me.
The next person we'd like &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"- Samantha. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go, Samantha.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
I was one of the only people that decided to do something truly new.
I think a lot of people are gonna be jealous of me.
The third person... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please come down...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Scott. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
My mind is just racing.
I know that I wasn't 100% proud of this dish.
It was not executed properly.
Congratulations.
"I mean, your three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you, chef."
Thank you.
You managed to cook what we think are the worst three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of this mystery box challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Listen carefully. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This season,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we've rewritten&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the rule books,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so none of you should ever get&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;too comfortable&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this kitchen,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because we could ask you to leave at any time, starting now."
What?
(Becky) We're all gobsmacked.
We just can't believe it.
It's crazy to me.
"And I'm just like, what the heck is gonna happen now?"
"Okay, we'll taste all three dishes."
Whoever we decide has plated the absolute worst dish will be handing back their apron.
"Ryan, bring your dish up to the station, please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Ryan) I made a balsamic, rum-glazed duck breast with some caramelized bananas."
Are you proud of this?
I've gone from one problem size eight down to eight problems of size one.
At this stage I'm at my singleton case.
So this is easy.
What do I do?
I merge.
"And the merge is, put them in order."
What do I do next?
"Obvious thing, I merge these."
And that as we saw was a nice linear operation.
"It's fun to do it upside down, and then one more merge which is I take the smallest elements of each one until"
I get to where I want.
Wow aren't you impressed.
"No, don't please don't clap, not for that one."
Now let me do it a second time to show you that --
I'm saying this poorly.
Let me say it again.
That's the general idea.
What should you see out of that?
"I just kept sub-dividing down until I got really easy problems, and then I combine them back."
"I actually misled you slightly there or maybe a lot, because"
I did it in parallel.
"In fact, let me just shuffle these up a little bit."
"Really what's going to happen here, because this is a sequential computer, is that we're going to start off up here, at top level, we're going to divide into half, then we're going to do the complete subdivision and merge here before we ever come back and do this one."
We're going to do a division here and then a division there.
"At that stage we can merge these, and then take this down, do the division merge and bring them back up."
Let me show you an example by running that.
I've got a little list I've made here called test.
"Let's run merge sort on it, and then we'll look at the code."
"OK, what I would like you to see is I've been printing out, as I went along, actually let's back up slightly and"
look at the code.
There's merge sort.
Takes in a list.
"The Engie is set up, all right?"
Don't worry about the Engie.
Machine learning for wed developers or
"Machine learning and You or something along those lines so I note everyone is here, ready to go."
"So yeah, I kind of made this talk as more of an introductory kind of thing."
I suspect if you understood everything in the last talk.
This might bore you.
Mostly because we are not going into numpy and scipy. that kind of stuff.
For the demo we are going to do I want to make sure you don't have to have your FORTRAN compiler set and everything.
We are doing just an overview. meant for web developers who have heard about this kind of stuff and read hacker news regularly and don't see how they can apply it to web applications and that kind of stuff.
"You should know python and data structures, that kind of stuff."
If you are in applied math and a PHD you might find this kind of boring.
"Hopefully we can get into some cool applications of machine learnng and we will be building somthing together, kind of fun."
"If you are following along on you laptop, for the material today all you need is"
"I wrote some set up scripts that will create a virtual environment, get you all the packages and stuff."
Let me break out of this real quick and get you started.
"So if you are on a mac and you can do HomeBrew, do brew install. you can do C compile and C sees it ."
The Natural Language ToolKit is in today and it requires that.
"If you are on Ubuntu, you need the development headers."
Clone the repository at mygethub. cd setup.
There are some shell scripts there.
"If you are on windows, I didn't write anything for you, sorry."
NLTK is a little weird with intstallations.
So let me know if there is a problem with that. so boot strap. download some stuff and you should get some fun stuff.
"Oh yes, Absolutely."
You want ... the font.
"Okay, Sorry I am a little mis set."
Where am I going?
Okay.
Can everyone see yet?
Bigger ? yeah.
Yeah the pail chart what did it fail on?
"It builds a pearl around it to smooth out the sand, and that's what our memories are really."
"We forget all the bad things, or a lot of them, or they're dulled."
We dull the emotions.
"But with Jill, she's right there."
"For instance, her mother, a dancer, remembers saying the usual one or two things about her daughter's weight gain."
Jill has the days and dates.
She'll not realize that she said 500 times.
She'll think she's said it one time.
"And it has caused a weight problem for her, but there's nothing I could do about it anymore."
"Jill wants us to know that too much memory, living in the past, is paralyzing."
It's uncontrollable.
"I actually probably should be in a mental hospital because this makes me crazy, but I figured out a way to live with this."
Think about your junior year in high school.
Now what can you remember?
Doctor Cahill and Doctor McGaugh of the University of California
Irvine say there's something else they've
"learned about that mysterious part of Jill's brain, which is larger than usual."
It's an area associated with OCD.
We believe that she has strong tendencies towards obsessive-compulsive.
"Could her brain be storing an infinity of memories, just as some OCD patients hoard things?"
We don't think it is an accident that the tendency to collect is both for objects and for memories.
"We think these are related, and we think the brain does it, and we want to figure out how."
"Do you save things, hoard things?"
"I don't like the word hoard, but yeah."
I have the first doll that was put in my crib.
I have the first gift that was given to me when I was born.
This is my notebook from senior year in high school.
Have you tried drugs?
What kind of drugs?
Antidepressants.
That doesn't work either.
There is only one thing they did make a dramatic difference.
It ties right together.
"Andy Puckett, Ph.D., Director of Planetarium &amp;amp; Visualization Theatre:"
And that's the beauty of the College of Arts and Sciences.
It really exposes you to ideas and ways of thinking that you wouldn't necessarily have been exposed to.
"Jocelyn Krebs, Ph.D. Biology Professor:"

And I would not change it for the world.
"Chris Barnett, CAS-Biology Graduate Student:"
It's been a great benefit for me to be able to stay here and to be able to do world-class biomedical research and get papers published.
"Steve Johnson, Director of Seawolf Debate Team Associate Professor:"
"The Opportunites that exist here are just outstanding because we are a relatively new state, because we are a relatively young university, because we embrace that ethos of Alaska so intimately in what it is we do."
Narrator:
And I would encourage you to read critically not just like a consumer.
Finally.
I hope this class motivates you to learn.
Learning is a very powerful thing in life.
"And I, I, I'll talk about it a little bit later more in depth."
"But when you learn more, learn Finance."
"And the reason is, if you know Finance, you pretty much know most of anything you want to know in life."
And I'm kind of serious about it.
"[laugh], You know that's, that's the funny part."
"So objectives, why you want to do, think about it."
And I hope you're convinced that this is something that you really need to learn.
What are the prerequisites?
"I've been receiving emails about, prerequisites."
"This is a question that we always get, here in life classes, and this is very tough for me."
"Because fundamentally, it could be everything in life, or nothing."
"Some prerequisites could be nothing, or everything."
Why am I saying that?
"It's because if you're go into the detail of development of Finance, the first thing that's the basis of Finance is Economics."
And Economics is actually called the mother discipline of Finance.
It has borrowed mostly from that discipline.
"So,"
I would encourage you to know that.
"Behavioral Science is also becoming important over time, but economics remains the basic paradigm."
Accounting.
"I must admit, Accounting, though I know some of it, is kind of boring."
"And, but it's a"
language.
"I mean, it's like, if you didn't understand me because I'm speaking"
"English, there would be a problem."
"Similarly, if you don't understand accounting, you cannot understand what's going on."
"And because it's imperfect, like every other language, you really have to know it."
"I promise you, I will give you hints of what to do when we do accounting, because we can't do all of it."
There's an S in there.
"The sparse diagonal matrix means what you're going to do is, you're going to basically so it's going to be a matrix fulls of zeroes, and you're gonna tell me which diagonals have stuff in'em, and put stuff on those diagonals."
"So, for instance, here's how you might put something in."
"So, first, you tell it."
Let me give you the structure here.
It's going to be an n by n matrix.
Doesn't have to be.
"You can tell it what size it is, but for us it's an n by n."
You tell it the location of where you wanna put this thing.
"So, for instance, if I wanna put something on the diagonal at zero, if I go to the right of the diagonal, it's one, two, three."
"Go to the left, it's negative one, negative two, negative three."
"So your location is predicated off that diagonal, to the right or to the left."
"So if you say zero, and what I'm going to do is put."
Lay down an E1 on that.
So right now what I've made is essentially the identity matrix.
Here's another command.
Spy.
"Spy allows you to look at the, all the non zero components, of the matrix."
"So if I do this, press go."
"There's my matrix structure, the blue dots indicate which things are not zero."
"By the way, by using the SP Diags."
The only things it saves is the blue dots.
"Notice the matrix is sparse, it's almost empty."
"If you were to save all these zeroes, right, order N squared matrix, the memory requirement would be order N squared for you."
"To save all these things as zeroes, if you save it as a sparse matrix, it's order N. 'Kay."
Be easy on your chip.
Try not to save memory stuff.
You're going to have to use your memory for other things besides saving matrices.
Okay?
"So, this is what's nice about this."
"So, hey, look at that."
I put down a diagonal.
"You have to work so hard to form the letters, that it's hard to do that and spell at the same time."
And it's hard to do that and have good ideas at the same time.
You're so good spatially--
Dr. Levine tells Nathan his strengths can help overcome his weaknesses.
"For example, his ability to draw this complicated design from memory can help him visualize facts like history dates that otherwise he would forget."
Remembering dates is a lot of detail.
But it won't be a lot of detail for you if you make a diagram of it and remember it as a visual pattern.
I have evidence that you're very smart.
You need to convince yourself of that.
"It was probably the first time he's heard somebody-- since the second grade teacher-- tell them how great he was, instead of ADD, you know, this huge thing."
It was really specific and it was something that seems manageable.
So it's very encouraging.
"But Nathan's parents think he needs one other thing, discipline."
"One year later, the ranks of the Hargrave Military Academy include Nathan Suggs."
"We get a lot of boys that are very smart and intelligent, have a lot of potential."
But for whatever reason they come here because they do not think they can do it.
Cadet Suggs.
"For his parents, sending their son here is a big sacrifice."
But they believe it's his big chance.
"For this year, we cleaned out his college fund and my parents also contributed."
"And so, I don't know exactly what we would do for next year."
I love you.
I love you.
I've missed you so much.
He lives at Hargrave.
And this fall has been very difficult for me.
"But I'm hoping that he will take in some of the discipline, make it his own."
I'm feeling happier.
I have more self discipline.
I'll probably have more than I have now at the end of the year.
And it will probably be a whole lot easier.
You look so nice.
There is a book called  'Buddhism Boys'.
It's about a teacher who taught mindfulnes to high school football players.
"I think, boys particularly can see the relationship to sports."
That's a big inroad.
(R. Brady) I don't think we will have time to answer more questions right now.
"But, there are going to be a lot  of opportunities to raise questions of various kinds  throughout the rest of the week."
"And after you leave here,  there is a worldwide community of over 1000 people who are interested in mindfulness in education, who are all part of the Mindfulness and Education Network listserv."
How many people are already  on this list?
"Please, raise your hand."
"We don't have too many Canadian members yet, but it would be wonderful to have a large Canadian presence."
The flyer is downstairs in the bookstore.
"If you have questions such as the ones you have been asking, you can just put them out on the network and you would get very thoughtful answers."
"It's not a very busy web service, you do not need to worry about being flooded with emails. but it's very thoughtful."
"So, I want to encourage all of you  to pick up a flyer."
We also have a conference annually.
"We have Canadians who come to our conference, that gets announced."
It will be March 14 to16  in Washington D.C. this next year.
There is a lot of resources on our website that you will find also listed here.
(J. Bell) I'd like to do one plug for a book that I found very nourishing.
It's called 'Teaching With Fire'.
"Two teachers asked teachers to sent them poems to guard them through hard times,  to remind them why they taught."
They talk about courage.
There are about 100 poems in here.
On one side is the poems sent by the teacher.
On the other is the teachers' own story about why this poem is important.
"I have used this in my teaching, in my training work and for my own personal use."
"I've used poem to cry through, beautiful collection of poems, some of them written by famous people, some by teachers themselves."
'Teaching With Fire'.
(Br.
Phap Dung) Thank you.
"(J. Bell) The author, the editors are Sam Intrator and Megan Scribner with Parker Palmer giving the intro."
"(Brother) Thank you John, thank you Richard, thank you panelists, thank you friends for being with us and... wonderful at my heart."
"The problem is your body, all of us; we care about what happens today, not down the road."
"One of the take home points that astonished me when I start to think about it, is that nature, evolution selects out for who has good kids, and that's what evolution is about: it's about having children; about progeny."
It's not about what happens when we're 80yrs-old or 90yrs-old.
"And so, inflammation is fantastic at dealing with today's ramifications."
"The problem is if you get the flu today, your risk of cancer and heart disease a decade or a two decades from now are up."
S:
If I get the flu just once?
Dr:
If you get the flu once.
"So those five, six days where you feel horrible, your inflammation is through the roof."
That's having ramifications down the road.
S:
"This is already getting a little scary for me, because I've had the flu...so I already feel a little worried about my cancer risk."
Dr:
I can tell by looking at you!
S:
"The symptoms we get when we have the flu or cold, it's not the virus that's causing it."
"The virus is causing the inflammation, which is causing the symptoms."
Dr:
Yes.
That's what's wild.
"When you get a virus, your immune system attacks it, and then you get a fever."
I still don't know why we get fevers.
"It's one of those things where cytokines, which are proteins the immune cells make to send out and get more reinforcements and tell the body what to do, it causes a fever."
"Is a fever good, is a fever bad?"
I don't know!
"We take Tylenol to lower a fever, but is that a good thing?"
Nobody has really looked at the long-term ramifications.
"We've looked at the short-term, but how does that effects will there be a decade from now?"
We just don't know.
S:
"What you're saying is the reason we have inflammation is, something is happening to my body,"
We saw it as an opportunity to develop a crop locally.
It's really volunteers in of our field.
"If you drive around, it's really easy to see right now."
It's going to be turning yellow.
"You can do down the interstate, 65 miles an hour, and you can pick it out."
Once you see it a couple of times.
So it is easy to see.
It's pretty much everywhere.
It's all across the Midwest.
"It stretches into Canada, down into"
Texas.
It's very widespread.
"It originated, probably, in this country with wheat, as a contaminant of wheat."
And that's probably why you see it so widely dispersed.
So we're not the discoverer of it.
We just saw an opportunity to take that plant and do something with it.
So it has very high oil.
"It is 36 percent oil, in the variety that we're working on."
"It's a very small seed, as you've seen this morning."
And it does dry down.
"It has a lot of good things going on in a crop, that you want right out, as a wild crop."
And usually you have to work to get those things.
It doesn't really seed scatter.
It will after a while.
That is how it gets dispersed.
It is usually several weeks after it's ripe that you'll start to see the seed shatter.
"So it holds on to the seed, so you can get it into the combine and do all the things."
"And so, these things sound all easy when you talk about them but when you work on a new crop, these things aren't easy to get to that point."
So this thing started way ahead of every other new crop that we have ever worked on at the lab.
And you have bear that in mind.
It may take tens of years to get to the point where pennycress started.
"So, Win has an opportunity to really take that and move that forward quite a bit and make some real advancements."
"If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA, that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil."
"OK, if we can do this, could we put it back?"
This is a key question for everybody.
"Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?"
"Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania, restore that ecosystem?"
Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible?
I've been to Tasmania.
I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common.
"I've even spoken to people, like Peter Carter here, who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old, but in 1926, this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines."
They trapped them.
"And when I spoke to this man, I was looking in his eyes and thinking,"
"""Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like, what they smelled like, what they sounded like."""
He led them around on a rope.
He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg to have in my head.
We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen.
"Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance, could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines."
My interest was in whether the environment had changed.
He thought hard.
It was nearly 80 years before this that he'd been at this hut.
"At any rate, he led us down this bush track, and there, right where he remembered, was the hut, and tears came into his eyes."
He looked at the hut.
We went inside.
There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night.
"And he told me, as it all was flooding back in memories."
"He said, ""I remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside,"" and he said they made sounds like ""Yip!"
Yip!
"Yip!"""
All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers.
"And the key question for me was to ask Peter, has it changed?"
And he said no.
The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in 1926.
The grasslands were sweeping away.
"I'm looking at a list of your published articles, doctor."
You've been quite busy and prolific.
"So based on your time spent with Holy Roller snake-handlers... ...voodoo priestesses and Indians tripping on peyote buds... ...based on observing these bizarre individuals... ...you've concluded that possession is... ...a basic, typical human experience?"
"I must say, counselor... ...that's quite a laundry list of disdain... ...and one that thoroughly mischaracterizes my research."
"No, I don't think possession is a typical experience."
But I am convinced that it is a scientifically verified... ...culturally universal one.
Have you ever used Gambutrol in your studies... ...to test your theory about its effect on the possession experience?
Absolutely not.
That would be dangerous to the patient.
"So this notion of Gambutrol locking someone in a possessed state... ...the key to your assertion that her medical treatment harmed Emily... ...this would be your own pet theory, correct?"
- You're just making this one up?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
Sustained.
"Although I think he's just taking a page from your book, counselor."
No further questions.
Erin!
I've got a doctor who wants to testify.
"He's an eyewitness, Erin."
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.
- What?
- He called us.
"Dr. Graham Cartwright, Department of Abnormal Psychiatry... ...at St. Mary's Hospital."
Dr. Cartwright.
Ring a bell?
Yes.
He was there?
- Yes.
"- Father... ...if you want me to defend you, you've got to give me... ...all the information I need."
With all of this medical testimony helping the prosecution... ...how could you not tell me that a doctor attended the exorcism?
He asked that I keep his involvement confidential... ...and I said I would.
They had a lot of sailors from the island.
"My uncle was telling me one time, I forget how many cousins he had that were captains on boats."
But that was when there were 70 ore boats.
You'd go up in the evening time and watch them going up Sand Bay.
"They all did the same speed, they all burned coal in the 50s."
"There was nothing to see, a dozen, right after the other lined up at the same speed, just heading for"
Grey's Reef there.
They did the same thing -
"In the day you'd see the smoke, but at night you'd see the lights go by."
"And when you went across on the mail boat, you always passed in front of one or behind one."
Heading down to Charlevoix or coming back up.
There was an awful lot of guys.
"When we put up ice here, our whole crew pretty much would be - we'd have 8, 10 guys down there."
They all were sailors that were just home for the winter.
They laid the boats up the first of December and go back in March.
"Unless a guy had lucked out to get the job for the winter staying on the boat, just to keep an eye on things."
"Like I said, [?]'s husband."
He'd always run what we called The Jack.
We had a movable thing to - when you put the ice up in the ice house the ramp and everything.
You walked alongside and it was just a little plank.
I don't know if I could -
"So, you'd pull the ice up."
These cakes up to the foot of the thing.
And then the other team - some guy driving the team.
"One of the sailors, he'd have the team."
Then they used the team to pull four of these blocks up.
Ray would be the guy behind us at what we called the
Jack.
He took a 12 by 12 plank with a bunch of spikes through it and then a big handle - to guide the - you hook on behind him and they'd keep on skidding it up.
And there'd be two or three guys up inside the ice house itself.
"They have these big ice tongs, skid it around, and they'd jam them and they'd tape it together."
So it was like one solid block of ice.
(R. Brady) Thank you.
(Woman in the audience) You mentioned that singing about flowers may not necessarily reach teens effectively.
"So, I was wondering if one of you can express what might be the best way to mindfully communicate with teenagers."
(K. Weare) I was not trying to say that nobody should sing songs about flowers with kids.
"But again, just taking the Mindfulness  in Schools Program from the UK, which is a Teens Program, it basically does things that are quite edgy, and exciting."
"For example, tasting."
It's chocolate but it's also hot chili which excites some of the kids.
"The next workshop, we use a shock ball, which gives an amount of electric shock to illustrate aversion."
(Laughter)
"It's very mild, I would say."
(Laughter)
We haven't lost too many yet.
(Laughter)
"But things like using clips, some films, some current pop music, and so on."
"And using language,  so you won't use mindfulness."
"We use MindLab or Emotional Warrior, or something of that sort."
"You talk about sports, you talk  about surviving life in a club."
You basically stop where they are.
It comes down to knowing your teens and working how you talk to them about anything really.
Translating the work of mindfulness  into the examples and language that you would use.
"There is a lot of stuff in pop music  that you could choose to play if you want to talk about being  in the moment, and ethics and so on."
"There is just a lot out there, you just need to get the head on, which is seeing the world  from the teen's point of view."
And use the teen themselves to tell you  what works with that group.
"So there is a lot, it's really  about the spectacles you put on before you start teaching more than sort of specifics."
(Woman) I am speaking from a parent's perspective rather than a teacher's.
"I would get someone else to teach, then."
(Laughter)
"(J. Miller) Just bringing the mindfulness to boys,"
I think one of the things is sports.
There are lots of people  in the sport world using this.
"The classic book is Phil Jackson's, who was coach of Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers."
He brought mindfulness right into a working coaching.
"This means I'm standing here on stage facing you,"
"And you are in the audience, in your seats, facing me."
You see the first row in the photo from the top here.
This is a photo of the model that the architects built for the contest.
"The building changed a little during construction, but basically it still looks as you can see here."
This is a photo of the National Theater of Somalia in Mogadishu.
This building has been constructed by Chinese people in the 60ies.
It was a gift of Mao to the young state Somalia.
Therefor Mao-Bibles have been provided at the opening celebration 1967 for each visitor.
"There was a page marked, when you opened it,"
There was a quotation from Mao:
"An army without culture is an uninformed army,"
And an uniformed army can be defeated.
A photo of the opening celebration.
The photographer took this picture on the 4th of May 2012 from a steep perspective.
Therefor you can see the stage tower well.
"From the stage, where I'm standing up to the rooftop are about 14 meters."
This equates roughly the height of the opera-house in Bayreuth.
The only difference is that this theater here is located in the heart of the city.
"Because of the angle which the photographer chose, you can see the prospect hanging there."
"This is the stage desgin of the opening play, which hase been written especially for this occasion."
You can see 4 persons hugging each other.
"At the back up in the sky, here, this is the white star from the flag of Somalia."
This flag resembles the flag of the UN.
It has been designed that way as gratitude to the UN for their aid.
The play has been written for this occasion.
It is called Dalaarwin Walid -
Dadaarwin Walid.
This means advices by the parents.
And this is a play about love.
"Somalia is a country in the east of Africa, which doesn't exist anymore."
"Anyway not as a state, because it fell apart in more than 20 years of civil war."
"I think this graph is the most important graph in all of health policy and I'm not lying or exaggerating, okay."
"There are at least two important lessons to be drawn from this graph, three important lessons."
So the three points of this is we're on another planet when it comes to health care spending.
"This is, the characteristic of a"
luxury good not in necessity and we could get down a considerable amount without the necessity for rationing.
That's why I think this graph is.
The most important graph in health care policy.
"I would also say for those of you who are a real nerds,"
look at these hours squares.
You don't get this kind of correlation.
In any other social science.
You just don't.
You barely got this in the biological sciences and you really have to go to Physics to get these kind of co-relations.
A perfect correlation is 1.0.
"We're spending $7,300 per person in 2007, corrected the next highest country as I mention, Norway."
"Switzerland is number three, $4,763."
Okay?
"So, compared to that, over 50 percent higher than they're spending."
"Now, some people and I won't get in this today will say, well, a large part of that is prices."
We pay more so our MRls cost more.
Our doctors have turns out have higher salaries than doctors in Europe.
Our nurses get paid more.
A day in the hospital in the United States is more expensive than a day in France.
"All true, doesn't eliminate this gap, okay."
"Might reduce it by half, doesn't eliminate it."
Plenty of rich otherwise healthy countries are down below the average.
"New Zealand, right?"
"Korea, South Korea, okay?"
"So, you don't have to, you know, even Finland is just [inaudible]."
You could be a perfectly fine country and spend a lot less than you're spending.
"I mean, these are countries spending a third of what we're"
"- I am need dropped dock tonight, respecting any ships and a boats."
"So this is the width, this is the length."
So L plus W is equal to 8.
What is the perimeter of the shaded region?
Fascinating.
Let's do it step by step.
First we can just figure out what this part of the perimeter is.
"And that's the easiest part, right?"
Because what's the perimeter of the whole circle?
"Well, it's the circumference of the whole circle."
Circumference is equal to 2 pi r.
This is the whole circle we're talking about.
"So that's equal to 2 pi times 6, so that's equal to 12 pi."
"This is the circumference of the whole circle, so the circumference of this arc, of this piece, is going to be 1/4 of that, because it's 1/4 of the whole circle."
"So it's 1/4 of 12 pi, so that's 3 pi."
"Now, what we need to be able to figure out is L and W because if we can figure out L and W, we can figure out everything else about this circle."
"And actually,"
"I'm going to continue this problem in the next video, because I think it might get a little involved, and I don't want you to get too confused."
I'll see you in the next video.
"What's a fuck, lord, music store?"
Hi!
Where's your compact disc departament?
"We don't care CDs, only vinyl."
Only vinyl?
Uau!
What blast to the past
The people's still listen to vinyl records?
I don't know.
"Well, me nice still have..."
I am to interview a patient and I'd like to give you some thumbnail sketch of what
Gestalt therapy stands for.
"The Gestalt therapy works on an equation awareness, equal present time, equal reality."
"In contrast to depth psychology, we try to get hold of the obvious, the whole surface of the situation in which we find ourselves, and to develop the emerging Gestalt, strictly on the I and thou, here and now, phrases."
And the Pentecostal Church accepts that a member has a legal abortion.
This was 1948.
I lived in the Luthagen district of Uppsala.
"We had one room, a kitchen, a privy in the yard and cold running water."
I remember Mom doing the laundry by hand with a washing board.
"A washing machine requires electricity, steel and detergent."
And it consumes energy.
But almost everyone in Sweden uses one.
Even the core of the environmental movement.
They probably use a low temperature and only good chemicals.
But if you ask Swedes if everyone in India should have a washing machine many would say that not every Indian household should.
They don't get that people are all the same.
"If I have a washing machine, so should everyone else."
People think Indians shouldn't have washing machines?
Not if they think about it.
But that's the general reaction.
Isn't it really that they're poor and can't afford one?
Consider the planning for how much electricity is needed on earth.
"Work out what we need for lighting, a washing machine, radio and TV."
That gives you the power we need.
None of my students have suggested that the world should be planned for that consumption.
"They hope ""those"" people will be playing flutes under the mango tree."
Isn't that a very generalized image of the students?
"There's a lot of variation, but a surprisingly large number hope that development will stop."
They think it's unsustainable.
We often hear that we already live beyond our means.
"""Everyone can't live like us."
"All Chinese people can't have cars."""
That's what we usually hear.
But the world can't function if we don't all live about the same.
How can the world unite if we don't live in the same conditions?
There's such appeal in having electricity and having some kind of holiday.
I dropped out of high school  with a baby on the way.
"I had no home, no money  and no help."
I put my hope in the crime on the streets.
"At the time, that scene  was my only option."
Crime on the streets eventually led me to jail.
I came close to death many times.
The lost that changed ...
"The lost that changed my life was the violent death of my younger brother."""
"It was 1967, Mike found his way into Youth Build program in Columbus, Ohio."
"And today, 14 years later, he is the director of his own Youth Build program, he is a minister of his own congregation, he is the owner of his own  construction company."
He has a family and 4 children  and he owns his own home.
"There are millions of young people who have this aspirations, they want  the same thing that you and I want."
"They want to know their true nature,  they want to know their value, they want to make a contribution, and they want to be able to support their families and be happy and safe, right?"
"Yet, because of poverty and racism,  they have been denied that opportunity."
And the schools have failed them.
You all who worked in some of those school have tried your best to counteract that.
Youth Build is developed  as a place for them to land.
"We started,my wife and long-time partner,  Dorothy Stoneman, who is right here, started Youth Build in 1978  at East Harlem, New York."
We as young people had some adult  back-up and some money to do.
"So, I stared across the street and said, ""I would like to fix up that building""."
It took us 5 years to do that first building.
"Starting there step-by-step,  there are now 273 Youth Build programs in the country's poorest communities and 16 other countries like South Africa,"
"Serbia, Haiti, Mexico."
"They asked us to come  by Afghanistan lately, I said:"
"""Wait!"
"Get your things together first, then we'll think about that."""
"They spent about a year in the program,  going to school, getting the GED diploma."
"Half the time they add and had the time building affordable houses for lower income people, learning leadership skills."
In this process they reclaim their lives.
Here are some elements that I think will work and we know about them here.
One is caring and love.
They come in pretty beat-up  by racism and poverty.
I'll test you on the final to see whether you really understood that.
So now the sound is 4 times larger than when I cover one up.
I'll cover the other one up.
It's down by a factor of 4.
[tone]
I can cover this one up and then you hear nothing of course.
[tone]
"Now I will move this one [tone] to the location [tone] where there is destructive interference, [tone] which should be about half of 15.6 centimeters."

Maybe you have good ears but I hear nothing anymore.
"Now I go through it and find the maximum, which is about 15.6 centimeters."

Here it is.

"And the other side, [tone] here's the maximum at center, so here should be a minimum, there it is, and I go to the other side, there should be a maximum."

"So what I have shown you today is I've shown you the interference pattern of sound, of water, of red laser light, of radar, and at the very least I hope I've convinced you as"
Young convinced the world in 1801 that light are waves.
And that means that Huygens was right and Newton was wrong.
Now that should perhaps not surprise you because Huygens was Dutch.
"But now, just to show you how complicated these learning problems can be, here's a story that is the flip side of Lauren's."
"Across the country in New York City there is a young girl whose social success has been masking a painful learning problem, a problem that because it exists in the inner city, might have been written off as something other than the neurological disconnect that it really is."
11-year-old Sara Lee Harris has always had lots of friends.
"Some of my friends are Amber, Roshida, Shana, Akima, Kimmy."
Sarah Lee is the youngest of four children.
"Her mom has one simple goal for her children, a good solid education."
My oldest daughter when she graduated from high school she went to Queensborough
College.
My son graduated from high school.
The twins graduate this year.
And twist the third red bubble.
Lock the free end of the third pinnk and red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the third gray bubble.
And twist the third yellow bubble.
Lock the free ends of the third gray and yellow bubble in one lock twist.
Alright.
Let's take a look on our sculpture.
"Basically, we are making the same fabric as we did in previously published instructions"
"""Fabric 2"", ""Fabric 3""."
The big difference here is we connect both ends of each row in this sculpture.
Twist the fourth yellow and the fourth red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the fourth yellow and fourth red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the fourth gray and twist the fourth pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the fourth gray and fourth pink bubble in one lock twist.
Keep working in the same fashion.
We can make as many rows as we want.
In this example we use only four balloons to build the tower.
We can use any even number of balloons to build larger in diameter tower.
There is also no limit how high you can make it.
Just add balloons as you need it.
Here is time saving way to make this sculpture.
Hold and twist balloons together to make the bubbles and
lock the ends in one lock twist in one move.
Twisting different size bubbles will definitely distort the tower.
Fix it right away.
I have mentioned before that we can make the tower as tall as we want.
"Let's limit our self here, for this instruction."
So far we have twisted six rows.
Or six bubbles of each color.
Now we have to build a cabin on the top of the crane tower.
We can make different size bubbles to make the cabin in different ways.
Let's do it in the simplest way.
"Coleen knows that I'm giving a message to her, and she can open that message and know that it goes to Alice."
It doesn't require the first one.
"If Bob see me talking with Coleen, presumably that's not a problem."
It doesn't require the second if Bob sees Coleen talking with Alice.
That's also not a problem.
"If Bob sees both of those and sees them in quick succession, especially if he sees the envelopes being handed on, then he's got a good reason to suspect that I'm talking with Alice."
So we need both of these properties.
"We need to know that Coleen can be trusted, and we need to know that Bob can't see both of these transactions."
Those are pretty high security assumptions.
"We don't want to have to trust Coleen completely, and we don't want to rely on the fact that Bob can't see these two conversations."
The way to make it more secure is to add a third person--
let's say we know Edgar as well.
"Now instead of giving the message directly to Coleen, what I'm going to do is take the envelope for Coleen, put that inside an envelope for Edgar."
We need to fold things a little to make them fit.
Now I'm going to seal this envelope with a very secure seal that only Edgar can open.
Now I'll give this to envelope to Edgar.
"Edgar will open it, see that it has an message for Coleen."
Edgar will give the message to Coleen.
"Coleen will open that, see that it has a message for Alice, give the message to Alice."
Alice will open the message and see that she shouldn't eat the onion.
This has more protection.
Now Coleen doesn't know that I'm communicating with Alice.
Because the message is going like this:
"It's going first to Edgar, then to Coleen, then to Alice."
"Neither Edgar, nor Coleen knows that I'm communicating with Alice."
Edgar knows that I'm sending a message through him that goes to Coleen.
"Coleen knows that she's receiving a message from Edgar, and it's going to Alice."
Neither one knows both endpoints.
"If we add enough hops, this can start to be quite secure."
This is actually called onion routing.
That's why the message is to not eat the onion.
The name comes from the idea that an onion has all these layers.
What's his name?
"I don't know, but he is like my brother"
He was killed by an APC running over him
My name is Ibrahim Azzouz
"They [army] created a trap for us, they let us approach the Radio &amp;amp; Television building"
Then the army ranks advanced on us
They began by firing shots at us
"After that they beat us with sticks, bringing us to the ground"
"After a while, the army APCs started driving around recklessly"
The APCs then started driving into the crowds hitting people
"Some people had their faces crushed in, some were sliced in half"
These were scenes of inhumane acts
From the army!
The Army that is supposed to protect us!
Our Army crushed us like cattle!
"Give us a chance to unite, we are brothers"
Patience ...
Patience
"Someone from Ezbet Nakhl, and the brother of Mina that they killed and have been laid to rest inside - Who has done this?"
The terrorist Tantawi ...
The Marshal ... he killed the young people inside
"But he is blind, because if he acknowledges those before him that are now in prison, he would not act this way"
"But the day will come, when God will take from him as he took from those that have been killed"
Not just him .. all of them
And may God put me to rest like those here
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...

The events of last night in front of Maspero [Egyptian Radio &amp;amp; Television Building]
Have resulted in the deaths of 24 Martyrs amongst our children
So let's talk about your characters.
Your characters are what can... are going to drive your book.
I didn't nail it.
I screwed it up.
"Christine, let's go, please."
(Christine) I sauteed some onions with scallops and chicken stock that I had infused with smashed garlic and chili peppers.
You were almost frazzled by this dish.
"You have a extraordinary palate, but I think that one is subpar."
"Next up, Ryan."
"We have portobello, dried shiitake, and morel mushrooms."
I made a duxelle out of the three of them so that I can incorporate the mushrooms in every bite.
The consistency of the risotto itself was spot on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good technique&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the rice.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Good job.
- Thank you very much.
"- All right, Scott."
"- Good luck, Scotty."
Let's do this.
This elimination challenge is definitely a chance for me to redeem myself with the judges.
"It means everything to show them that I can not only just bounce back, but actually really shine."
You think this has it?
Is this gonna be good?
I went back to where I normally cook.
I went as simple and core as I could to let the risotto speak for itself.
Seven ingredients in this entire dish.
- The texture's nice.
"- Thank you, chef."
Huge improvement over the last dish that we saw.
"A spirited effort, and, uh, welcome back to the contest."
"Thank you, Joe. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So the next risotto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we want to taste&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is from Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Joe is definitely the scariest judge.
"He's the judge to win over, and, if I can do that, then the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; title is definitely mine."
"I made a pistachio, cranberry, cherry, and gooseberry risotto."
What's this?
What is this baby powder-looking stuff?
And now I can't get -- I can't shake the metaphor.
"OK, I'm still in ""Poetics,"" in Aristotle, and I'm thinking -- out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there."
And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.
"Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis."
"It's what our network does; it's what ""Dirty Jobs"" is."
And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.
Great.
"The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know --"
"Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother."
OK.
That's peripety or peripeteia.
And this metaphor in my head --
I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.
(Laughter)
"I got to tell you, it's such a great device though."
"When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere."
"I mean, Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense,"" right?"
"Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people, and then, boom -- ""Oh, I'm dead"" -- peripetia."
You know?
It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.
"Neo in ""The Matrix,"" you know?"
"""Oh, I'm living in a computer program"" -- that's weird."
"These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations; and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for."
"And, as I stood there,"
looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled -- but it looked OK.
"Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?"
"Because, look, I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is."
And I talk to him.
(Laughter)
"And he says, ""Hey Mike."
"Their positions in feet as a function of time in seconds,"
"T of t and H of t respectively, are plotted below."
"So T of t is the position of the tortoise as a function of time, and it's in feet."
H of t is the position of the hare.
What is the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on the interval t is greater than 0 and less than 20?
"So T of t, they were talking about the tortoise here."
"This is the function T of t right over here, this blue line."
And it looks like it's moving at a constant rate of change.
The slope of this line is constant.
So let's see what this rate of change is.
If we start-- so we could even start from the starting position.
"When 1 second goes by, each notch here in the horizontal axis is 1 second."
"You see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So every time 1 second goes by, it looks like-- and we have to be very careful here."
"At first it looks like, oh, maybe he moves 1 feet."
But we have to be careful about what these notches represent.
"It looks like these notches represent 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 feet."
"So every time 1 second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"Another second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"So it looks like the rate of the tortoise, so I'll say the tortoise rate, the rate of the change of distance with respect to time is 5 feet for every second."
So let's see which of our choices seem to match that.
And that is over the entire interval.
"The interval starts here, this is 0, and 20 is right over here."
"And it looks like we have a constant rate, we have a constant slope."
We have the same inclination of this line the entire time all the way until t is equal to 20.
"So this first choice says the tortoise walks at 5 feet per second the whole time, and this looks right."
Our tortoise has a constant rate of 5 feet per second.
This walks might be an understatement.
"5 feet per second is a pretty good speed, especially for a tortoise."
But we are going to go with that one.
"Now, let's just look at the other ones for fun to see how true they are or see if they could have somehow applied to this problem."
The hare stops moving after 5 seconds.
"Standard adult size is going to be a 22 gauge, 1 to 1 and a 1/2 inch length, 22-23 gauge for intramuscular."
It's going to be a smaller gauge and a shorter length for small children.
You might have a 3/8 inch for an infant perhaps instead of 1/2 inch.
"I have a very small set of 1 inch or 1 and a 1/2, its going to be very short; 1/2 inch, 3/8, something like that."
Ok so select the appropriate size needle and syringe.
[ Pause ]
I'm going to clean the top of my medication bottle.
"I've done my 5 rights, I've done my 3 label checks to make sure I have the right medication."
[ Pause ]
I'm going to put the amount of air that I need to pull back the same amount of volume of medication to displace my volume and my... [ Pause ]
...ampule; my vial.
Get rid of the bubbles.
[ Pause ]
Drop your medication.
"Again, this is sterile."
I'm going to need to carefully recap it.
Alright so now I go into my patient's room and I position my patient in the appropriate spot so that I can administer the injection.
"For this particular medication, I want to use the ventrogluteal muscle."
Remember that's the most recommended in the literature to use for your injections.
So our anatomical landmarks with the heel of your hand.
I'm using my opposite hand to the patient's hip so this is their right hip and my left hand.
"I find the head of the femur and then with my index finger,"
I find the anterior superior spine.
I move my middle finger along the crest to open it.
Open my hand.
Alright.
This is the pelvis here and this is bone.
"This is a little tight as I walk my finger down, I can see that it has a lot of give there and this would be the sweet spot of the muscle; the give of the muscle."
I'm going to use my new alcohol.
Make a nice big circular cleaning out.
Ok.
Now I have to keep my hand on the anatomical landmarks because it's a very small injection site so I can't take my hand away.
You can see that's a modern battery in there.
We've converted this.
And this battery is connected to a bulb.
And it lights up.
"It's the most simple thing you can make-- a battery and a bulb, the bulb lights up."
And that's all it is.
The clever bit is the wires of the circuit are inside the rotors.
"So when the wires turn, the battery will connect to a different bulb."
Let's try and see that happen.
"So I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"Do it again, I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
It changes.
"Do it again, turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"And that's why it changes each time, because it has moving parts inside."
"But otherwise, it's just a simple circuit."
I think we need to know how to decode.
"This would be no good if we can't decode our message, so"
let's do that.
"First of all, we're going to take our code here, we need to know what the setting was."
"Now, if you notice, in the little windows, we have three numbers."
"It's like a combination lock, like a bike lock."
"Now, I took a note of what those three numbers were."
"Those three numbers, when we started writing Numberphile, were a 13, 9, and 21."
"So the idea is, you would type in your message, and you would get a code."
"The machine itself doesn't transmit, so you would have to write that code on a piece of paper."
So that piece of paper would be given to the radio operator who would then transmit the message by radio by Morse code.
That would travel miles away.
"So now imagine a second German officer, maybe on a ship somewhere in the ocean, now he's tuning into that radio signal."
He can hear the code.
"It's coming in, and he writes it down."
"Now, this second officer will have an"
Enigma machine as well.
What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work.
"Well, we had no real reason to expect it would, and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these."
"And just last February, the last time we did these trials,"
I saw a miracle starting to happen.
"What we found was most of these eggs didn't work, but then suddenly, one of them began to divide."
That was so exciting.
And then the egg divided again.
And then again.
"And pretty soon, we had early-stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those."
"We even DNA-tested some of these cells, and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells."
So we're very excited.
This is not a tadpole.
It's not a frog.
"But it's a long way along the journey to producing, or bringing back, an extinct species."
And this is news.
We haven't announced this publicly before.
We're excited.
We've got to get past this point.
"We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues."
It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.
Watch this space.
I think we're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
"We haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready."
The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
"The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes."
But it's not related to any of those.
It's a marsupial.
"It raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do, and it has a long history, a long, fascinating history, that goes back 25 million years."
But it's also a tragic history.
"So we shipped our 0.7, and I think it was when we got to 0.8 with Firefox which it would have been on May or June of 2004, that we finally understood we had a chance."
Like a real chance.
Because 0.8 of Firefox was far enough along that people started noticing it.
And the number of people using Firefox started to grow.
Pretty soon there were more people using Firefox 8 than had ever used the Mozilla suite.
"Something like a million, or two or three million."
And the other way that I knew that we were on the right track was Tim O'Reilly called us up.
I mean I know Tim forever because I've been in the open source world for a number of years but this time he called up to say
"""Hey, we're hearing a lot about Firefox."
"Can we come down and talk to you?"""
"Tim O'Reilly's greater skill is he has a phenomenal nose for what's new, what's coming and what technology is gonna be interesting."
So there were a lot of clues.
"Then, the summer of 2004 was a long summer."
"Because in between 0.9 and 1.0 was five or six months, that's when the extension system was built and I think I've been the most nervous I've ever been in that phase."
I remember speaking and I could not...
"I was on a panel but I walked across the stage constantly,"
"I was sick to my stomach because we knew this was our big bet, we could see the stuff was happening but there was that pressure that you have to ship the product."
"So the final phases of Firefox, getting the first version out, were the start page and we..."
Before Firefox the start page had been a typical open source project:
"""Hi!"
Wanna help?
Here is Bugzilla.
Don't like Bugzilla?
Here's Despot.
You don't like that?
"Here's the link for Tinderbox."""
So when we made the commitment to ship a consumer product we realised that doesn't help most people.
[Question]
"Unlike Bugzilla, which is smooth and lovely..."
"That shows you our standards, right?"
"So this was again an immense emotional intense, like knocked-down drag-out fight."
What to do?
And so there's a couple of ways we can think about it.
"If this leg is supporting 35 Newtons and we have a total weight here of 120 Newtons, our total weight, the weight at the top of the table plus the bookshelf, that's 120 Newtons."
So the balance of this must be supported by something or someone.
So the balance of this is going to be supported by this leg.
So it's 120 minus 35 is what?
[PHONE RlNGS]
"Oh, my phone is ringing."
120 minus 35 is what?
120 minus 30 is 90.
And then 90 minus 5 is 85 Newtons.
It's so disconcerting when my phone rings.
I have trouble focusing.
"Anyway, it's probably because my phone sounds"
like a freight train.
"Anyway, so there you go."
"This type of problem is actually key to, as you can imagine, bridge builders, or furniture manufacturers, or civil engineers who are bridge builders, or architects, because you actually have to figure out, well, if I design something a certain way, I have to figure out how much weight each of the supporting structures will have to support."
"And as you can imagine, why is this one supporting more weight?"
Why is this leg supporting more weight than that leg?
"Well, because this book, which is 100 Newtons, which is a significant amount of the total weight, is much closer to this leg than it is to this leg."
"If we put it to the center, they would balance, and then if we push it further to the right, then this leg would start bearing more of the weight."
"Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting, and hopefully, I didn't confuse you."
And I will see you in future videos.
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously.
"The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri."
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
"To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree."
"Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened."
(Claps)
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
"Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri."
Ah-hah.

And this is why chocolate  is associated with longevity.
"If you recall, there was a great book written years ago, which we're gonna look at"
"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
"And the Oompa Loompa's had brilliant pearly white strong teeth, because chocolate is great for your teeth."
Chocolate toothpaste is coming.
"This is what the cacao bean looks like  when you break it open, when you break it  into the different pieces."
"And those are called nibs, and these products are available  here in Finland now."
And all over the world.
Raw chocolate products --  in fact this industry is now over a hundred million dollar industry.
And it all came from one moment when I bit into raw cacao bean.
"And for the last 8.5 years,"
I've been proselytizing  about the power of chocolate all over the place.
In fact it never stops.
Some people complain about that.
"Anyway, iconically chocolate is associated with wonder and magic."
"And if you see that giant head back there, that's an Olmec head."
They're the ones who originated the word cacao.
"And you can see the bird in this image as well, indicating that connection between birds  in that realm and chocolate."
"Chocolate, as I discovered when I was studying in Oaxaca Mexico, is added to guacamole, but not process chocolate, raw chocolate."
They take the crushed up nibs  and they put it in their guacamole.
Try it at home.
"I was fortunate I grew up in California with Mexican people, and I was in love with guacamole  from an early time."
What an amazing thing  to have your cuisine expanded.
And that's what we're doing with chocolate.
"I got so into chocolate, I started growing chocolate."
This is my chocolate nursery in Hawaii.
"I have a farm in Canada,  I have a farm in Hawaii."
And the purpose of that farm in Hawaii  is to grow chocolate and explore the mystery and magic  of this great plant.
I grew that chocolate tree from seed.
Such an amazing amount of learning  can come from growing plants.
You can learn more from a garden  many times then you can from a book.
"I was very, very excited to explore."
"We're going to have to draw a lot of things, we're going to have to draw a lot of states."
That's kind of difficult.
And the answer was yes.
That's the point.
"It's these little pieces and these little touches that don't necessarily have a practical purpose that demonstrate to people that hey, if they thought that much about this, then think about how much work they put into the actual search results."
"Now, you have to be careful with this because it's a very, very strong message to send."
You have to make sure that your product backs it up.
So how do we apply this to thinking to products?
"Well, it doesn't have to be the large things."
"The Pac-Man example, the effort to actually make the game was a lot smaller than to produce the search results."
But simply ask yourself this question.
What are the things that I can do that I don't have to?
"So that said, here's a couple pieces of reading that we recommend that you look into to find out more about some of these topics, like affordances and natural mapping, an in Don"

There IS a way we can collectively fight back against environmentally destructive multinational corporations.
"A coordinated global general strike and boycott, combined with personal preparedness, in sufficient numbers, can cause a great deal of economic disruption."
The best tactic?
Non-participation.
If there is a need of timely vaccination then that's going to be picked up and provided by the respective government programs.
According to IGAD the experiences will serve as a model for other countries with pastoralist communities. being
Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
"Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won"
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care
"You touched my heart, you touched my soul"
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
"I know you well, I know your smell"
I've been addicted to you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I am a dreamer but when I wake
You can't break my spirit
It's my dreams you take
"And as you move on, remember me"
Remember us and all we used to be
"I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile"
"So, instead of, you know, looking for new sources of water, we can look for this source we already have."
"So getting into Greywater, one of the first questions is, is this legal?"
Like can I do this legally?
And the regulations around Greywater have been changing over the last couple of decades.
Greywater used to be viewed as sewage.
"It was part of just the whole water stream going down out of the house, considered sewage, dangerous, you can't reuse it."
And certainly over time it's been shifted to be seen as a resource to be able to be used for non-potable sources.
"So in California, we were the first State to have a code."
It was written in 1992.
"And it was a code, it's a plumbing code designed to allow people to reuse Greywater."
"But the way it was written, it really was more of a disposable code and so people weren't able to do that--to use"
--actually reuse it.
They were kind of asked to dispose of it deep under the ground.
"And so, between 1992 and 2009, pretty much all Greywater Systems were done without a permit, which were--they were technically illegal because the code really wasn't in line with why people want to use it, how it was practical to use."
"And so, there's millions of un-permitted systems."
"And last year, a bit--a lot of--there was drought, there was a lot pressure of reducing water."
"And so, there was a big push to rewrite the code and make it actually fit with Greywater being a resource."
"And so, the Department of Housing and Community Development wrote a new code."
And a lot of people were involved in that to really make it so we could use
Greywater as a resource.
"And so, from last year and onward to the future, Greywater is seen as a resource."
And we're going to show you some simple and legal ways that you can reuse it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Better safe than sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's the legal way [INDlSTlNCT] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
We'll get to that in one second.
Yeah.
Good.
It's actually right here.
"So,"
Greywater--who has heard of Greywater?
All of you.
"So, anyone have a Greywater System? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not yet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:"
Not yet?
"Yes, the wounds lasted for some time."
And did you attach any supernatural significance to these wounds?
I believe they were stigmata.
"By that, you mean supernatural injuries... ...that correspond to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ?"
Yes.
"Stigmata are a sign, a mark indicating one is touched by God."
"After that night, why do you think Emily refused another exorcism?"
I believe she'd accepted her fate.
Is there anything else you'd like to say about Emily?
No.
The defense rests.
Father Moore attaches divine significance... ...to the wounds on Emily's hands and feet.
Why?
Because he sees them as confirmation of what he wants to believe.
"That Emily was a saint, touched by the hand of God."
I'm afraid the truth is far less inspiring.
"Because the truth is, by the time these miraculous wounds appeared... ...Emily had already shown a tendency to injure herself... ...and simply did so again on one of the barbed-wire fences... ...surrounding the Rose family farm."
Father Moore's beliefs are based on archaic and irrational superstition.
Emily suffered because she was sick... ...not because she was a saint.
I'm a man of faith.
And I am also a man of facts.
"And in here, facts are what must matter."
And these are the facts of this case:
"Emily Rose had epilepsy, which caused psychosis."
"And, given time, medicine would have cured her."
But it didn't.
Why?
"Because Father Richard Moore convinced Emily... ...that she wasn't ill, that she didn't need medicine."
And in the weeks leading up to her death... ...when she was clearly in need of medical treatment... ...he failed to have her hospitalized.
So... ...the defense has given us an extraordinary... ...creative explanation for the events that led to this.
"Ladies and gentlemen, don't you believe it."
"Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil that did this to Emily Rose."
"So 2,600 words and it has 23 paragraphs."
A two-paragraph preface is then added to the report.
Is the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120?
So this is interesting.
So the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120.
So if we knew the total number of words in the document we'd be set.
We would just take the total words divided by the total paragraphs they have now.
"They have the 23 original plus the 2 from the preface, you have 25 total paragraphs."
Now it told you the average words per paragrah.
"Now, we don't know the total words, because the total is going to be equal to the 2,600 words in the body of the document plus the words from the preface-- I'll call that words sub preface-- all of that divided by 25."
This is the average.
"This is what we really have to figure out, to figure out if it's less than 120."
That's what they want to know.
So statement number 1.
Each paragraph of the preface has more than 100 words.
"So I guess we could say that the preface, the words from the preface are greater than 200."
"That's another way of saying that the total is going to be greater than 2,800."
"Now if the total is greater than 2,800, what does that tell us about the total divided by-- excuse me."
"So then the total divided by 25 is going to be greater than 2,800 divided by 25."
"What's 2,800 divided by 25?"
"Let's see, 25 goes into 2,800."
"1, 25, 30, 1, 1 times 25, 25, 50, 12."
So it tells us that the average is going to be greater than 112.
So that doesn't help us.
"If it told us that the average was going to be greater than 120, we would be done."
"We would say oh, we have enough information to answer the question."
"Actually, the answer is no, that the average is going to be greater than 120."
"But here, this tells us the average is greater than 112."
It could be 113 or it could be 121.
So it doesn't answer our question of whether the average is less than 120.
So statement one alone is not that useful.
Statement number 2 tells us each paragraph of the preface has fewer than 150 words.
Any might that you might think that my city as the ideal city.
It is not.
You would be a straight jacket for future generations.
They will make all the cities.
Do you understand?
No final frontiers.
That is the message.
"Well, i got all these ideas from the human body."
"When you get an infection on your toes, there is no community."
That sends a command to the brain.
"And the brain says, oh, i am going to do a two month study."
But at that time your infection is up to your knee.
The antibody go right away.
So every organ of the body is taking care of it.
That is how the Earth is operated.

"- Hi Fiorela, tell me what do you do and why do you blog?"
"- Well, I have two kinds of blogs."
"One has personal content, ""Bitácoras de Fiori Álvarez"" where I tell all kinds of stories, short stories that cross my mind at that moment, some of them are my own experiences, another are my friend's experiences, and things that necessarily need to be repeated, in some way."
"The other blog, has more academic content"
They are brief summaries of what I read.
I study Political Science.
"So, you will find a lot about Sociology, Political Sciences."
"International Relations, etc."
"Basically what I want in the first one is to have a place to vent in the second one, I seek to share knowledge because not to many people have access to a certain kind of books or they don't easily understand them."
"-Besides your blogs, in what other places are you in internet?"
"- Well, I follow some blogs, starting for Ivan Lazo's blogs"
I follow Lucifer Achocada ... ... well different kind of contents there are different things that I read..
"Most of them are about politics, because of my career. the second is related to short stories and simple writings, just to distract my mind for a while."
"So, avoid repetition, avoid excess verbiage."
And ...
"Yes, I've used it. ..."
I've written [laugh] editorials about that which I think you've used it.
I've used.
Yes [laugh].
"And Avoid, you know, sometimes people will write a rather long discussion in the introduction of the paper, where it's, really, the introduction should be."
"Brief, and say why you did this study and what you, basically what you what you tried to accomplish."
But leave all the discussion the review of the literature for the discussion section.
"Don't try to, to put too much in the introduction."
Some things are certainly you need some background.
As to why you did this study.
Which may involve citing some previous
"literature, but don't go into detail."
"At that's, in the introduction."
And .
Don't repeat numerical data in the text.
"You know, you'll have a table which has nice, numerical data with odds ratios and so on, and then there's, in the results, saying table one shows the blah, blah, blah and the odds ratio was this and that and, so avoid repeating that."
"We will often ask authors, you know, just describe."
The finding of the table in words.
And they can see.
The reader can see the numerical examples.
"Good, yeah."
So those are my main suggestions.
Those are good tips.
"Yeah, and you know, one of the, the fears I think that comes up often when I'm teaching a course like this."
"And it's already come up in this class is, a lot of scientists will say to me well I, you know, you know, I've been teaching them to write in simple and concise language."
And they'll say well if I simplify it to much I'm gonna dumb down the science.
It's gonna lose precision.
Mm-mm.
And.
So there's this kind of fear that a lot of scientists have.
[laughter].
A bit of a scam because I wasn't afraid.
Maybe it was because at University I was part of the Psychic Research Society and one of the things we found out was that never ever once in a hundred years of ghost hunting in UK has a ghost ever harmed anybody.
So armed with that information I had my research - so why be afraid?
They can't harm me at all.
And that way I wasn't conditioned through fear.
"But the Thai people, and there's a few"
"Thai people here, [laughter], they have grown up with ghost movies."
"Ever since they were small they saw these ghosts, huge, like heads with entrails following behind, and they would do terrible things to people."
"And because of that, just even the mention of a ghost.."
I remember this story - this poor little novice staying in our monastery in Thailand.
"Because it was a cremation monastery that day was the moon day when we would meditate all night...that poor little novice, we did a funeral that day, and were supposed to meditate all night... in the hall."
"Now usually, little novices, they are only about 11-12 years of age, there is no way they would stay up all night, they would sneak off in the middle of their night back to their house."
"We knew they did this, it was breaking the rules, but they were only small little monks, so we didn't mind."
And we've go to be kind..
Not this day.
"This night, that little novice, he would not leave the hall."
[Laughter].
Because he was just so afraid of the ghost.
See even the [Laughter].
Those dogs must have been reborn in Thailand.
Last night.
[Laughter].
Great special effects.
"Now these, here they go again."
[Laughter].
"Shut up, dogs!"
[Laughter].
"There, they're going now."
"Now these ghosts, or rather this little novice, the poor little novice, stuck in that hall, you know 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, too scared to go out."
When it got to about 2 o'clock in the morning he just couldn't hold his urine any longer.
He had to go to the toilet.
Hi there.
Look on this.
Thank you.
Saying that power plants are the number one cause of global warming is like saying that humans are the number one cause of global warming.
"Power plants don't emit energy, don't create energy for the purposes of just creating energy for the sake of it."
"They create it for industries, and one of the industries that uses the most energy is factory farming."
"In the US, the meat industry uses about one third of all the fossil fuels that we generate."
"Headquarters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, in short PETA."
They have almost 2 million members and are active worldwide.
I love this one as well.
- Oh yes. - This is a very famous one.
We've got this.
I suspect that for Al Gore and for a lot of other people it's just too inconvenient of a truth.
"Gore was a politician and is beholden to a lot of industry people, in many different industries."
Probably in the meat industry too.
"And while he certainly has done admirable work, its disheartening to say the least that he has continued to ignore the fact that the meat he's eating every night for dinner is the number one cause of global warming."
I'm Alicia Silverstone and I'm a vegetarian.
There is nothing in the world that has changed me as much as this.
I feel so much better and have so much more energy.
It's so amazing.
There is a prominent environmental group in the US called Environmental Defence.
"And they recently wrote on their website that if every American replaced chicken with vegetarian foods for just one meal per week, it would be the equivalent in carbon dioxide of taking about 500,000 cars off the US roads."
"Here in the United States, big is beautiful."
That applies to the cars and definitely to the steaks.
The average American eats 124 kilos of meat a year.
44 more kilos than the average Dutchman.
"At night, at the hotel, I watch a classic about American factory farming."

"Here you go, Leo."
"Psst, Leo!"
Who are you?
How did you know my name?
"Now, we can have it into full screen and it will show me what's happening at a 720 pixel."
Look how great that
looks on your TV screen.
This is YouTube.
It's pretty amazing.
All right.
We're going
to go pause this again.
"Now, YouTube has actually launched a new product called YouTube Leanback that's actually defaulted for the Google or for the big screen experience."
"Not specifically for Google TV, but for any large screen that you're viewing YouTube on."
"Now, YouTube Leanback automatically defaults video into full screen."
"It also has very intuitive controls so that you can search, pause, play, rewind all the videos one by one."
"So you see here I can just navigate right, play any video I want to, I can even browse down and search by category."
"And again, it controls, are large and very intuitive."
"So, with Google TV, all of these can become a reality in your television."
But this is not just about video and it's not just about YouTube.
"From here, I can go anywhere on the web."
What about FarmVille?
"Now, did you know that the last I checked, 10% of Americans are playing FarmVille every single day?"
"I don't know what the statistic is for Germans, but that boggles my mind."
Okay.
"So, online games are pretty fun."
What about music?
"Now, there's so many online music streaming sites these days, what if you could play music from your TV?"
"Your TV if often connected to the best speakers in your house, so why shouldn't your music be coming out of those speakers?"
What about photos?
A lot of people these days are uploading their photos to places like
"Picasa, Flickr, Facebook, and a lot of these sites actually have a very interesting feature called slideshow mode."
"Now, again, what's more compelling, a 10-inch digital photo viewer sitting on your coffee table or a 50-inch TV sitting in your living room?"
It's the best and brightest screen in your house.
"This is the screen that you should be displaying all of your photos on, and now you can."
Okay.
"This question, that you want to find out."
"Because sometimes, there is so much distortion when you try to focus, that you'll forget the question."
It's like something is zooming in on really what is important.
"And what happens is that, that part of your mind or psyche that's trying to avoid, seeing the truth for what it is."
The mind as you come nearer to identifying the mind will begin to throw stones in the bush.
To trying to get you to look somewhere else.
"So, this will be felt , like a kind of distortion"
"'no, no, I can't cope with it' and all this type of stuff."
"So, write it down."
And hold the question in your consciousness.
And it will begin to burn something.
"You feel, feel it. what will be left is just a sort of spaciousness."
"And intense feeling of presence, just presence, and joy and space."
"Then , in this moment, you re-invite again the question , you see."
"'Now who wants, who wants this picture?'"
'Who wants to fulfill this picture'?
And see what happens then?
It will have no pulling power for you.
"So, this is really the effectiveness of the enquiry."
I want to go over it again for you.
Something is on the mind.
Something is coming up.
"In India sometimes, when it is intense. intensely personal, nothing can trouble you except you personalize it."
"If there is no identity, it has no power."
"You've to somehow spray your scent on whatever it is, to empower it."
You understand what I mean by this.

Herding is a really good and interesting alternative to foraging and agriculture.
"You domesticate some animals, and then you take them on the road with you."
The advantages of herding are obvious.
First: you get to be a cowboy.
"Also, animals provide meat and milk, but they also help out with shelter, because they can provide with wool and leather."
"The downside is that you have to move around a lot, because your herd always needs new grass, which makes it harder to build cities."
Unless you are the Mongols.
"By the way, for the next 14 weeks, you will frequently hear generalization followed by"
"""Unless you are the Mongols"""
"But anyway, one of the main reasons herding only caught on certain parts of the world is that there aren't that many animals that lend themselves to domestication."
"Like, you have sheep, goats, caddle, pigs, horses, camels, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, all of which have something in common: they aren't native to the Americas."
The only half-way useful herding animal native to the Americas is the llama.
"No, not that llama."
Two Ls.
"Yes, that llama."
Most animals just don't work for domestication.
"Like, hippos are large, which means they provide lots of meat."
But unfortunately they like to eat people.
Zebras are too ornery; grizzlies have wild hearts that can't be broken.
"Elephants are awesome, but they take way too long to breed."

Elegant.
But first let's see what the secret compartment has for me today.
"Oh, it's another double cheeseburger."
Thanks secret compartment.
"Just kidding, I don't thank you for this."
An open letter to elephants.
"Hey, elephants."
"You are so cute, and smart, and awesome."

"Withdrew my paper from the Annals of Epidemiology and, and combined it with his and the New England Journal took it."
"Wow, yeah."
So even I was faced with a salami problem as an author.
"So those our the, the things Yeah, sorting those things out Yes Early can be very helpful."
And what do you think is if you have to point to one thing that number one mistake that scientist make when submitting their paper for publication?
I think it's overconfidence in how important.
And how good there study is.
[laugh].
"You know, you've worked on it really hard."
Yeah.
And done your best to write it up.
And this was an important topic or question that was really important to you.
"And you think, oh gosh, this is really an important finding, but others may not value it so I. [laugh]."
"So if it gets rejected I would do this, some factor like that."
"I would persist, I think it's important to persist and submit it elsewhere."
Fix it and submit it elsewhere.
"Yeah, finding the right journal for it might be the."
"Might be the key, yeah."
Right but you know just because you've devoted a year or two to this project you think its really important don't assume that other people will place it as high priority as you do.
"Yeah, yeah that's a good point and I have to profess you go give some advice to authors about writing style because you've written a number of editorials in American Journal of Epidemiology dealing with writing."
Mm-hm.
Right.
So what advice do you have to the writing?
"Well, I guess clarity and conciseness are what I would put as the highest priority."
Characteristics of writing avoid repetition.
Sometimes people will say something in the introduction and then repeat it in the discussion.
"Avoid that or they'll say something in the method section, which gets repeated in results."

- Especially because Java catches jar index offsets.
- If you replace a jar in a running app....
"- Things get very, very interesting. - ..you get horrible, horrible problems."
"- If you try to load a component that hasn't been loaded yet, the jar offset is wrong so it will just give you a bizarre ""no class.found"" error."
It's a bad error.
It's bad.
That is all.

"When you compile those jars into the extension directory, [indecipherable] and you still have to put them back in the [indecipherable], correct?"
- No.
- If you just shovel them in there then you're lost when the application starts?
- Any jars in your slash content extension are going to be loaded before anything else in your class paths.
There is nothing you have to do.
It's even loaded before the library extension.

Um.
"While I'm looking up the D800, what types of courses would be most helpful for you coming up?"
"Um, do you, do you I ike the longer courses where you can just go in and pick out a movie?"

"Uh, how they connect with each other, that would be helpful because they go into the multi media, there is after effects photo shop, and premiere, and the audio piece, what is it, the um, audition."
Uh huh.
"Here I have one that shows how they all connect with each other, how you place to using one thing and go back to the other set, for saying, mention "" em briefly in one or the other."

"If I take this guy and evaluate it, it's the vector 1, minus 1, 4."
"And then this guy is the vector 3, 5, and 1."
So what we just did and this is-- I don't know.
"For some reason, I find this to be pretty amazing."
We can now rewrite this transformation here as the product of any vector.
"So if we define this to be equal to a, or we could write it this way."
We can now write our transformation.
"Our transformation of x1, x2 can now be rewritten as the product of this vector."
I'll write it in green.
"The vector 1, 3, minus 1, 5, 4, 1 times our input vector, x1, x2, which is super cool because now we just have to do a matrix multiplication."
"Instead of this, and if we have some processor that does this super fast, we can then use that."
"I don't know, I think this is especially elegant, because what happens here is we applied the transformations to each of the columns of a 2-by-2 matrix, and we got a 3-by-2 matrix."
And we know what happens when you multiply a 3-by-2 matrix times a vector that's in R2.
Or you can almost view this as a 2-by-1 matrix.
You're going to get a vector that is in R3.
Because you're going to have these guys times that guy's going to be the first term.
These guys times these guys are going to be the second term.
These guys times those guys are going to be the third term.
"So by kind of creating this 3-by-2 matrix, we have actually created a mapping from R2 to R3."
"Anyway, for some reason I find this to be especially neat."
"Hopefully, at least you find this somewhat instructive."
hello dear sports fans
I'm with you again DmitriyXfit
And you still do this?
And I don't do this anymore.
I haven't practiced for real for the last 7 months.
What the meaning of that?
For me if you were to pull it very far - it was like being a drug addict and not getting the high you need.
"But after some time I learned - no, I do practice because I go through everything in my head."
"I play with the band, I play concerts, I don't have time to do everything anymore."
But that time will hopefully come again.
As long as you work and do something you just need to be happy with yourself.
Teenagers who are sad and have a bad personal image send in a demo after demo and have no response from  record-labels.
They shouldn'tbe sad they should be proud of themselves that they  are not just sitting on the couch doing nothing.
Do you feel that you had to let go of many things to get where you are now?
No.
The only thing I let go without knowing was my first and biggest love.
"You talk a lot about love, you sing about love."
"Well, there are a lot of emotions in me; it's not for just anything."
"I get very emotional - ""Titanic' you know of it, right?"
"Or ""Notebook"","
I just cry because I put myself too far into the films.
And I can't be sad for breaking up with a girl when there obviously was fate surrounding the situation.
We're getting close to the end and we talked about it earlier - how does you future look?
If you can picture it?
If I'm allowed to decide...
But you will decide.
"Yes, my future looks like I will now do many concerts this summer which I will not let people cancel, that was some surprise."
And...
And I will after some time take a little vacation where I will think over what my next project will be.
I'm quite sure that one day I will end up in children's television as a host probably.
And I also really want to help with a new talent.
And I will turn into an old-news and then I want to be there discovering a new talent.
"It's kind of the ""circle of life""."
"Alexander Rybak, thank you for being here."
That's hazelnut and walnuts.
"Next to it, some tapioca maltodextrin."
I wanted to give it a little bit of...
"You know what it is, it's garbage is what it is. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What you did on that dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is inappropriate&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and ultimately kind of disgusting."
"Congratulations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The cranberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the nuts, the gooseberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; already just unheard of in a risotto."
That is a disaster.
[Whispers]
"Oh, dear. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Damn.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Serve us your best.
Anybody.
[Whispers]
"Damn it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Graham)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Last but not least,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Dave Mack.
"I'm looking at my dish, the plating and everything was fantastic."
"My dish came out exactly how I wanted, and I feel very confident."
"What we have here is some morel mushrooms, some portobello mushrooms."
"Used some veal stock, a sauvignon blanc."
Did you wash the mushrooms?
I didn't wash them out completely.
"If they're not rinsed super well, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;especially the morels,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it's like a dirt sponge,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and you taste that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and it's just gritty.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It's just really bad.
Don't grab a morel. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why do you tell me&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what to avoid?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm here to eat the dish or should I eat selectively?
As you wish.
[Utensils clatter]
A little too sandy for me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Big mistake.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Guys, some basic stuff &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;like feeding us sand&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and things like that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; not good."
I screwed up.
But I hope that they're able to see through that and still see my culinary greatness.
"We tasted some fantastic risottos and, sadly, some disastrous risottos. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We now need to come up&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with a decision."
(Announcer) The judges must now decide which home cooks are the bottom three.
"From these, one more person will be sent home tonight."

S:
I'm here with Dr. Agus who is a professor of engineering and medicine here at USC.
We're looking at pictures of things that seem very different to me.
What is the commonality?
Dr:
The commonality is inflammation.
"Inflammation can be manifested by a runny nose or the flu, it could be manifested by an infection in your toes, it could be hitting your head playing football, or hitting your arm when you fall while playing a sport"
All of those can cause inflammation.
S:
Inflammation has a certain meaning in everyday language:
It means something is swollen and red.
But here we're talking about inflammation in the medical or scientific sense where it's not things are swollen and red BECAUSE of inflammation.
Dr:
Right.
S:
So what is inflammation?
It isn't just swollen and redness.
Football players get red and swollen.
Dr:
Inflammation occurs when your body senses danger.
"So when something is wrong--whether it be infection, whether it be trauma--in the case of football players your body senses danger and sends in its front-line soldiers which are its immune cells in order to fight whatever is causing it."
"So, if it's trauma, the immune cells go in there and they help rebuild the tissue that is damaged."
"If it's bacteria, they go in there and try to take away the bacteria so you can get over that cold or that flu."
"So, that whole process is what we call inflammation, it's the ""danger process""."
S:
So the immune cells go to the site of danger to either fight the danger itself or repair the aftermath of the danger.
That sounds like a good thing!
Dr:
It's an awesome thing.
"For six months, heavy rains cause rivers to rise."
Forests to flood.
The Amazon and its tributaries overflow an area about the size of California.
Which poses real problems for ants.
Their homes can be covered with over 30 feet of water for months at a time.
"To survive the flood, ants need to build an ark."
It's a raft.
A miracle of biological engineering.
"None of the ants are submerged, or even get wet."
"Their water-repellent bodies push against the surface, shaping it into a bowl-- without breaking the surface tension."
Nature's Noahs are number 8 in the countdown because the ant's ark can ride out the flood for months.
It holds millions of passengers with zero casualties.
Unless it runs into pirates.
Heat is another killer.
"Out of the shade of the forest, the larvae are suffering."
Workers carry them to the edge of the raft and dip them in the cool water.
The fight for survival doesn't end when the colony runs aground.
Scouts race ahead to find a new nest site.
Others unload the women and children.
Soon the ants will be safe in a new nest.
Until the next flood.
Drought is deadly.
"Without water, some animals are forced to leave."
Others do something unbelievable.
Tiger salamanders become cannibals.
"In the shallow ponds of Arizona, juvenile tiger salamanders come in two types-- both with feathery gills."
Mom has no gills and lays eggs.
But not all eggs are created equal.
Scientists discovered the tiger salamander has a unique way to survive drought.
Some eggs carry the genetic blueprints to become harmless plankton feeders.
Others become cannibals.
"A month after hatching, they transform into killers, with big teeth and big heads."
Now what if I tell you that we observe that X 1 was equal to this little value X 1.
"Well if that's the case, then you can come up here and you'll see that X 2 is more"
likely than not to be in this region as.
I'll circle them right here.
So in fact you would expect the conventional mean x one equals little x one to be maybe somewhere around here .
And this would be near 2.1 okay?
Likewise you can see just from this.
"Again, that the variance of x2 would have shrunk."
"Because knowing something about x1 would give us information about x2, and that would decrease our uncertainty about the"
location of x2.
And in fact this expression here tells us how to actually do that.
This mathematically.
"So, so they're conditional distributions."
"A conditional distribution of a multivariate normal is again, multivariate normal."
"We also mention that the linear combination, ax plus a, of multivariate normal random variable x, is normally distributed with mean, a times the expected value of x plus little a, and covariance mix, matrix a times covariance of x times A transpose."
Welcome back.
Well we left off on problem number 13.
But let me start it over just so that we don't get confused kind of doing the problem over the course of two videos.
So number 13.
It starts off with this pattern.
"3, 5, minus 5."
And what it says in the problem is that each even number term is 2 more than the previous term.
And then each odd number term is negative 1 times the previous term.
So we started with 3.
"So let me say term-- let me write it here, term-- term and then value."
And then what we did.
Maybe we could call that f of x or the function.
How did we go from one value to the next?
"So if we make a table, term one is value 3."
And that's just the starting one.
Term two is 5.
"That's because we added 2, we added 2 to 3."
"While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution, and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders, we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage, or whether it's domestic violence, whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere."
"So, why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?"
"What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in, that we can stop, and that there are other ways of actually taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people."
"Well, here is one such way."
(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.
Your parents were peaceful people.
Your grandparents were peaceful people.
So much peace in one place?
How could it be otherwise?
(Music)
"But, what if ..."
Yes.
What if ...
One little gene in you has been trying to get through?
"From your beginnings in Africa, through each generation, may be passed on to you, in your creation."
"It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you."
"And if it's in you, then it's in me too."
"Oh, dear."
"It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother."
"It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide."
"Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk."
"Oh, dear."
"And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town."
It's that little gene.
It's small and it's mean.
"Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection."
"Adrenaline, kill."
It'll give you the will.
"Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it."
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
"Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me."
"Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln."
It's still 10 days away.
Ok.
"Quickly I went back to the message,  the first one and what I found is this, obviously."
"He was talking about Tuesday, August 20."
"And I was understanding, of course,  it was the time."
"There is a very thin line  between what I want to say, what I say, what the other guy  wants to hear and the way he understands it."
And any deviation in this thin line automatically puts us in what we generally call... a misunderstanding.
And even though  it produces discomfort to us
"I propose to you the idea that behind our misunderstandings  there is a lot of very useful information at first hand about ourselves, which is also giving us  an opportunity of learning, that allows us to grow and helps us  improve our relationships."
"Lets see, in 1514, spanish explorer"
"Francisco Fernández de Córdoba landed in the shores of the peninsula  he called Yucatán, because that was the word  natives pronunced when he asked them what was the name  of those shores in which he had landed."
"Later, it was known that  in the mayan language,"
"Yucatán means ""I don't understand""."
(Laughter)
"As I was saying,  our misunderstandings speak more about the way in which  we perceive things, than the way things are."
"We are constantly filtering  what we perceive and we do so all the time,  in a major or minor scale."
"As the famous adagio says,"
"""We don't see things just the way  they are, but the way we are""."
"Without going further,  a while ago I found myself working in a job presentation, totally abstracted from the exterior world and then"
I heard some kind of noise  from the exterior that was telling me
"""Bla-bla-bla the kids..."
Bla-bla-bla tomorrow ...
Bla-bla-bla balls...
"And in that moment I noticed  it was the voice of my wife, Maru, who was staring at me, and saying,"
"""Did you hear what I just said?"""
"""Who?"""
This catch phrases allow me  to gain some time.
"""Yes, yes, you were telling me that...  tomorrow I'll take the kids to school..."
"What happened with the balls?"""
"""See."
"When I speak to you,  you don't listen to me"""
"""Yes, eh..."""
Next question says to his agent: did you explain this to her before?
But can you...
Gracias (thank you)
Walks out
ANTHONY:
I was President of one of the fraternities at Cal State Northridge.
"I used to get calls from Dean Peckham on Saturday and Sunday morning at 8:30, because one or more of the fraternities had had some kind of indiscretion, and I was being called on the carpet to explain our misbehavior."
"Of course, I never told my parents that the Dean was calling me for that."
"They were under the impression that I was a very important person to the management of the college, because a dean would call me almost every weekend and ask me to come down to college to help him."
"So, it worked for me."
I hope I helped the dean get the things done that he wanted to do.
It seems he went from there to a tremendous amount of success with the university.
(Music Plays)
NARRATOR:
Few individuals affiliated with Cal State Northridge are as beloved as Dr. Edmund Peckham.
"The son of two teachers, Ed learned the value of education and mentoring at an early age."
"With a bachelor's from Brown and a master's and Ph.D from Harvard,"
Ed began his service to San Fernando Valley State College in 1967 as Dean of Student Activities and Housing.
Ed was faced with the difficult task of initiating from the ground up a comprehensive program to improve student life on campus.
ANTHONY:
I think Ed's ability to get along with almost everybody was probably his main tremendous strength.
He was able to deal with people in almost any venue and come out looking like everybody's friend.
NARRATOR:
"By 1969, he was named Dean of Students and in 1985 he was named Vice President of Student Affairs."
"Ed was an active administrator, attending Associated Student government meetings, emceeing campus events, and advising many, many student clubs and organizations."
WlLLlAM:
"When we think about campus spirit, we think of Ed Peckham."
He was a colorful person.
He drove a yellow convertible vehicle.
I think it was a Pontiac.
And he'd ride this thing in the Homecoming parades.
He just had a lot of color about him and about his involvement with students.
"The expert's strategy, a full immersion language treatment."
"She needs a lot of practice talking in complete sentences, talking on a more"
"literate level of things, really talking about issues."
What was Clinton's position in the article that you took your notes on?
"We want to build these muscles, these expressive language muscles because one of the best ways to learn to talk, right, is to have plenty of practice."
It's almost like working out for a sport.
And she has to do that.
She needs a verbal work out.
You need to be a risk taker.
You need to try a new word.
You need to make that
leap.
But you have to be comfortable.
You have to be confident.
You have to know you're in a safe place to do it.
And someone's got to be there to help give you the ammunition to take that risk.
"But once you start taking it and once you start succeeding, the ripple effect is wonderful."
"There, it's very positive."
"So the prescription for Sarah Lee is a kind of immersion therapy, almost like"
learning a foreign language.
"There will be flash card drills, practice conversations, lots of reading, and new vocabulary words over and over and over."
"If she keeps it up, the experts believe she can overcome her expressive language deficiency."
What should you do if you find someone's wallet or purse in a store?
You should-- if the person it not too far-- you should run and give it to them or you can--
"One year later, the assessment of Sarah Lee's progress is indeed hopeful. --and let them know that you have their wallet."
I hope if I loose my wallet you're the one who finds it.
This past year has been a year of real growth for her.
She's contributing more to classes now and she's doing more reading.
And she's found ways to help herself.
And that alone is like shooting baskets to prepare for a basketball game.
"The more she does, the better she gets at it."
Sara Lee has improved dramatically.
Those are roosts.
Oh!
OK.
"Again, what it does is, it makes the whole farm infrastructure portable."
"So it could be done in suburbia, it could be done on a rental farm, it could be done on an uncle's farm, you can move all this around."
"And that really changes the entrance opportunity, and the expansion capability, by having the infrastructure all portable."
"Of course, the turkeys, they'll pick up 45% of their diet off the grass, so that's why they get a much bigger area."
It's great.
"Yeah, they got this area today, and they were just there two days before, we move them every two days."
"And, again, we've got the cows ahead, we're shortening the grass with the cows."
Do you need a tractor to move this?
"Yeah, this is a feed buggy up on the front, so it's hooked up to the feed buggy."
"So you just hook up to the feed buggy with a tractor here, you set up your next circle up here, and you just hook up with the tractor and open it up."
And you've been doing this for twenty years?
"I came back to the farm full time September 24, 1982."
It'll be 30 years this September 24th.
"So what type of adoption have you seen across the industry with people accepting these techniques and utilizing them, and raising pastured poultry."
"Well, it's growing, but it's such a tiny subset of the whole industry that it's still not a spit in the ocean."
Still way less than one percent.
"Oh, yeah, but it's growing."
What is the rate at which it is growing?
Is it doubling every year?
Is it 50%?
"I don't, it's hard to tell."
Do you think it might be doubling?
"I don't know, I doubt if it's doubling."
"Doubling every year, that would be astronomical."
But I can imagine now that it's increasing by 10 or 15% every year.
So it's definitely going up.
"So if there were one thousand farms last year, there'll be probably eleven hundred this year, and thirteen hundred next year, and it's definitely on the up swing."
Being fueled partly by the whole local food tsunami.
"The whole local food, integrity food tsunami."
"Well, what I do is I take the transformation of this guy."
"My domain right here is R2, and I produce a vector that's going to be in Rn."
"So what I do is, let's see."
So I'm concerned with multiplying things times vectors in R2.
"So what we're going to do is we're going to start with the identity matrix, identity 2 because that's my domain and it just looks like this:"
"1, 0, 0, 1."
I'm just going to start with that.
"And all I do is I apply my transformation to each of the columns, each of my standard bases."
These are the standard bases for R2.
"I showed you that they're bases, how do I know that they're standard?"
Why are they called the standard bases?
"And I haven't covered this in a lot of detail right yet, but you could take the dot product of any of these guys with any of the other guys, and you'll see that they're all orthogonal to each other."
"The dot product of any one of these columns with the other is always zero, so that's a nice clue."
"And they all have length of 1, so that's a nice reason why they're called the standard bases."
"But anyway, back to our attempt to represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
"So we say look, our domain is in R2, so let's start with I2, or we could call it our 2-by-2 identity matrix."
And let's apply the transformation to each of its column vectors where each of its column vectors are a vector in the standard basis for R2.
So I'm going to write it like this.
"The first column is T of this column, and then the second column is going to be T of 0, 1."
And I know I'm getting messier with my handwriting.
"What is T of the vector 1, 0?"
"Well, we just go here."
We construct another vector.
So we get 1 plus 3 times 0 is 1.
"Then we get 5 times 0 minus 1, so that's minus 1. x2 is zero in this case."
"And then we get 4 times 1 plus 0, so that's just 4."
"So that's T of 1, 0."
"And then what is T of 0, 1?"
"T of 0, 1 is equal to-- so we have 0 plus 3 times 1 is 3."
Then we have 0 minus 1 is minus 1.
Let me make sure I did this one right.
What was this?
Win Phippen:
"On a more sophisticated scale, the corn and soybean production has been around for a while."
And there are several plant breeders in the country that have actually been working on this.
But they are simply trying to improve production practices.
"And so they could be, simply, improving the hybrids for insect resistance, or disease resistance."
Every year new diseases come along.
Soybean Asian Rust is one that came back a few years ago.
All of our current varities didn't have Soybean Asian Rust resistance in it.
"And so now they are looking back to the old wild populations to see if they can find that resistance and find some old lines, and cross it into today's hybrid line."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
And why it is that Western is well positioned to be doing this sort or research?
Win Phippen:
We're in the perfect location.
"We're ideally suited, in the middle of the Midwest."
"We're right in the center of a lot of graduate-level programs, where students can go on and get master's degrees, and PhDs in plant breeding."
"And, most of the seed-breeding companies are located right here in the Midwest."
And so our students come in with a good agricultural background.
And now they can get...
"This grant adds a new minor here in the department, in the School of Ag."
Beth Seaton:
So you have a new minor in plant breeding?
Win Phippen:
A new minor in plant breeding.
So that offers two new courses.
One is in traditional plant breeding...
And this is where we simply cross plants with each other.
And it offers the new bio-technology plant breeding.
"And this is, you've probably heard about genetically engineering plants."
This is here we can introduce DNA from other sources into plants to give it some unique traits.
And this is where we can have plants resistant to herbicides and insects and things like that.
Beth Seaton:
You can get some on the Ave.
"You know? for those of you who are far away from the Ave, I don't know where you can get incense, but we've got lots here."
"Maybe we can ship some to you, 'kay?"
"And then you can meditate upon this, okay?"
"But I'll just tell you that's your matrix A. And then, what we're going to do, is do exactly what we did in class last time."
"Remember this matrix a, it's 500 rows, 5000 columns, so it's, it's a big matrix with highly under determined, okay?"
"Oh by the way, well lets go back to that."
"Now once you get that, then, here you go."
This is exactly what we did in class last time.
"We're going to solve this, highly underdetermined system, in three ways."
We're going to use the pseudo inverse Command.
"We're going to say okay, find the suit [UNKNOWN] over in the first of this matrix a."
Multiply it by your sample signal.
"Get a v-, get the vector x out, okay?"
"We're also going to say, alright, how about just use the backslash."
Backslash solves large and indetermined systems.
"There it is, we'll call that X2 and then, here you go."
"Here's the optimization routine, and I've given you a link that you can download this."
It's a
little add-on in that .
It's just a generic convex optimization solver.
"What you're going to do is, Is the following."
"There's some variable x3 that's going to be our solution, and you want to minimize, so what you want to do, is you want to find the minimum l1 solution of this under determine system, so here it is."
"Minimize the norm x3, within one norm."
"There's the one norm right there, right?"
The l1 norm.
"Subject to x = b, right?"
So there's infinite number of solutions.
"Give me the one that satisfies the solution, but also has the smallest l1 norm."
That's what y ou're saying to do.
"And you know, from what we did last time."
"First thing is probably going to do, is say, hey, you know what?"
Hockenheim.
It was while test driving and I was always a proponent of hassling people.
That's what we were talking about.
This hierarchy...
"Mansell, Prost, Senna, Berger wanted to put us in our places, which I could never accept."
One example was the test driving in Hockenheim.
I was during a qualifying simulation.
"Ayrton already finished his turn, actually, but suddenly he wanted to come in again."
"He saw that I was straight behind him and even though he had Honda power he drove the curves very slowly, but I could not overtake in a curve, so I tried on the straight but he pushed the throttle and was gone again."
I could not keep up with my Ford engine.
"He did that to me twice in different moments, but then there was a third situation."
"But this time, I was the one ahead and of course I made now the same play as he did."
But he could not stand that and told me afterwards that this is not a correct behaviour.
So that were the first conflicts with the established ones.
I remember that Berger once said:
"""This guy is so eager."
Totally overambitious.
"Actually we don't like him!"""
Did you feel that you got kind of ignored by those drivers?
I felt the opposing wind from them.
"There was an interesting situation, I think in the first or second year"
"Gerhard (Berger) had a flat tire, drove on the side, could not go fast anymore."
I tried to overtake and he totally cut in on me.
This was an act to show me that I should be aware when and whom I overtake
Years later we went home from Monza in the same car...
I already made my first championship and we had an honest conversation.
He said:
"""Well friend, at that time we had the feeling that we must run rings around you."""
You were considered as unapproachable at that time...
What do you think about it?
Quite the contrary!

Sublimation
"Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős proved that if ""n"" is superabundant, then there is a ""k"" and ""a""1, ""a""2, ..., ""a""""k"" such that"
"where ""p""i is the ""i""-th prime number, and"
"Basically, they proved that if a number is superabundant, the exponent of a larger prime number is never bigger than a smaller prime number during prime decomposition(the process of a composite number become smaller prime numbers). All primes from 0 to formula_4 are also factors of ""n"". The equation says that a superabundant number has to be an even integer. It also is a multiple of the ""k""-th primorial formula_5"
"Superabundant numbers are like highly composite numbers. Not all superabundant numbers are highly composite numbers, though."
Alaoglu and Erdős observed that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant.
Eyeliner
An eyeliner (sometimes written eye liner) is a type of makeup used for the eyes. It is applied around the contours of the eyes to create different aesthetic effects.
"In the 20th and 21st century, the use of eye liner has also been associated with Goth and Punk fashion."
History.
"Eye liner was first used in Ancient India, Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia as a dark black line around the eyes. As early as 10,000 BC, Egyptians and Mesopotamians wore various cosmetics including eye liner not only for aesthetics but to protect the skin from the desert sun. Eye liner may also have been worn to protect the wearer from the evil eye. The characteristic of having heavily lined eyes has been frequently shown in ancient Egyptian art. They produced eye liner with a variety of materials, including copper ore and antimony. Ancient Egyptian kohl contained galena, which was imported from nearby regions in the Land of Punt, Coptos and Western Asia."
"In the 1960s, liquid eye liner was used to create thick black and white lines around the eyes in the make-up fashion associated with designers like Mary Quant. The '60s and '70s also saw new fashion trends which made use of eyeliner, eyeshadow and mascara in new ways. As goth and punk fashion developed, they employed eyeliner for a dark and dramatic effect."

Lawrence Bragg
Sir William Lawrence Bragg (31 March 1890 – 1 July 1971) was an Australian-born British physicist and X-ray crystallographer.
"Bragg was always known as Sir Lawrence Bragg, and his father was Sir William Bragg. Lawrence Bragg was educated in Adelaide, Australia and in England. He was awarded the Military Cross in World War I."
"Lawrence Bragg discovered (1912) the Bragg law of X-ray diffraction, the basis of X-ray crystallography. He was joint winner (with his father, Sir William Bragg) of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915."
"To date, Lawrence Bragg is the youngest Nobel Laureate. He was the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953."
"He was elected an FRS in 1921. He was knighted by George VI in 1941, and received both the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society."
Hoverfly
"Hoverflies, sometimes called 'flower flies' or 'syrphid flies', are the insect family Syrphidae. Hoverflies mimic wasp stripes, and are usually smaller than wasps. Thus to a bird they may look scarcely worth eating, and dangerous."
"As their common name suggests, they are often seen hovering or sucking nectar at flowers. The adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen, while the larvae (maggots) eat a wide range of foods."
"In some species, the larvae are saprotrophs, eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects."
"Aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year. Hoverflies are important natural enemies of these pests, and can be used in biological control. Some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators. Some orchids mimic aphid alarm scent (pheromones), which attracts hoverflies. The hoverflies then pollinate the orchids."
"About 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described. Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on most continent except Antarctica."
"Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their mimicry of the black and yellow stripes of wasps. They are a classic example of Batesian mimicry. The Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing: it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting, but in reality it is good to eat. Hover flies look roughly like little wasps, and their warning colouration is well-known to birds."
"Unlike adults, the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods. Predatory species benefit farmers and gardeners, because aphids destroy crops. Hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control."
Atomkraft
"Atomkraft are an English heavy metal band who were part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. They formed in 1979 and disbanded 1988. Their ""Total Metal"" approach is somewhere between fellow NWOBHM bands such as Motörhead and Venom, punk rock bands such as The Dickies, and early Exodus or Slayer."
Sounds.
"The Waray language has sixteen consonants: . There are three main vowels: ""a"" , ""i"" , and ""u"" . Consonants and were once allophone but cannot interchange, like ""palaron"" (to be lucky) [from ""palad"", palm (because someone's luck is seen in the palm)] but not ""paladon"" and ""tagadiín"" (from where) [from ""diín"", where] but not ""tagariín""."
Numbers.
"Native numbers are used for numbers one through ten. From eleven onwards, Spanish numbers are exclusively used in Waray today, their native counterparts being almost unheard of by the majority of native speakers numbers (except for gatus for ""hundred"" and yukot for ""thousand""). Some, specially the old ones, are spoken alongside the Spanish counterparts."
Some common words and phrases.
Below are examples of the Waray spoken in Metropolitan Tacloban and the nearby areas:
J.E.B. Stuart
"James Ewell Brown Stuart (1833-1864) was a general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. He was from Virginia. During the war, he was known for dangerous things he did while riding a horse. He was killed at the Battle of Yellow Tavern in 1864."
Riodinidae
"Riodinidae is a family of butterflies. They are commonly known as riodinids or metalmarks. Metalmarks get their name from the bright, metallic (looking like metal) markings found on the wings of most species. The family has nearly 2,000 species in it. The metalmarks are mostly found in the Neotropical region. Most metalmarks are small. Their wingspan ranges from 20mm to 65mm. Metalmarks vary greatly in wing shape, pattern, and color."
Riodinidae was formerly known as the family Nemeobiidae and as the family Erycinidae. It was also once thought to be a subfamily of Lycaenidae.
Taxicab number
"A taxicab number is the name given by mathematicians to a sequence of special numbers: 2, 1729 etc. A taxicab number is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in ""n"" distinct ways. It has nothing to do with taxis, but the name comes from a well-known conversation that took place between two famous mathematicians: Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan."
The story about Godfrey Hardy’s taxi.
"Godfrey Hardy was a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University. One day he went to visit a friend, the brilliant young Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was ill. Both men were mathematicians and liked to think about numbers."
When Ramanujan heard that Hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what the number of the taxi was. Hardy said that it was just a boring number: 1729. Ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at all: it was a very interesting one. He explained that it was the smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
This story is very famous among mathematicians. 1729 is sometimes called the “Hardy-Ramanujan number”.
Explanation of the Hardy-Ramanujan's number.
There are two ways to say that 1729 is the sum of two cubes.
1x1x1=1; 12x12x12=1728. So 1+1728=1729
But also: 9x9x9=729; 10x10x10=1000. So 729+1000=1729
"There are other numbers that can be shown to be the sum of two cubes in more than one way, but 1729 is the smallest of them."
Known taxicab numbers.
"Since the famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan, mathematicians have tried to find other interesting numbers that are the smallest number that can be expressed by the sum of two cubes in three/four/five etc. different ways. These numbers are very, very big, and have been found by computers."
"So far, the following six taxicab numbers are known :"
Bernard Frénicle de Bessy
"Bernard Frénicle de Bessy (about 1605–1675), was a French mathematician. He was born in Paris. He wrote many papers about mathematics, number theory and combinatorics. The Frénicle standard form, a standard representation of magic squares, is named after him. He solved many problems created by Fermat. He also discovered a taxicab number and in 1693, he described all 880 essentially different normal magic squares of order 4."
"Like Fermat, Frénicle was an amateur mathematician, but he wrote letters to famous people such as Descartes, Christiaan Huygens, Mersenne and also Fermat, who was his friend. He is mainly remembered for his discoveries about number theory."
Soledad O'Brien
"Maria de la Soledad Teresa O'Brien (born September 19, 1966) is an American broadcast journalist. She does broadcasts for CNN and HBO. She has received an Emmy Award."

""Do What U Want"" has reached the top ten in Canada and the UK and the top twenty on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. It charted moderately on other charts around the world. A music video has been made for the single but was never commercially released."
"A remix was released on January 1, 2014, featuring fellow pop singer Christina Aguilera, after she and Gaga performed the song on the competition series ""The Voice"", where Aguilera was a coach."
"In January 2019, a documentary called ""Surviving R. Kelly"" was released which talked about Kelly's allegedly abusive relationships with women. Gaga later regretted working with him on the song and had the album version removed from all music stores and streaming services. She also claimed that she was a supporter for Kelly's alleged victims. Other than remixes, only the Christina Aguilera version of the song is still available."

"By contrast, death caused by active intervention is known as unnatural death. The ""unnatural"" causes are usually given as accident (implying no unreasonable voluntary risk), misadventure (accident following a willful and dangerous risk, which can include drug or alcohol overdose), suicide, or homicide. In some settings, other categories may be added. For example, a prison may track the deaths of inmates caused by acute intoxication separately.

However, it differs from other titles in that there is no assisted aiming, a bigger focus on gameplay, and online multiplayer. Samus Aran, the main character that the player plays as, can access her gunship from anywhere. The game uses both screens of the Nintendo DS: the top screen is used to show Samus' health and the amount of a weapon remaining, while the bottom screen shows the radar. The player moves Samus with the D-pad, and aiming is done with the use of the touch screen on the Nintendo DS' bottom screen."
"Online multiplayer can be played with up to four players. Players can play as Samus or one of six bounty hunters. Each bounty hunter has different forms and weapons. The game's host is able to set options for points and time limits, as well as determine whether or not players can use the radar. If less than four players join a game, computer-controlled characters are placed into the game. In multiplayer, the bottom screen shows the number of kills a player has made and the time remaining in the round."

"Commerzbank Tower is located in Frankfurt's district ""Innenstadt"" in the centre of the city. It is home to the headquarters of the second largest German bank, Commerzbank."
History.
"From 1970 onwards, the previous head offices were centralised in Frankfurt am Main, where the legal seat has also been located since 1990. In the early 1990s, Commerzbank sought to build a new skyscraper in the center of Frankfurt am Main. The aim was to consolidate a large part of the rented locations in the city. The extraordinary skyscraper was designed by Lord Norman Foster. Since 1997, the tower has been a prominent feature of the Frankfurt skyline and is regarded as a model for environmentally friendly and energy-saving architecture."
Architecture.
"The floor plan forms a triangle with slightly outwardly curved sides. The tower appears open and transparent due to the atrium, also triangular. A double-skin facade encloses the building. The stepped top of the tower creates a striking building termination and sets an expressive sign for the banking district. The building was constructed from 1994 to 1997 and cost 600 million DM. It has 56 floors and an area of 109,200 square metres. The architect who designed the building is Norman Foster. The skyscraper weighs about 200,000 tonnes and contains 18,800 tonnes of steel - twice as much as the Eiffel Tower in Paris."
Green Building.
"The architect and his client worked together to make the Commerzbank tower innovatively environmentally- and climate-friendly. Natural ventilation and environmentally-friendly air conditioning create a long-term contribution to climate protection. The tower has been supplied entirely with ""green"" electricity since the beginning of 2008 and - like all Commerzbank buildings - is cleaned exclusively with biodegradable cleaning products. In 2009 the city of Frankfurt awarded the Commerzbank tower the ""Green Building Frankfurt"" award."
Present.
"The magnificent building at the Kaiserplatz in Frankfurt is the Commerzbank's Head Office, and 2.800 people work there."
Messeturm
"MesseTurm is a skyscraper in Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, Germany. In English it is known as the ""Trade Fair Tower"". It is Germany's second tallest, and at the time of its building, it was the tallest building in Europe. It is the fourth tallest building in Europe. It is 257 metres (840 feet) tall."
"MesseTurm is located in Frankfurt's district ""Westend"". This is near the same named Trade Fair-Area in the centre of the city. It is home to the German headquarters of Reuters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse."
"The construction began in 1988. It was finished in 1991. It was the tallest building in Europe, between 1991 and 1997. In 1997, Commerzbank Tower became the tallest building in Germany. It was only two metres higher than MesseTurm. The construction of the building's foundation set a world record. The world record was for the longest continuous concrete pour. Ninety trucks poured concrete for 78 hours. They poured it into the deep foundation."
"There is a pyramid on the very top of MesseTurm. It is tall. This makes it very different from other skyscrapers. Because of this shape, people in Germany often call it ""The Pencil."""
Arrondissement of Belley
"He wrote seven stories, six short ones, and two non-fiction ones. Three of his stories, four collections of his short stories, and three non-fiction ones were released after he died. Because he did many exciting things, some people say that, of the many characters he created in his books, he was his best creation."
Hemingway's early life.
"Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, near the midwestern city of Chicago. He was the second child in a family of six. His father was a doctor. His mother was a painter and a pianist."
"Each summer, the family traveled to their holiday home in northern Michigan. Ernest's father taught him how to catch fish, hunt, set up a camp, and cook over a fire."
"At home in Oak Park, Ernest wrote for his school newspaper. He tried to write like a famous sports writer, Ring Lardner, and he made his writing skills better."
Start as a news reporter.
"In 1917, Hemingway decided not to go to a university. The United States had just entered World War I and he wanted to join the Army, but they rejected him because his eyesight was not good enough."
"Ernest found a job with the ""Kansas City Star"" newspaper in Kansas City, Missouri. He reported news that happened at the hospital, police headquarters, and the railroad station. One reporter said: ""Hemingway liked to be where the action was."""
"The Kansas City Star told its reporters to write short sentences, and to report unusual details of an incident. Hemingway quickly learned to do both."
His life outside of America.
Hemingway worked for the newspaper for nine months. He then joined the Red Cross to help on the battle fields of Europe. His job was to drive an ambulance and to take wounded soldiers off the battlefield.
"The Red Cross sent him to Italy. There, he soon saw the first wounded. This was when a weapons factory in Milan exploded. Later, he was sent to the battle front. He went close to the fighting to see how he could act in the face of danger. Soon, he was seriously wounded."
"Soon after healing, the war ended. Hemingway returned to the United States. After less than a year he had changed forever: he needed to write about what he had seen. Hemingway wrote many short stories about people who experienced World War I."
Gone to Chicago.
"Some time later, Hemingway left home for Chicago to prove to himself, and to his family, that he could earn a living from his writing."
"But he ran out of money and began to write for a newspaper again. The Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Star, loved his reports in Chicago. They hired him and paid him well."
"In Chicago, Hemingway also met Sherwood Anderson. Anderson was one of the first American writers to write about common people. Hemingway saw that Anderson's stories showed life as it really was. This was similar to what he wanted to do."
Anderson gave Hemingway advice about his writing. He told Hemingway to move to Paris. Life was less costly there. Anderson said that Paris had many young artists and writers from many nations.
In Paris.
"Hemingway decided to move to Paris. Before he did, in America, he married a woman he had recently met. Her name was Hadley Richardson."
"Paris was cold and grey when Hemingway and his new wife arrived in 1921. They lived in one of the poorer parts of the city. Their rooms were small and they did not have water from pipes. But the ""Toronto Star"" employed him as its European reporter, so they had enough money for the two of them to live. That job gave Hemingway time to write his stories."
"Hemingway enjoyed exploring Paris, learning French customs, and meeting friends. Some of these new friends were artists and writers who had come to the city in the 1920s. Among them were poet, Ezra Pound, and writers Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Seeing that Hemingway was a good writer, they helped him publish his stories in the United States. He was thankful for their support at the time, but later denied that he had received their help."
"Hemingway travelled all over Europe. He wrote about politics, peace conferences, and border disputes, as well as sports, skiing, and fishing. Later he would write about bullfighting in Spain. The ""Toronto Star"" was pleased with his work, and wanted more of his reports, but Hemingway was busy with his own writing."
"He said this: ""Sometimes, I would start a new story and could not get it going. Then I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think. I would say to myself: 'All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know.' So finally, I would write a true sentence and go on from there. It was a wonderful feeling when I had worked well."""
His first success in 1925.
"Hemingway's first book of short stories was called ""In Our Time"". One of its stories, ""Big Two Hearted River,"" told of the effects of war on a young man who was taking a long fishing trip in Michigan. Hemingway had learned from his father, when he was a boy, about living in the wild."
"The story is about two kinds of rivers. One is calm and clear, and is where the young man fishes. The other is a dark, threatening swamp. The story shows its main character trying to forget his past, as well as the war. He does not talk much about the war. The reader learns about the young man, not because Hemingway tells his readers what the man thinks, but because he shows that man learning about himself. Many people believe it is one of the best modern American stories of all time. Because of this, ""Big Two Hearted River"" is often published in collections of best writing."
"After the book was published in 1925, Hadley and Hemingway returned to the United States for the birth of their son, after which they quickly returned to Paris."
"Writing ""The Sun Also Rises""."
Hemingway was working on a long story. He wanted to publish a novel so he would be recognized as a serious writer. And he wanted the money a novel would earn.
"The novel was called ""The Sun Also Rises"". It is about young Americans in Europe after World War One. The war had destroyed their dreams and had given them nothing to replace those dreams. The writer Gertrude Stein later called these people members of ""The Lost Generation."""
"The book was an immediate success. At the age of 25 Ernest Hemingway was famous. Many people, however, did not like Hemingway's art because they did not like what he wrote about."
"The Padmashalis divided into two groups based on ""Sampradaya"", being the Shaivas and the Vaishnavas and they worship both Shiva and Vishnu."

Numerical integration
"Numerical integration is the term used for a number of methods to find an approximation for an integral. Numerical integration has also been called quadrature. Very often, it is not possible to solve integration analytically, for example when the data consists of a number of distinct measurements, or when the antiderivative is not known, and it is difficult, impractical or impossible to find it. In such cases, the integral can be written as a mathematical function defined over the interval in question, plus a function giving the error."
One way to find a numerical integral is using interpolation. Very often these interpolating functions are polynomials.
"Various formulas have been studied for many years and become famous. For example, there is the Gaussian quadrature (named after Gauss), the Newton-Cotes formula (named after Isaac Newton), and the Euler-Maclaurin formula (named after Leonhard Euler)."
Numerical errors.
"Numerical errors can occur in any kind of numerical computation including numerical integration. Errors in numerical integration are considered in another area called ""validated numerics""."

"The town grew as an important centre for transport. After 1769, ships were able to use the river. It was a stagecoach stop for travel on the road between London and Cambridge. In 1842 the town got a railway station."
"In 1901 there were 7,000 people living there, and by 1951 it was 13,000."

Malnutrition
Malnutrition is eating a diet which does not supply enough nutrients. There are two broad cateogries of malnutrition:
"Sometimes, people need to lose weight, and eat according to a special diet. This is usually not called malnutrition."
"Malnutrition is considered a more scientific and official term than starvation which has negative associations. Malnutrition is not, however, simply a matter of eating too little. Someone can be malnourished if they eat an unhealthy diet. This can be cured by eating a proper balanced diet."
"Children whose daily diet contains less carbohydrate and protein do not grow well. They do not gain weight. Their hands and legs appear as skin and bones. They cry all the time with hunger. They are not active and have sunken eyes. Such children often fall sick. Lack of a particular vitamin is another kind of malnutrition which can cause a particular deficiency disease, such as beriberi and rickets."
"Malnutrition becomes a bigger problem during famine because most of the people do not get enough food, hence increasing the death rate."
"Mont-Saint-Michel is a municipality in the Laurentides region of Quebec, in Canada. It is part of the Antoine-Labelle Regional County Municipality."

Nurse
A nurse is a person who is trained to give care to people who are sick or injured. Nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well and to keep them fit and healthy. Nurses also help with end-of-life needs and assist other family members with grieving.
"Nursing is a profession, like a doctor, but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need. In some places, nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse."
"Nurses work in many places. Nurses work in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and in the community, and they even visit people at home if they can not get out."
"Sometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors, because the nurses will be able to help patients directly, by talking to them, doing things they need, carefully watching that nothing goes wrong, and then seeing them as they get better."
"Like doctors, nurses can choose what work they do. Some nurses train and work to help during surgery. Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition (what to eat), and disease (what can make people sick). Nurses can do many different jobs to help people."
Nurses are in demand because there are not enough nurses to handle hospital needs. Because of this shortage nurses will sometimes travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing.
Titles.
"Registered Nurse in some countries like U.S is a term for an officially registered nurse. In hospitals where nurses wear uniforms with caps, an R.N. is recognizable by the fact that the cap has two black stripes."
Nursing in Australia.
"Nursing in Australia is done by ""Registered Nurses"" or ""Enrolled Nurses"". Both must complete education past high school. An Enrolled Nurse must complete a course of study between 12 and 18 months. Registered Nurses need to complete a Bachelor's degree."
Gender-neutral titles.
"Titles have changed because men as well as women can be nurses. It was, in most countries, a wholly female occupation. The titles were designed for females and have now been revised to be genderless. The exception to this is midwife, a term still used because it seems natural that a nurse helping a mother through childbirth should be a female. There are some males acting as midwives. The supervisory body for UK nursing is the Nursing and Midwifery Council."
Teams.
"Some medical and surgical groups operate as teams. This means that senior surgeons always operate with the same group of people, so reducing the risk of mistakes, and allowing juniors to learn and understand the individual cases."
"Also, moving around as a team allows specialist groups to serve more than one hospital. This is particularly useful when the amount of work in a speciality does not permit having a full team on site in each hospital."

Batting (cricket)
"In the sport of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat. It is done to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket."
"Any player who is currently batting is called a batter even if they are better in any other skills in cricket. Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries. A top-level batter has good reflexes, decision-making and strategy with excellent physical batting skills."
"During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch. The one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called 'the striker', while the other is the non-striker. When a batter is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or until 10 of the team members are out. After the batting of first team is over the other team gets a turn to bat."
"Batting tactics and strategy depends on the type of match being played. It also depends on the current state of play. Batters try to score many runs quickly without losing their wicket. To score quickly, risky shots must be played which increases the chances of batters being out. Batters’ safest choice is to guard the stumps but this may result in scoring fewer runs."
"As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention. It helps to know how effectively a batter is playing. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored by the number of times he has been out (dismissed)."

Chaetognatha
"Chaetognatha, commonly known as arrow worms, are a phylum of small predatory marine animals. They are present in huge numbers in plankton worldwide."
"About 20% of the known species are benthic and can attach to algae or rocks. They are found in all marine waters from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from ."
"Despite the huge numbers, there are only about 120 modern species in 20 genera. Some species are known to use the neurotoxin ""tetrodotoxin"" to subdue their prey."
"Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the Cambrian Period. Complete body fossils have been described from China, and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia."
These animals are usually considered a type of protostome.
Pepper spray
"Pepper spray (also called OC spray, from Oleoresin capsicum) is a spray used for self-defence, by spraying it into an attacker's face. It makes eyes water and causes intense pain, sometimes even leading to temporary blindness. Pepper spray is an inflammatory agent. When someone is sprayed with pepper spray, their eyes will close and they will have difficulty breathing, a runny nose, and cough. The stronger the spray is, the longer the effects last, but the average full effect lasts around thirty to forty-five minutes, with longer effects lasting for hours. Pepper spray is mostly used by police forces for riot control, but in some countries people can use it for self-defence."
"The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin, a chemical found in capsicums, chillis and other members of the pepper family."
Pepper spray usually comes in canisters and can be sprayed up to twenty-five metres.

Phenol
"Phenol is the organic compound with formula C6H5OH. It is a white solid. It has an OH group (hydroxyl group) bonded to a benzene ring. It is an alcohol. Because the aromatic group attracts electrons, it is quite acidic. topolin is produced from petroleum. It is an important molecule because it can be used to make many other products. It is also used in detergents and herbicides."
Properties.
Acidity.
"Phenol has a pKa of about 10. For normal alcohols this number is usually around 15. However, phenol is less acidic than compounds like carboxylic acids. The reason for this high acidity is the resonance stabilization of the molecule when it becomes an anion."
Reactions.
"Phenol can do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions very well. This is because the lone pair on the oxygen atom can give electrons through the benzene ring to an electrophile. Because the lone pair is so high in energy however, sometimes phenol reacts too many times."
History.
"Phenol was first discovered in 1834. It was found as a product of burning coal. One of its first uses was to kill germs in surgery. It is still used today in some analgesics. During the Second World War, phenol was also used by the Nazis. They used it in concentration camps to quickly kill small groups of people."

Unhexquadium
"Unhexquadium is a radioactive element that has not been discovered. It will have 164 protons and 318 neutrons. Interest in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely prompted by predictions that the isotope 482Uhq (with 164 protons and 318 neutrons), would be at the center of a possible second island of stability (the first being centered on 306Ubb or 298Fl )."
Pingualuit crater

The couple lived there for the first few years of their marriage. They had four children."
Lake Torrens National Park
"Lake Torrens National Park is a national park in South Australia, 345 km north of Adelaide. The park protects the area around Lake Torrens, which is a large, dry, salt lake covering an area of 5,700 square kilometres. The lake is part of a large rift valley that also includes Spencer Gulf. Lake Torrens has been filled with water twice in the last 150 years."
"The lake filled in 2010 and attracted a large number of birds, including 150,000 Banded Stilts. This bird can only breed on islands in flooded salt lakes and have only bred in South Australia seven times in the last 70 years. The last known breeding was at Lake Eyre in 2000. During dry times the stilts live at the Coorong Lakes waiting for the salt lakes to flood."
History.
The first European to find Lake Torrens was Edward John Eyre in 1839. For many years it was believed that Lake Torrens was a large horseshoe-shaped salt lake in the northern Flinders Ranges. This salt lake blocked any path to the interior. The first European to get through this barrier was A. C. Gregory from the north in March 1858.
"Later in 1858, an expedition under Benjamin Herschel Babbage and Major Warburton in the north-west also crossed the non-existent barrier near modern Marree. Eyre's horseshoe lake was actually made up of six large salt lakes; Lake Frome, Lake Callabonna, Lake Blanche, Lake Gregory, Lake Eyre South, and Lake Torrens itself."
Hominin
"Hominini is the tribe of african apes that comprises humans (""Homo""), and all ancestors of ""Homo sapiens"" back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with ""Sahelanthropus"" as a key fossil."
"A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus ""Pan"" (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the ""human"" branch, including genus ""Homo"" and its close relatives, but not ""Pan"". All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species."
Genera.
Subtribe Panina
Subtribe Hominina
Hominina
"Hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates. It is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes, including the genus ""Homo""."
"If an anthropologist wants to includes chimpanzees in the tribe Hominini, then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put Australopithecines and humans in. But this is not a majority view at present, and the mainstream view is:"
"If used, the group includes ""Sahelanthropus"" six to eight million years ago."
Taxonomy.
"Even today, the genus ""Homo"" has not been properly defined."
"Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define ""Homo"" when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of Neanderthals brought the first addition."
"The genus ""Homo"" was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human."
"Over the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times."
"Classifying a fossil as ""Homo"" means evidence of:"
The 1907 Chilean census established it had a population of 8.430 inhabitants.
History.
"The commune was created by decree of 22 December 1891, with the territory of Llico and Iloca subdelegations."
"It was suppressed by the Decree with Force of Law No. 8.583, on 30 December 1927, by dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campo as part of a greater political and administrative reform, adding its territory to the commune of Vichuquén. The commune was effectively suppressed on 1 February 1928."
Commune of Auquinco
"Auquinco was one of the communes that was part of the department of Santa Cruz, in the province of Curicó."
The 1920 Chilean census established it had a population of 2.886 inhabitants.
History.
The commune of Auquinco was created by Decree number 3.458 on 19 August 1918.
"It was suppressed by the Decree with Force of Law No. 8.583, on 30 December 1927, by dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campo as part of a greater political and administrative reform, adding its territory to the commune of Chépica. The commune was effectively suppressed on 1 February 1928."
Tomaso Albinoni
"Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was a Venetian composer. He wrote operas and instrumental music. He is best remembered as the composer of a work called ""Adagio in G Minor"". Albinoni did not actually write the Adagio."
Life.
"Albinoni was born in Venice. He learned to play the violin and to sing. It is not known who his teachers are. His first opera, ""Zenobia, regina de Palmireni"", was performed in Venice in 1694."
"In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi, a soprano singer."
"He became famous and he performed his operas in many Italian cities, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. He also wrote and published instrumental music during this time. Albinoni did not try to find a job in a church or a court. He remained an independent composer and published music on his own."
"He retired from writing music after 1741, and died in Venice in 1751."
Music.
"Most of Albinoni's operas are lost. This is because he did not publish his operas during his life. His instrumental music has survived. Nine collections of instrumental music were published. Because of this, he is better known for writing instrumental music today. He is the first Italian composer to publish an oboe concerto."
"He was known by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues based on themes by Albinoni."
Voiceless alveolar fricative
"The voiceless alveolar fricative is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨s⟩. The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by 's' in ""sun"" and ""sorry""."
List of numbers
"This is a list of numbers. This list will always be not finished. This happens because there are an infinite amount of numbers. Only numbers will be added. Numbers can be added as long as they are popular in math, history or culture."
"This means that numbers can only be if they are a big part of history. A number isn't if it is only related to another number. For example, the number (3,4) is a number when it is a complex number (3+4i). When it is only (3,4), however, it's not notable."
Natural numbers.
Natural numbers are a type of integer. They can be used for counting. Natural numbers can also be used to find out about other number systems. A negative number is not a natural number.
"0 is argued on whether or not it is a natural number. To fix this, people use the terms ""non-negative integers"", which cover 0 and ""positive integers"", which does not."
An IPv6 address can be long and this can lead to mistakes when typing them into the computer or writing them down. There are two ways in which an IPv6 address can be made shorter without leaving anything out:
DNS.
DNS stands for Domain Name System
"It is also called a service server, and is based on client server network architecture. Like a phonebook, it contains a database of public IP addresses."
Other versions.
"Versions before IPv4 were experimental and never widely used. Version 5 was used exclusively for the Internet Stream Protocol, which was also never widely used."
Eurasia
"Eurasia is the combined landmass of Europe and Asia in the northern part of Earth. It has the Atlantic Ocean on its west, and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The Arctic Ocean is to its north, and the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean to its south. It is the largest of the continents. Its name comes from adding the ""Eur"" from ""Europe"" to ""Asia"". It and Africa form a part of the world called ""Afro-Eurasia""."
"Some geographers say Eurasia is one continent, because Europe and Asia are mostly on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them. The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa. To them, the Aegean Sea was the division between the Balkan Peninsula in Europe and Asia Minor in Asia. North of the Sea of Marmara, the Greeks thought the lands on the western side of the Black Sea was Europe and the eastern side was Asia. The ancient Greeks did not know very much about the lands north of the Black Sea. Since Classical Antiquity, people have talked about Asia and Europe separately, so it is now a tradition to see them as two continents."
"Some other continents, which are not completely divided by sea, are joined together by a thin strip of land (called an isthmus). An example is North America and South America, which are connected by the Isthmus of Panama. Europe and Asia are not divided by a sea, nor by any isthmus."
"Outside of geological definitions, Eurasia also includes the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula."
"Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. Here, the dividing line is the Ural Mountains. West Eurasia includes Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia, because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is as difficult to cross as a sea. Also, North Africa is culturally linked to Europe by the Mediterranean Sea."
List of countries.
The OECD’s Eurasia activities involve 13 countries extending from the borders of the European Union to the Far East:
North Pole
The North Pole is the point that is farthest north on Earth. It is the point on which axis of Earth turns. It is in the Arctic Ocean and it is cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high. The ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice.
There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the physical North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole.
There is a star called the North Star (or Polaris) that is always in the sky above the North Pole. People can tell how far north they are by seeing how high the North Star appears in the sky.
Plural
"In linguistics, noun phrases have grammatical number. Plural is one kind of grammatical number. In English, plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., ""32 degrees, no bananas"", ""0.5 liters"", ""1.2 grams"", ""two times"", ""three fish"", ""20 mothers""). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., ""one time"", ""a glass"", ""the sun"", ""my mother"", ""Jennifer""). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., ""water"", ""the meat"", ""some space"", etc.)."
"In many languages, a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In English, the normal plural suffix ""i""s ""-s"" (e.g., ""cat"" is singular, and ""cats"" is plural)."
Plurals in English.
There are a number of exceptions:
"It is fair to say that most native English-speakers make mistakes in this area, which is one of the more troublesome aspects of English."
Other languages.
All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each language is different from the one that is applied to English nouns.
"In other languages, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, there is usually no plural ending."
Alexander Gode
Personal life.
"Married three times, his last wife was a former fan, who met him when she made a documentary about his life and career. One of his later supporters was radio talk show host Howard Stern. Tiny Tim died in 1996, after suffering a heart attack during a performance."
Kelvin
"The Kelvin scale (symbol: K) is the SI unit of temperature. It is named in honour of the physicist William Thomson, the first Lord Kelvin (1824–1907)."
0 degree Celsius = 273 kelvin
Definition.
"The Kelvin scale is defined by a specific relationship between the pressure of a gas and the temperature. This says that ""the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin"". This means that Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, and scientists use this scale more than any other."
"The kelvin is a base SI unit of measurement, since 2018 defined by setting the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant ""k"" to 1.380649×10−23 J⋅K−1."
"The temperature of the triple point of water is a hundredth of a degree Celsius above the freezing point, or 0.01 °C. The coldest possible temperature is called absolute zero and is equal to -273.15 degrees Celsius, or zero kelvin (0 K). By writing temperatures in kelvins one does not need to use negative numbers."
The absolute temperature scale was designed so that a change in temperature of 1 kelvin is equal to a change of 1 degree Celsius. This means that it is easy to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin.
"It is important to notice that the name of this unit is simply ""kelvin"" (with a lowercase initial), not ""degree Kelvin"". In English, it undergoes normal plural inflection as ""kelvins"". For example, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen is 77 kelvins."
"In everyday use, the kelvin is most commonly used to measure very low or very high temperatures, such as the temperature of liquid nitrogen or the temperature of a light bulb filament."
Tourism
"Tourism means people traveling for fun and adventure . It includes activities such as sightseeing and camping. People who travel for fun are called ""tourists"". Places where many tourists stay are sometimes called ""resorts"". Places that people go to for tourism are called tourist destinations."
There are many reasons why people travel for fun:
The tourism industry.
The tourism industry has different parts. Some of these are:
Package tour operators can offer all these services to a group who will go together. This can be cheaper than paying for them separately.
Damage tourism can bring.
"Tourism can bring damage to the local area, and/or the tourists. Litter, scuba-diving and deforestation are problems for popular places such as St. Lucia, Hawaii and others. Scuba-diving can damage coral reefs which are home to hundreds of species of sea animals. Tourism can change culture when people learn each other's ways, and certain local traditions are being put aside for tourists."
Berkshire
"Berkshire is a county in southeast England. It is west of London. Its county town is Reading. In the past, a town named Abingdon was the county town, but this town is not in Berkshire any more."
Berkshire is also known as the Royal County of Berkshire.
"Cities, towns and villages."
"The towns below are not part of Berkshire now, but were in the past."
Buckinghamshire
"Buckinghamshire (abbreviated Bucks) is a county in central England, near the south and London. The county town is named Aylesbury."
"Cities, towns and villages."
In commerce.
"Ima Keithel () is the world's only women run market. It has 3 major complexes. Leimarel Sidabi Ima Keithel is the Complex Number 1 of the market. It is followed by Imoinu Ima Keithel (Complex Number 2) and Phouoibi Ima Keithel (Complex Number 3). This 500 year old market is in the center of Imphal, Manipur."
In geography.
"The ""Leimarel Hill"" is a hill in Manipur. Trekkers go here for panaromic viewing of 360 degree of Loktak Lake."

Irai Leima
Irai Leima () or Ireima () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess and the divine female personification of water and aquatic life. She is also considered to be the incharge of the diseases.
"She is the consort of Irai Ningthou (literally, ""king of water""). Both are regarded as the divine spirits of water bodies."
Mythology.
"Irai Leima is the daughter of King Heibok Ningthou and the princess of Heibok Ching. Her father was an expert in witchcraft and black magic. Irai Leima is known for her exceptional beauty. One day, she was fishing in the Liwa river. King Kwakpa (Kokpa) of Khuman dynasty saw her and fell in love with her. He proposed her. She replied that her parents' wish will be her wish. So, King Kwakpa consulted his subjects. They presented Heibok Ningthou many presents. King Kwakpa planned to marry Irai Leima if her father agreed or to bring her by force if her father rejected. Seeing the arrogance of Kwakpa, Heibok Ningthou turned all the gifts into stone. At this, followers of Kwakpa fled the place. Kwakpa returned home disappointed."
"One day, King Kwakpa got intoxicated after drinking a juice of the roots of Tera plant (""Bambax malabaricum""). He wanted to meet Irai Leima. So, he went to her place riding on a Hiyang boat. Seeing his approach, she fled to Pakhra Ching mountain. Kwakpa chased her. Seeing all these, Heibok Ningthou turned the Hiyang boat into stone and the oar into a tree. Getting angry, Kwakpa ran towards Heibok Ningthou to kill him. Then, Heibok Ningthou turned Khuman Kwakpa into a stone. Irai Leima saw all this and was afraid of her father. She left her father and ran away. She passed the Pakhra Ching, crossed the Liwa river and entered the house of Sarangthem Luwangba. She hid herself inside the granary of the house. When Sarangthem Luwangba and his good lady Thoidingjam Chanu Amurei left the house for field, Irai Leima came out from her hiding place. In the meantime, she completed all the household chores. When the couple returned home, she hid herself again. The couple got surprised at this but it happened everyday. So, one day, the man returned home earlier than usual. He found out the truth. But when he came near Irai Leima, she had disappeared below the granary. He looked under the granary but he saw nothing. He was amazed at this. So, he discussed the issue with all his clan members. They searched everywhere but didn't find her anymore."
"Irai Leima appeared in the dream of Sarangthem Luwangba and told him that she was merged into his clan and became his daughter. The matter was reported to King Senbi Kiyaamba of Ningthouja dynasty. The king sent maibas and maibis to examine the case. The examiners said that the mysterious lady was a goddess and she should be worshipped. King Kiyaamba also told Luwangba to do so. From that year onwards, Irai Leima was worshipped as a goddess."
"The day on which Luwangba first saw Irai Leima was the first Monday of the Meitei lunar month of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". And the day on which the maibas and maibis came was the first Tuesday of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". Still today, from the time of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD), the Sarangthem family members annually hold a grand feast (""Chaklen Katpa"") in honor of the goddess. Later, Irai Leima came to be known as Hiyangthang Lairembi."
Worship.
"When a person gets ill after bathing in a spring, pool, stream, people believed that the water spirits (Irai Leima and Irai Ningthou) had caught the person. To get well again, people worship the two deities. For this, the maibas perform the rites and rituals. The offerings include 2 eggs and 7 bamboo vessels filled up with rice paste."
"The also highly respect the deities. They offer many wild sacrifices. The sacrifices maybe a white fowl, a pig, a dog or a he-goat."
Identification with other deities.
"Irai Leima (""Ireima"") is considered as one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimaren), the supreme mother earth goddess. She is also described as a form of goddess Imoinu."
"Irai Leima is also known as Hiyangthang Lairembi. During the reign of King Garib Niwaj (alias ""Pamheiba""), goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi was converted to Hindu goddess Kamakhya (a form of Durga). The 3rd day of Durga Puja is observed as the ""Bor Numit"" (literally, Boon Day)."
Panthoibi
"Panthoibi () or Panthoipi () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess of civilization, courage, fertility, handicraft, love, victory, warfare and wisdom. She is married to Nongpok Ningthou."
"According to Col. John Shakespear, Panthoibi is the most well known goddess of her religion."
Panthoibi is frequently associated with Leimarel Sidabi. She is regarded as one of the representations of Leimarel.
"The personality of Panthoibi and other goddesses like Emoinu and Phouoibi depict as well as influence the , courage, independence, and social honour of Meitei women."
Etymology.
"The Meitei term ""Panthoibi"" (ꯄꯥꯟꯊꯣꯢꯕꯤ or ꯄꯥꯟꯊꯣꯏꯕꯤ) is made up of three words, ""Pan"" (ꯄꯥꯟ), ""Thoi"" (ꯊꯣꯢ or ꯊꯣꯏ) and ""Bi"" (ꯕꯤ)."
"In Meitei language, ""Pan"" (ꯄꯥꯟ) means ""to rule over something like country, kingdom, land, nation or state""."
"In Meitei language, ""Thoi"" (ꯊꯣꯢ or ꯊꯣꯏ) means ""to "", or ""to "", or ""to "", or ""to "", or ""to ""."
"Each of these acronyms means roughly the same thing. In each, the learners already have another native or ""mother"" language, and they want to learn English as well."
History.
"The teaching of English as a second language has a long history. For example, the official introduction of English into India's education system began in 1835."
Use.
"English as a second language is the single most popular subject in the world, after mathematics. English is a very important language in business. Many people study English as a foreign language, because they want a better job. English is also very important in education. Many pages on the internet are in English."
"Many people who can not go to English language classes study on the internet, using websites like BBC Learning English."
"Many people study English in a country where the people speak English. This way, many students learn to listen and speak English better."
Testing.
There are many English exams. These English exams are important for learners. They may show how well a person can use English. It is very difficult to compare different English exams. Every exam is a little different. Read Testing English as a foreign language for more information.
Global Scale of English.
"Global Scale of English (GSE) is a test for learners of English as a second or foreign language. The GSE is a list of can-do statements based on the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for English. Learners' abilities are rated on a 10-to-90 point scale for each of the four basic skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). A learner reaches a level on the scale when she or he can correctly perform 50% of the can-do tasks at that level. The education company Pearson PLC developed the scale."
Teaching.
Teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) is referred to the practice of teaching the English language to the students with different first languages. It is taught in the state school system or privately with a language school or with a tutor. TEFL can also take place in an English-speaking country for people who have immigrated there.
"TEFL teachers may be native or non-native speakers of English. Other forms of TEFL are TESL (""Teaching English as a second language""), TESOL (""Teaching English to speakers of other languages""), and ESL (""English as a second language"")."
"Additional types of TEFL certification include: CTBE (Certificate in Teaching Business English), CTYL (Certificate in Teaching Young Learners), CTO (Certificate in Teaching Online)."
Switzerland
"Switzerland (; ; ; ; Swiss German: ""Schwiz"") is a comparatively small country in Western Europe. The official name of Switzerland is ""Confoederatio Helvetica"". This is Latin and is not often used except for official state documents. Switzerland is a confederation of even smaller states, which are the 26 cantons."
"Switzerland is known for its neutrality. A country is neutral when it does not take sides among the countries who are at war. Switzerland has been neutral since 1815. Many international organizations are in Switzerland. The United Nations has a main office (but not its headquarters) in Geneva. Its predecessor organization, the League of Nations, was headquartered in Geneva. It is no longer neutral since February 28, 2022."
"There are four official languages in Switzerland: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. Some cantons and even towns have two languages spoken in them, and the largest canton by area, Graubünden, has three.

"Quorn, South Australia"
"Quorn is a small town in the Flinders Ranges in the north of South Australia, 39 km northeast of Port Augusta. In 2011 there were 1206 people living in Quorn. Quorn is the home of the Flinders Ranges Council local government area. It is in the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey."
It is also the home of the Pichi Richi Railway.
History.
"The town was surveyed in 1878 and named after Quorndon in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. It was a railway town, part of the railway line being built from Port Augusta. The railway line from Port Augusta to Quorn opened in 1879. It reached Government Gums (Farina) in 1882, Marree in 1884, Oodnadatta in 1890 and Alice Springs in 1929. This railway line later became known as the ""Ghan line"" or Central Australia Railway."
"In 1917, Quorn became the crossroads of the north–south Central Australian Railway and east–west Trans-Australian Railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. This made Quorn an important town, as everyone travelling east–west or north–south in Australia passed through Quorn. As a result, many fine buildings were built as the town expanded."
"Quorn's role as a crossroads was lost in 1937 when a standard gauge railway connection was opened between Port Pirie and Port Augusta. However, during World War II, Quorn was a vital service point for trains heading north to Alice Springs. Over one million soldiers passed through on their way to Darwin and on to Papua New Guinea. There were over 50 trains eaxh day during and immediately after World War II. The trains also carried coal mined at Leigh Creek to the new Playford A Power Station in Port Augusta."
"During the 1950s a new standard gauge line was built which did not pass through Quorn. It was built on the western side of The Dutchmans Stern, Mount Arden and Mount Eyre. This line went from Stirling North to Brachina and then followed the original narrow gauge route through Leigh Creek and to Marree. Trains no longer went through the Pichi Richi Pass or Quorn. The only services now operating through Quorn was freight from Peterborough and Hawker. As a result Quorn lost its important railway business and in the 1980s the railway was completely closed as freight was moved to road transport. One unusual aspect of the railway working from Peterborough to Quorn and then on to Hawker was the need for the engine to be turned and joined to the opposite end of the train when arriving at Quorn, as it was not a ""through"" station for the trip from Peterborough to Hawker."
"In 1973 the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society was formed to keep and protect the unique bridges and stone work that formed the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass between Quorn and Stirling North. At first they only wanted to preserve the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass, but they later got railway carriages and locomotives to provide a tourist service through from Quorn to Port Augusta. TheThey have written a book showing the railway in its heyday."
Tourism.
"A main attraction in Quorn is the Pichi Richi Railway. There are also a self-guided walking tours in the town, included several based around the town's historic old buildings, the railway yards and other historic locations. The Flinders Ranges Visitor Information Centre / Pichi Richi Railway in the Quorn railway station provide visitor information, bookings for the railway, accommodation, tours and souvenirs."
Boysenberry.
"Rudolph Boysen experimented with various berry crosses in Napa, California in the 1920s. In 1923, his hybrid successfully grew and bore fruit. However, unable to make his new berry a commercial success, Boysen abandoned his crop after breaking his back in an accident."
"Years later, after he had moved to Orange County, a fellow grower named Walter Knott heard about the berry and tracked down Boysen. Walter Knott was able to bring a few dying vines back to life at his farm, now known as Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California. Knott named the fruit after Boysen."
Spyro (character)
"Spyro the Dragon is a video game character from the video game series with the same name, where he is the main hero. He is a purple dragon who goes on missions to help protect his home world which is the Dragon Realms. He is usually followed by a yellow dragonfly named Sparx and in the earlier games Sparx would be Spyro's health bar. His main attack in the games are ramming enemies with his horns. He also has 5 breath abilities: fire, water, bubbles, electricity and ice."
Concentrate
"A concentrate is a special form of a substance, where one of the base components is mostly removed. The most common case is the removal of the solvent from a solution: Fruit juice concentrate will have most of the water removed. The benefit of this is that the concentrate takes up less volume, and weighs less than the original solution. This can save transportation costs. When needed, the solvent can simply be added again."
Biophilia
Biophilia is the musical project and seventh studio album from Icelandic singer Björk. The album was released in 2011.

John Singer Sargent
"John Singer Sargent (January 12, 1856 – April 14, 1925) was an American artist. He was the leading portrait painter of his day."
"During his career, he created about 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as many sketches and charcoal drawings. He travelled worldwide. His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris, and then moved to London."
"His ""Portrait of Madame X"" resulted in scandal, though today it is hard to see why. She was thought to be somewhat loose sexually. In the original portrait as exhibited, one strap of her gown had fallen down her right shoulder. This suggested to some the possibility of further revelation; ""One more struggle"", wrote a critic in ""Le Figaro"", ""and the lady will be free""."
"Sargent visited Spain, studied Velázquez, and was entranced with Spanish music and dance. He understood what the Impressionists were doing, and adopted their habit of painting ""en plein-air"". He was a big fan of Monet, and bought four of his works. His portrait of Monet shows he understood what was going on in French art at the time."
"Sergent kept his American citizenship, and went back there four times. However, he remained living in London to the end of his life."

Research labs.
Research at the school relate to the following topics:
Two-body problem
"The two-body problem is a problem from classical mechanics: there are two bodies which influence each other. Very often they attract or repel each other. In many cases they rotate. The problem uses bodies which are circles, or spheres. Solving the problem is possible for many situations, but it usually involves higher level mathematics."
Simplification: One body has a mass that is much smaller.
"When one of the two bodies has a mass that is much smaller, the influence of this smaller body on the larger one is very small, and can be disregarded. In such a case, the problem can be reformulated as a one-centre problem, where there is a stationary big body in the centre, and a small body orbiting around the big one. This setting is very comon. Johannes Kepler was the first person to formulate and solve it. For this reason, it is also known as Kepler problem."
General solution for the two-body problem.
History.
"Brooklyn is named after a Dutch town called ""Breukelen"". Dutch people were the first people from Europe to live in the area. When they got there, there were already some Native American people living there called the Lenape. The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of New Netherland."
"During the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there voted to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one culture or ethnicity. Other parts are mixed."
"The Brooklyn Bridge is old and famous. It goes over the East River and connects Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. The longest bridge in New York, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island."
Cornish language
Cornish (Cornish: Kernewek) is a very old language from Cornwall in the southwest of England. Cornish is a Celtic language and is very similar to Welsh and is related to Gaelic.
History.
"A long time ago, Cornish was the only language spoken in Cornwall, but more and more people began to speak English, instead of Cornish. In 1550, when the prayer book was written in English instead of Latin, the Cornish people got angry and there was a rebellion. Because many Cornish-speakers died and they would now hear the Bible in English, Cornish was used less and less."
"By 1800, only a few people could speak Cornish, and since no one spoke it to one another any more, Cornish became endangered."
"People say that a woman called Dolly Pentreath was the last person who could speak Cornish. That is not quite true, but she was one of the last people to use it instead of English."
Methods of spreading.
"Some people learned about Cornish by traveling around talking to people who could still speak it and by reading old plays and books. Some people wanted to learn the language and speak it and so in 1904 a learned man, Henry Jenner, wrote a book to help people. Some people then began to learn the language and speak it again."
Today.
"No one knows how many Cornish-speakers there are now. People think that about 8,000 to 13,000 people probably speak Cornish. Some young people have grown up speaking it. Most people in Cornwall know a few sentences or words in Cornish. In 100 years, Cornish has grown from almost no speakers to many thousands, which is very exciting for many people."
"There are now many new books, films and songs in Cornish. The Bible has now been translated into Cornish. There is an event, the open Gorseth, with a story and poetry competition. Sometimes, Cornish is used in churches."
"There used to be a problem with Cornish: three different dictionaries had different spellings, and people did not agree about how to write words or say them. That was confusing for people when they have not been speaking for long. In 2008, people who used different types of Cornish came together and agreed on a new standard form of Cornish to be used everywhere."

Watergate scandal
The Watergate scandal was a serious scandal during and after the 1972 presidential election.
"A United States President and Republican, Richard Nixon was running for election against Democrat George McGovern. Afterwards, Frank Wills, a security guard, discovered clues that former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the Democratic Party and George McGovern months before the election. They secretly listened to phone lines and stole several important documents."
"When these men were found, they were discovered to have been associated with Nixon. He had helped them cover all the evidence of the scandal, and may have even hired the men to begin with. ""The Washington Post"" was a newspaper which played a big role in exposing the misdoings, specifically aided by reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. This showed the public that Nixon was not as trustworthy as he seemed."
"Nixon chose to resign from office on August 9, 1974 because he wished not to be impeached. This means that he might have been charged with crimes. The U.S. Congress could not impeach him if he resigned. After this, Gerald Ford, his vice-president, became the President by default. Ford pardoned Nixon for all of his crimes later on. The name ""Watergate"" comes from the hotel in Washington, D.C. where the first crime and break in took place, and is often associated with political scandals."

"Presidents' Day, originally was two separate observances, Abraham Lincoln's birthday, which was February 12, and George Washington's birthday, which was February 22. The two observances were combined in 1971 into a single observance which is held on the third Monday in February."
Memorial Day
"Memorial Day is a national holiday in the United States. It is also a state holiday in many states. The holiday honors troops who have died in past wars like World War I and the Korean War. It was founded by U.S. Army General John A. Logan, who fought in the Civil War and the Mexican–American War."
"Memorial Day was first held in 1865 after the American Civil War. It was called Decoration Day at that time. The holiday was first called Memorial Day in 1882, and became a federal holiday in 1967. On June 28, 1968, the United States Congress made a law that said that the official Memorial Day holiday is May 30, but that Memorial Day was to be observed by federal employees as a paid holiday on the last Monday in May."
Memorial Day is thought of by many Americans as being the start of summer.
Columbus Day
Columbus Day is a holiday celebrating the day Columbus landed on San Salvador. It is celebrated in many countries. This holiday is very controversial because of the way Columbus treated the Native Americans at the time.
Veterans Day
"Veterans Day is the American holiday when people who had served in the military during war-time are remembered and thanked. It is both a federal and a state holiday. The holiday is celebrated on the same day as Armistice Day or Remembrance Day in other countries. These holidays are all November 11. This is the day seen as the end of World War I. The first World War ended on November 11, 1918."
"The holiday was first created as Armistice Day in 1919 by President Woodrow Wilson. Thirty states made it a state holiday that year. It was made a holiday for the entire country in 1938. In June 1, 1954, the name was changed to Veterans Day."
Ralph Vaughan Williams
"Ralph Vaughan Williams (b. Down Ampney, Gloucestershire, 12 October 1872; d. London, 26 August 1958) was the most important English composer of his generation."
Vaughan Williams always pronounced his first name “Rafe” - (“Vaughan” rhymes with “born”). His father was a rector. Ralph was very young when his father died. The family moved to Dorking near London. He went to Charterhouse School and played the viola in the school orchestra. He studied at the University of Cambridge and at the Royal College of Music where Hubert Parry was his teacher.
Early career.
"Vaughan Williams wanted to be a good composer, so he went abroad to study with famous composers like Max Bruch in Berlin and Maurice Ravel in Paris. Yet he knew that he must not simply imitate these composers, so he also studied English folk song. He became good friends with the composer Gustav Holst. The two men always showed one another the music they were writing so that they could help one another by offering criticism."
"In 1910 he wrote a work which became one of his best-known pieces of music: the ""Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis"". The piece is for a string orchestra divided into two sections. It uses a theme by the famous 16th century composer Tallis. He also wrote hymn tunes for the English Hymnal. One of his most popular hymn tunes is the one called ""Sine Nomine"" sung to the words “For all the saints”. Another lovely work is ""The Lark Ascending"". This is a short work for solo violin and orchestra. The violin sounds like a skylark singing in the sky. In 1934 he wrote a short piece for flute, harp and string orchestra called ""Fantasia on Greensleeves"" which is based on the famous English Renaissance tune ""Greensleeves""."
Later works.
"During his long life Vaughan Williams wrote nine symphonies, works for the stage, songs, choral music and chamber music. In 1938 he wrote a famous piece called ""Serenade to Music"" for 16 solo singers and orchestra. It was one of several works he wrote inspired by Shakespeare. The words were from the play ""The Merchant of Venice"". It was written for the 50th anniversary of Sir Henry Wood’s career as a conductor. In 1953 he wrote music for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, including a very short and simple motet ""O taste and see"" which has remained very popular with church choirs."
In his old age he became quite deaf. This was because of the noise of gunfire he had been exposed to when he was serving as a stretcher bearer in World War I.
"Port Lincoln, South Australia"
Port Lincoln is a city in South Australia. It is a coastal city on Boston Bay at the southern end of the Eyre Peninsula. It is the largest city in the region. It is about 280 kilometres (straight line – 646 km by road) from the capital city Adelaide.
History.
"The first people to live in the area were the Barngarla (Parnkalla) people, who are Indigenous Australian people. The name they used to call this area was Galinyala."
European people settled in the area in 1836.
"British Royal Navy explorer Matthew Flinders discovered the harbour in February 1802. He named it ""Port"" Lincoln rather than just Lincoln, where Flinders came from."
Fresh water.
"Port Lincoln may have become the state capital of the future South Australia, but it did not have a good water supply.. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln could not get enough fresh water, which is now supplied mostly from the underground aquifers to the south of the city. Recently the water supply on the Eyre Peninsula has been connected to Murray River water through a link from Kimba to Whyalla to connect into the Morgan to Whyalla pipeline water."
Demographics.
"About 14,245 people live in the Port Lincoln area as of 2006. Aboriginal people made up 5.4% of Port Lincoln's 2006 population."
Geography.
"Port Lincoln has different coastal areas, from sheltered waters and beaches, to surf beaches and rugged oceanic coastline."
Government.
Port Lincoln and its suburbs comprise the City of Port Lincoln local government area. Port Lincoln is in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.
Economy.
"The economy is based on loading wheat onto ships. The port can handle over 337,500 tonnes) of wheat. There is also the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. The port is home to a large commercial fishing fleet. There is also fish farming (aquaculture) of the following species: tuna, kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimental farming in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the introduction of fish farming, the main fishing was for Southern bluefin tuna."
"Port Lincoln is the end of an isolated narrow gauge railway system to bring the wheat to port. Iron ore traffic may be added in the future, although this has been the topic of protest and debate in the community."
Tourism.
"Tourism is becoming more important, thanks to the scenic beauty and coastal locality. Easy access to both Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight make Port Lincoln a good place for yachting, scuba diving, shark cage diving and game fishing. The city also is the regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula. However, many State Government functions are gradually being closed as State Government becomes more centralised in Adelaide. During the past decade, there has been a big increase in building houses and commercial buildings."
"Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park and Kellidie Bay Conservation Park are within easy driving distance."
Transport.
Port Lincoln is the port for the isolated narrow gauge () Eyre Peninsular Railway.
There is also a smaller port at Proper Bay which may be restored to use for iron ore traffic. The export of iron ore through Port Lincoln has been approved by the South Australian Government. (c. Oct 2009)
Port Lincoln Airport is located a few kilometers north of the city. Regional Express and Qantaslink provide several daily flights to the state capital of Adelaide.
Culture.
"The book ""Blue Fin"" by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln. The movie of the same name was filmed in nearby Streaky Bay. Some of the shark scenes of ""Jaws"" and Anzac Cove scenes in ""Gallipoli"", were also filmed near Port Lincoln."
"""Australian Survivor"", the Australian-produced series of the US television series, ""Survivor"", was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001."
"""Hearts Apart"" by Caitlin Jones was written on a farm in Port Lincoln."
"Port Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the four-masted barque ""Moshulu"", which anchored off Boston Island. ""Moshulu"" had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer). But there was no grain to be had there, even though ""Moshulu"" waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. ""Moshulu"" finally sailed to Port Victoria for cargo."
"During the 1939 season, ""Passat"" and ""Lawhill"" also went to Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book ""The Last Grain Race"" (1956). Several pictures of Port Lincoln in 1939 are in his photo-essay of his voyage, ""Learning the Ropes""."

Italophilia
"Italophilia is the admiration, general appreciation or love of Italy, its culture, society, arts and people. It is often related to the emulation of Italy's ideals and civilization."

"""Italophilia"", ""Italophile"", and ""Italophilic"" are the terms used to denote pro-Italian sentiments, usually in politics and literature."
A huge italophilia started to develop in Europe during the centuries of the Italian Renaissance.
Actually one of the main reasons of Italophilia in the world is that Italy is home to more World Heritage Sites than any other nation in the world. These sites are culturally important and value according to UNESCO. Indeed about 60% of the works of art of the world are in Italy.
"Another reason is the worlwide appreciation for Italian culinary and foods. Italy is also a big wine producer. In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes, and many italian wines are very famous in the world, like the ""Chianti""."
"Indeed in the American countries with a huge Italian emigration in the last centuries, there it is a widespread italophilia: Argentina, Brasil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Canada and the USA have millions of Italian descendants who promote in their society the love and appreciation for Italy."
"Actually Giorgio Silvestri (director of the ""Assemblea legislativa della Liguria"") has calculated that there are nearly 250 million italophiles in the world."
DeWitt Clinton
"DeWitt Clinton (March 2, 1769 – February 11, 1828) was an early American politician and statesman. He graduated in law from Columbia University in 1790. From 1790 to 1795 he served as private secretary to his uncle, George Clinton."

Measles
"Measles is an infectious disease, caused by a virus. People catch measles from other people. It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe. People with measles have a sore throat, a fever, a cough, red eyes and a runny nose. They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body. These rashes will cause a high irritation of itching."
"Measles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch. If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it. In developed countries, lots of children have a vaccination (injection) to stop them from getting measles. Often they are given the MMR vaccine, to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella. The three vaccinations are all in one injection."
"Measles is sometimes also called ""rubeola"", but it is not the same as rubella (German measles). The German Measles (rubella) was discovered by German scientists."
"There is no specific cure for measles. People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away. Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it. In the 19th century measles epidemics killed many Polynesian people."

It covers and area of , and is the world's largest weapons test facility on land. The range is a restricted area, called the Woomera Prohibited Area. The airspace above it is also restricted, and is called the Woomera Restricted Airspace."
"The range was originally set up as a place for the British to test missiles during World War II. The British asked to do weapons testing here (in the centre of Australia), because not many people lived there. A Commonwealth weapons design and test project, called the Australian-Anglo Joint Project, was signed in 1946. The range originally had an area of ."
"Between 1955 and 1963, the British ran a series of seven nuclear-weapon tests at Maralinga, then inside the range. The Joint Project ran until 1980, when the British withdrew from the program. The range is still used as a testing site by the Australian Defence Force. Access is leased to foreign militaries and private companies for their own testing of weapons."

Voice of America
"The Voice of America (VOA) is the official broadcasting service of the United States government. It is one of the best-known stations in international broadcasting. Along with English, VOA broadcasts in many other languages. VOA's broadcasts are made to share a positive view of the United States with the world. Americans in the United States are not part of VOA's intended audience, but many Americans do listen to the program."
History.
"VOA was organized in 1942 under the Office of War Information with news programs aimed at Europe and North Africa occupied by Germany. VOA began broadcasting on February 24, 1942, but VOA noted in its site that it began broadcasting on February 1, 1942. Transmitters used by VOA came from shortwave transmitters used by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Voice of America began to transmit radio broadcasts into the Soviet Union on February 17, 1947."
"During the Cold War, VOA's budget was reduced. On August 1, 1953, VOA was separated from the Department of State and it was included under the Information Agency. VOA moved its headquarters from New York to Washington, DC. next year. In 1959 VOA started ""Special English"" programs. In the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Marti and TV Marti."
"One of VOA's famous programs was remembered as ""Jazz Hour"" presented by Willis Conover. This program continued for 40 years, and its record remains at the National Museum of American History, also known as """"Smithsonian""."

George Gershwin
"George Gershwin (September 26, 1898; Brooklyn, New York – July 11, 1937; Hollywood, California) was an American composer and a pianist."
Story of his life.
Childhood.
"George Gershwin was born on September 26, 1898, in Brooklyn, New York."
"His family immigrated to the United States. Gershwin, his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city, but he did not like school or studying."
"While exploring the city, Gershwin heard jazz and blues music spilling out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. Gershwin began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized Gershwin's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: ""I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt."""
Younger days as a student.
"Gershwin studied classical piano, and he was a first-rate pianist,but his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. He loved playing piano and it was his passion. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business. The New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called ""Tin Pan Alley."""
"The phonograph and radio had been invented in the late 1800s. But it would be many years before there were musical recordings or regular radio broadcasts. Tin Pan Alley publishers needed another way to sell new songs, so they employed people to play the piano to do this."
"The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only 18 years old. It had a long title: ""When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get ‘Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em. """
Success as a songwriter.
"Gershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. ""There is plenty more where that came from,"" he said."
"Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called ""Swanee."" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. ""Swanee"" was made into one of the first musical recordings. Gershwin was suddenly famous. He also was in the Grammy Hall of Fame."
"Music critics note that ""Swanee"" is not like most of Gershwin's music. Later, he wrote true love songs. Some were light and funny. Some were full of intense feeling. Many of these songs were written for the popular musical theater. One of his most emotional love songs never became part of a musical play, however. It is called ""The Man I love."" The song was sung by the Francine Evans role [played by Liza Minnelli in Martin Scorsese's film, New York, New York] and supposedly 'written' by her character for her soon to be husband, Jimmy Doyle [superbly played by Robert De Niro], of the Jimmy Doyle Orchestra. His character also 'wrote' the title song, New York, New York, who was actually written by Fred Ebb, music by Kanter, his partner. The song became New York's official anthem in 1985."
His brother Ira.
"Gershwin's older brother, Ira, wrote the words to ""The Man I Love"". As George became famous, Ira wrote the words to more and more of his songs."
"The two brothers were very different. Ira, the writer, was quiet and serious. George, the musician, was outgoing—the life of any party. When they had to finish a new musical Ira locked George in a hotel room until it was done. But George wrote better songs with Ira than with anyone else."
Music of Gershwin.
As a songwriter.
"One of many examples of the Gershwin's combined work is the song ""They Can't Take That Away From Me."" The Gershwins wrote the song for dancer and actor Fred Astaire for the film ""Shall We Dance."" That was George and Ira Gershwin's first movie musical."

The two ""Peanuts"" specials ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown"", which he directed, were each honored with a Peabody Award."
Equation of state
"In physics, chemistry and thermodynamics, equations of state are used to describe the state a dynamical system is in. . Equations of state are commonly used to describe the state of gases and fluids. In the real world, equations of state are approximations. They can be quite complex to write down, and usually, they are solved using numerical methods."
Variables.
"There are certain variables such as pressure, volume, or temperature, that can be used to describe such a system. So in its simplest form, an equation of state is a function, that takes these dependent variables as input, the state can then be as simple as saying that in its current state, the function has the numerical value zero:"
formula_1
"where p ist the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature."
Ideal gas.
"The simplest of these describes an ideal gas, it is the ideal gas law. This law can also be used to describe the state of real gases, in certain conditions (such as with a low pressure, and high temperature)."
Osterwald
"Osterwald is a community and part of the Joint Community (""Samtgemeinde"") of Neuenhaus in the County of Bentheim in Lower Saxony. The community has the centres of Osterwald, Alte Piccardie and Hohenkörben (Veldhausen parish)."

Urðarbrunnr
"Urðarbrunnr (Old Norse for the ""Well of Urðr"") is a well in Norse mythology. It is situated under the Yggdrasil or the world tree. Norse mythology is a version of the older northern Germanic mythology. The gods would travel via the bifrost with the exception of Thor as it was thought that he would break the bridge which took the form of a rainbow, to Urðarbrunnr. Here they would meet and decide things, presumably laws of nature and magic and love and war."
Mario Party 5
"Mario Party 5 is a party board video game for the Nintendo GameCube console. It is the fifth game in the ""Mario Party"" series. It was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. It was released on November 10, 2003 in North America, on November 28, 2003 in Japan, and on December 5, 2003 in Europe."
Gameplay.
"""Mario Party 5"" plays the same as the first four ""Mario Party"" games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Boards have different types of spaces, including blue spaces which add coins, red spaces which take away coins, and Bowser Spaces which causes Bowser to appear and do a bad event. The game introduces the DK Space, where Donkey Kong appears to cause an event to happen. Unlike Bowser events, these events are always good. Also new to the game is the Capsule system, which replaces the item system from past games. Capsules are containers that hold a single item. Players can get capsules by passing by the ""Capsule Machine"" on the board. Each capsule does something different, including increasing the number of dice blocks a player can roll, and taking away coins from an opponent. Capsules can be thrown up to ten spaces away."
"Ten characters are playable. New to the series as a playable character are Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Because of the addition of the DK Space, Donkey Kong is no longer a playable character."
"In addition to the main party game, players can also play a mode called Super Duel Mode. In Super Duel Mode, players build a battle vehicle to use in tournaments or fight against friends. Players are able to change their vehicle by using different parts. Parts can be bought with the points from mini-games."

Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Adopted on March 30, 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment (Amendment XV) to the United States Constitution granted African-American men the right to vote. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments."
Background.
Nowhere in the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights were Americans given the right to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment gave African-American men the right to vote. But not until the 1960s did judicial interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment conclude the right to vote was a fundamental right of all citizens.
The reasons behind the omissions of voting rights in the Bill of Rights and Constitution is that including them would have been too controversial at the time. Each state had different rules for who could vote. Some allowed free blacks the right to vote. Others allowed women the right to vote. A few states required ownership of property in order to vote.
"In the Election of 1868, Republican Party candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, won the presidency by only a narrow majority of the popular vote. He received support from free black voters in the South. Without that support, he probably would have lost the election. At the time blacks could not vote in the Northern states. The Republican party needed help to stay in power and thought that black votes would help. At the time Republicans controlled both the Senate and House. The proposed amendment was passed by Congress in 1869 and sent to the states for ratification. It was quickly ratified by three-quarters of the states in early 1870. Part of the reason why is that Republicans also controlled the state governments in the South. Southern Democrats were not able to block the measure."
Results.
"After passage, the Fifteenth Amendment did not have much of any impact on black voting in the South for nearly a century. Southerners used various methods including terrorism, poll taxes and grandfather clauses to prevent blacks from voting. Congress and the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down voting restrictions. For example, in a landmark decision in ""Smith v. Allwright"" (1944), The Court decision made it unconstitutional to keep African-Americans from voting in a Democratic Party primary in Texas. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which stated that all Americans had the right to vote, including African-Americans. But overcoming these problems on a case-by-case basis was proving to be unsuccessful. As soon as one form of discrimination was stopped, a new one appeared in its place. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, removed further barriers to minorities voting. It was amended five times by Congress to extend its protections as needed."
Solar eclipses on Mars
"The two moons of Mars—Phobos and Deimos—are much smaller than the Moon, greatly reducing solar eclipses on that planet."
Eclipses.
Phobos.
"Phobos is only 20 by 25 km (12 by 16 mi) and has a rapid orbital motion, so someone on Mars would only see the solar eclipse for no longer than about thirty seconds. Phobos also takes only 7 hours 39 minutes to orbit Mars, while a Martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes long, meaning that Phobos can create two eclipses per Martian day."
Deimos.
"Deimos is too small, 15 by 10 km (9.3 by 6.2 mi), to cause an eclipse. The best someone on Mars would see would be a small object passing the Sun."
View from Earth.
"Both moons are too small to cast a shadow on Mars that can be seen from Earth. However, since the creation of artificial satellites, the shadow of Phobos on Mars has been seen."
War of the Oranges
"The War of the Oranges, or the War of the grapefruit was a brief conflict in Alentjo in 1801. French and Spanish troops invaded Portugal."

"The center's best known feature is the Sails Pavilion. It is a exhibit and special event area. The Sails Pavilion's roof includes Teflon-coated fiberglass ""sails"". They are intended to show San Diego's maritime history. The Pavilion was first built as an open-air facility under the roof. This made it hard to get people to use it. Because of this, the Pavilion area was enclosed in glass. This made it much more usable."
History.
San Diego approved the construction of a new convention center in 1983. It was built on land owned by the Port of San Diego. Construction of the building began in March 1987 and was finished in November 1989. The center was made larger in September 2001 by doubling its square footage.
"Notable events hosted at the convention center include the Comic Con International convention. It hosted the 1996 Republican National Convention, which nominated Bob Dole and Jack Kemp for President and Vice President of the United States."

Burning of Jaffna Public Library
"The burning of the Jaffna Public Library () was an attack at the central library in the city of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. It was one of the events that led up to the Sri Lankan Civil War. The first attack on the library building was on 1 June 1981. A group of Sinhalese rioters burned the library that was one of the important libraries in Sri Lanka and one of the biggest in Asia."
"This was one of the most violent examples of ethnic-based book burnings of the 20th century. At the time of its destruction, the library was one of the biggest in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts."
"In 1984 the library was repaired. However, the civil war had begun the previous year. The building was burned several times during the years of fighting, until 1998 when the president tried to make peace between the Sinhalese and Tamil sides. In 2003 the rebuilt library reopened again."

Servants.
"Thirteen of the eighteen persons in this category were attached to Pilgrim families, the other five were with non-Pilgrim families. Four of those listed here were small children, given over by Samuel More to Thomas Weston and then to agents John Carver and Robert Cushman, who assigned them to senior Mayflower Pilgrims to be classed as indentured servants."
"In all, there were 102 passengers on the Mayflower - 74 males and 28 females"
Animals.
"At least two dogs are known to have participated in the settling of Plymouth. Edward Winslow writes that a female dog which is called an English Mastiff, and a small English Springer Spaniel came ashore on the first explorations of what is now Provincetown, Massachusetts. There may have been other animals on the ""Mayflower"", but only these two dogs had been mentioned."
"Bosley Crowther did not like the movie. He wrote, ""The script was obviously written to bring [Wyman] and Mr. Hudson, who made a popular twosome in the ""Magnificent Obsession"", together again. Solid and sensible drama plainly had to give way to outright emotional bulldozing and a paving of easy clichés."""

Pus
"Pus is a fluid that is created as a result of certain inflammations in vertebrates. In vertebrates, white blood cells fight the inflammation. Neutrophils destroy the agents that cause the infection, for example bacteria, macrophages engulf and neutralise these agents. Pus is made of dead neutrophils and macrophages, mostly. In most cases, pus is the result of bacterial infection, but it can also result from other conditions, such as psoriasis."
Leptin
Leptin is a hormone made by cells in fat tissue that reduces hunger. That helps the energy balance in the body.
"Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the ""hunger hormone"". Both hormones act on receptors in the hypothalamus. They adjust appetite to get energy homeostasis."
"In obesity, a decreased sensitivity to leptin comes up. This leads to a feeling of hunger, despite high energy stores."
"Although regulation of fat stores is the primary function of leptin, it also plays a role in other physiological processes. These additional functions are still being studied."
Leptin was recently discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey M. Friedman and colleagues at Rockefeller University. Its discovery is important in the study of obesity which has become a problem in western society. The importance of leptin was discovered through experiments done on mice in a laboratory. Scientists found that mice who had more leptin in their bodies were thinner and didn't need to eat as much. Leptin levels can be increased by reducing stress and having quality or restful sleep.

Nitro compound
A nitro compound is a molecule that has the nitro group. The nitro group is made of one nitrogen atom connected with two oxygen atoms (-NO2). The nitrogen is also bonded to the rest of the molecule.
"Nitrogen normally has only three bonds. In a nitro group, the bond is considered positively charged. Then one bond of the oxygen is negatively charged, and the other has a double bond. In reality, the best way to represent the nitro group is to consider it to have delocalized electrons. Then all three atoms are sp2 hybridised."
Reaction.
"Nitro compounds are very explosive. This is because, at high temperature, nitro compounds can decompose and release nitrogen gas. This reaction is very exothermic (gives out a lot of energy). Many explosives have nitro groups, for example trinitrotoluene (TNT)."

From 1996, the Brazilian Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) monitored and occasionally interacted with him from a distance, but he otherwise chose to remain isolated. Living primarily by hunting and gathering and moving frequently, he left behind a deep hole of unknown purpose in each of his homes. This was the reason for his nickname. The Man of the Hole survived another attack by an armed rancher in 2009. In 2018, his case attracted international attention when FUNAI released a video of him to raise awareness about the threats uncontacted peoples faced in Brazil.

He is welcomed and a feast is held. His older, dutiful brother who has worked without reward for his father resents the fuss made over the prodigal son. His father reminds him that all he has is his. He says they should still celebrate the return of the younger boy because he has come back to them. In the Western Catholic church, this parable is usually read on the third Sunday of Lent. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the ""Sunday of the Prodigal Son"". The parable is the subject of much art, music, literature, and stage works."
"This is the last of three parables about loss and redemption. It follows the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin. Jesus tells this parable after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with ""sinners."" The father's joy described in the parable reflects divine love, the ""boundless mercy of God,"" and ""God's refusal to limit the measure of his grace."""
Parable of the Mustard Seed
"The Parable of the Mustard Seed is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in three of the Gospels of the New Testament: Gospel of Matthew (13:31–32), Gospel of Mark (4:30–32), and Gospel of Luke (13:18–19). The differences among the three tellings are minor."
"In Matthew and Luke, this parable is followed by the Parable of the Leaven. The Parable of the Leaven also has a theme about the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. A version of the parable also occurs in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas 20."
"The parable from Matthew reads: ""The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field; which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."" The parables from Mark and Luke are similar."
Parable of the Lost Sheep
"The Parable of the Lost Sheep is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in the Gospel of Matthew at 18:12–14 and the Gospel of Luke at 15:3–7. It also appears in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. The parable is one of three that tell of loss and redemption. The others are The Lost Coin and The Prodigal Son. The Lost Sheep tells of a shepherd who leaves his 99 sheep to search for one sheep that is lost. Joel B. Green writes that ""these parables are ... about God, ... their aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost."" The parable has been depicted often in art."
Brandenburg Gate (Potsdam)
"The Brandenburg Gate () on the ""Luisenplatz"" in Potsdam, should not be confused with the gate of the same name on Berlin's ""Pariser Platz"", it was built in 1770/71 by Carl von Gontard and Georg Christian Unger by order of Frederick II of Prussia. It stands at the western end of ""Brandenburger Straße"", which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul."
"Previously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling."
"Towards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory."
Since the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.

Cradle of Humankind
"The Cradle of Humankind is a World Heritage Site. It was first named by UNESCO in 1999. The site is about 50 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa in the Gauteng province, and occupies ."
"The site's limestone caves, including the Sterkfontein Caves, were where fossils were found. A 2.3-million year-old fossil ""Australopithecus africanus"" (nicknamed 'Mrs. Ples') was found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson. The find followed the 1924 discovery of the juvenile ""Australopithecus africanus"" skull, 'Taung Child', by Raymond Dart, at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa, where excavations still continue."
"The name ""Cradle of Humankind"" reflects the fact that the site has produced a large number, as well as some of the oldest, hominid fossils ever found, some dating back as far as 3.5 million years ago. Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found."
Recent work.
"The remains of several partial skeletons of a previously unknown Australopithecan species were found in 2008 near Johannesburg. They have been dated to about two million year ago (mya). A recent re-examination of two partial skeletons of ""Australopithecus sediba"" has led to its identification as close to the origin of the genus ""Homo"". Not all palaeoanthropologists agree this is a new species."
"A new analysis shows this species had a human-like pelvis, hands and teeth, and a chimpanzee-like foot. In six separate research reports, palaeontologists reported on the anatomy of a juvenile male skeleton, MH1, a female skeleton, known as MH2, and an isolated adult tibia or shinbone, known as MH4. The findings suggest that some species of australopithecine climbed trees, some walked on the ground, and some did both."
"Colleagues in England investigated the teeth. Like other parts of the skeleton, the teeth are a mosaic of primitive and human-like features."

Swift
The swift is a bird in the family Apodidae. It is in the order Apodiformes with treeswifts and hummingbirds. The swift is very good at flying. It spends all of its time in the air.
"The scientific name for the swift (""apus"") comes from the Ancient Greek word απους, ""apous"" which means ""without feet"". This is because swifts have very small, weak feet. Swifts use their feet to hold on to vertical places (for example, the wall of a house, or a cliff). Swifts do not want to land on the ground. It is often thought that if they land on ground, they cannot fly up again, but that is not true. They can take off but with difficulty."
Description.
"Swifts are small birds. They can fly very well and very fast. Some swifts can fly at 514m per second. If a swift needs to fly very fast, it can fly at 60m per second for a short amount of time. When catching insects, they fly in a series of swoops, changing direction rapidly as they pursue the prey."
"Swifts have long, curved wings. The wings are in the shape of a sickle or boomerang. They have a forked tail. This means it looks like a V shape."
"Swifts can be seen all over the world. They like to live in warmer places and they migrate every year. For example, Swifts fly to Europe in the spring and summer. When it gets cold at the start of autumn, the Swifts fly to Africa where it is warmer."
Nests.
"Swifts make their nests in a corner between two walls. For example, near the roof of a house, or in an area between rocks in a cave. They use mud and saliva (spit) to make a cup-shaped nest."
"There are some swifts which only use saliva to make their nests. These swifts are in the genus ""Aerodramus"". In Asia, people take the nests and use them to make bird's nest soup. This soup is very popular in China."

"The short-tailed albatross or Steller's albatross (""Phoebastria albatrus"") is a large seabird from the North Pacific. With a wingspan of up to , it is the largest of the Albatrosses of the northern hemisphere. While breeding occurs in large colonies, the adult birds prefer a solitary life. It is a good flyer. 1949, almost all birds were thought to be extinct. When a few were re-discovered in 1951, they were protected. Since then, their numbers have increased, so that in 2022, they are no longer seen as ""endangered"", but as ""vulnerable"". Short-tailed albatrosses feed on cephalopods, fish, and crustaceans. They are oportunists, and will also feed on the organic waste ships throw overboard."
"Although related to the other North Pacific albatrosses, it also exhibits behavioural and morphological links to the albatrosses of the Southern Ocean. It was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas from skins collected by Georg Wilhelm Steller (after whom its other common name is derived). Once common, it was brought to the edge of extinction by the trade in feathers, but with protection efforts underway since the 1950s, the species is in the process of recovering with an increasing population trend. Its breeding range, however, remains small.It is a part of the albatross family."

Ecgfrith of Northumbria
Ecgfrith (or Egfrith; –685 AD) was the King of Deira from 664 AD until 670 AD . When his father died he became King of Northumbria from 670 AD until his death. Ecgfrith ruled Northumbria when it was at the height of its power. His reign ended with his defeat at the Battle of Nechtansmere in which he died.
Early life.
"Ecgfrith was a younger son of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his wife Enfleda. She was the daughter of King Edwin of Northumbria. He was born . In 655 he was ten years old when Penda of Mercia took him hostage. In 660, at age fifteen, Ecgfrith was married to Etheldreda, the daughter of King Anna of East Anglia. She was the widow of the """" Tondberht of the South Gyrwas. Even though she had been married she had retained her virginity. After her marriage to Ecgfrith she refused to her second marriage and remained a virgin. She was encouraged by Bishop Wilfrid to remain . This caused friction between Ecgfrith and Bishop Wilfrid."
King of Northumbria.
"In 660, shortly after the death of his father, Ecgfrith became King of Northumbria. Ecgfrith asked Bishop Wilfrid to convince the queen the kingdom needed an heir. He paid the bishop in gold and a great many hides of land to convince her but Etheldreda would not change her mind. The marriage was dissolved before the end of 672. Ethelreda was allowed to become a nun. She retired to Coldingham Priory and a year later she became the abbess of Ely, which she had built herself. Ecgfrith married as his second wife Eormenburg. She and Bishop Wilfrid became bitter enemies."
"In 672 the Picts revolted and threw out the king that the Northumbrians had placed on the throne there. Ecgfrith sent his army into Pictland (Scotland) to punish them. He defeated the Picts and appointed his ealdorman Beornheth to rule over them. In 674 Wulfhere of Mercia and his allies attacked Northumbria. Wulfhere was trying to reclaim Lindsey. But Ecgfrith defeated Wulfhere and made him pay tribute. Wulfhere was succeeded as king of Mercia by his brother Aethelred in 675. Ecgfrith arranged for his sister Osthryth to marry Aethelred. But in 679 Aethelred defeated Ecgfrith in battle at the River Trent. To prevent a blood feud between the two royal families, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury stepped in to prevent further bloodshed. He secured a truce between Northumbria and Mercia that lasted for 50 years. Ecgfrith next turned his attention to the Britons of Rheged. He drove them out of northern England and into Ireland. There they became mercenaries for the Irish kings and also began raiding the English coast. In 684 Ecgfrith led his armies against the kingdom of Brega, north of present day Dublin in Ireland. He won a victory and returned to Northumbria. At this point he may have become too confident. In 685 Ecgfrith again attacked the Picts but this time he was defeated and killed. On 20 May 685 his forces were drawn into an ambush at Nechtansmere near Forfar in Scotland. Ecgfrith and his second wife Eormenburg had no children. Ecgfrith was succeeded by his half-brother Aldfrith. Queen Eormenburg retired to Carlisle abby."
Ecgfrith and the Church.
"In 674 Ecgfrith had given Benedict Biscop, a Northumbrian nobleman, fifty hides of land at the mouth of the River Wear. This was to build the first of two great monasteries. In 682 King Ecgfrith gave another forty hides of land to Benedict for a second monastery. It was to be at the mouth of the River Trent at Jarrow. The two monasteries were administered as a single community and came to be called Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbeys. They became a center of learning and were where Bede wrote most of his works. Ecgfrith was at the dedication of Jarrow abbey in 685 about a month before his death."
"From 669 Bishop Wilfrid was directly involved in every gift of land and money to the Church by the Northumbrian king and queens. He became very powerful and rich in the process. In 671 he began building a great church which was financed by and confiscated British church lands. But after Queen Etheldreda retired to her abbey he lost most of his rich patronage. The new queen, Eormenburg, had no love of Wilfrid. Stephen of Ripon, the author of the eighth-century ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" (""Life of Saint Wilfrid"") accused her of being jealous and not having the proper respect for the bishop. In 678 King Ecgfrith drove Bishop Wilfrid out of Northumbria. Bede gave no explanation for why Wilfrid was expelled, but made it clear his sympathies lay with the Bishop."

Operation (mathematics)
"In mathematics, an operation is a function which takes one or more inputs (called operands) and produces an output. Some of the most common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, all of which take two inputs and produce an output. These are called binary operations, and are often used when solving math problems. Other types of operations are called unary operations, which take only one input and produce an output."
"There are more operations than these, including raising numbers to exponents, taking the root and applying the logarithm."
Below is a list of the most used operations.
List of mathematical operations.
Addition.
"Addition is the first arithmetic operation and hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of subtraction. The terms in an addition are called ""addends"", and the result of an addition is called a ""sum""."
The symbol for addition is +
Examples of additions:
formula_1
formula_2
formula_3
formula_4
formula_5
"Any number plus zero is the same number (formula_6). This is called the ""additive identity""."
For example: formula_7
"Changing the order of the addends in an addition does not change its sum. This is called the ""commutative property of addition""."

"From its origins as the ""Kara-Irtysh"" (Vast Irtysh, kara means Vast in Turkic languages but also black. But in the context and geographic terms usually refers vast) in the Mongolian Altay mountains in Xinjiang, China, the Irtysh flows northwest through Lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan, meeting the Ishim and Tobol rivers before merging with the Ob near Khanty-Mansiysk in western Siberia, Russia after 4,248 kilometres (2,640 mi)."
"The name Black Irtysh (""Kara-Irtysh"" in Kazakh, or ""Cherny Irtysh"" in Russian) is applied by some authors, especially in Russia and Kazakhstan, to the upper course of the river, from its source entering Lake Zaysan. The term White Irtysh, in opposition to the Black Irtysh, was occasionally used in the past to refer to the Irtysh below lake Zaysan; now this usage is largely obsolete."

Interpretations of quantum mechanics
"In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism is very difficult to interpret physically. However, there are many ideas about the interpretations and meanings of quantum mechanics. There are no facts to prove any interpretation over the others, but there are some that are more accepted than others."
Background material.
"""Main article: Quantum mechanics"""
The main ideas of quantum mechanics are the postulates of Schrödinger and Heisenberg. The Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes the wavefunction of an object. The equation can be given by
formula_1
"The basic meaning of this equation is that a particle, such as an electron, is not ""just"" a point-like particle, but also a type of wave. The philosophical implications will be explored shortly. Another fundamental of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This bizarre theory is the idea that the position and the momentum of an object cannot both be known. The greater the certainty of the ""position"" of an object, the less the certainty of the ""momentum"" of the object. The mathematical formulation of this is given by"

Ice candle is a kind of candle made from water. It is fantastical and looks like a lamp-shade. It has been made in cold areas in winter. It melts in a few days so we can enjoy it for a moment.
History.
"The Ice candle was first made in Shimokawa, Hokkaido. In Shimokawa, there are few days in a year when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees below freezing. So this town is known as extreme cold. The members of “Egg of Columbus”, which is a Town Development Idea Semester in Shimokawa, had thought about some ideas on how people enjoy a cold winter with snow. In 1985, they found a sentence, “...the flame moves in the ice block, it changes to the natural lamp-shade quickly, the flame in the natural and pale clear glass lights up in the garden fantastically...” This is from “Live in north literary calendar, Northern area column (Kita no kurashi saiziki, Hoppo-ken column)” written by Ryuichi Ito who was a professor of Hokkaido university of education. He wrote about the candle which is made by Scandinavian Finland children. The Egg of Columbus got some hints to create the Ice candle from that sentence. In 1986, the Ice candle was created. They put a wish for people to be able to spend winter happily in it. In 1987, the Ice candle was introduced on TV. From around that time, townspeople have made it at their own home. Now, the Ice candle is known by Japanese nationwide and loved by people living in cold areas."
How to make.
"To make the Ice candle, you need a bucket, water and a cold environment to freeze water."
"At night the temperature is under -16 degrees, put water into the bucket, then get it outside and through the night. Next morning, turn it upside down and take out the ice if the water has almost frozen. Flow outside the water which couldn’t freeze. Put a candle into the hole of the ice. Not to break it, treat it carefully."
"We can make it with our own original ideas. For example, the colors and the shapes. If you want to color it, you can use a food coloring or paints. If you want to make it differently, you can use a milk carton or a balloon instead of a bucket."
Ice candle festival.
"The Ice Candle Festival is one of the festivals which is held in winter. In this festival, the venue is illuminated by many Ice candles. The place of origin is also Shimokawa in Hokkaido. Two years later after the Ice candle appeared, the name of Shimokawa Winter Festival, which was already there, was changed to Ice Candle Festival. In this festival, the Ice candle was put not only at the venue but also at each house in the town. In total, about 7000 Ice candles were put in the town. In addition, people who go to the festival enjoy eating food outside while seeing the Ice candles. Now, the Ice Candle Festival is held in various places in Japan. Lake-Yamanakako Ice Candle Festival in Yamanashi prefecture and Mt. Nobeyama Plateau Ice Candle Festival in Nagano prefecture are also famous festivals."

Analysis.
"This animation was created for children, but a wide age of people pay attention to it because of Twitter. The reason for increasing popularity is in every episode. Every story is not only cute, but also deep. The view of the world is pop, but people appear to have an ugly attitude. Also it has a parody of a movie. For example, Back to the future. These are the reasons more people attract. An animation history researcher mentioned that molcar's appearance, the story and heartwarming attitude made it interesting and popular."
"An educational critic mentioned that the animation has no conversation, so understanding of the story in music, moving facial experiences are good for children to create imagination. Also mentioned, because of the pandemic people have more time to stay at home. That is why this animation is more popular."

Luís Vaz de Torres
"Luís Vaz de Torres was a Spanish explorer. Sometimes his name is spelled Luis Váez de Torres. He was born around the year 1565, and died in 1607. Today, he is noted for the first recorded European navigation of the strait which separates the continent of Australia from the island of New Guinea. The strait is now named after him (Torres Strait)."
Origins and early life.
"Captain Luis Váez de Torres undertook a voyage from 1606 to 1607. In this voyage, the crew called him a ""Breton"" in reports. One of the reports points to an origin in the northwest province of Spain, that is Galicia. Historians accept this as evidence of his origins. The year and exact place of his birth are unknown but he was likely born around 1565."
"Torres has been presented as Portuguese, without any evidence other than his name. He is never called a Portuguese in the records but they note remarks made by crew members of the Portuguese origins of Pedro Fernandes de Queirós."
Torres entered the navy of the Spanish Crown and found his way to its South American colonies. By late 1605 he first entered the historical record as the nominated commander of the second ship in an expedition to the Pacific. The Portuguese born navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós proposed him for the position.

Variscan orogeny
The Variscan orogeny (Hercynian orogeny) is an ancient mountain-building event in the late Palaeozoic era. It was caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana to form the supercontinent of Pangaea.
"It explains many older features of the present-day world. The Appalachians in North America and the Massif Central in France are two examples. Other examples are the Pyrenees, Sardinia, the Rhine Massif, the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. To the east, the Variscan caused the Urals, the Pamir, the Tian Shan mountains."
"This geologic mountain-building event took place mostly in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. By then Pangaea was more or less complete. In the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, there was land between Siberia over the North Pole to Antarctica over the South Pole. Later in the Mesozoic, the opening of the Atlantic split Pangea. The various parts of the huge mountain belts ended up widely apart on the modern globe."
Higher mountain chains on present-day Earth are the product of a later episode of mountain-building known as the Alpine orogeny.

Chess notation
"Chess notation is a method for writing down chess moves: after a player makes a move, both players write it down. This is compulsory in all organized chess events"
"The system must have these elements: the move number, the piece moved, the square it starts from (optional), the square it goes to, and other relevant information such as captures, and castles.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p275 There are other notations for recording positions."
"There have been ways of describing moves from quite early on. Manuscripts with move descriptions are known in Arabic (9th century) and from Europe (13th century).p275 These early notations are usually quite cumbersome; ""The pawn of the king forward two houses"".p229; 469; 848 This kind of notation is called ""descriptive"". In a descriptive notation each player describes squares from his own point of view, e.g. 1 P–K4 P–K4. A notation which uses labels for the ranks and files is called ""algebraic"". In this notation a square has only one label, e.g. 1 e4 e5."
Algebraic notation.
"The moves of a chess game are written down by using a special notation.Article 8 and Appendix E Usually algebraic chess notation is used. In algebraic notation, each square has one and only one name (whether you are looking from White's side of the board or Black's). Here, moves are written in the format of: abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved. For example, Qg5 means ""queen moves to the g-file and 5th rank"" (that is, to the square g5). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means ""knight from the g-file moves to the square f3"". The letter P showing a pawn is not used, so that e4 means ""pawn moves to the square ""e4""""."
"If the piece makes a capture, ""x"" is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on. Example: ""Bxf3"" means ""bishop captures on f3"". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the Pawn left is used in place of a piece initial. For example: exd5 means ""pawn captures on d5."""
"If a pawn moves to its eighth rank, getting a promotion, the piece chosen is written after the move, for example e1Q or e1=Q. Castling is written by the special notations 0–0 for kingside castling and 0–0–0 for queenside. A move which places the opponent's king in check normally has the notation ""+"" added. Checkmate can be written as # or ++. At the end of the game, 1–0 means ""White won"", 0–1 means ""Black won"" and ½-½ is a draw."
"Chess moves can also be shown with punctuation marks and other annotation symbols. For example: ! means a good move, !! means a very good move, ? means a bad move, ?? a very bad move (sometimes called a ""blunder""), !? a creative move that may be good, and ?! a doubtful move. For example, one kind of a simple ""trap"" known as the Scholar's mate, as in the diagram to the right, may be recorded in full notation:"

"Sir Richard Timothy Hunt , (born 19 February 1943 in Neston, Cheshire), is an English biochemist. He is usually known as Tim Hunt."
Hunt shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on cell division.
The prize was shared with Paul Nurse and Leland H. Hartwell. They had discovered the molecules which control cell division.
"Cyclins are proteins that play a key role in regulating the cell-division cycle. Hunt found that cyclins begin to be synthesised after eggs are fertilised. He also found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells, where they also regulate the cell cycle."
Early life.
"At the age of eight he was accepted into the Dragon School, where he first developed an interest in biology thanks to his German teacher, Gerd Sommerhoff."
"When he was fourteen he moved to Magdalen College School, Oxford, where the science prizes now bear his name."
Career.
"In 1961, Hunt was accepted into Clare College, Cambridge to study natural sciences, graduating in 1964 and immediately beginning work in the university Department of Biochemistry."
"He finished his PhD in 1968 and went to New York to work on protein synthesis. Tiny amounts of glutathione inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocytes (immature red blood cells), and tiny amounts of RNA killed the synthesis altogether. After returning to Cambridge he continued work on substances which started or inhibited protein synthesis."
"In 1982 at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, he used the sea urchin (""Arbacia punctulata"") egg as his model organism. He discovered the cyclin molecule."
Hunt found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells where they regulate the cell cycle. His group showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein kinases. One of these had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by Paul Nurse.
"In 1990 he began work at Imperial Cancer Research Fund. In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse for their work on cell division. Other honours followed, and he was knighted by the Queen in 2006."
Personal life.
Hunt is married to Mary Collins. The couple have two daughters.

"The ragdoll is a cat breed that is large, with blue eyes, and a semi-longhair soft and silky coat of fur. It is usually mostly white, with light to dark marks."
"The ragdoll was first bred by an American breeder named Ann Baker from a Persian-like cat (without a pedigree) and a Birman cat with the Siamese colorpoint gene. It is similar in appearance to the Himalayan, which was bred directly from the Persian and Siamese."
"The Ragdoll is gentle, easy going, and affectionate. The breed was named ""Ragdoll"" because they often go limp and relax like a rag or cloth doll when it is picked up. The original mother cat that the breed was created from was involved in a car accident, but contrary to popular belief, this is not why the breed goes limp when picked up (injuries from an accident are not passed on to offspring genetically)."
"Ragdoll is a breed that enjoys being around humans and it may follow its owner around the house. Due to its soft nature, it is strictly recommended to be an indoor only cat."
"In addition to the colorpoint pattern, Ragdolls may also have mittens (white paws)."

"He was mentored by G. H. Hardy in the early 1910s. After getting his degree at Cambridge, Ramanujan did his own work. He compiled over 3500 identities and equations in his life. Some of the identities were found in his “lost notebook”. When the notebook was discovered, mathematicians proved almost all of Ramanujan's work. His discoveries have led to many advancements in mathematics. His formulae are now being used in crystallography and string theory."
"In 2011, Ramanujan's birthday was made “National Mathematics Day” by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh."

Echizen forged knives
"Echizen forged knives are traditional knives made in Echizen City, Fukui prefecture, Japan. These knives are notable for the use of two techniques in its creation. ""Nimai hiroge"" (double layering), and ""Mawashi hagane tsuke"" (shaping the knife). Because of these characteristic techniques, they were chosen as the earliest traditional craft for forged knives in 1979."
History.
"The origin of Echizen forged knives was in the early Nanboku-cho period. In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture moved to ""Echizen no kuni"" (present Echizen city) and made sickles for the citizens. During his stay, many citizens began to make products using his techniques. Because of this, Echizen city became an area famous for their production of farming tools. During the Edo period, these tools spread in Japan through trading. They were noted for their lightness and sharpness, and because of this, knives made in Echizen city became popular in Japan. Now, Echizen produces many products other than knives, such as hatchets."
Two main processes.
"The two main important processes: ""nimai hiroge"" and ""mawashi hagane tsuke""."
...The blade is evenly thinned by stretching the two layered plates. This is done by beating both sides at high speeds with a machine hammer.
...The tip of the blade is sharpened carefully to be close to the sharpness of a diamond.

Principality of Sealand
"The Principality of Sealand is an unrecognized micronation that claims HM Fort Roughs (also known as Roughs Tower) as its territory. Roughs Tower is an offshore platform in the North Sea around off the coast of Suffolk. Roughs Tower was used as a sea fort in international waters during World War II. Since 1987, the tower has been occupied by the family and associates of Paddy Roy Bates, a former British Army major. Bates took the tower from pirate radio broadcasters in 1967. Sealand was invaded by mercenaries in 1978. Sealand was able to defeat the attack. The platform has been in British territory since 1987, when the United Kingdom made its territorial waters larger."
History.
"In 1943, during World War II, HM Fort Roughs (sometimes called Roughs Tower) was built by the United Kingdom as one of the Maunsell Forts. Its main goal was to protect the nearby shipping lanes from German mine-laying vehicles. It held 150–300 Royal Navy personnel throughout World War II. The last time it was used by the Royal Navy was in 1956."
Occupation and creation.
Roughs Tower was used in February and August 1965 by Jack Moore and his daughter Jane. They used it as a base for Wonderful Radio London.
"Major Paddy Roy Bates took the fort on 2 September 1967 to use it for his own pirate radio station (Radio Essex). However, he never starting broadcasting. Instead, he declared the independence Roughs Tower as the Principality of Sealand."
"In 1968, British workmen entered the claimed territorial waters of the Principality of Sealand to fix a buoy near the platform. Michael Bates (son of Patty Roy Bates) tried to scare the workmen off by firing warning shots from the platform. As Bates was a British subject at the time, he was called to court on firearm charges after the incident. However, the court said that the platform was outside of British waters and the case could not continue."
"In 1975, Bates introduced a constitution for Sealand, followed by a national flag, a national anthem, a currency and passports."
1978 attack.
"In August 1978, Alexander Achenbach, who said he was the prime minister of Sealand, hired many Dutch and German mercenaries to attack Sealand while Bates and his wife were in Austria. They took the platform and took Bates' son Michael hostage. Michael was able to escape and take back Roughs Tower using weapons stored on the platform. Achenbach was charged with treason. He was held there unless he paid DM 75,000 (more than US$35,000 or £23,000). Germany sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Sealand to negotiate for Achenbach's release. He was released after many weeks of negotiation. Roy Bates claimed that the diplomat's visit meant that Germany had ""de facto"" recognized Sealand."
2006 fire.
"On the afternoon of 23 June 2006, the top platform of Roughs Tower caught fire because of an electrical fault. A Royal Air Force helicopter took one person to Ipswich Hospital. The Harwich lifeboat stayed nearby Roughs Tower until a local fire tug extinguished the fire. All damage was repaired by November 2006."
Attempted sale.
"In January 2007, The Pirate Bay, an online media index founded by the Swedish think tank Piratbyrån, tried to buy Sealand after harsher copyright laws forced them to look for a new headquarters. Between 2007 and 2010, Sealand was offered for sale through the Spanish estate company ImmoNaranja at a price of €750 million (£600 million, US$906 million)."
Death of founder.
"Roy Bates died at the age of 91 on 9 October 2012. He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for many years. He was succeeded by his son Michael.

"In the 1950s, as they came to doubt that the children had died, they put up a billboard at the site along State Route 16 with pictures of the five."
"In support of their belief that the children survived, the Sodders have pointed to a number of unusual circumstances before and during the fire. Authorities say the fire was caused by an electric fire and that the remains were cremated in the fire. The Sodders believed the Sicilian Mafia or someone else kidnapped the children due to George's anti-Benito Mussolini views."

"It is not known why the area was called Caulfield, but it is probably linked with Baron Caulfeild of Ireland. John Caulfield was an early settler in the colony of Victoria. The name Caulfield was in use by 1853, and the early maps always place it somewhere around the racecourse."
The whole area was named the Caulfield Road District in 1857. Caulfield Post Office opened on 1 January 1863 and closed in 1974. Caulfield Junction Post Office opened in 1923 and is still open.

Stratosphere
"The stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet Earth. It extends from about 8 km above the poles (18 km above the equator) to about 50 km. In the stratosphere, the temperature rises with increasing height. This makes the stratosphere very stable. This temperature gradient is caused by the ozone layer which absorbs some UV radiation from sunlight. The absorbed radiation is converted to heat."
"This differs from the lower layer, the troposphere, where temperature declines with higher altitude, and from the next higher layer, the mesosphere, where the temperature again declines."
"Airplanes that are going far usually fly in the lower stratosphere, because the engines are more efficient in cold air and drag is small in low air density air."
"As part of the creation of the Muni Metro system, streetcar operation switched to light rail operation in 1981 – the last line to do so. While many streetcar lines switched to bus lines after World War II, the J Church avoided this due to the private right-of-way it uses between 18th Street and 22nd Street."
Extension to Balboa Park.
"The outer end of the line was originally at Church and 30th Streets. It was where streetcars used a triangle of railroad track to turn back. Studies to further the line from its southern terminus had been made in the 1920s and 1970's. In 1990–91, the tracks were extended to the Balboa Park BART station and the Metro Center (Muni light-rail base), giving J-line cars a much shorter connection to the yard than before. The extension opened on August 31, 1991. But the new section was used only by light rail cars starting or ending their runs; all-day J-line service was not use the new tracks until June 19, 1993."
K Ingleside
"The K Ingleside is a light rail line of the Muni Metro system in San Francisco, California. It mostly serves the West Portal and Ingleside neighborhoods. Opened on February 3, 1918, it was the first line to use the Twin Peaks Tunnel."
Route description.
"The K Ingleside line stops at concrete boarding islands in the middle of the street next to the tracks. Some stops have raised platforms for accessibility. Stations between West Portal and Embarcadero is only served by the outbound K. But, not the inbound K, as it switches to T at West Portal."
Operation.
"The K Ingleside begins service at 5 a.m. weekdays, 6 a.m. Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays, with the end of service around 12:30 a.m. each night. Trains on the weekdays are scheduled to come every 10 minutes. Trains on the weekends are scheduled to come every 12 minutes."
History.
Municipal Railway.
"The San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) opened its K line along with the Twin Peaks Tunnel on February 3, 1918. The line ran from St. Francis Circle station along West Portal Avenue, through the tunnel, along Market Street to Van Ness Avenue (joining the J Church at Church Street). And along existing tracks on Van Ness Avenue to Pine Street. On June 1, 1918, the J and K lines were removed from Van Ness Avenue and went further along Market Street to a loop at the Ferry Building."
Changes in 1980s.
"More changes to the service route followed until finally on December 17, 1980. It was when the K line was light rail operated, with service from Embarcadero Station to Balboa Park, on weekdays only. Weekend service continued to use PCC cars until September 1982. This was when the Muni Metro became fully operational."
Changes in 2000s.
"From February 2001 to June 7, 2003, K Ingleside service was cut back to St. Francis Circle. It was also replaced by buses on Ocean Avenue for street repaving, and route reconstruction along Ocean Avenue."
"Following service changes on June 30, 2007, the K Ingleside and the T Third Street lines were combined inside the Market Street subway tunnel. Though keeping their line designations, resulting in an upside-down, horseshoe-shaped route from Balboa Park to Bayshore and Sunnydale. At West Portal Station, inbound K trains heading towards downtown change their signs to the T line; at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line."
L Taraval
"The L Taraval is a light rail line of the Muni Metro system in San Francisco, California. The line is currently not operating and replaced by buses through the end of 2024 for reconstruction along Taraval Street."
Route description.
"The line begins at Wawona and 46th Avenue station (near the San Francisco Zoo), which is on a one-way loop on Vicente Street, 47th Avenue, Wawona Street, and 46th Avenue. It runs north on 46th Avenue to Taraval Street, then runs east on Taraval Street to 15th Avenue. The line then runs south one block on 15th Avenue, then east on Ulloa Street to West Portal station, where it tags along with all the other Muni Metro lines towards Embarcadero station."
Operation.
"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the L Taraval operates 7 days a week, with train service beginning at 5 a.m. weekdays, 6 a.m. Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays and running until 12:30 a.m."
History.
"Muni's L Taraval line opened as a shuttle from West Portal to 33rd Avenue on April 12, 1919. It went further west along Taraval Street to 48th Avenue at Ocean Beach on January 14, 1923; that October 15, the shuttle service was replaced with larger streetcars running through to the Ferry Building. The L Taraval went south (turning off Taraval at 46th) to the San Francisco Zoo, the line's current outer terminus, on September 15, 1937. Every other streetcar line was routed to the new Transbay Terminal on January 15, 1939; they went back to the Ferry Building on January 1, 1941, but the Transbay Terminal became the inner terminal for all streetcars on June 6, 1948."
Light rail operation.
"The L switched to light rail operations as part of the opening of the Muni Metro system in 1980. While many streetcar lines switched to buses operations after World War II, the L Taraval remained a streetcar line due to its use of the Twin Peaks Tunnel."
L Taraval Improvement Project.
"The L Taraval Improvement Project, originally called the L Taraval Rapid project, was to improve street safety and speed up trains."
"L Taraval Improvement Project construction began in August 2019. In September 2019, construction on the first phase of the project began. It took place between Sunset Blvd and 46th Avenue. The first phase was completed in July 2021. The second phase began in January 2022, with the second phase of the construction project taking place from Sunset Blvd to Ulloa St near West Portal station. This phase is expected to last through 2024."
Determiners.
"Determiners are words placed in front of a noun to make it clear what the noun refers to. The difference is each noun can only have one determiner and the determiner always comes before all the other parts of the noun phrase. The most common determiners in English are ""the"" and ""a/an""."
Adverbs.
"Adverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word ""quickly"" in the sentence ""He ran quickly."" They can also describe an adjective. The adverb ""very"" describes the adjective ""sick"" in the sentence ""The boy is very sick."" Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence ""He ran very quickly."""
Prepositions.
"A preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that it adds to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word ""over"" in the sentence ""he walked over the bridge."""
Conjunctions.
"A conjunction is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. It can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. ""And"" in the sentence ""the boy and the girl run"" connects the boy to the girl because they both run. Conjunctions can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word ""but"" in the sentence ""I like cats, but he likes dogs"" is a conjunction doing this."
Interjections.
"Interjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word ""Hooray,"" which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word ""yes"" is much simpler than saying ""what you say is true,"" so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word ""um."""
Syntax.
"Grammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called ""syntax."" Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs."

Scott Young (writer)
"Scott Alexander Young (April 14, 1918 – June 12, 2005) was a Canadian journalist, sportswriter, novelist and the father of musicians Neil Young and Astrid Young. Over his career, Young wrote 45 books, including novels and non-fiction for adult and youth audiences."
Early life.
"Born in Cypress River, Manitoba, Young grew up in nearby Glenboro, Manitoba, where his father, Percy Andrew Young, owned a drug store. His mother was Jean Ferguson Paterson. After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to Winnipeg, but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and he went to live with an aunt and uncle in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler."
"Young began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the Winnipeg Free Press and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna Blow ""Rassy"" Ragland in 1937 and the two were married in 1940."
Moves to Toronto.
"Unable to get a raise at the ""Free Press"", Young moved to Toronto in 1941, covering news and sports for the Canadian Press news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover World War II for CP. He came back a year later and joined the Royal Canadian Navy, where he served until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined ""Maclean's"" magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, Neil Young, was born in Toronto in November 1945."
"Young began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the ""Saturday Evening Post"" and ""Collier's"". He quit his job at ""Maclean's"" in 1948 to write short stories full-time."
"In 1949, Young bought a house in Omemee, Ontario, near Peterborough. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from ""Sports Illustrated."" His first novel ""The Flood"" was published in 1956. Young moved to Pickering, Ontario and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining ""The Globe and Mail"" as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Mead were married. They had a daughter, Astrid Young, in 1962."
He was also a host on Hockey Night in Canada until getting on the wrong side of Toronto Maple Leafs co-owner John Bassett. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.
Life on the farm.
"In 1967, Young bought a farm near Omemee in Cavan Township and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the ""Globe""'s news bureau in Ottawa. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with Punch Imlach. The rights had been acquired by the ""Toronto Telegram"", but the ""Globe"" wouldn't allow Young's writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the ""Globe"" and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the ""Telegram"", moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the ""Telegram"" until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the ""Globe and Mail"". Young and his second wife separated in 1976, and in the fall of 1977, he moved in with fellow ""Globe"" writer Margaret Hogan. The two married in 1980. At the same time, Young had a falling out with the ""Globe"" over stories critical of Imlach written by Donald Ramsay and quit. He worked with former Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe on Smythe's autobiography, which would be published after Smythe's death in November 1980."
"In 1988, Young received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and was also inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Young and his wife sold the farm in the late 1980s and moved to Howth, Ireland, a suburb of North Dublin. In 1990, Young received an honorary doctorate from Trent University and donated many of his papers to the university's archives. The Youngs returned to Omemee in 1992 and repurchased their old farm, which Young owned for the rest of his life. Scott Young Public School in Omemee was named in his honour in 1993. His autobiography, ""A Writer's Life"", was published in 1994."
"He and Margaret moved to Kingston, Ontario, in 2004, where he died the following year at the age of 87."

Description.
"The soft-feathered, brown birds reach up to in height. Their feathers are in a double layer which helps keep the emu cool. They have bare skin on the sides of the face and their neck. They can weigh up to . They have two large legs, with three toes on each foot. Their wings are very short, about"
", and are hidden under their feathers."
They can live up to 10–20 years
The emu is common over most of mainland Australia. It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot. If necessary they can run at up to for some distance at a time. They may travel long distances to find food. One emu was found to have traveled .
Diet.
"They feed on a variety of plants (seeds, flowers, new growth) and insects. Because of their size they need to eat a lot."
Breeding.
"Emus are solitary birds. However, the young chicks stay with the father until they are 18 months of age. The breeding season is between February and July, when the female can lay between 5-15 eggs in a ground nest built by the male. The male then sits on the eggs for 8 weeks until hatching. The baby chicks have very clear stripes on the feathers which act as camouflage."
"On the east coast of Australia, emus were once common but have become uncommon with increased human population. On the other hand, the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid (dry) regions. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and leather. The first emu farms began in Western Australia during the 1970s."
In captivity.
There are approximately 1100 emus in zoos.
The history of the name.
"The first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillip's ""Voyage to Botany Bay"", published in 1789. The species was named by ornithologist (bird expert) John Latham, who worked on Phillip's book. He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species. Its scientific name, Dromaius novaehollandiae, is from the Latin words, meaning ""fast-footed New Hollander"". The history of the common name, ""emu"", is not certain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird. This word was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea. In Victoria, some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were ""Barrimal"" in the Djadja wurrung language, ""myoure"" in Gunai, and ""courn"" in Jardwadjali."
Kiwi
"The kiwi is a type of bird from New Zealand. They are the genus Apteryx of the family Apterygidae. There are several species and sub-species of kiwi. The kiwi is a symbol for New Zealand. People from New Zealand are nicknamed ""Kiwis""."
"They have a long beak and brown feathers. The feathers look like fur. Kiwi cannot fly, and their wings are so small that they cannot usually be seen. Kiwi cannot see well, but they can hear very well. They are the smallest ratite birds."
Life.
"Kiwi are night (nocturnal) birds. They mostly eat invertebrates, like worms and insects. Kiwi keep a territory where they live alone or with their mate. In their territory they build several small caves where they sleep, or lay their eggs."
Kiwi are monogamous; the male and female stay together until one of them dies. The male and female live in the same territory and raise their children together.
"Female kiwi lay 1-3 eggs. Compared to the size of the mother, the eggs are the largest of any bird species. Kiwi are mature when they are 2 years old, and they can live more than 20 years. One kiwi kept in a zoo even reached 35 years old."
Eggs.
"The female brown kiwi lays enormous eggs, which are almost one-sixth of her own body weight. These eggs take 11 weeks to incubate, the longest time for any bird. In comparison, Yellow-breasted Chats' eggs take only 11 days, and chickens' eggs take 21 days."
Habitat.
"Kiwi prefer to live in burrows they make in forested areas. They either make their burrows in the ground like rabbits, in between the roots of trees, or in hidden sheltered places such as hollow logs. Kiwi line their burrows with leaves to make them more comfortable and warm. Sometimes they hide the entrance to their burrows using piles of twigs. Kiwi may have more than ten different burrows in their territory and will swap between them sometimes."
Kiwi are threatened by many mammals. Stoats are the main threat for the kiwi chicks. Ferrets and dogs kill adult kiwi.
Dodo
"The dodo ""(Raphus cucullatus)"" is an extinct species of flightless bird from Mauritius."
"Like many other island birds, they lost the power of flight because it was no advantage where they lived. Dodos were in the same family as the pigeon. They were endemic to (only lived on) the island of Mauritius. They became extinct in the late 17th century."
The Dodo has become a symbol of extinction caused by the arrival of humans in ecosystems where humans had never before lived.

Language attrition
Language attrition happens when someone forgets all or part of a language learned earlier.
Language death
"Language death is a when language is no longer being used as a first language (also called mother language or native language) or a second language and so it becomes an extinct language. It should not be confused with a dead language, such as Latin, which still is still spoken as a second language."
"Language revival, a dead language becoming a living language again. The only widely-known example of a language being revived is Hebrew."
Modern language
A modern language is a language which is spoken today. It is the opposite of an extinct language. The official languages of countries are modern languages.

The Gang of Four Messing up Hong Kong
"The Gang of Four Messing up Hong Kong(traditional Chinese: 亂港四人幫) was first used by Sing Pao Daily News in August 2016 to call these four men as a group – Zhang Xiaoming, Leung Chun-ying, Jiang Zaizhong and Tung Chee Hwa."
"Sing Pao Daily News kept writing for months that the group had been causing trouble in Hong Kong for their own gain. Leung sounded like he looked down on the above-said writing when he once answered reporters' questions. Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, whose boss is Jiang, kept writing for months that the above-said writing was telling lies."
Many people cared about their writing bad things about each other. They had different guesses on why it was happening.
"In February 2017, Sing Pao Daily News said that some people had begun doing horrible things to try to make them stop writing about 'the Gang of Four Messing up Hong Kong'."

Signs.
"The lowering acid level itself can make symptoms similar to gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hinders protein digestion by holding back the enzyme pepsin. Pepsin needs a low gastric PH to become active. Low acid levels in the stomach are also linked with bacteria growing too much, which can stop the body taking in nutrients or vitamins."

Dieppe Raid
"The Dieppe Raid is also known as the Battle of Dieppe, Operation ""Rutter"" and, later, Operation Jubilee. It was a Second World War Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe. The attack took place on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942."
"The attack began at 5:00 a.m. and by 10:50 a.m. the Allied commanders had to call a retreat. Over 6,000 infantrymen, mostly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian Armoured regiment. They were also helped by a strong force of Royal Navy and smaller Royal Air Force group."
"The goal was to capture a major port for a short period and to gather information. Upon retreat, the Allies also wanted to destroy coastal defences, port structures and important buildings. The raid was also intended to improve morale and demonstrate the commitment of the United Kingdom to attack a Western front in Europe."
"None of these goals were achieved. There was not enough Allied artillery support. The troops were trapped on the beach by obstacles and German gunfire. After less than 10 hours since the first landings, the last Allied troops had all been either killed, evacuated, or captured by the Germans."
"Instead of showing the British commitment, the terrible number of Allied deaths showed that the Allies were not ready to invade France for a long time. The attack did help the Allies to gather some information."
"A total of 3,623 of the 6,086 men (almost 60%) who went ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured. The Royal Air Force did not get the ""Luftwaffe"" to start a battle. The RAF lost 96 aircraft (at least 32 to being shot down or accidents), compared to 48 lost by the ""Luftwaffe""."
"The Royal Navy lost 33 landing craft and one destroyer. The events at Dieppe affected the plans for the North African (Operation ""Torch"") and Normandy landings (Operation ""Overlord"")."
Background.
The British decided the Dieppe attack could be planned within a month. They were very careful to keep the attack secret. No records were kept of the plans.
"After the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk in May 1940, the British started to plan an attack force. It would use new ways of doing sea landings on beaches (amphibious warfare)."
The British started planning was to see if they could capture a port. This would allow them to test out how to use ships in the attack. It would also allow them to test new equipment.
"Dieppe, a coastal town in France, is built along a long cliff by the English Channel. In 1942, the Germans set up two large artillery batteries at Berneval-le-Grand and Varengeville. One important consideration for the British planners was that Dieppe was within range of the Royal Air Force's fighter aircraft."
"There was also pressure from the Soviet government to attack the Germans in Western Europe. By early 1942, The Wehrmacht's Operation ""Barbarossa"" attacks did not destroy the Soviet Union."
"However, the Germans moved into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin demanded that the Allies attack in France to force the Germans to move 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front. This would make the fighting less hard for the Red Army."
Plan.
The Dieppe raid was a major attack planned by Vice-Admiral Lord Mountbatten.
"The attacking force would consist of 5,000 Canadians, 1,000 British troops, and 50 United States Rangers."
"It was originally planned in April 1942 and code named Operation ""Rutter"". The Allies planned to do a major attack on a German-held port on the French coast and to hold it for two tides. They would destroy enemy buildings and defences before withdrawing."
This plan was approved in May 1942. It included British parachute units attacking German artillery batteries. The Canadians would land on the beaches and attack. The parachute operation was cancelled and instead No. 3 Commando and No. 4 Commando would land by sea and attack the artillery batteries.
Land component.
"The Canadian government wanted that Canadian troops to do some fighting. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John Hamilton Roberts, was selected for the main force."
"The plan called for an attack, without any heavy air bombing."
The lack of enough bombing was one of the main reasons for the attack's failure. Some people think that air and naval bombing was not done to limit casualties of French civilians in the port.
"The Dieppe landings were planned on six beaches. Four were in front of the town, and two to the eastern and western sides."
"Armoured support was provided by the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)). 58 of the new Churchill tanks would be sent ashore using the new landing craft tank (LCT). In addition, three of the Churchills had flame-throwers and all could operate in the shallow water near the beach."
Problem signs.
"Unintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer. Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. Stress can come from divorce, changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals."
Sleeping.
"Getting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits."
With every breath.
"Without going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night. One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide. That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out. A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon. Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss."
Your body also burns calories while you sleep.
Diet vs exercise.
"It is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat. Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories."
Exercise alone can be effective in weight loss. Several studies found similar results. The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss. The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body.

Kostandin Shpataraku
Kostandin Shpataraku (flourished 1736–67) was an Albanian painter of 18th century.
Early life.
"Kostandin Shpataraku was born in Valesh village in the Shpat region of Albania. The region is located in the southern highland of Elbasan, Albania, in today's Gjinar which was originally in the Ottoman Empire."
Work.
"Shpataraku was a painter in the Orthodox tradition of icons and Byzantine church frescoes, active between 1736 and 1767. His works combine Byzantine tradition and Italian Renaissance influences."
Death.
"Shpataraku was beheaded by the Ottomans in Elbasan. His family took his body and buried him in his village with his head apart from the rest of the body, so the Ottomans could not find his exact grave. A small chapel was built later to commemorate him. He is also commemorated as a saint by the locals, on September 21."
Legacy.
"Many of his icons are in Ardenica Monastery, St. Jovan Vladimir's Church near Elbasan, Vithkuq, and in the ""Museum of Medieval Art"" in Korce. Many of his works belong to private collections."
Elastin
Elastin is part of connective tissue. It is an elastic protein which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored.
"Elastin is important in blood vessels because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, ligaments, the skin, the bladder, and elastic cartilage. It is present in all vertebrates above the jawless fish."
"In humans, elastin is encoded by the ""ELN"" gene."
Icterid
"The Icteridae are a family of small to medium-sized New World songbirds. They are usually brightly colored. Most species have black as a main plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red. The family is extremely varied in size, shape, behavior and coloration."
"This group includes the New World blackbirds, New World orioles, the bobolink, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds, oropendolas and caciques. They are only distantly related to the Old World common blackbird (which is a thrush) or the Old World orioles."
"Icterids are unusual in songbirds because they have considerable sexual dimorphism. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures and weighs about . This variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families."
"One unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull allows them to open their bills strongly rather than passively. This lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food."

Match fixing
"Match fixing, in organized sports, occurs as a match is played to an entirely or partly pre-determined result. This violates the rules of the game and often the law. The most common reason is to get a payoff from gamblers."
"The major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and the future team advantage. In Eastern Europe, mafia gangsters are linked to illegal gambling and match fixing. In Russia, people have disappeared or died after acting against bribes in sports."
"Many sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines tFheir opponent in the next. By losing a match, a certain team can face an easier opponent in the next round. This makes them much more likely to win."
Sports betting
"Sports betting is the activity of predicting sports and placing wagers on the outcome. Some suggest bets were placed for the first time in Ancient Greece, while others insist there is evidence of similar betting activities even before that."
"The frequency of sports that is bet upon differs with culture. Most of those bets are placed on basketball, baseball, mixed martial arts, boxing and auto racing at both professional and amateur levels."
"In many parts of the United States, sports betting is illegal. It is legal in several other states. They include Iowa, New York, Rhode Island, Colorado and Nevada. In countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden sports betting winnings are not taxed. Other jurisdictions, like Germany, impose taxes on wagering profits, but naturally the percentage varies from one country to another."
Sports betting can be done on several Internet websites or in public.

The Ark.
"As described in the Book of Genesis, Noah and his family kept believing in God in a time when most people were not, like his son Canaan and his wife Naamah. Knowing this was true, God told Noah he was going to flood the world, so he could drown out evil. He told Noah to build a boat called an ""ark"". Noah was to put himself, his family (except his son and his wife because they refused to come aboard the ark), and two (a male and a female) of every kind of animal on it. People laughed at Noah, but they were killed by the flood with his son and his wife. Noah and family stayed on the ark until they reached land. To find land Noah sent out a dove, which returned with an olive branch. After the flood, God made a rainbow as a promise to say that he would never destroy the Earth by flood again. When they were able to walk on dry land, the animals were released and they were able to repopulate the earth."

Cocculus carolinus
"Cocculus carolinus otherwise known as ""Carolina Coralbead"", ""Redberry Moonseed"" or the ""Carolina snailseed"". It is indigenous to several states along the South to Midwest. It gets its name from the bright red color of the marble like berry that protrudes from the leaves of the plant."
Description.
"The Carolina Coralbead is a deciduous, woody vine that can twines along the trunks of several trees or along the ground. It occurs in timberline areas, rocky woods, glades, fence rows and ponds. Carolina Coralbead can grow 10–12 ft (3–3.6 m) and usually spaced within 3–4 ft (90–120 cm) of one another. If ingested in large amounts, the berry on Cocculus carolinus can be poisonous, but the overall toxicity of its berries do not prove to be fatal. In areas in Little Rock, Arkansas, the Carolina Coralbead is referred to as an invasive weed system which seedlings have been spread by birds. Once a root system has been established, it is hard to remove the plant, so planting in new areas has been a point of concern for this plant. The best ornamental features of the plant are its foliage and its attractive red berries in fall. ""Cocculus carolinus"" can grow in temperatures between from -3.8 °C (25 °F) to -28.8 °C (-20 °F). Its leaves are covered in short hairs and should not be confused with the species ""Smilax bona-nox"",which has tendrils and prickles."

Research with Wright will have a poetic development and dialogue in many of his future creations of strong identity. The researches with Wright in an artistically unknown America in Italy will continue for years both in Arizona and in Wisconsin, also comparing themselves with other designers such as Auguste Perret, Richard Neutra in California, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Chicago to then reach his own and totally avant-garde Italian rationalist system upon his return to Italy, although open to different types of contaminations that created a concept of avant-garde design that is unique in the world."

Description.
The house sparrow is small bird. It is between 14–18 centimeters (5.5–7.1 in) long. It weighs between 24–39.5 grams (0.85–1.4 oz). Females are smaller than males.
"Male and female house sparrows are different colors. The male is brown, gray and white. It has a black throat. The female and young house sparrows are brown and dark yellow or cream. They have streaks (stripes) on their heads and wings."
Habitat.
"The house sparrow lives close to humans, often near human houses in towns or cities. It also lives near farms and makes a nest in a bush or small tree. It can have two or three broods per year. This means it has two or three sets of eggs and chicks each year."
"Nest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.p52–57 A sparrow sometimes digs out its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches. More often it uses the nests of other birds, such swallows' nests in banks and cliffs, and old tree nest holes. It often uses deserted nests. Sometimes it takes over active nests by driving away or killing the occupants. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe. This puts the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters so the native bird population declines."
Conservation.
"The number of house sparrows in the United Kingdom has gone down, perhaps because their hedgerow habitat has shrunk. They are now 'endangered' in the United Kingdom. However, in other countries, the bird is still very common. Hedges are necessary to the bird because predators cannot usually get at their nests. They would have no defence against magpies (for example) if face-to-face."
Sparrows in Mao's China.
"Sparrows eat some grain. So Mao decided that sparrows should be eliminated in China. The result was a disastrous famine, with grain yields a fraction of what went before. Apparently no-one knew enough about sparrows. They are major predators of locusts. With few sparrows, locusts thrived and ate much of the wheat. It is difficult in an autocracy to tell leaders they are wrong."
Couch
"A couch, sofa or settee is a kind of furniture that is designed to seat more than one person. It usually has a place to rest your arm on each side. Couches are normally found in the living room or in front of the TV."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, a couch was thought as a long, upward seat for resting on. One end would slope up high enough to provide a place for the head to rest."
"Some late 18th-century kinds of couches had an arm running partly down one side, and this type continued to be made in England. In Greek places, there were flowing designs with all kind of elegant colors. Many of them had scrolled ends and short legs. The couch was later taken over by the overstuffed sofa during the Victorian age."
Expression.
"Because the couch is usually set in front of the TV, it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it. Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time. This person, a person who does not do a lot of physical activity, was called a ""couch potato"". This was also because potatoes do not move at all, and does not do anything but just sits there. This may also be considered as slang. Couch came from the word ""couche"", which means, ""a bed, lair,"" or from the word ""coucher"", which means ""to lie down."""
Types.
"The most common types of couches in homes are the ""love seats"" for two, or the ""sofa"" for more than two. Other couches include the ""divan"" or the ""fainting couch"", which usually does not have a back. Couches are usually bought in a set together with cushions, which give them a bouncey and decorative comfortable touch."

Porridge
"Porridge is a food which is made with a cereal, usually oats. The oats are boiled in water or milk, or both. It is usually served hot in a bowl or dish. Some people add things to their porridge such as sugar or syrup. In Scotland salt is often added."
"Porridge is a traditional food in many countries in Northern Europe. It is usually eaten for breakfast. In some countries barley or other grains may be used. Porridge is cooked in saucepans or in a microwave. Traditionally, it was cooked in large metal kettles over hot coals. Porridge was often served as food for prisoners in prisons. This is why in English there is a slang expression ""doing porridge"" which means ""being in prison"". Porridge is also given to people who are ill because it is healthy and easy to eat and digest."
"Semolina and gruel are foods which are quite similar to porridge. Semolina is usually served as a pudding. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge that may be also drunk and may not need to be cooked. Oliver Twist, in the famous book by Charles Dickens, was given gruel to eat."
Emergency telephone
"An emergency telephone is a special telephone that can be used in an emergency situation. Such telephones can usually be found on highways, and other big roads. They can also be found in places where people feel unsafe, such as big parks or the campuses of universities. Emergency telephones are also placed at spots where many people commit suicide, like bridges or cliffs."
"Emergency phones are usually connected directly, there is no need to dial a telephone number. Lifting the receiver, or pushing a button will make the call. Very often emergency telephones will also tell the other side where they are. This is because people may not know where they are or they may be in shock because of an accident that just happened."
"There are many special rules that apply to emergency telephones. They need to be in special colors, because color-blind people may not be able to tell the difference between certain colors. They also need to be easy to use. In an emergency situation, many people do not have time to think about how to operate them."

The stadium is owned by Clube Atlético Paranaense. Its formal name honors Joaquim Américo Guimarães, a former chairman of Internacional-PR, which was a football club that merged with América-PR. This merger formed Atlético Paranaense. Joaquim Américo Guimarães started the stadium's construction in 1912. Despite being called an arena, it is technically an outdoor stadium. On May 31 2009, the stadium was made one of the match sites for the Brazil 2014 World Cup."
History.
"The stadium was built at the previous location of a Brazilian Army powder depot. In 1934, the stadium was renamed Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães. In the 1970s, the original stadium was closed down. After being reopened in 1984 and operating for some years, the old stadium building was demolished on March 26, 1997, right after a construction project of a new arena was announced. In June 1999, the new stadium was built. In 2005, the stadium was renamed ""Kyocera Arena"", after the Japanese company Kyocera purchased the naming rights."
"The inaugural match of the old stadium was played on September 6, 1914, when Flamengo beat Internacional 7–1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Flamengo's Arnaldo."
"The inaugural match of the new building was played on June 24, 1999, when Atlético Paranaense beat Cerro Porteño of Paraguay 2–1. The first goal of the stadium after its reinauguration was scored by Atlético's Lucas."
"The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 31,740. It was set on December 16, 2001 when Atlético Paranaense beat São Caetano 4–2, on the first game of that year's Brazilian Championship finals."
"The contract with Kyocera that gave the company naming rights expired in early 2008. It was not renewed, and no new partnership was announced. The stadium went back to its old name, ""Arena da Baixada""."

It fed on kelp, and lived in shallow waters around the Bering Sea. Hunted relentlessly for their meat, they died out 27 years after their discovery. The reduction in the kelp supply may also have contributed to their extinction."

Eye colour
"Eye color is a visible character caused by two factors: the pigmentation of the eye's iris, and way light is scattered as it hits the top layer of the iris."
"The human eye is different from its nearest relative, the chimpanzee eye. The eyes of chimps and also gorillas are entirely brown. Humans have the white to their eyes. This difference is thought to be significant. In the apes, individuals do not usually look directly at other members of the family, but all the same they keep a close watch on what is going on with the family group. They tend to look out of the corners of their eyes, as if to keep the glance secret. Perhaps to them a direct look is aggressive. Jane Goodall used to be careful and avoid looking directly at the gorilla families in the bush. She would sit at a distance, appearing to nibble at grass and leaves, while making occasional glances at the gorilla family."
Physical cause.
"In humans, the pigment of the iris varies from light brown to black. This depends on the amount of melanin in the iris. The appearance of blue, green and hazel eyes result from the Rayleigh scattering of light in the iris. A similar process accounts for the blueness of the sky. Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or fluid. Eye colour is an example of structural colour which varies according to the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes."
"The brightly coloured eyes of many birds, reptiles and insects is caused by other pigments, such as pteridines, purines, and carotenoids."
Genetics.
"The view that blue eye colour is a simple recessive trait is incorrect. Two main gene loci code for the eye pigment: ""OCA2"" and ""HERC2"". They sit next to each other on chromosome 15. Mutations (SNPs) to these genes account for much of the variation seen in eye colour. ""OCA2"" mutations close to the 5′ regulatory region explain most human eye-color variation. An intron in ""HERC2"" contains the promoter region for ""OCA2"", affecting its expression."
"There are about 15 other genes which have some effect on eye colour inheritance. This is an effect called epistasis, and is not unusual."
Iris (eye)
"The iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, circular structure in the eye. It controls the diameter and size of the pupils."
"Eye colour is the colour of the iris. In humans, the iris may look green, blue, brown, hazel (a combination of light brown, green and gold), grey, violet, or even pink. In response to the amount of light exiting the eye, muscles attached to the iris expand or contract the pupil. The larger the pupil, the more light can enter the eye and reach the retina."
Iris

A minimum mass that weighs 7,795 pounds (3,536 kg) and at the maximum mass that weighs 15,532 pounds (7,000 kg). It is powered by two Turbomeca Turmo engines driving a helicopter rotor with four blades."
Harp.
"There are seven pedals on a concert harp. Each pedal can be in a high, middle or low position. The strings of the harp can be thought of like the white notes of a piano, tuned to naturals (C,D,E etc.). Each pedal can change one of the letter-named notes one semitone higher or lower. For example: the pedal on the left changes all the Ds to D flat (if the pedal is in the highest position) or D sharp (in the lowest position). From left to right the pedals operate the Ds, Cs, Bs, Es, Fs, Gs and As."
Timpani.
Pedal timpani are timpani with a pedal which will tighten or loosen the drumhead. This will make the note go up or down in pitch. It is a fairly new invention. Composers in the Classical music period never had pedal timpani. Their timpani always had to be tuned by hand using the taps around the side. Composers like Béla Bartók wrote for pedal timpani.
Harpsichord.
Modern harpsichords often have pedals which change the sound in the same way that stops on an organ change the sound. In earlier harpsichords the sound was more often changed by pushing in or pulling out hand stops.
Alcoholism
Alcoholism is addiction to alcohol. People who have alcoholism are called alcoholics.
"Alcoholism is a disease. It often gets worse over time, and can kill a person. However, alcoholism can be treated."
"Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the world. Around the world, there are at least 208 million people with alcoholism."
"Alcoholism is a condition with a social stigma. Because of this, alcoholics often feel ashamed of their drinking. They may try to hide their drinking, avoid getting help, or refuse to believe that they are alcoholics, because they are too ashamed."
Diagnosis.
"Being an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol. It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink. No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking."
"To be diagnosed with alcoholism, a person has to have three of these symptoms in the past year:"
"There is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic. There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person ""may"" be an alcoholic. These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers)."
Alcoholism causes many problems.
Problems in the body.
"Alcoholism can cause many health problems. For example, it can cause:"
"If a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning. This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death."
"In 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world. This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use."
Problems in life.
Alcoholism can also cause many problems in alcoholics' lives. These include:
Alcohol withdrawal.
"If an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal."
"The most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called ""DTs""). Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Many people who get the DTs die from them."
This does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking. It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking. Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking.
Epidemiology.
"In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world. (This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.) In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world. This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics."
Around the world.
People in developed countries drink the most alcohol.p.4
Alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Here is a list of all the areas in the world. It is in order from the areas where alcoholism is most common to the areas where it is least common:p.21

"Duffield Castle, Derbyshire"
"Duffield Castle was a Norman Castle in Duffield, Derbyshire. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument."
"The rocky site was easy to defend, because it was surrounded by the river in three sides and hard to climb. It is not clear whether the site was inhabited in prehistoric times. The Roman army might have been there to protect the ford nearby where people from Lutudarum Wirksworth passed before joining Rykneld Street at Derventio (now part of Derby) which was N-shaped route for the North Sea ports."
"Ancient items of Anglo-Saxons have been found there. They suggest that Saxon Thane named Siward or his relatives might have occupied the site. Also, many Roman or Romano-British pottery has been found, including roof tiles of Roman pattern. Some of them were kept in the Derby Museum, but others kept in the Parish Room were unfortunately lost."
The Norman Castle.
"Henry de Ferrers (Ferrars) faithfully served King William and was given land in Derbyshire, which became known as Duffield Frith. It was between Heage and Shottle on the North, and Tutbury on the South. He built Tutbury Castle as his main residence. He built another castle at Duffield to protect north side of his land. This castle was probably built of wood."
"His third son, Robert, fought the Scots in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, and became the first Earl of Derby."
"His great grandson, William, became the Earl in 1162. He supported King's sons when they resisted Henry II, and finally both castles were destroyed in 1173."
"William II was favored by King John, and took back the land of Wirksworth, Ashbourne, and Horston Castle (Horsley). The castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt with stone. William III was also favored as William II was."
"The next Earl (the 7th generation), Robert, fought against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed. Once the king forgave Robert, but he resisted again and was defeated in battle at Chesterfield. He lost his land in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed. His lands were given to Prince Edmund, who became first Earl of Lancaster shortly later."
"The castle was completely destroyed. Most of the stones were taken away as materials of other buildings, and the place gradually retuned to wild."
Excavations.
"When the site was surveyed, the base of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle was found with a large rock on it. The size of the rock was really remarkable, about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in width, only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London."
"The grounds were saved with definite shape of foundations, and transferred to the National Trust in 1899. For many years, Parish Council was in charge of the site, but recently the role was handed down to the Trust."
"Other surveys in the 1930s and in 1957 verified the residence before the arrival of the Normans, because many Romano‑British items were found."
"A geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001. Traces of other structures to the south and the southeast were found, and they appeared to date from the same period. The Trust is planning to raise necessary funds to carry out further investigations."

Wasted username
A wasted username or wasted account is a user account on a website that was not used very much (or at all) after it was made. A person who makes an account like this is called a namewaster or a name waster.
"This word came from YouTube, where many people would post both funny and hateful comments on namewasters' YouTube channels. This was an Internet phenomenon until 2012, when YouTube deleted a lot of these wasted accounts."
Chain mail
"Mail, or chain mail, is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour. Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest."
Etymology.
"The origins* of the word ""mail"" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word ""macula"", meaning ""spot"" or ""opacity"". Another theory relates the word to the Old French ""maillier"", meaning “to hammer” (related to the modern English word ""malleable""). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders."
History.
"Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC. At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe. The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead. Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship. Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century."
Modern uses.
Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters. Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks. But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors. It is also popular in live action role playing.
Afar Triangle
The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.
"The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia."
Human fossils.
Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans.
"Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna."
Geography.
"The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level."
"The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth."
"The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map."
Plate tectonics.
"The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt."
"More than half of the island has never been cleared of vegetation, and a quarter of it is conserved in National Parks, Conservation Parks, and five Wilderness Protection Areas. The main protected areas are:"
"Because of its isolation from mainland Australia, foxes and rabbits are not there. People are forbidden to bring them into the island. Registration and microchipping of cats is complulsory."
"The Kangaroo Island kangaroo, Rosenberg's sand goanna, southern brown bandicoot, Tammar wallaby, common brushtail possum, short-beaked Echidna and New Zealand fur seal are native to the island, as well as six bat and frog species. The sole endemic (found nowhere else) vertebrate species is a small marsupial carnivore called the Kangaroo Island dunnart. The koala, common ringtail possum and ""Platypus"" have been introduced and still survive there. Kangaroo Island had a native species of emu, the Kangaroo Island emu which became extinct between 1802 and official European settlement in 1836. Perhaps this was caused by bushfires or hunting by sealers or whalers."
"The introduced koalas have flourished so well on the island that their preferred food source, the manna gum tree, is at risk of local extinction. Koalas have recently been forced to turn to other, less tasty, plants. Park Management has been searching for a solution."
Tourism.
The island is a major tourist attraction.

I like classical
Uh-huh.
"um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway."

"It's just a half hour,"
or is it hour?
"Well, half hour."
Oh.
"That, that's all there is to it."

Uh-huh.
"and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,"
but I didn't really see that in there.
"But what I've read about it, they talk about that."
"But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,"
"and, and, uh, I guess mostly I, I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY, TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if I can do it,"
"Yeah,"
"Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus."

"And, uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it."
"On our, uh, public television, they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show."
Uh-huh.
"And it showed the latest, uh, developments from all the computer companies."
"Uh-huh,"
I've never seen that program.
"Well, you know, it's,"
"unless you're really into computers, you and software, you probably wouldn't be interested,"
Uh-huh.
"but I don't know,"
Uh-huh.
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there.
Oh.
"And, uh, you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, you know, and then they also, the hardware."
Oh.
Uh-huh.
So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
"and, I enjoyed that."
Uh-huh.
It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials.
"Oh, okay."
"It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show"
"Do you hear, the, the beep in the background."
Yes.
"Oh, that's a, an ambulance or something going on here, I think."
Okay.
"Where, Where are you,"
I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually.
"and, uh,"
In Manhattan.
Are you at home now?
"Yeah,"
I'm at home.
So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.
Uh-huh.
"So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear."
So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up.
"Um, yeah,"
"and often times that,"
"I can't talk on can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call."

Um?
"I said, I wonder why."
"Oh, it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it."
Cafeteria?
Yeah.
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it
Maybe
so. Let's see what else can we do?
"Changes,"
I'll tell you what we could do.
What?
"We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired"
Uh-huh.
"Because you know,"
"You mean, like for health insurance?"
"Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company."
"See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job."
Yeah.
Okay.
"Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find a place to put them or you know, boot them out."
"Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, uh, school teaching."
"Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid."
Thank you
What?
"I said, thank you."
"if you're cutting,"
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for for set up?
"Uh, tools for set up and for measurement."
"Uh, you got to have a one tenth indicator,"

"five tenths uh, usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each. Uh,"
Huh.
five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars.
"You got to have, uh, six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars."
"You got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars. Uh,"
one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars.
A two to three for eighty dollars.
A three to four for eighty dollars.
So you've got thousands of dollars or so.
I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools.
Real fast.
Yes.
"Real, real fast."
Edge finders and ...
"But I was thinking about though that, that when you actually get to the milling equipment though, when it starts turning ..."
"Well, I know,"
"because, okay."
Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches.
Yeah.
You know.
"But you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real simple thing, like gee,"
I need a hole there.
What size hole?
Yeah.
"As in metric size hole or a, or an American sized hole?"
Yeah.
"And, and what, but the thing is then you've got to with screws"
"and we have a lot of, uh,"
"the county I am, I'm in, the minorities are mostly Hispanic."

Probably quite a few black people up there
"and and,"
No
"We're from a county, we're from the county they marched in."
We're in Forsyth county
"Oh, is that right?"
"yes,"
"and we,"
"and there's very, very few blacks."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, so, so that's, uh,"
"I, I hate to say, uh,"
"it's not a problem, uh, because I hate to feel like they are a problem, although they are."
Yeah
"but, you know, it, it's,"
"you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever,"
but then again.
"But it is a problem  Uh, especially in the inner schools, inner city."
"Yeah,"
"there is no denying that, that,"
"Sure, you know."
"Teachers, you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school."
"Well,"
and you can't put all the children in special education.
"That's right,"
you can't do that.
"Uh, and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know."
Right.
"See, I grew up in Nebraska"
and then he goes home
"and, and, uh, you know, in the, in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or, or something like that,"
Right.
or they don't care.
"You know, mamma, guess what I did in school today,"
"well who cares, you know."
"An a lot of it, a lot of the parents now are so young."
True.
"You know, that they're, they still, they still don't know what's going on"
"and how are they supposed to, you know, teach their kids that are coming up, you know, what's going on."
"I mean it's just, it's a vicious cycle, that we're, you know, dead, smack dead in the center of"
Yeah.
and we have to try to swim out.
"You know, kind of like the Bermuda Triangle,"
we're just sinking
and it's almost impossible to swim back up.
Yeah.
"But, um, yeah,"
"there's definitely problems,"
Yeah
"I'm,"
"its just the solutions that, you know, they're going to be in our political system,"
"they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while, too long."
"I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with, uh, oh, especially Asian, Japanese families coming,"
"here in Plano we've got, uh, quite a few."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Uh, engineering types, people who have come from Japan,"
Right.
and they put their kids in the U S schools
and they're appalled.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I have a son that is in the fourth grade"
Huh.
"and, uh, they have just now taken up division."
Wow.
Yeah
And
That is slow.
"uh,"
my husband and I go to the store
"and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication, division things"
"and I feel like, uh, there are several areas that we're just really, really slow in."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system."
"It is,"
What do you think's wrong to cause that?
"Well, well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system."
"And the money they do have, they're not, they do not use it wisely."
Yeah.
"Uh, she, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students."
Uh-huh.
And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal  with on an every day basis. Uh
Yeah.
Perhaps.
"but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children."
Yeah.
"And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It  it, you know, it can, it can really be bad."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's one thing I worry about ."
"Uh, also I think, we have a lot of, uh, Hispanics"
"There you go,"
uh-huh.
"I said I don't know,"
I'll have to try it and see.
I've always watched it.
Uh-huh.
"And he said, well, fine,"
"he said, we'll just take you over to the course, he lives near Brookhaven we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it."
Uh-huh
"If you do, then we can go golf together."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, whoa,"
"great,"
I get to walk all around a little green field all day.
"But those kinds of things happen, though,"
"you, you get a little taste of it"
"and you say, Hey, this is not bad."
Uh-huh.
And you really begin to develop an interest in it.
But I am not an athlete at all.
Me either.
"You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball, and, hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball."
So I am not an athlete.
Maybe golf is a forgiving sport.
I don't know.
Yeah
"at least you're just you're competing against yourself, I guess, more than everybody else out there."
It doesn't appear to be
Uh-huh.
"I really, I, I haven't really acquired an interest in it,"
"but I'm open to try anything, you know."
Yeah
"that's, kind of the way I feel."
"The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair"
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"he's,"
"anyway, and that was just excessively violent."
I was worried
"Yeah,"
isn't it amazing.
"it's like golly,"
"if kids start imitating that they'll knock each others blocks off,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it was all bloodless
Uh-huh.
and the good guys can get hit all day long
Uh-huh.
and they have to shake it off
Yeah.
"they don't, they don't, you know, get, uh, epileptics, that sort of thing from getting hit on their head"
Right.
"you know, it's a little disturbing the violence in these films,"
"partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book on the other hand it makes it seem like,"
Uh-huh.
"I read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies, don't have very realistic upsets of the violence."
"The violence can seem very realistic,"
but the aftermath is usually not there.
Right.
"So you see people who are severely injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions"
Uh-huh.
"they thrash around,"
"they scream, you know, uh,"
"it's just a very, very bad thing,"
"and they never present that,"
"Well, uh, normally I like to, to go out fishing in a boat, and, uh, rather than like bank fishing, and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish, that, uh, I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing."
"So, you like fresh water."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I've never tried like with, deep, uh, sea water fishing because you get, I get sea sick"
Uh-huh.
Oh I see
"Well, one of these days, I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine,"
"so I can go out and go, uh, deep sea fishing."
"Now, that would be nice."
"Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast, in the summers,"
Uh-huh.
and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast
Uh-huh.
"and so, I thought fish came out of the ocean"
"Oh, my goodness."
and anything that was fresh water was muddy
Uh-huh.
so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties
"so I had, I had always been a, a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun."
Uh-huh.
Oh I bet it is.
There's so many different ways to catch fish.
Uh-huh.
"You know, at night you can go walking in the shallows, and gig flounder and things like that."
"Which isn't technically fishing,"
but it's a lot of fun.
Uh-huh.
"So, I, I grew up fishing."
Uh-huh.
What area of lakes do you like?
"Well, uh, now, I haven't done much fishing here in Texas, uh, because I moved from Ohio,"
Yeah.
Yeah
"I know a lot of companies that waste so much that,"
"I'm even trying,"
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster
Yes.
"and I thought, I don't understand this, you know."
Yeah.
"We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and, and recycle and all that stuff"
"and, and here we are wasting."
"And I don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it."
"Well the last time, uh, someone moved offices in my building"
"and, uh, the, uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes."
"Not the cheap ones of course. And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around,"
Uh-huh.
"I, I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon"
and they're good boxes.
That's exactly what I did.
And they were just going to throw them away.
"Exactly what I did, exactly."
Yeah.
Because I didn't want to waste that.
Huh-uh.
And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes .
Right
"and, and these boxes are,"
you can unfold them.
Right.
"So, you know, there, they don't take up much storage space."
"Exactly right,"
well that's very good
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
"And the more you use them, the more they send them to you."
"But each of these had an annual fee also, right."
Exactly.
"The American Express was probably the worst, um, because with the Gold card,"
I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up
Uh-huh.
"but I know the Green card was like thirty-five, five dollars a year."
"Yeah,"
forty five.
"Right, uh,"
"I,"
"Which was a lot,"
"because I mean, you had to pay it in full every month."
"Exactly, you know,"
"I, that's it,"
"I really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,"
"so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free."
Uh-huh.
"And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and one Visa,"
"and here, most of the stores will accept those,"
and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had a Discover,"
"and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, um, closing."
"Um, it really wasn't my choice, though."
"I mean, I ended up having, I ended up actually losing my credit cards."
Oh.
"Um, I ended up going through a credit counseling service um, because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake."
"Oh, my gosh."
So we really had a lot of rain.
"Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,"
"there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano"
Right.
"and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,"
"and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,"
"but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess."
It just
"Yeah,"
we had a lot of flash floods in the area.
"We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few."
Uh-huh.
Not more than ten
"but,"
"That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much."
"Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,"
"it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy"
"Yeah,"
"well, it's, uh, interesting,"
"uh,"
I'm going down to El Paso next week
"and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,"
"but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,"
"Well, El Paso won't be cold."
"It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?"
"No,"
"it's, it's, quite southern"
"and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso."
Uh-huh.
"The, uh, you'll be flying in there?"
I was just thinking
"I wonder, I wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis."
"I really,"
"From what I understand, it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana."
"And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the,"
"what is it,"
it's based on common law
and the rest of the country is not or something like that.
Yeah.
Pretty strange.
"But, uh, fortunately I never have had to go in even, even for jury duty."
"Yeah,"
"I haven't either other than,"
"But, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for, uh, as a witness."
He may subpoena me.
So we'll see what happens.
"But, uh,"
I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. .
Yeah.
"It's,"
"there are too many big problems, you know."
"There's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now. You know, to try to get them all in in a good time"
I know.
and we already have too many lawyers as it is.
Yeah.
"And if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"And, in fact, they're even letting some go."
Yeah.
"I, I, I'm originally from Florida"
"and, uh, if I catch him I call him"
and he comes back.
"So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things."
Um.
Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own
No
we never did.
"and,"
"I, I trained him on my own"
"and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult."
Uh-huh.
"We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,"
"but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,"
"so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,"
"but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well."
I never really to hit him or anything.
Uh-huh.
"Just, you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things."
Huh.
Really?
"I, I see other people out there"
"and they hit their dogs and try to,"
"and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing,"
"least I,"
Invisible what?
"Invisible fencing,"
have you heard of that?
"No,"
what is that?
"It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter"
Oh.
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
"Of course, uh, being a woman most of these things were done by the men."
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, so I wasn't directly involved"
"but, uh, they really were helpful, I know, to our house."
"It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it"
Yeah
Yes
That's awful.
"Um, Howard and I were talking about home repair the other night and, uh, in connection with scouting."
We've got a scout coming up
"and, uh, uh, I think it's neat for young people to learn how to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing faucets, dripping faucets,  and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that."
Huh-uh.
"As a matter of fact, one thing, I have a young son"
"and one thing we did, was we had paneling on the inside of our, uh, front of our house, or the hall way of our house, rather,"
"and we were repainting the, the front room in the hall there,"
and we took down that paneling
and he helped me
"and, and, uh, he was, it was fun to work with him. And, uh, and, uh, help putty up the holes together and, and do things,  like that."
Huh-uh.
"How does the paneling,"
"it looks lots better than,"
do you like it better?
"Oh, I like it so much better."
It makes it so much lighter.
Yeah.
"You know, it really does."
"You know, and people that have been to my house before and then now really have liked,  much better, too."
Huh-uh.
That's nice.
It's been fun.
"Nice to have it come out positive and look,  look good."
Yeah.
"So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
That's another thing.
You have to go to different places to do that.
Right.
"So it's, so that's nice."
"It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up"
"and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,"
"but, uh, uh, it didn't go through."
Uh-huh.
"But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh,"
"I don't know,"
it just doesn't make sense to me.
Right.
"I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, so I guess that's one option."
Yeah.
"That's good,"
that's good.
I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.
"Like, uh"
Uh-huh.
"have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?"
Huh.
No.
"Yeah,"
"I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,"
you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
Okay.
"Um, well I guess first of all I, I could have asked that before."
Do you have children?
No.
No.
Okay.
"Because I, I didn't know if that would make a difference  in how you felt."
Yeah.
"Um, what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two,"
I think it's a good idea.
"I think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves."
Yeah.
"I think it's, uh,"
"would everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about."
"I just, um,"
"I guess that's my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in,"
"and, uh, I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um"
Did you?
something Oh!
"and, and I agree with what you said that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it  so much I don't think they realize"
Uh-huh.
"and I, uh, I, I think it gives you a better perspective, on life"
"and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world"
"and  and it would certainly help the country, too, uh."
Yeah.
Really
"Yeah,"
"I think that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used to  go through, you know,"
Yeah.
"they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do."
Yes.
Yeah.
"and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, I believe."
"Oh, gosh."
"Yeah,"
"Lyndon LaRouche, that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected."
Uh-huh.
"Next thing you know, you've got him."
Right.
"If you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together."
Yeah.
"You know, I like what he says,"
and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
"Right, yeah."
"And, uh, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?"
Yeah.
Right.
That's what I thought.
"Yeah,"
he sure did.
"And, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know."
He might do a good job.
Yeah.
"I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long"
"Oh, yeah."
I think that discourages a lot of people.
"What we do, usually, is, uh, vote, uh, absenteeism"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, I know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason,"
Yeah.
"yeah,"
seven yards of sand.
"I got to shovel it all, lots of fun."
"Yeah,"
"I have to do that,"
"I want to make some flower beds,"
and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.
Uh-huh.
"And I'm going to,"
my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter
Sure.
"but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something, you know, if I want to grow a tomato or something in there"
Right.
"Well, it seems,"
"I mean, I guess it'd go with my flowers."
"I've seen a lot of people use them, you know, for flower beds,"
"but I don't know what, whether they'd have creosote would do anything,"
"I mean,"
"Yeah,"
"I don't, I don't, I just don't think you,"
I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird
Uh-huh.
but I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering.
And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated.
"Well, you can get, um, you can get pressurized lumber,"
"Yeah,"
"but they put, some kind of chemicals in there too."
"Oh, that's right."
"there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too."
Yeah.
"Well, I'm not really worried about it,"
you can just go and vote
Right.
"and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks,"
the hours are good
and they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays.
Uh-huh.
"And so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, it's, uh, the lines are long."
"Yeah,"
"I'm in Dallas,"
and they're long here too.
"So, uh, but, uh,"
"Yeah,"
I voted absentee one year.
I really was going to be gone.
"So, I did it,"
"but, uh, it was nice."
I would be tempted to do it again.
"Well, uh, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line"
Right.
"and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day."
Yeah.
I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
"Um, yeah,"
"I've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the Republican party."
"And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots,"
"but, uh, my mind has gone blank."
"I've been all evening How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for"
"Uh-huh,"
"you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on,"
"There is no official Triple Crown for these Melbourne races, but racing fans consider these three Group 1 races to be the major interconnected component of the spring carnival package, while also acknowledging that only a superhorse could win them all in the same season to complete a . Only one horse has ever managed this feat, the great New Zealand galloper Rising Fast, in 1954. More recently, popular Might and Power won all three races, though not in the same year."
"The ""Spring Grand Slam"" in Melbourne is considered by some in the racing industry to be more difficult to win than the famous Triple Crown in the United States because the Australian races contain many more variables."
"The Triple Crown — involving the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes — is contested only by three-year-olds who race over distances between 1910 metres (Preakness) and 2400 metres (Belmont). The horses all carry the same weight (fillies a little less than colts and geldings), and none of the horses are being asked to race around the track in an unaccustomed direction."
"In Melbourne, the races are open to all horses aged three and over, and they race between 2,040 metres (Cox Plate) and 3,200 metres (Melbourne Cup)."
"The weight carried by horses can vary immensely, both in each race and from race to race, because three different handicapping systems are employed. The Caulfield Cup is a handicap race, the Cox Plate is a weight-for-age race, and the Melbourne Cup is a combination of both, a weight-for-age-handicap."
"Furthermore, in the U.S., horses race counter-clockwise on all tracks, but in Australia and New Zealand, there are both clockwise and counter-clockwise tracks. All ""Spring Grand Slam"" races in Melbourne are raced counter-clockwise, so horses domiciled in areas with predominantly clockwise tracks can be disoriented and not perform to potential."

= = = Rule of 78s = = =
"Also known as the sum-of-the-digits method, the Rule of 78s is a term used in lending that refers to a method of yearly interest calculation. The name comes from the total number of months' interest that is being calculated in a year (the first month is 1 month's interest, whereas the second month contains 2 months' interest, etc.). This is an accurate interest model only based on the assumption that the borrower pays only the amount due each month. If the borrower pays off the loan early, this method maximizes the amount paid (interest paid) by applying funds to interest before principal. In other words, in comparison to a simple interest loan, a rule of 78s loan will charge more interest if the loan is paid early."
"A simple fraction (as with 12/78) consists of a numerator (the top number, 12 in the example) and a denominator (the bottom number, 78 in the example). The denominator of a Rule of 78 loan is the sum of the digits, the sum of the number of monthly payments in the loan. For a twelve-month loan, the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is 78 (1 + 2 + 3 + . . . +12 = 78). For a 24-month loan, the denominator is 300. The sum of the numbers from 1 to n is given by the equation n * (n+1) / 2. If n were 24, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 24 is 24 * (24+1) / 2 = 12 x 25 = 300, which is the loan's denominator, D."
"For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of the finance charge, 11/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the second month's portion of the finance charge and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the finance charge is assessed as that month's portion of the finance charge. Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of a 24-month precomputed loan."
Formula for calculating the unearned interest:
formula_1
"where formula_2 is the unearned interest, formula_3 is the total agreed finance charges, formula_4 is the number of months paying off early, formula_5 is the total term of loan in months"
"The earliest official use of the Rule of 78s to calculate the unearned portion of a loan's finance charge was in Indiana in 1935. Most loans in 1935 were for small amounts at low interest rates for short periods of time. It reduced the cost of loan calculations in a pre-computer era and was well suited for the small, short, and low interest rate loans of the era."
"In the United States, the use of the Rule of 78s is prohibited in connection with mortgage refinancings and other consumer loans having a term exceeding 61 months."
"On March 15, 2001, in the U.S. 107th Congress, U.S. Rep. John LaFalce (D-NY 29), introduced H.R. 1054, a bill to eliminate the use of the Rule of 78s in credit transactions. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services on the same day. On April 10, 2001, the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, where it died with no further action taken."
"In the UK, as part of the Consumer Credit Act of 2005, the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1483) which does away with the Rule of 78 in consumer credit lending was issued and brought into effect on 31 May 2005."
"The Rule of 78s deals with precomputed loans, which are loans whose finance charge is calculated before the loan is made. Finance charge, carrying charges, interest costs, or whatever the cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the finance charge has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the finance charge to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the finance charge as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed finance charge is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal."
"A simple explanation would be as follows: suppose that the total finance charge for a 12-month loan was $78.00. That figure is representative of the sum of digits by adding the numbers together, i.e., 12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 = 78. If a person repaid a consumer loan after 3 months, the financial institution would refund the sum of the ""remaining"" digits...(i.e. 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 or $45.00. In essence, they would retain the first three (3) numbers...12,11,10 or $33.00. Thus the consumer would not receive as much of a refund if it were divided equally by 12 months ($6.50 per month). Under this scenario they would have received a refund of $58.50, which is more beneficial than the $45.00 refund."

"Our peacemakers and planners must be supported by camps all over the globe, where youth, recruited from every town and village all over the globe, serves. This service must implement the global organization as the young must experience what the old are planning before the old can have any authority."
"Among those who had joined the short-lived work at ""Camp William James"" was a Dartmouth student, Page Smith, who later became an important American historian at the University of California, Santa Cruz. While on the faculty at UCLA, in 1962, Smith wrote a letter to Hubert Humphrey proposing an international version of the ""Camp William James"" experiment in the ""moral equivalent of war"". Humphrey passed along the idea to the US President, John F. Kennedy, and by 1963, the Peace Corps was created."

Zan Arbor, who has been conducting experiments in an attempt to break the Force into its constituent parts, is holding captive Qui-Gon Jinn and the elderly Jedi Master Noor R'aya. The three rescuers attempt to smuggle themselves into the laboratory; however, despite the fact that Qui-Gon has managed to free himself, Zan Arbor escapes with the unconscious Noor."
"Later, Obi-Wan receives a message informing him that his companion Astri Oddo, who went to pursue the bounty hunter Ona Nobis, is injured on the planet of Sorrus. Qui-Gon and Adi send their Padawans to Sorrus to bring Astri home, but Obi-Wan learns that this was merely a trap set by Ona Nobis, and wisely chooses to run away from a fight. He and Siri are ordered to return to the Jedi Temple, but he convinces Siri that they should look for Astri since she's on Sorrus. They are transported to the far desert and investigate a cave where they find Astri and her three companions tied up. However, the cave collapses — another trap set by Ona Nobis. The party are eventually rescued by a member of a tribe that Astri once helped. The two Padawans learn that Ona Nobis is headed to Belasco, the homeworld of Senator Uta S'orn, Jenna Zan Arbor's only friend."
"On Belasco, the Jedi discover that the population is suffering unusually severely from bacteria that recur in the drinking supply every seven years. They find Senator S'orn caring for sick children, but she wants nothing to do with the Jedi. Eventually, they discover that S'orn has altered Galactic Senate transcripts for Zan Arbor, and that Zan Arbor is likely on the planet. Suspecting that Zan Arbor has bioengineered the bacteria in order to make a profit selling a cure, the four Jedi infiltrate the water purification plant, obtaining dated water samples as evidence."
"Obi-Wan and Siri then follow Uta S'orn as she delivers dinner to patients at the royal grounds, in the hope that she will lead them to the hiding place of Zan Arbor and Ona Nobis. After seeing Ona Nobis eat dinner, they report back to their Masters, who confront the Leader of Belasco and ask that S'orn's quarters be searched. There, the Jedi find Jenna Zan Arbor, along with the captive Noor R'aya. Zan Arbor is quickly captured, but Obi-Wan notices that Siri has left the room, and he goes to search for her. He finds her cornered by Ona Nobis on the palace roof, and the two Padawans manage to hold off the wily bounty hunter. Ona Nobis then tries to escape, but she falls to her death when Siri slashes through her whip."
= = = Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy = = =
"The Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy was a large, wide-bodied cargo aircraft built in the United States and used for ferrying outsized cargo items, most notably NASA's components of the Apollo program. The Pregnant Guppy was the first of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines. The design inspired other later designs, such as the jet-powered Airbus Beluga and Boeing Dreamlifter."
"In 1960, U.S. airlines were disposing of their obsolete piston-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruisers in favor of the newer jet-engined airliners. NASA was finding that barge transport of their increasingly large space program components from manufacturers on the West Coast to test and launch sites on the East Coast was slow and expensive. Aircraft broker Leo Mansdorf was stockpiling surplus Stratocruisers at Van Nuys prior to resale, and ex-USAF pilot John M. Conroy realized the potential of these aircraft to transport the large but relatively light rocket components."
"Conroy presented his plans for an extensively modified Stratocruiser to NASA, where an official commented that the bloated aircraft resembled a pregnant guppy. Although NASA was lukewarm on the concept, Conroy mortgaged his house and founded Aero Spacelines International to build and operate the concept aircraft."
"Conversion work was undertaken by On Mark Engineering. The Pregnant Guppy (registered N1024V) was built from an ex-Pan Am airframe with a five-m section from an ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft (G-AKGJ) added immediately behind the wing. The wing, engines, tail, nose, and cockpit were unchanged, but a new upper fuselage of 6 m diameter was added, giving the aircraft a ""triple-bubble"" appearance in front view. The entire rear section (including tail surfaces) was detachable to allow cargo to be loaded directly into the fuselage."
"The aircraft first flew on September 19, 1962, piloted by Conroy and co-pilot Clay Lacy. When Van Nuys traffic control realized that Conroy intended to take off, they notified police and fire departments to be on alert. However, the huge aircraft performed flawlessly, the only difference in handling being a slight decrease in speed caused by extra drag of the larger fuselage."
"Carrying the S-IV Saturn I rocket stage, the Guppy saved three weeks' transit time versus barge, for a cost of $16.00 (equivalent to $ today) per mile ()."
"In the summer of 1963, the Pregnant Guppy began flying NASA cargo. Among its early duties was transporting the first and second stages of the Gemini program's Titan II from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, to Cape Canaveral. As the space program grew through the late 1960s, this one aircraft clearly could not handle the whole transport load, so 25 more Stratocruisers and ex-USAF C-97s were purchased to construct four Super Guppy aircraft, which were even longer and larger than the original."
"The various Guppy aircraft served throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond, initially transporting space components, and later, as NASA scaled down its operations after the success of the Apollo program, transporting airliner sections."
The Pregnant Guppy was sold to American Jet Industries and registered N126AJ for scrap and it was finally scrapped at Van Nuys in 1979.

"The Armenian Native Faith, also termed Armenian Neopaganism or Hetanism (Armenian: Հեթանոսութիւն ""Hetanosutiwn""; a cognate word of ""Heathenism""), is a modern Pagan new religious movement that harkens back to the historical, pre-Christian belief systems and ethnic religions of the Armenians. The followers of the movement call themselves ""Hetans"" (Armenian: հեթանոս ""Hetanos"", which means ""Heathen"", thus ""ethnic"", both of them being loanwords from the Greek ""ἔθνος"", ""ethnos"") or ""Arordi"", meaning the ""Children of Ari"", also rendered as ""Arordiners"" in some scholarly publications."
"The Arordiner movement has antecedents in the early 20th century, with the doctrine of ""Tseghakron"" (Ցեղակրօն, literally ""national religion"") of the philosopher and nationalist political theorist Garegin Nzhdeh. It took an institutional form in 1991, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union in a climate of national reawakening, when the Armenologist Slak Kakosyan founded the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (""Arordineri Ukht""). Neopaganism expert Victor Schnirelmann estimated the following of Armenian neopaganism to be ""no more than a few hundred people""."
"The first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (or ""Ara""; ""Arordineri Ukht"" in Armenian) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard, or Edik) Kakosyan (1936–2005). He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from Soviet Armenia; in 1979 he fled to the United States where he became familiar with the ideas of Garegin Nzhdeh (1886–1955)."
"Nzhdeh was a philosopher, statesman and ""fedayi"" of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of Armenia, and is still one of the driving forces of Armenian nationalism. Kakosyan praised him as the ""prophet of the Armenians"". Nzhdeh founded a movement named ""Tseghakron"" (""religion of the nation""), which was among the core doctrines of the Armenian Youth Federation. In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as Atlas upholding the ordered world, and it makes reference to Hayk, the mythical patriarch of the Armenians, and to Vahagn, the solar and warrior god ""fighter of the serpent"", as means through which to awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide of 1915."

"The great dodecahemicosacron is the dual of the great dodecahemicosahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the small dodecahemicosacron."
"Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called ""stellation to infinity"". However, he also suggested that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions."
The great dodecahemicosahedron can be seen as having ten vertices at infinity.
= = = Pagri = = =
"Pagri or Phari (; ) is a town in Yadong County in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China near the border with Bhutan. the town had a population of 2,121. It is one of the highest towns in the world, being about above sea-level at the head of the Chumbi Valley."
"Thomas Manning, the first Englishman to reach Lhasa, visited Pagri from 21September until 5November 1811 and had this to say about his room in the town: ""Dirt, dirt, grease, smoke. Misery, but good mutton."" Pagri was of some military importance in the early 20th century when it was occupied by the British Tibet Expedition under Francis Younghusband in 1904. The Pagri Fortress (""Dzong"") was located here and was important for the government as it stood between Tibet and Bhutan. Pagri was a staging area en route to Gyantse and ultimately Lhasa."
"During the summer of 1912, the 13th Dalai Lama met Agvan Dorzhiev at Phari Dzong and then accompanied him to the Samding Monastery, before returning to Lhasa after his exile in India."
"Thubten Ngodup, the current Nechung Oracle, was born in Phari in 1957."
"The houses are mostly made of Tibetan traditional stone and wood. The Pagri Valley lies in an alpine steppe zone on the south side, with an average annual temperature , and an extreme maximum temperature of . Annual precipitation is about , snow and ice melt forming rich water resources, shrubs and meadows development, a good place for the development of animal husbandry. Pagri is rich in minerals, wild animals, plants, and tourism resources. It is also a trading centre but due to geographical location is prone to natural disasters. Summer flash floods, mudslides, winter avalanches, snowstorms, etc. are common, and poor facilities makes it vulnerable to disaster. During the rainy season, water levels rise causing serious flooding, reducing soil quality and arable land every year, damaging the ecological environment and a threat to the inhabitants of Pagri. To the northeast of Pagri is Mount Jomolhari."
"Owing to its extreme altitude, Pagri has an alpine climate (Köppen ""ETH"") that is too cold to permit the growth of trees, even though the altitude is still marginally too low for the formation of permafrost. Example Mount Fuji in Japan, Uelen in Russia and Longyearbyen in Svalbard Norway. The winter is severe in spite of the fact that no month has daytime maxima below , and also very dry and long, extending as late as May. Snowfall, however, is rare because of the dryness. Summers, during which the great majority of precipitation occurs, are cool even at their warmest and consistently damp, even though the Himalayas prevent falls from ever being heavy."
= = = Great icosihemidodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the great icosihemidodecahedron (or great icosahemidodecahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 6 decagrammic faces passing through the model center.
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the great icosidodecahedron (having the triangular faces in common), and with the great dodecahemidodecahedron (having the decagrammic faces in common)."
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

There was a succession crisis after the premature death of Asclettin and Guaimar IV of Salerno, as suzerain of Aversa, tried to impose his candidate on the Normans, but they elected Trincanocte and he prevailed in getting Guaimar's recognition too. In 1047, he was present at a council with Pandulf IV of Capua and Guaimar, where the former was returned to his princely position and the latter's great domain was broken up. The feudal titles of Rainulf and Drogo of Hauteville, count of Apulia, were confirmed by the Emperor Henry III and they were made his direct vassals. Within a year, Trincanocte died and was succeeded by his infant son Herman under the regency of his cousin Richard, whom he had originally spurned, believing him to be a dangerous rival. Soon, Herman was displaced (or worse) and Richard was count."

"Mark Major (born March 20, 1970 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger. He was drafted 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League's 1988 entry draft. Major acquired many penalty minutes over his career due to his playing style, which involved battling in front of the net for loose pucks, scoring garbage goals, and blocking the goaltenders view. Major only played in two NHL games, for the Detroit Red Wings. He also enjoyed a short career as a professional roller hockey player in Roller Hockey International (RHI). Taking into account all of his hockey games played at a professional level, Major played in 1,339 games and acquired 4,334 penalty minutes, giving Major an average of 3.24 penalty minutes per game during his career. After 4 seasons and 2 Championships as Head Coach of the Amherstview Jets Junior A team, Major is taking a year off to help coach his daughter's Kingston Ice Wolves' Peewee AA team."
"Major started receiving attention from NHL scouts while playing for the Don Mills Flyers of the MTHL in 1986. He advanced to the North Bay Centennials of the Ontario Hockey League for the 1987–88 season and put up 33 points in 57 games to go along with a whopping 272 penalty minutes (PIM). Major averaged almost 5 penalty minutes a game, but his hard-nosed style was admired by NHL scouts and Major was selected 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1988 NHL Draft. Now as an NHL prospect, Major gained confidence and began the 1988–89 season again with the Centennials before being traded 11 games in to the Kingston Raiders. He would remain in Kingston for that season and the next (when they were renamed the Kingston Frontenacs), scoring 112 points and 361 PIMs, before moving up to the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League. Major remained with the Lumberjacks for three seasons, scoring 77 points and 617 PIMs. He led the team in penalties during the 1991–92 season with 302 and would add another 29 PIMs in the Lumberjacks' playoff run which saw them lose four games to none in the finals to the Kansas City Blades. After his last season with the Lumberjacks, that included a relocation to Cleveland, Major was let go by the parent club Pittsburgh and quickly signed as a free agent by the Boston Bruins on July 22, 1993."
"Major started play with Boston's affiliate the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League. He scored 26 points along with 176 PIMs during the 1993–94 season, but Providence failed to make the playoffs. He was let go by the Bruins, and joined the Detroit Vipers of the IHL for the following season. He continued to play aggressively, with his 36 points and 229 PIMs helping push the Vipers into the playoffs, but his play couldn't help them past the second round."
"Major again caught the attention of an NHL team, when the Detroit Red Wings signed him as a free agent on June 26, 1995. He began play for the Adirondack Red Wings of the AHL in the 1995–96 season and scored 29 points while racking up 234 PIMs for second on the team. He was known as a player who wouldn't back down from a fight, and he was involved in several fights during Adirondack's short playoff run that season, receiving 21 PIMs in just three games."
"Major finally received his first shot in the big leagues during the 1996–97 NHL season when he was brought up from Adirondack for two games starting on November 2, 1996. In his very first game, halfway though the second period, Major fought veteran instigator Tie Domi of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Major held his own against Domi but was rewarded with a bloody nose and a five-minute major. Major played the following night and failed to impress the Detroit staff, which resulted in him being sent back down to the minors. Finishing the season with Adirondack, and leading the team in PIMs with 213, Major was let go by Detroit."
"Major still had NHL interest and was quickly signed as a free agent on August 20, 1997 by the Washington Capitals. He started out in their farm system playing for the Portland Pirates of the AHL. In his first season, Major was first on his team and second in the league for penalty minutes with 355. This was his career high for PIMs in a season and as of 2007, he still holds the team record for penalty minutes in a single season. Major wasn't finished with 355 and added 52 more PIMs in 10 playoff games that year. The following season he again led the team in PIMs and saw his point production decrease to only nine points in 66 games. He was let go by Washington and began play for the Houston Aeros of the IHL in 1999. After just 20 games (with 81 PIMs), Major was signed as a free agent by the Flint Generals of the United Hockey League. He was named team captain and finished out the 1999–00 season with the Generals scoring 41 points, his highest point total in years, and helped the team win the Colonial Cup. He put up great numbers the following season when he finished with 46 points and 163 PIMs. Generals coach Billy Thurlow had this to say about Major's style of play:"
"Anytime he's on the ice, people have to respect us. Nobody's going to shove us around."
"He would also go on to join the AHL's Hershey Bears for two games in the 2000–01 season. In 2001, he joined the Wheeling Nailers of the East Coast Hockey League and would go on to score 84 points in two seasons with the Nailers. The coach, John Brophy, had this to say about Major returning for his second season in Wheeling:"
"We are very fortunate to have Mark return to the Nailers, not only are we getting a great player and a natural team leader, but a guy who is good in the community and represents the Nailers and Penguins organizations with class."
"The 2003–04 season would be Major's last, playing in 40 games for the Laval Chiefs of the QSMHL and 12 games for the Kalamazoo Wings of the UHL."
"Major was also an active member in the Roller Hockey International League for its entire lifespan. Major played on the Buffalo Stampede in 1994 and 1995, winning the Murphy Cup in 1994. He joined the Empire State Cobras in 1996 and the New Jersey Rockin' Rollers in 1997. When the RHI folded in 1997, Major continued playing with the Buffalo Wings of Major League Roller Hockey in 1998 and joined the newly re-formed Roller Hockey International with Buffalo in 1999. The league folded for good after the 1999 season."

"Bartholomeus Breenbergh (before 13 November 1598 – after 3 October 1657) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of Italian and Italianate landscapes, in Rome (1619-1630) and Amsterdam (1630-1657)."
"Little is known of his early life. In his three-volume ""Schouburg"", Arnold Houbraken mentioned him in his first volume with an entreaty to readers to write to him with more news of Breenbergh's biography. He had been told that Breenberg was born in Utrecht and had been a master of Cornelis van Poelenburgh, which he knew to be impossible from the facts that he already had, namely ""the birth of Poelenburg in 1586 and the death of Breenberg in 1660."" Houbraken never received the information he requested, though he mentioned Breenbergh again in his second volume in a list of 59 competent painters who were contemporaries of Abraham Bloemaert and Paulus Potter."
"Äccording to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD), Breenbergh was born in the Netherlands town of Deventer, but after the death of his father in 1607 moved away with the rest of his family, probably to Hoorn. There he was a contemporary of Jacques Waben and possibly received his first training, though his first teacher is now supposed to be ""one of those many forgotten Amsterdam landscape painters of the 1610s"". His registered teachers are Pieter Lastman and Jacob Symonsz Pynas."
"Breenbergh is first registered as a painter on an archival record in 1619 in Amsterdam, though he possibly was established there earlier."
"In the same year he left for Rome. There he lived and worked with the Flemish painter Frans van de Kasteele and was heavily influenced by another Fleming resident, the landscape painter Paul Bril. From 1623, however, he came under the spell of Italian landscapes by the somewhat older Cornelis van Poelenburgh—indeed, the works of Breenbergh and van Poelenburgh are sometimes difficult to tell apart. He was also influenced by Nicolaes Moeyaert. Breenbergh in his turn influenced the French landscape-painter Claude Lorrain (who arrived in the city about 1620). In about 1620 Breenbergh became one of the founders of the Roman society of Dutch and Flemish painters, the ""Bentvueghels"", among whom he was nicknamed ""het fret"" (""the ferret"")."

= = = Rising of the North = = =
"The Rising of the North of 1569, also called the Revolt of the Northern Earls or Northern Rebellion, was an unsuccessful attempt by Catholic nobles from Northern England to depose Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots."
"Elizabeth I succeeded her half-sister Mary I as queen of England in 1558. Elizabeth's accession was disputed due to the questioned legitimacy of the marriage of her parents – Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Under Henry VIII and his advisor Thomas Cromwell, power was gradually shifted from regional institutions to royal control. This course was encouraged by Elizabeth's counsellors such as William Cecil and a policy of centralization was the approach favoured by Elizabeth herself at least in regards to the northern border region."
"Opponents of Elizabeth looked to Mary, Queen of Scots, the descendant of Henry VIII's sister Margaret. The claims were initially put forward by Mary's father-in-law, King Henry II of France, and Mary upheld them after her return to Scotland in 1561."
"Many English Catholics, then a significant portion of the population, supported Mary's claim as a way to restore Roman Catholicism. This position was especially strong in Northern England, where several powerful nobles were Roman Catholics; there had been similar risings against Henry VIII; the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536 and Bigod's Rebellion of 1537. Supporters of Mary hoped for aid from France (among Scots) and possibly Spain (among English). Mary's position was strengthened by the birth of her son, James, in 1566 but weakened again when she was deposed in July 1567."
"The rebellion was led by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland. Seven hundred knights assembled at Brancepeth Castle. In November 1569 Westmorland and Northumberland occupied Durham. Thomas Plumtree celebrated Mass in Durham Cathedral. From Durham, the rebels marched south to Bramham Moor, while Elizabeth struggled to raise forces sufficient to confront them. But, hearing of a large force being raised by the Earl of Sussex, the rebels abandoned plans to besiege York, and captured Barnard Castle instead. They proceeded to Clifford Moor, but found little popular support. Sussex marched out from York on 13 December 1569 with 10,000 men against the rebels' 6,000, and was followed by 12,000 men under Baron Clinton. The rebel earls retreated northward and finally dispersed their forces, fleeing into Scotland."
"A questionable role in the rebellion was played by Leonard Dacre, an early sympathiser of Mary. At the outbreak of the rebellion, he travelled to Elizabeth's court at Windsor to claim the heritage of his young nephew, the 5th Baron Dacre. After the latter's untimely death in 1569, this had descended to his sisters, all married to sons of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear."
"After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River. Though Hunsdon was outnumbered, he charged Dacre's foot with his cavalry, killing 300–400 and capturing 200–300 men. Dacre escaped via Scotland to Flanders, where he died in exile."
"Two of the rebellion's leaders, the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, had fled into Scotland. Northumberland was captured by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and turned over to Elizabeth in 1572, who had him beheaded at York. After having been hidden at Ferniehirst Castle, Westmorland escaped to Flanders, where he died impoverished. His family lost their ancestral homes and his wife, Jane Howard, also fled to the Continent. She lived the rest of her life under house arrest. Her brother, the Duke of Norfolk, was first imprisoned, then pardoned. He was imprisoned again following the Ridolfi plot in 1571 and finally executed in 1572. Norfolk's treason charges included ""comforting and relieving of the English rebels that stirred the Rebellion in the North since they have fled out of the realm."" Altogether, 600 supporters of Mary were executed, while many others fled into exile."
"Queen Elizabeth declared martial law, exacting terrible retribution on the ordinary folk of the Yorkshire Dales, despite the lack of any popular support for the Earls' Rising, with her demand for at least 700 executions. The victims of this purge were, as a contemporary account said ""wholly of the meanest sort of people"", so that hardly a village escaped the sight of a public hanging. (Source: )"
"In 1570, Pope Pius V had tried to aid the rebellion by excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her deposed in the papal bull ""Regnans in Excelsis"", but the document did not arrive until the rebellion had been suppressed. The bull gave Elizabeth more reason to view Catholics with suspicion. It inspired conspiracies to assassinate her, starting with the Ridolfi plot."
"In 1587, Elizabeth brought Mary, Queen of Scots, to trial for treason; she was convicted by the court and executed."
"The Rising of the North is the main conflict in the historical drama film ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2018)."

"WEZB (97.1 MHz) is a commercial FM radio station licensed to New Orleans, Louisiana. Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts a Top 40 (CHR) radio format. It rarely uses its call sign, instead calling itself B97 FM. The studios and offices are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in Downtown New Orleans. The station airs the syndicated Kidd Kraddick Morning Show from KHKS Dallas on weekdays."
"WEZB has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for FM radio stations. The transmitter site is off Behrman Highway in the city's Algiers neighborhood. The signal covers much of Southeastern Louisiana and Southwestern Mississippi. WEZB broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel carries Entercom's Channel Q service, primarily for LGBTQ listeners."
"On September 1, 1945, 97.1 signed on the air. This was WRCM, the FM simulcast of AM 990 WJMR (now WGSO) and sister station to WJMR-TV 12 (now WVUE channel 8), all owned by George J. Mayoral. Then, around 1966–67 after the TV station had already been sold, the Supreme Broadcasting Company bought the two radio stations and changed the call signs to WNNR and WNNR-FM. At the time, the stations were located in the Jung Hotel at 1500 Canal Street in downtown New Orleans. WNNR-FM had a power of only 20,500 watts from an antenna 310 feet atop the building, a fraction of its current wattage and antenna height."
"On January 2, 1972, EZ Communications acquired the FM station. It became WEZB, part of a chain of Beautiful Music stations such as WEZC Charlotte, WEZR Washington and others owned by EZ. While it was profitable, it was not able to best WWL-FM (now WLMG) in the easy listening format. Briefly in the 1970s when disco music became a popular genre, 97.1 became ""Disco 97 FM"" on Thursday, February 8, 1979. But the disco era was short, with WEZB switching to a rhythmic contemporary sound, called """"FM 97, The Rhythm Of The City!"""" ""We had a big party in the Atrium at the Hyatt Regency Hotel"" says Jimmy Roberts, B97 FM's first BJ, the station's version of a DJ. On January 1, 1980, ""Baby New Year was dropped from the ceiling and we switched over from being ""FM 97, The Rhythm Of The City!"" to ""The New B97 FM""."""

The old sea lion enclosure was repurposed for river otters."
"In January 2014, ground was broken for the approximately 18-acre ""African Adventure"" expansion doubling the size of the zoo and including large animal exhibits such as lions, breeding elephants, cheetahs, rhinos, meerkats, hippos, gorillas, and penguins. Measure Z, which provided funding for capital zoo projects, was renewed by voters in November 2014."
"On October 15, 2015, phase one of African Adventure opened. The 13 acre exhibit is home to over 100 animals including lions, African elephants, cheetahs, and rhinos. In 2016, the zoo opened the ""Roo Walkabout,"" an Australian walk-through exhibit which features red kangaroos, emus and kookaburras. That year set a new attendance record with just under 1 million visitors."
"Attendance dropped significantly from 2016 to 2017, to 833,114 guests; 2018 saw another slight drop to 828,000 guests. While no major new exhibits opened in 2017, May 2018 saw the debut of a new children's water attraction named ""Wilderness Falls."" This new play area was designed to allow younger guests to ""cool off and make a splash in the waterfall, follow the footprints and explore the wilderness, and discover the fire lookout tower."" Work also began in late 2018 on an infrastructure project designed to enable future zoo expansion, including the forthcoming ""Kingdoms of Asia"" project, as well as a new warthog and tortoise exhibit. The warthog/tortoise exhibit opened in African Adventure in June 2019."
"= = = Elizabeth of Carinthia, Queen of Germany = = ="
"Elizabeth of Carinthia (also known as Elizabeth of Tyrol; – 28 October 1312), was a Duchess of Austria from 1282 and Queen of Germany from 1298 until 1308, by marriage to the Habsburg king Albert I."
"Born in Munich, Bavaria, she was the eldest daughter of Count Meinhard of Gorizia-Tyrol, and Elizabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Germany, widow of the late Hohenstaufen king Conrad IV of Germany."
"Elizabeth thus was a half-sister of Conradin, King of Jerusalem and Duke of Swabia. Elizabeth was in fact better connected to powerful German rulers than her future husband: a descendant of earlier monarchs, for example Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, she was also a niece of the Bavarian dukes, Austria's important neighbors."
"She was married in Vienna on 20 December 1274 to Count Albert of Habsburg, eldest son and heir of the newly elected King Rudolf I of Germany, thus becoming daughter-in-law of the King of the Romans and Emperor-to-be. After Rudolf had defeated his rival King Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, he invested his son Albert with the duchies of Austria and Styria at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg on 17 December 1282."
"Albert initially had to share the rule with his younger brother Rudolf II, who nevertheless had to waive his rights according to the Treaty of Rheinfelden the next year. Duke Albert and Elizabeth solidified their rule in what was to become the Habsburg ""hereditary lands"", also with the help of Elizabeth's father Meinhard, who in his turn was created Duke of Carinthia by King Rudolf I in 1286."
"Elizabeth was described as shrewd and enterprising, in possession of some commercial talents. The construction of the Saline plant in Salzkammergut goes back to her suggestion."
"Upon the death of Albert's father in 1291, the princes elected Count Adolf of Nassau German king, while Duke Albert himself became entangled in internal struggles with the Austrian nobility. Not until Adolf's deposition in 1298, Elizabeth's husband was finally elected King of the Romans on 23 June 1298. Two weeks later, Adolf was defeated and killed in the Battle of Göllheim. In 1299, Elizabeth was crowned Queen of the Romans in Nuremberg."
"On 1 May 1308 her husband was murdered by his nephew John ""the Parricide"" near Windisch, Swabia (in modern-day Switzerland). After Albert's assassination, Elizabeth had the Poor Clare monastery of Königsfelden erected at the site, where she died on 28 October 1312 and was also buried. Today her mortal remains rest at Saint Paul's Abbey in Carinthia."

Before his NFL career, he played for Winston-Salem State University, where he also played collegiate basketball."
"Thigpen played infrequently in his first three seasons, but had a breakout year in 1994, catching 36 passes for 546 yards. Then in 1995, he made the Pro Bowl, catching 85 passes for 1,307 yards and five touchdowns, and assisting his team to Super Bowl XXX, where he recorded three catches for 19 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers 27–17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. His tough style of play earned him the nickname ""Meatball,"" which was later changed to ""Phil"" when he joined the Oilers in 1998."
"Thigpen played only six games in the following season due to injuries, but made a full recovery in the 1997 season, catching 79 passes for 1,398 yards and 7 touchdowns and making his second Pro Bowl selection."
"In 1998, he signed a five-year, $21 million contract with the Oilers, which at the time was the highest known contract ever signed among wide receivers. He went on to play with them for the final three seasons of his career, assisting the team (now known as the Titans) to Super Bowl XXXIV in the 1999 season. Such a large contract for a wide receiver was a signal of the role which wide receivers would begin to play in the NFL. Thigpen retired after the 2000 season with 313 career receptions for 5,081 yards and 30 touchdowns. He also rushed for four yards, returned two punts for 30 yards, and gained 188 yards on eight kickoff returns."

"Using the Batavia Institute as the basis for its proposal, Batavia submitted a bid for the Illinois normal school in 1857. A normal school or teachers college is an educational institution for training teachers. Its purpose is to establish teaching standards or norms, hence its name. The State of Illinois passed an act to establish a normal school on 18 February 1857—the second west of the Appalachian Mountains."
"Bids were opened by the State Board of Education in Peoria on 7 May 1857. The first proposition on the agenda was from Batavia, which offered a subscription of $15,000, with the land and building belonging to the Batavia Institute, valued at $30,000, making $45,000 in all. Washington, in Tazewell County, Bloomington, and Peoria submitted proposals, as well. After considerable discussion, a resolution was adopted locating the new university at Bloomington—actually north of town at the village of North Bloomington, which was renamed Normal in 1865, for the school. Illinois State University celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007."
"The building and grounds of the Batavia Institute were sold in 1867 to Dr. Richard J. Patterson, who, as proprietor and medical superintendent, operated it as a private rest home and sanitarium for women, called Bellevue Place. The sanitarium operated until July 1965. The most notable patient was Mary Todd Lincoln, widow of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who was a patient for several months in the summer of 1875."
"In the 1960s, the building was converted to a residential facility for unwed mothers called the Fox Hill Home. The Fox Hill Home operated into the 1970s when the building fell into disrepair."

Alan Horrox at Thames Television bought the concept and title and passed them to Grant Cathro and Lee Pressman, already established at Thames Television as the writers of ""T-Bag"" and creators of ""Mike and Angelo"", to develop ""Spatz"" as a sitcom. While updating the setting to a standard fast food restaurant, the name ""Spatz"" was retained, with the writers noting that it suggested spats or disagreements."

= = = Arthur Lyon Fremantle = = =
"General Sir Arthur James Lyon Fremantle (11 November 1835 – 25 September 1901) was a British Army officer and a notable British witness to the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Whilst holding the rank of ""Captain and Lieutenant Colonel"" he spent three months (from 2 April until 16 July 1863) in North America, travelling through parts of the Confederate States of America and the Union. Contrary to popular belief, Colonel Fremantle was not an official representative of the United Kingdom; instead, he was something of a tourist."
"Fremantle was born into a distinguished military family; his father, Lieutenant-General John Fremantle, had commanded a battalion of the Coldstream Guards, and had served during the Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign, as well as acting as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke during the abortive British invasion of Buenos Aires in 1807. Arthur's middle name, Lyon, came from his mother, Agnes Lyon. He was called ""Arthur"" after the Duke of Wellington, who had been the first witness at his parents' wedding in 1829."
"After his graduation from Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Arthur Fremantle was commissioned into the British Army in 1852, serving firstly as an ensign in the 70th Foot, before being transferred to the 52nd Foot almost immediately thereafter. The following year, Fremantle became ensign and lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and continued to receive promotions until, in 1860, at the age of 25, he held the rank of captain of his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army."
"The same year, Fremantle was appointed to the position of assistant military secretary at Gibraltar under Governor William John Codrington. In January 1862, the Confederate commerce raider CSS ""Sumter"", pursued by the Union Navy, arrived in port. The ship's commander, Raphael Semmes, sought to have his ship repaired and refitted, although ultimately the ""Sumter"" was sold and its crew transferred to the newly constructed CSS ""Alabama"". Sometime in early 1862, the young British captain met the flamboyant Confederate captain, and was inspired by Semmes' tales of blockade running and combat on the high seas."
"Like many other officers of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable interest in the American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, he decided to take a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface:"

"WPBF presently broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays)."
"Initially, WPBF had a small news department as it did not plan to launch one until after it received the ABC affiliation. After being purchased by Paxson Communications, the station added additional newscasts to its schedule. For a long time they struggled with ratings in their own market, which is attributable to WPLG's very strong over-the-air signal in Palm Beach County and its availability on Comcast throughout the area. However with Hearst's traditional hard news focus on their stations soon instituted within WPBF's news operation, WPBF eventually became a spirited second place news operation, and WPBF usually outranks WPEC currently in most timeslots (NBC affiliate WPTV has been well dominant in the market for years)."
"On July 12, 2006, it started airing a half-hour newscast called ""Weather First at 4"" on weekdays becoming the first station in West Palm Beach to do so. While the main intention of the new broadcast was to cover West Palm Beach area weather, news updates and headlines were added after a short time. This production is streamed live on their website. On July 17, 2006, WPBF added thirty minutes to its weekday morning show which began airing at 5:30. It became a full two-hour broadcast on January 28, 2008. The station debuted a new traffic reporting system featuring data from Traffic.com on February 14 that included a new traffic segment, ""Beat the Traffic"", seen on weekdays."
"Expansion of local news continued with the launch of a weekend morning newscast on March 8. On August 18, 2008, WPBF began broadcasting a broadcast at noon during the week which is also streamed live on its website. On September 14, 2009, the station debuted a new logo, set, and graphics package while expanding the 4 p.m. newscast to an hour. WPBF dropped weeknight newscasts in the 5 p.m. hour to make room for ""Dr. Phil"" which had moved to the station from WPTV; that change has since been reverted, for as of September 12, 2011, ""The Dr. Oz Show"" replaced the 4 p.m. newscast."
"Until October 4, 2010, WPBF was the only channel in the West Palm Beach market that did not offer newscasts in high definition or even enhanced definition widescreen. However, WPBF was operating HD-ready studios and field cameras for its broadcasts. The shows were displayed in pillarboxed standard definition while showing the station's logo and ""HD"" in the left and right thirds of the screen. On October 4 starting with the weeknight 4 p.m. newscast, WPBF started broadcasting local news in high definition. Upon the upgrade, it began using an updated music package and slightly revised HD graphics previously used by sister station WESH in Orlando. In December 2012, WPBF upgraded their graphics package to the new Hearst Television graphics along with new music and talent opens. However, like another sister station, KSBW in Salinas, California, HD is not mentioned in the news openings. WPBF will also continue to display HD in the left and right thirds of the screen when video footage is shown in 4:3 standard definition.

"Marjorie Celeste Champion (née Belcher; born September 2, 1919) is an American dancer and actress. At a young age, she was hired as a dance model for Walt Disney Studios animated films. Later, she performed as an actress and dancer in film musicals, and in 1957 had a TV show based on song and dance. She has also done creative choreography for liturgy, and served as a dialogue and movement coach for the 1978 TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", set in the late 18th century in the Ohio Valley."
"Marge Champion was born as Marjorie Celeste Belcher on September 2, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Hollywood dance director Ernest Belcher and his wife, Gladys Lee Baskette (née Rosenberg). She had an older half sister, Lina Basquette, who already was acting in silent films at the age of twelve. Lina was the daughter of her mother's first husband, Frank Baskette, who had committed suicide."
"Marjorie began dancing at an early age as her sister had done. She began dancing as a child under the instruction of her father, Ernest Belcher, a noted Hollywood ballet coach who trained Shirley Temple, Cyd Charisse, and Gwen Verdon. She studied exclusively with her father from age five until she left for New York. She credits her good health and long career to her father's teaching principles: careful, strict progression of activity, emphasis on correct alignment, precise placement of body, attention to detail and to the totality of dynamics and phrasing. Her first dance partner was Louis Hightower. In 1930, she made her debut in the Hollywood Bowl at age 11 in the ballet ""Carnival in Venice"". By age twelve, she became a ballet instructor at her father's studio. She was hired by The Walt Disney Studio as a dance model for their animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Her movements were copied to enhance the realism of the animated Snow White figure."
"In 1937, Marge Belcher married Art Babbitt (1907–1992), a top animator at Disney and creator of Goofy. They divorced in 1940."
"In 1947, she married dancer Gower Champion (1919–1980). They had two sons, Blake and actor Gregg Champion. They divorced in January 1973. Belcher met Gower when she was 12 years old in the ninth grade at Bancroft Junior High and that's when their romance started. Although performances often took them away from California, Los Angeles remained their home base."
"In 1977, she married director Boris Sagal. Sagal was killed on May 22, 1981, in an accident during the production of the miniseries ""World War III"". She became stepmother to Boris' five children, who include Katey, Jean, Liz, and Joey."
"The very first picture Belcher remembers being in was ""The Castles"" with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This gave her a feeling that she would really like to do movies but what she really wanted to do was go to New York and be in New York shows. Sadly, Belcher wasn't tall enough not even for ballet, which is what she trained all her life for."
"Together as a dance team, the Champions performed in MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s, including their first MGM musical ""Till the Clouds Roll By"" (1946), ""Show Boat"" (1951) and ""Everything I Have Is Yours"" (1952). Other films with Gower included ""Mr. Music"" (1950, with Bing Crosby), ""Give a Girl a Break"" (1953), ""Jupiter's Darling"" (1955), and ""Three for the Show"" (1955). MGM wanted the couple to remake Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, but only one, ""Lovely to Look At"" (1952), a remake of ""Roberta"" (1935), was completed. The couple refused to remake any of the others, the rights to which were still owned by RKO."
"Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of ""What's My Line"". Mary Healy guessed who they were."
"During the summer of 1957, the Champions had their own TV series, ""The Marge and Gower Champion Show"", a situation comedy with song and dance numbers. Marge played a dancer and Gower a choreographer. Real-life drummer Buddy Rich was featured as a fictional drummer named Cozy."
"In the 1970s, Champion, actress Marilee Zdenek, and choreographer John West were part of a team at Bel Aire Presbyterian Church that created a number of creative worship services featuring dance and music. They later offered workshops and related liturgical arts programs throughout the country. She and Zdenek co-authored two books, ""Catch the New Wind"" and ""God Is a Verb"", related to this work."
"In 1978 she served as a dialogue and movement coach for the TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", adapted from Conrad Richter's trilogy of the same name. It was set in the late 18th-century Ohio Valley."
"Champion has also worked as a dance instructor and choreographer in New York City. In 1982, she made a rare television acting appearance on the dramatic TV series ""Fame"", playing a ballet teacher with a racial bias against African-American students."
"Champion appeared in several stage musicals and plays on Broadway as a performer. She made her New York debut in ""What's Up"" (1943). She also performed in the ""Dark of the Moon"" (1945) as the Fair Witch, and ""Beggar's Holiday"" (1946) having multiple roles. She made her last Broadway appearance in ""3 for Tonight"" in 1955. She also worked as a choreographer or Assistant, including ""Lend an Ear"" in 1948 as assistant to the Choreographer; ""Make a Wish"" in 1951, as assistant to Gower Champion; ""Hello, Dolly!"" in 1964 as special assistant; and ""Stepping Out"" (1987) as choreographic associate. In 2001, she appeared as Emily Whitman in the Broadway stage revival of ""Follies""."
"Champion states ""as a dancer, by the time you're 40 you're done. If I ever come back, I want to be an actress- it lasts long. But I was 81 when I was in ""Follies""."
"Marge Champion has been interviewed in numerous documentaries, including for the behind-the-scenes documentary directed by Oscar-winner Chris Innis, ""The Story of the Swimmer"", which was featured on the 2014 Grindhouse Releasing/Box Office Spectaculars Blu-ray/DVD restoration of ""The Swimmer"". She was also interviewed at a Hollywood film festival screening of ""The Swimmer"" by filmmaker Allison Anders for the same release. Champion and Donald Saddler, who met while performing together in the ""Follies"" in 2001, are the subjects of a short film about the two dancers leading meaningful lives at age 90."

= = = Jōkō Ninomiya = = =
"Joko Ninomiya was born on January 27, 1954, in Yawatahama, Shikoku, Japan. Ninomiya was the youngest of 10 brothers and sisters. His family owned and tended to several fruit orchards. To augment the family's income, his father also worked as a carpenter."
"In seventh grade, at age 12, Ninomiya began training in a Judo class taught by a teacher at his junior high school. He earned his first degree black belt by the end of eighth grade. After turning 14, Ninomiya did extra Judo training at the local police station gym on weekends and holidays. It was there that he met the man who would become his teacher and mentor in karate- Hideyuki Ashihara. One year later, in 1969, Ninomiya began training in Ashihara's Kyokushin dojo."
"Hideyuki Ashihara began training in Kyokushin karate at the honbu dojo in 1971 when he was 16 years old. Kyokushin(kai) is a full contact, knockdown style of karate founded by Mas Oyama. Ashihara attained first degree black belt in Kyokushin in 1974. Two years after that he became an instructor, and two years after that he was allowed to open his own dojo in Ninomiya's home town of Yawatahama."
"During this time, Ashihara was developing his own approach to the Kyokushin curriculum he was teaching his students as well as adding additional movements and techniques that he had devised. His techniques involved using circular patterns to move outside of an opponent's attack and then to counterattack from a position of advantage. These techniques also involved parries and sweeps intended to use the opponent's momentum against him. He always stressed getting the maximum impact from a minimum amount of force. Ashihara called these techniques, ""Sabaki."" Although many of these techniques were prohibited in Kyokushin Knockdown karate tournament rules, he taught them to his students, including Ninomiya, so that they would be more effective, all-around karate fighters. Many renowned karate students came to train at Ashihara's dojo because of his reputation as an extremely effective instructor."
"When Ninomiya was 17, he received his brown belt in Kyokushin from Ashihara and was chosen to compete in the All-Japan Tournament as the youngest competitor. He lost in the second round to eventual tournament champion Katsuaki Satō."
"Ninomiya trained hard for the next year's tournament, including spending three weeks living and training alone at a beach some distance from his home town. At his second All-Japan tournament in 1972 he lost in the third round to eventual tournament champion Miyuki Miura."
"During this time, Ninomiya had continued to train and compete in judo, as well as in karate. However, with graduation from high school, he stopped training in judo and trained full-time in karate, when not working in various jobs, including as a nightclub security guard. Ninomiya was now a 1st degree black belt in Kyokushin. At the 1973 All-Japan tournament, he lost again in the third round, this time to eventual tournament champion Hatsuo Royama."
"One month after the 1973 tournament, Ninomiya was chosen, along with five others, to go to live and train at the three Kyokushin dojo in New York City. Two of the American fighters that trained with them there were William Oliver and Willie Williams. The other five members of the group returned to Japan after two months, but Ninomiya stayed in New York to teach and train. Because of visa problems, he was unable to compete in the 1974 All-Japan tournament."
"In October, 1975, 21-year-old Joko Ninomiya returned to Japan to compete in the first All-World Tournament. In the semi-finals, he once again faced Katsuaki Satō. After a three-overtime match, Satō won the match by judge's decision. Satō then won the subsequent title match against Hatsuo Royama. Ninomiya finished in third place. The tournament was filmed for a documentary, called ""Fighting Black Kings"" that also profiled several of the competitors, including William Oliver and Willie Williams."
"Ninomiya returned to New York and prepared for the next year's All-Japan tournament. At the tournament, his quarter-final match went to three overtimes before he was awarded the decision. His semi-final match went two overtimes before he was again awarded the decision. Extremely fatigued, Ninomiya had only 10-minutes to rest and prepare for the final match against Toshikazu Satō which Satō won. Ninomiya returned to New York to resume teaching and training."
"Ninomiya was unable to compete in the 1977 All-Japan due to a training accident involving a sword that almost severed his left thumb. Instead, he decided to move to Denver to open his own Kyokushin dojo. His first classes were held in a neighborhood health club. However, he was subsequently able to rent a vacant store to use as a training dojo. He soon had a dedicated core of students."
"The next year, Ninomiya returned to Japan briefly for his father's funeral. Seven months later, he returned again for the 1978 All-Japan Tournament. In the final match, Ninomiya defeated Keiji Sanpei to win the All-Japan championship. He then retired from tournament competition to concentrate full-time on teaching karate."
"In 1980 Hideyuki Ashihara left the Kyokushin organization and started his own style- Ashihara Karate. Ninomiya directed the US region of Ashihara Karate from Denver. Over the next eight years, Ashihara Karate slowly increased in size in the US and around the world."
"During this time, Ninomiya states that he had developed strategies and ideas of his own that he was eager to implement in his training curriculum. He also wanted to develop his own tournament format that would provide what he felt to be a ""true"" test of karate skills. Therefore, in May, 1988, Ninomiya decided to leave Ashihara Karate and start his own style. Most of the instructors and students of Ashihara in the US decided to follow Ninomiya into his new organization Enshin kaikan, providing a strong base for the new style- Enshin Karate."
"Since 1988, Enshin Karate has continued to be headquartered at Ninomiya's honbu in Denver. The organization has grown and now includes schools in Asia, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East, as well as in the US. Ninomiya's idea for an open, knockdown-rules tournament that promotes the Sabaki method became the Sabaki Challenge which has been held annually in Denver since 1989."
"Ninomiya travels extensively in his position as director of the Enshin organization. He attends the openings of new dojo, presides over Enshin sabaki tournaments, and conducts seminars on the sabaki method. When not traveling he trains and instructs at the honbu in Denver."
= = = Maqsood Ahmed = = =
"Maqsood Ahmed (26 March 1925 – 4 January 1999) was a Pakistani cricketer who played in 16 Test matches from 1952 to 1955. He was educated at Islamia College, Lahore."
"Maqsood Ahmed was a useful all rounder in the first ever cricket team of Pakistan. Before the creation of Pakistan, he played for Southern Punjab in India, scoring 144 in his very first match. An aggressive hitter of the ball, Maqsood played a vital role in the recognition of Pakistan as test playing nation when he made 137 against the visiting MCC in 1951–52."
"A right-handed middle-order batsman, Maqsood was a hard hitter of the ball and is one of the Test cricketers whose highest score was 99, which he made in the Third Test against India in 1954–55. Though a brilliant batsman, his performance in Test matches was rather irregular because of his carefree attitude. In England in 1952 he became the first Pakistani to play as a professional cricketer. The English press dubbed him ""Merry Max""."
"He played 16 Test matches, scoring a total of 507 runs. He was also a right-arm medium fast bowler with three wickets in test matches to his credit. His first-class record is better, with 3815 runs in 85 matches between 1945 and 1964, including six centuries. He also took 124 wickets, with 7 for 39 and 6 for 44 against Sargodha in 1962–63 his best bowling figures. He was the leading bowler in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1962–63 with 34 wickets at an average of 9.29. He captained Karachi Blues and Rawalpindi in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy."
"After retiring from cricket, Maqsood Ahmed worked as a commentator and sports journalist for PTV, BBC and Radio Pakistan. He also served as the Chief National Cricket Coach and coached many Test stars including Intikhab Alam, Asif Iqbal, Mushtaq Mohammad, Sadiq Mohammad and Majid Khan. He was the Chairman of the National Selection Committee of the Pakistan Cricket Board which selected the World Cup winning team in 1991–92."

Jennifer Dunning, ""The New York Times"" dance critic, described his work as follows: ""Arthur Aviles has developed an individual voice and style that might be compared to bold street theater and poster art, communicating his truths about life as seen as a gay male Puerto Rican through simple narratives that are always colorful and often poignant and amusing."""
"Since 1991, Aviles has collaborated extensively with his first cousin, the comedian and performer Elizabeth Marrero. He has also collaborated with other gay Puerto Rican performers such as Jorge Merced. Avilés is publicly gay, as he has indicated in interviews, and many of his dance pieces explore gay topics."
= = = Sideritis = = =
"Sideritis (Gr: σιδηρίτις), also known as ironwort, mountain tea and shepherd's tea, is a genus of flowering plants well known for their use as herbal medicine, commonly as an herbal tea. They are abundant in Mediterranean regions, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and Macaronesia, but can also be found in Central Europe and temperate Asia."
"In Greek ""sideritis"" can be literally translated as ""he who is made of iron"". The plant was known to ancient Greeks, specifically Pedanius Dioscorides and Theophrastus. Although Dioscorides describes three species, only one (probably ""S. scordioides"") is thought to belong to ""Sideritis"". In ancient times ""sideritis"" was a generic reference for plants capable of healing wounds caused by iron weapons during battles. However, others hold that the name stems from the shape of the sepal, which resembles the tip of a spear."
"In 2002, molecular phylogenetic research found ""Sideritis"" and five other genera to be embedded in ""Stachys"". Further studies will be needed before ""Stachys"", ""Sideritis"", and their closest relatives can be revised."
"Some schemes recognize and categorize up to 319 distinct species, subspecies, ecotypes, forms or cultivars, including:"
"Botanists have encountered difficulties in naming and classifying the varieties of ""Sideritis"" due to their subtle differences. One particularly confusing case is that of ""S. angustifolia"" Lagasca and ""S. tragoriganum"" Lagasca."
"The genus is composed of short (8–50 cm), xerophytic subshrubs or herbs, annual or perennial, that grow at high altitudes (usually over 1000 m) with little or no soil, often on the surface of rocks."
"It is pubescent, either villous or coated by a fine, woolly layer of microscopic intertwined hairs."
"""Sideritis"" inflorescence is verticillaster."
"Very popular in Greece, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Bulgaria and North Macedonia, ""Sideritis scardica"" is used as a herb either for the preparation of herbal teas, or for its aromatic properties in local cuisines. The herbal tea is commonly prepared by decoction, by boiling the stems, leaves and flowers in a pot of water, then often serving with honey and lemon."
"Ironwort has been traditionally used to aid digestion, strengthen the immune system and suppress common cold, the flu and other viruses, allergies and shortness of breath, sinus congestion, even pain and mild anxiety."
"Scientists have suggested that the popular pronouncement of ironwort as panacea may have some basis in fact. Studies indicate a positive effect on many common ailments. Ironwort is known scientifically to be anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant. Active elements include diterpenoid and flavonoids. Significant research has been done on ironwort confirming its popular use to prevent colds, flu, and allergies. Most of this research has taken place in universities in the Netherlands and in Greece, Turkey, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Albania, where the plant is indigenous."
"""Sideritis raeseri"" is the most commonly cultivated ""Sideritis"" in Bulgaria, Greece, Albania and North Macedonia, where advanced hybrids also exist. Planting is recommended during two periods (October–November or February–March in the Northern hemisphere) and gathering in July, when in full bloom. The plant is typically dried before usage."

"Hubert Max Lanier (August 18, 1915 – January 30, 2007) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in earned run average in 1943, and was the winning pitcher of the clinching game in the 1944 World Series against the crosstown St. Louis Browns. His son Hal became a major league infielder and manager."
"Born in Denton, North Carolina, Lanier was one of a handful of players who remained active during the World War II years. A naturally right-handed player, he had become a left-handed pitcher only because he twice broke his right arm in childhood. After signing with the Cardinals in 1937, he reached the major leagues in 1938. He had arguably his best season in 1943, compiling a 15–7 record with a league-best 1.90 ERA. In 1944 he won a career-high 17 games, and was the winner of the final game of the World Series against the crosstown Browns. He was named an NL All-Star in both 1943 and 1944."
"Lanier, along with a dozen other major leaguers, defected to the Mexican League in 1946 after being offered a salary nearly double what he was making with the Cardinals. Disappointed by poor playing conditions and allegedly broken contract promises, he tried to return to the Cardinals in 1948, but was barred by an order from commissioner Happy Chandler, imposing a five-year suspension on all players who had jumped to the Mexican League. In response, Lanier and teammate Fred Martin, as well as Danny Gardella of the New York Giants, sued Major League Baseball in federal court, challenging baseball's reserve clause as a violation of U.S. antitrust law (preceding the similar suit by Curt Flood some 25 years later). Chandler reinstated Lanier and the other players in June 1949. Lanier immediately held out for more money than he was being paid at the time of his leaving for Mexico, but eventually signed a contract paying him the same amount as in 1946."
"Lanier rejoined the Cardinals in 1949. After winning a total of 101 games for the club, he ended his career with the New York Giants (1952–53) and the Browns (1953)."
"Over fourteen seasons, Lanier posted a 108–82 record with 821 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA in 1619 innings pitched, including 21 shutouts and 91 complete games."
"Lanier died at age 91 in Dunnellon, Florida."

"Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio (1902–1964) was an Italian painter, the formulator of industrial painting, and a founding member of the Situationist International. He was also a scholar of popular culture, archaeology, nomadism, and botany."
"Pinot-Gallizio was born in Alba, Piedmont, where he became an independent Left councilman and a chemist. In 1955, he met Asger Jorn, with whom he co-founded the Experimental Laboratory of the Imaginist Bauhaus in Alba, which was part of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, in opposition to the return to productivism by others in the Bauhaus school, in particular Max Bill. It was held in Pinot-Gallizio's studio, a monastery from the seventeenth century, and was attended by such artists as Enrico Baj who experimented with nuclear painting techniques, Walter Olmo, who experimented with musical interventions, Ettore Sottsass, Elena Verrone, and Piero Simondo."
"Pinot-Gallizio drew from his background as a chemist in developing new painting techniques. In 1956 he, along with Jorn, organized the First World Congress of Free Artists, at which a representative from the Lettrist International spoke, foreshadowing the foundation of the Situationist International in 1957 by members of both groups, including Pinot-Gallizio. At this conference the Italian artists withdrew from the Laboratory, and after the formation of the SI only Pinot-Gallizio and his son, Giors Melanotte, remained. He helped to make the SI known in the art world with an exhibition in Paris in 1959."
"He left the SI in 1960 as it became focused on political, rather than artistic, action. He died in Alba in 1964, and the laboratory continued its work until his death."
"Many of Pinot-Gallizio's works were industrial paintings. Rather than a small image to be interpreted, these huge canvases were intended to cover a large area. The first of these was the cavern of anti-matter, prepared in 1957 after the formation of the SI. It was composed of 145 meter canvases which were painted by hand or with the aid of spray guns and machines using resins invented by Pinot-Gallizio himself. It was displayed at the Galerie René Drouin in 1959, draped around the gallery and sold by the meter."

= = = Hop-tu-Naa = = =
"Hop-tu-Naa is a Celtic festival celebrated in the Isle of Man on 31 October. It is the celebration of the traditional Celtic festival of Samhain, the start of winter (). (The lenited form of the genitive singular of ""Samhain"" is ""Shamhna"".) It is thought to be the oldest unbroken tradition in the Isle of Man."
"Hop-tu-Naa is a continuation of the Manx ""Oie Houiney"", which is exactly the same as the Irish ""Oíche Shamhna"" and which was pronounced the same (though not in revived Manx). The exact status of Oíche Shamhna and its role in the Celtic calendar has been a matter of debate. Oíche Shamhna eventually mutated into Halloween in northern England and in Ireland, it was carried to America by Irish immigrants and developed into the modern Halloween."
"The term ""Hop-tu-naa"" comes from a Manx Gaelic song traditionally sung during the festival which included the nonsense Hop-tu-naa as a refrain; such nonsense rhymes are common theme in Irish and Scottish Gaelic music."
"On the Isle of Man today, many groups of people continue the tradition of singing Hop-tu-Naa songs ""around the houses"" (which traditionally referred to waits going around visiting houses, especially those of the wealthy, and soliciting gifts; beggars going ""around the houses"" are featured in The Deemster) with turnip lanterns. In addition to this, many public Hop-tu-Naa events take place across the Isle of Man each year, most of which today include competitions for artistically carving turnips and the singing of traditional songs. As well as the many events run within local communities, the National Folk Museum at Cregneash hosts an event to teach the traditional Hop-tu-Naa song and to help people to carve turnips."
"At the modern Hop-tu-Naa, children dress up and go from house to house hoping to be given sweets or money, as elsewhere. The children carry carved ""turnip"" lanterns (which are known as ""moots"" by the Manx) and sing Hop-tu-Naa songs. There are regional varieties of how turnips should be carved for Hop-tu-Naa, with variations focusing on which way up the turnip is and the nature of the decorations. It is believed that turnip-lanterns do not date earlier than the start of the 19th century, as the vegetable had only been introduced at the end of the previous century. In the past children would bring the stumps of turnips with them and batter the doors of those who refused to give them any money, in an ancient form of trick or treat. This practice appears to have died out."
"A hop-tu-naa dance was collected by both Mona Douglas and Leighton Stowell. It was believed to have been danced through the streets on Hop-tu-Naa night by couples carrying their turnip-lanterns. It is a simple procession dance for pairs of dancers which involves the Manx reel step and a combination of arches only. This dance is taught in many schools on the Isle of Man during October each year, and it is danced at many of the Hop-tu-Naa events across the island."
"Some of the older customs are similar to those now attached to the January New Year. It was a time for prophesying, weather prediction and fortune-telling. Last thing at night, the ashes of a fire were smoothed out on the hearth to receive the imprint of a foot. If, next morning, the track pointed towards the door, someone in the house would die, but if the footprint pointed inward, it indicated a birth."

"WPXT, virtual channel 51 (UHF digital channel 43), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Portland, Maine, United States, serving southern Maine and eastern and northern New Hampshire. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications, as part of a duopoly with Poland Spring-licensed ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The two stations share studios on Ledgeview Drive in Westbrook; WPXT's transmitter is located in South Gray along I-95/Maine Turnpike/Gold Star Memorial Highway. There is no separate website for WPXT; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WMTW."
"The station signed-on September 14, 1986 as Maine's first independent station and the first new commercial station to launch in the Portland market in 32 years. After a few weeks as an independent, it became a charter affiliate with Fox on October 6. In 1996, the station's original owner, Bride Communications, entered bankruptcy and WPXT was sold to Pegasus Broadcasting."
"In October 2001, WPXT switched to The WB due to a monetary dispute between Pegasus and Fox; The WB had previously aired in off-hours on sister UPN affiliate WPME (channel 35). This left Maine with no over-the-air Fox affiliate until April 2003, when Portland's Pax TV affiliate WMPX-TV (now WPFO) switched to the network and WFVX-LD signed on as the first over-the-air Fox affiliate for the Bangor area. In the interim, Fox's primetime and children's programming was only available on cable via WFXT (which was owned by the network at the time) for those living on the New Hampshire side of the market and via Foxnet for those living in Maine; WCKD-LP (which was initially expected to serve as the network's replacement affiliate) carried the network's sports programming during that time. Pegasus declared bankruptcy in June 2004 over a dispute with DirecTV (co-owned with Fox by News Corporation) over marketing of the direct broadcast satellite service in rural areas. The Pegasus station group was sold in August 2006 to private investment firm CP Media, LLC of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania for $55.5 million. Eventually, CP Media formed a new broadcast company, New Age Media."
"As a WB affiliate, WPXT was originally branded on-air as ""Maine's WB 51"", but in 2004, changed to ""Maine's WB"" to reflect its status as the only over-the-air WB affiliate in the state. Although Bangor and Presque Isle also had affiliates, they were only provided on cable through The WB 100+ (a similar operation to Foxnet)."
"On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that they would merge the broadcast operations of The WB and UPN to form The CW Television Network. On March 9, it was announced WPXT would become Portland's CW affiliate. Later on May 1, it was made public sister station WPME would affiliate with MyNetworkTV. With the new affiliation, WPXT's branding became ""The CW Portland"". In 2007, WPXT changed its on-air branding to reflect its call letters rather than a city."
"WPXT ceased analog transmission August 12, 2008 (more than seven months prior to the original Federal Communications Commission (FCC) digital switchover deadline February 17, 2009) due to transmitter failure. On May 2, 2011, WPXT signed-on a new second digital subchannel to become the area's MeTV affiliate. On November 7, 2016, Escape (now Court TV Mystery) was added to subchannel 51.3."
"New Age Media announced in March 2012 that it would sell WPXT to Tyche Broadcasting for $75,000. The deal was contingent on WPME's concurrent sale from MPS Media to Triumph Broadcasting. On November 9, 2012, WPXT filed a non-consummation notice to the FCC, meaning the transaction is nulled and void. On February 13, 2013, New Age Media filed to sell WPXT to Ironwood Communications for $1,525,000; the deal was concurrent with a planned sale of WPME to Cottonwood Communications. The FCC granted its approval of the sale on April 2. The sale was consummated on May 20."
"On March 22, 2018, MyNetworkTV, Escape and Laff programming was moved to WPXT's respective third, fourth and fifth subchannels; the three networks had been carried by WPME, which was concurrently sold to Ion Media Networks to become WIPL, an Ion Television owned-and-operated station. Hearst Television announced its acquisition of WPXT on July 30, 2018; the $3,350,000 purchase created a duopoly with ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The sale was approved on September 12 and was completed on September 21, 2018; concurrently, WPXT changed its branding to ""Maine's CW."""
"The ownership change also resulted in a streamlining of subchannels between WMTW and WPXT the next month. With Hearst's preference for its main station in the market to carry the MeTV affiliation, MeTV and H&I exchanged places, with MeTV moving to WMTW-DT2 and H&I going to WPXT-DT2, and Laff going from WPXT-DT2 to WMTW-DT3, with Escape going to WPXT-DT3 (and the likely non-renewal of the Katz Broadcasting network agreement; Hearst only tends to carry Bounce TV from that provider). The syndicated programming formerly on WPXT-DT3's ""WPME"" service was removed, and MyNetworkTV programming now airs in place of H&I's primetime, or sometimes during the late night hours on WPXT-DT2, an arrangement similar to the setup for the third subchannel of sister station KCCI in Des Moines, Iowa."
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
"Syndicated programming on WPXT includes ""Divorce Court"", ""The People's Court"", ""How I Met Your Mother"", ""Modern Family"", ""Mom"", ""Extra"", ""TMZ on TV"", and ""Chicago P.D."", among others. Throughout its history, WPXT has also produced and aired several local programs."
"For many years, WPXT operated a news department and produced its own local newscasts. For a time, the station's nightly prime time news at 10 was simulcasted on sister station WPME. WPXT even produced a weeknight broadcast at 7 on that station at one point but the show was eventually canceled due to poor ratings and inconsistent viewership. It made national headlines a week before the 2000 Presidential election when reporter Erin Fehlau (now at ABC affiliate WMUR-TV) revealed Republican candidate George W. Bush had been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol 24 years earlier."
"On June 15, 2002, after shuttering its own news operation, WPXT entered into a news share agreement with Maine's two NBC affiliates, WCSH and WLBZ (then both owned by the Gannett Company). This arrangement resulted in a nightly half-hour prime time show at 10 to debut on the station known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on Maine's WB 51"". On weeknights, the news and sports segments originated from WCSH's studios at Congress Square in Downtown Portland while weather forecast segments came from WLBZ's facility on Mount Hope Avenue in Bangor. Weekend broadcasts aired entirely from Portland. The WPXT newscast featured a similar format to newscasts that were simulcast on both WCSH and WLBZ (which largely serves as a semi-satellite of WCSH), with statewide news from both the Portland and Bangor markets. However, since WPXT is a Portland/Auburn market station, there was ultimately a focus on southern areas. With the affiliation switch to The CW in 2006, WPXT's news became known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on The CW Portland""."
"WPXT would not face any competition in the time slot until February 5, 2007, when current Fox affiliate WPFO entered into a similar arrangement with CBS affiliate WGME-TV. On November 6, 2008, WCSH moved the WPXT show to its second digital subchannel affiliated with NBC Weather Plus. As a result, WLBZ's production involvement in the newscast was dropped and refocused to Portland. After a six-year run, the production was eventually canceled altogether."
"On October 31, 2011, WPXT and WCSH established another news share agreement and debuted an hour-long extension of the big three outlet's weekday morning show. Known on WPXT as ""NewsCenter Morning Report Xtra"", this aired from 7 until 8 and competed with WGME's one-hour morning newscast on WPFO. This ceased in Spring 2014."
"Following WPXT's sale to Hearst Television, the station announced that a WMTW-produced prime time newscast would premiere on September 24, 2018. A WMTW-produced Saturday 7 p.m. newscast premiered on August 31, 2019 and continues through the conclusion of ABC's college football coverage which necessitates the preemption of WMTW's usual 6 p.m. newscast."

"Of course, there is no truth in any of these stories. The bridge was constructed as planned; von Rieppel’s complex calculations, (all carried out without the aid of computers or arithmetic aids), were correct – he died about 30 years later after an unrelated illness."
"What might be true are rumours about Emperor Wilhelm II's boycott of the inauguration ceremony. According to legend, the Emperor was annoyed that such a state-of-art structure was named after his grandfather, Wilhelm I, not after himself. He therefore decided not to attend the celebrations in person."

"= = = Eldol, Consul of Gloucester = = ="
"Eldol was Consul or Count of Gloucester in Geoffrey of Monmouth's circa 1136 work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""The History of the Kings of Britain""). In this pseudohistory he was the sole British leader to escape from the massacre of Salisbury, to which Hengist had invited all of the British Leaders to a peace treaty. When all of the leaders were there, about 460 in number, Hengest ordered his men to draw their long knives and kill every leader. Vortigern was spared, but every other ruler was slain, save Eldol, who grabbed a stick up off the ground and killed 70 men in his escape."
"After the massacre, Eldol was a key supporter of Aurelius Ambrosius and helped him defeat the Saxons. Eldol defeated Hengist in hand-to-hand combat at the battle at Kaerconan/Cunungeburc, which may be the town of Conisbrough, and beheaded him. He was also at the siege of Vortigern's tower. Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, was his brother."
"Thomas Rudge gives an account in his 1811 ""The History and Antiquities of Gloucester"":"
"Eldol, or Edel, a Briton, is said to have been Earl of Gloucester in 461; he was, according to the account of Robert of Gloucester, and other historians, a knight of great prowess. He attended King Vortigern at the treaty of Ambresbury in Wiltshire, to which they were invited by Hengist, the Saxon, with the express stipulation that neither party should go thither armed; but the Saxons having, contrary to their engagement, concealed long knives under their clothes, murdered great numbers of the Britons. Eldol is said at this time to have exerted himself so powerfully with a stake he happened to find, as to slay no less than seventy of the Saxons, and after having disabled many more, he escaped to Gloucester, his own city. He is also said to have behaved with uncommon courage, in a subsequent battle between Ambrosius, King of the Britons, and Hengist, when ... he rushed through the Pagan army, took Hengist prisoner, and cut off his head."
"It is not stated whether Morvid, Consul of Gloucester during King Arthur's reign in the ""Historia Regum Britanniae"", is related to Eldol."
"In later Welsh legend, Eldol became Eidol or Eidiol 'Gadarn' ('Mighty'), recorded as one of the three strong men of Britain, having, at the meeting on Salisbury plain, slain 660 Saxons with a billet of wood."
"There was a Welsh hero Eidiol mentioned in ""The Gododdin"" who may have inspired the use of the name in Geoffrey's work."
He should not be confused with King Eldol who lives generations earlier in Geoffrey's work.
"Eldol and Eldad have minor roles in the 1970 novel ""The Crystal Cave"" by Mary Stewart. After the battle with Hengist, one of Ambrosius's men says to Merlin, ""... old Eldad laid about him [i.e., fought well] with the best of them. Did you see him?"" Merlin replies wryly, ""I heard him."""
= = = Yiddle With His Fiddle = = =
"Yidl Mitn Fidl (, ""Yiddle With His Fiddle"", ), is a 1936 musical Yiddish film."
"Arye and his daughter Itke are musicians, or ""klezmorim"", who became impoverished and were evicted from their home in Kazimierz Dolny. Arie sees no choice but to embark on a career of a travelling band, but fears for the safety of his daughter on the dangerous roads. Itke solves the problem by disguising herself as a boy and adopts the persona of ""Yidl"", ostensibly Arie's son."
"During their voyages, they meet another pair of merrymakers, the father-and-son duo Isaac and Ephraim Kalamutker, with whom they form a quartet and roam through the Polish countryside seeking engagements. ""Yidl"" falls in love with Ephraim, who is utterly oblivious to the true sex of his companion. The four are hired to perform in the wedding of young Teibele to the old, rich man Zalman Gold. The bride had to cancel her prior engagement with her true love, Yosl Fedlman, for her late father left many unpaid debts. Yidl takes pity on Teibele and the quartet smuggle her out of the party and have her join them as vocalist. To Yidl's dismay, Ephraim is enamored with the young woman. Itke reveals her true self to Isaac, who determines to assist her and leaves to locate Yosl."
"When arriving in Warsaw, the group become a success and are hired to perform in a concert. However, personal tensions between the members run high. Efraim signs a contract with a local orchestra. Teibele's lost match finally arrives, and they run off together before the show. Yidl, quite by accident, takes her place and recounts her entire story and love for Efraim in song form. She is applauded and signed on a contract for a career in the United States. Having learned the truth, Efraim abandons his commitments and joins her on the ship to New York."
"After the success of ""Joseph in the Land of Egypt"", a silent film dubbed into the Yiddish language by Joseph Green, met with success, he decided to create an entirely Yiddish film, and returned to his native Poland to do so. ""Yidl Mitn Fidl"" was the most successful Yiddish film of all time and the most popular of Green's films as well."
"The film was shot on location in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, with local inhabitants as extras. Based on a novella by Konrad Tom, the screenplay was written by Green. Its score was composed by Abraham Ellstein, and the lyrics to the songs were written by Itzik Manger. Jakob Jonilowicz was the photo director of the film."
"It was filmed in Poland to minimize costs: the total budget was $50,000. Picon was contemplating entering English-language entertainment and had to be paid an astronomical fee in terms of Yiddish cinema, $10,000 or a fifth of the entire expenditure, to star in the main role. Besides her, all actors were Polish. The film turned into a resounding commercial success and covered the producers' expenses even before opening in the United States. When it premiered in the Ambassador movie theatre, Frank S. Nugent wrote in the ""New York Times"": ""It must be set down to her credit that, despite the fact that there is not a single new thing in the whole bag of tricks emptied on the screen, Miss Picon puts so much infectious gayety, not forgetting the proper modicum of sadness, into the action that the result is genuine entertainment."" It was exported to most of Western Europe, Australia and South Africa, and was screened in the British Mandate of Palestine with Hebrew dubbing. In Britain, it opened at Academy Cinema, Oxford Street, on 21 July 1937. The picture was exported outside of London and was quite a success; In a review for ""Night and Day"" from 29 July 1937, Graham Greene wrote of ""Yiddle"": ""a story in which even the music seems to have the dignity and patina of age and race. An odd feeling of freedom pervades the film full of ugly people in bowler-hats strumming in courtyards... Freedom even from the closer tyranny of a well-made script, as if the whole picture were an impromptu performance, like the stories in the Decameron."" Several copies were sent to Nazi Germany, where Jews were not allowed to attend regular cinemas, and viewing was restricted to ""members of the Jewish Race."" Premiere in the hall of the Jüdischer Kulturbund took place on 2 May 1938, and it then ran in communities across Germany."

"Diabolique is a 1996 American psychological thriller film directed by Jeremiah Chechik, written by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Don Roos, and starring Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri, and Kathy Bates. The plot follows the wife and mistress of an abusive schoolmaster who find themselves stalked by an unknown assailant after murdering him and disposing of his body."
"The film is a remake of the French film ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) directed by Clouzot, which was based on the novel ""She Who Was No More"" () by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac."
"Mia Baran is a devout Catholic schoolteacher at a boys' school outside Pittsburgh where her husband, Guy, is schoolmaster. Guy is abusive to the weak Mia, a former nun who suffers from cardiomyopathy; his mistress, Nicole Horner, a fellow teacher at the school, is protective of Mia. When both women grow tired of his abuses, they collaborate to murder him in an apartment owned by a family friend of Nicole's. The women lure him there, and Mia drugs him before they successfully drown him in a bathtub. They wrap his body in a shower curtain and place it in a wicker box."
"While en route to the school, Nicole crashes Guy's car in a pileup on the interstate, but the wicker box goes unnoticed by authorities. The women arrive at the school in the middle of the night, and dump Guy's corpse in the unkempt swimming pool on the property, staging his death as an accidental drowning. When his body fails to rise to the surface after several days, Nicole has the pool drained, but Guy's body is nowhere to be found. The women subsequently discover photos taken of them on the day of Guy's murder, and believe someone is blackmailing them."
"After reading about the discovery of a John Doe in a nearby river, Mia goes to view the body at the sheriff's station, but finds it is not Guy. There, she attracts the attention of Shirley Vogel, a retired police officer-turned-private investigator who offers to look into Guy's disappearance. Nicole is resistant, and Shirley quickly becomes suspicious of the women. Their fears of a blackmailer are confirmed when Mia discovers the shower curtain used to conceal Guy's body hanging in her bathroom window."
"Shirley confronts Mia with the accident report from Guy's car, and surmises that Guy was en route to see her in Pittsburgh on the day he disappeared. Mia grows increasingly paranoid, believing Guy is alive and stalking the women. This fear increases when two videographers filming an event at the school capture an image of Guy standing in one of the building's windows. Later, while investigating the school's basement, Shirley is attacked and knocked unconscious."
"That night, Mia finds Guy floating in her bathtub, and witnesses him rise from the water. Terrified, she loses consciousness and collapses, apparently suffering a heart attack. Nicole arrives, and it is revealed that she and Guy had planned the series of events to scare Mia to the point of heart failure. Nicole laments, however, and tells Guy she had wanted to call it off. While overlooking Mia's body, Nicole realizes she is in fact not dead; when Guy realizes she is alive, he attacks both women, knocking Nicole unconscious."
"Mia flees downstairs, and Guy tackles her to the ground in front of the pool and attempts to drown her. Nicole manages to stop him by driving a garden rake into his head, and he falls into the pool. As Nicole attempts to revive Mia, Guy pulls her into the pool and tries to drown her. Mia enters the pool, and together, both women successfully drown him. They exit the pool and are confronted by Shirley, who punches Mia in the face; willing to cover for the women, she explains it will help prove self-defense in Guy's murder. Mia walks away from the pool, distraught, and Shirley smokes a cigarette while watching Guy's body sink to the bottom."
"Filming took place in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The St. Philomena School was used as the primarily filming location."
"The movie was compared unfavorably to the original movie, and received overall negative reviews. It currently holds a 'rotten' 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award for ""Worst New Star"" (as the new ""serious"" Sharon Stone) for this film and ""Last Dance"", where she lost to Pamela Anderson for ""Barb Wire""."

The second single, ""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002. A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised, following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved."
"The album was a success, reached number ten in the United Kingdom and number twenty on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart."
"Initially, the album was to be titled ""Innocent Girl"" and set to be released on 27 August 2001, but was released on 1 October. Beckham revealed that she felt she had ""a lot to prove"" with the album's release: ""When I started recording this album, I had a lot to prove. I want to prove I can sing and dance and have a vision. I'm really baring my soul on this. I hope people like it. When I was with the other girls I never did a lot of the singing, so this is the first time that people are going to see me and what I am capable of"". She added that she hoped the album would do well ""and I can have a successful solo career""."

The video culminates into a ""dance-off"" and motorcycle race between the two Victorias. The complex video was shot almost entirely on a green set with a great deal of post-production, making it one of the most complex solo Spice Girl videos to date."
"""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002 as the second single from her debut self-titled solo album (2001). It peaked and debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart and sold 56,570 becoming the 173rd best seller of 2002. There is a French version of the song called ""Mon Coeur N'en Fait Qu'a Sa Tete"" (an adaptation of the title into French, or ""my heart does what it wants to do"")."
"A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on ""Friday Night's All Wright"". Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved.

"""Victoria Beckham"" faced a chart battle during the album's release week with Kylie Minogue's ""Fever"". Both singers had previously faced a battle in the singles' chart, when their singles were released on the same day. However, Beckham's album debuted at number ten on the UK Albums Chart on 13 October 2001, whilst Minogue's album topped the charts. ""Victoria Beckham"" charted for three weeks on the chart. However, the album has only sold 50,000 copies overall in the United Kingdom, while costing £5 million to produce. After ""Being Victoria Beckham"", an official documentary that aired in March 2002, the album re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number sixty-seven."

"In family law, the Court can order a Residence Order of the Family Court under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 following the breakdown of a marriage and determining where the children are to live and with whom. The order can be sole or joint, and if joint, it can be made to a couple regardless whether they are married. If a residence order is granted, this automatically gives him, her, or them parental responsibility for the child(ren) which will continue until the order terminates (usually this will be until the child(ren) reach their sixteenth birthday unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying a longer period)."
The following can make an application for a Residence Order under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 as of right:
"If an applicant cannot apply for the Order as of right, (e.g. they are wider family members such as grandparents etc. who wish to seek orders for their grandchildren), they can make an application to the court seeking leave to issue the application. In deciding whether to grant leave, the court will consider, amongst other things:"
"As a matter of public policy, the courts have always operated under the doctrine of ""parens patriae"" to make the best interests of any children their first and paramount concern. From time to time, this doctrine has been included in statutes, the most recent relevant version being section 1 of The Children Act 1989 which requires the court to consider the ""welfare checklist"". Before making a section 8 order (i.e. a residence order) the court must consider:"
"A child is not automatically a party to the proceedings and will be represented by a Guardian ad litem unless the court considers it necessary. If a Guardian is appointed but the children and the Guardian do not agree on what recommendations to make to the court and the children are of sufficient age and understanding, they will be able to instruct a solicitor directly to represent their views and the Guardian will present an independent view to the court. Whether or not a Guardian is appointed, the court can request a Welfare Report under section 7 of The Children Act 1989, either from the local authority where the child currently resides or from a Children and Family Reporter who is an officer appointed by CAFCASS. The report will usually inform the court of the child's wishes and feelings, but the officer will recommend what he or she thinks is in the child's best interests in the circumstances of the case rather than just advocate the child's wishes."

= = = Museum Building (Trinity College Dublin) = = =
"The Museum Building is a building within Trinity College. Finished in 1857 and located on the south of New Square, it is home to the University's Geology, Geography, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering departments. It is a Palazzo style building, inspired by Byzantine architecture of Venice, and finished in Lombardo−Romanesque detailing, with over highly decorated 108 carved capitals."
"In 1833 the then Board of the College instigated a competition for a new Museum Building to contain the geological and various other collections which were housed within the large room of Regents House. Tenders were invited for almost twenty years, ending with the design submitted by Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward being accepted in April 1853. At the time however a row with John McCurdy had caused some concerns to the Board."
"On 23 May 1853 a contract for foundations was agreed with Messrs Cockburn & Son builders (for £24,000) and ground was broken some months later. It was during this time that Samuel Haughton (Professor of Geology) undertook an investigation into the suitability of the site due to its close proximity to the Old Library. He reported various layers of made ground, ash pits and calcareous drift, finally deeming the site permissible to build upon."
"The exterior of the building was fully in place by 1855; however, it was not until 1857 that the interior was completed and the building as a whole finished."
"Suitably fitting for a building designed to house a Geology collection, the Museum Building was constructed from a vast number of different and contrasting forms of stone. College tradition holds that it some form of stone from every quarry in Ireland during the time of its construction was used somewhere within the building."
"The exterior walls were first constructed from Calp Limestone, which were then faced with 22.86 cm (9 inches) of Ballyknockan Granite. The quoins, columns and 108 capitals, as well as the string course which can be seen halfway up the building, are all of Portland stone from the Isle of Portland, Dorset. The tympanum over the heavy wooden main door to building and which bears the crest of the College (a popular 19th-century variant, slightly different from the one currently used by the college today) is of Caen stone from Caen, France. Overall the exterior amounted to just under half the cost for the entire building."
"Initially Deane and Woodward had planned for the interior walls to be of rubble which would then be plastered over. However, in early 1855 they submitted a design change to the Board, deciding instead to use Caen Stone, and the Board agreed. However, when they had learnt that only two thirds of the stone had arrived the Board rescinded this permission. After strong argument from Deane, on 4 May they Board overruled their prior decision and agreed to the use of Caen Stone."
"The large domed central hall once again makes heavy use of Irish stone. The Romanesque arches between each column use alternating yellow and red stained blocks which sit upon bases and capitals of heavily carved Portland Stone. The central staircase and floors of the upper balconies are also made of Portland Stone. The original floor was composed of Yorkstone flagstones, further Portland Stone, Welsh Ffestiniog stone, with black squares of black slate, however this floor later relaid."
"The main entrance hall of the building houses fourteen full columns and eighteen half-column made of Irish Marble, although the only true marble is Connemara Serpentine. There had been some problems sourcing the materials needed to have every column complete, which after more petitioning from Deane resulted in the half columns. The only non-Irish stone used in the columns is a dark red Serpentine from Ruan Minor, The Lizard peninsula area of Cornwall."
The known stone from which the columns are made of include:
"Some of the interior room designs by Deane and Woodward were never realised, as the official college architect John McCurdy had convinced the Board otherwise."
"The entirety of the building's carvings are by brothers John and James O'Shea of O'Shea and Whelan who gathered wild flowers to use as models from the college's botanical garden near Ballsbridge. There are seven carvings that relate specifically to Aesop's Fables, and one (considered to be the most important) which refers to Charles Darwin and Evolution."
"College records from May 1860 mention of how the smoggy atmosphere had adversely affected the stone. After years of laying behind sooty deposits the ashlar of the building had become obscured. In 2010 a three-year conservation programme of the Museum Building was begun. Once finished in March 2013, many of the carvings which were almost invisible had been restored to their past state."

Buie also produced its cover version performed by the Classics IV which was released by United Artists Records in 1971. He and the Classics IV's manager Paul Cochran were two of the four owners of Studio One. The cover was actually marketed with its title combining the first two words of the original's (""Cherryhill Park"")."
"The subject of the song is one Mary Hill, a girl who has frequents the titular Cherry Hill Park. During days she acts as a tease to the boys in the park but at night when they return to the park she gratifies them, as noted in the barely disguised suggestive lyrics. However, she ""married away"" to a ""man with money"". As a result, she stopped coming to Cherry Hill Park."
"Royal came up with the song's title after a friend described seeing Cherry Hill, New Jersey on a visit to nearby Pennsylvania."

"He made his professional sumo debut in March 1979 at the age of 15, after leaving junior high school. He was recruited by Kokonoe stable. In 1980 he adopted the ""shikona"" of Fujinomori, before switching to Takanofuji in 1984. He first reached ""sekitori"" status in March 1985 upon promotion to the second highest ""jūryō"" division, but could manage only 4 wins against 11 losses and was demoted back to the unsalaried ""makushita"" division. After winning promotion back to ""jūryō"" in January 1986 he made his debut in the top ""makuuchi"" division only two tournaments later in May 1986."
"Takanofuji was ranked in the top division for 33 tournaments, winning one special prize for Fighting Spirit. His two gold stars for defeating ""yokozuna"" were both earned against Futahaguro (who, as Koji Kitao, also turned to professional wrestling). Takanofuji had the advantage of belonging to a stable that included two ""yokozuna"", Chiyonofuji and Hokutoumi, which under sumo regulations meant he never had to face them in tournament play. However, his height of meant he had a higher centre of gravity than was ideal for a sumo wrestler, and he seemed to struggle when promoted above the mid ""maegashira"" ranks. Though he managed to reach the fourth highest ""komusubi"" ranking in July 1990 he could not maintain the rank, winning only two bouts there. He was demoted from the top division after the September 1991 tournament and announced his retirement in May 1992. His career coincided exactly with that of his stablemate Hokutoumi, who made his debut alongside him in March 1979 and also retired in May 1992. At Takanofuji's own request, it was the previous head of Kokonoe stable, ex-""yokozuna"" Kitanofuji, his long time coach, and not his successor, ex-""yokozuna"" Chiyonofuji, who performed the topknot cutting at Takanofuji's official retirement ceremony or ""danpatsu-shiki."""
"Takanofuji's most common winning ""kimarite"" were ""yori-kiri"" (force out), ""hataki-komi"" (slap down) and ""tsuki-otoshi"" (thrust over)."
"Reverting to his real name, he joined the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion in June 1993, making his debut in February 1994. Yasuda spent the majority of the 1990s as an undercard wrestler, primarily competing in opening matches or as the fall guy in tag team matches with wrestlers such as Shinya Hashimoto and Kensuke Sasaki, achieving little success. In late 2000, Yasuda, along with Kazuyuki Fujita, became somewhat of a pet project for Antonio Inoki, and both of them were sent to the United States to train in mixed martial arts. Yasuda returned to Japan soon after, and was victorious in his first fight against veteran Masaaki Satake at Pride 13. Yasuda's win helped further legitimise him as a pro wrestler in the eyes of Inoki, and this was rewarded with Yasuda reaching the semi finals of the 2001 G1 Climax, where he lost to Keiji Mutoh. After earning one win and one loss in MMA throughout 2001, Yasuda earned the biggest win of his career in December by choking out veteran Jerome Le Banner. His defeat of Jerome led to Yasuda's stock in New Japan skyrocketing almost overnight, and Yasuda soon found himself elevated from over the hill veteran to top title contender in early 2002. Yasuda earned the biggest win of his pro wrestling career on February 16, defeating Yuji Nagata in a tournament to win the vacant IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Yasuda held the title for 48 days, before dropping it to Nagata in April. In August 2002, Yasuda and Kantaro Hoshino formed their own faction, the Makai Club, a group of wrestlers primarily with MMA backgrounds who worshipped Antonio Inoki like a god. Yasuda was viewed as the leader of the group, and in early 2003 he partnered up with his second in command Kazunari Murakami to enter the IWGP Tag Team Championship #1 Contender Tournament. Despite losing to Jim Steele and Mike Barton in the final, an injury to Steele would give the title to shot to Murakami and Yasuda who unsuccessfully challenged Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono on February 16. Having retired from MMA, the aging Yasuda's position in the New Japan card began to fall again, and in late 2004 he left the promotion. After leaving New Japan, he started making sporadic appearances for ZERO-ONE and Hustle."
"In October 2007 he reportedly attempted to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, using a yeontan. A friend however, interrupted the alleged attempt. He was hospitalized with fears of possible brain damage, but this proved not to be the case and he eventually made a return to wrestling. Speaking to ""Tokyo Sports"" Yasuda later denied attempting suicide, saying the poisoning was accidental. On January 11, 2011, Yasuda announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He wrestled his final match on February 4, 2011, in which he was defeated by Genichiro Tenryu."
"Though very past his prime physically, Yasuda made his transition to mixed martial arts as a NJPW representative in March 2001. He had his debut at the PRIDE 13 against similarly retired kickboxer and karate champion Masaaki Satake. Yasuda received damage and bled from his face, but he nullified most of Satake' attacks by rushing him through sumo techniques against the ropes every time they were separated. At the end, the unanimous decision was given to Yasuda for controlling the fight."
"Yasuda returned to MMA in the K-1 Andy Hug Memorial event, taking on Rene Rooze in a special rules match, but he lost via head kick KO at the third round. He would be more successful in December 2001, when he fought popular K-1 player Jerome Le Banner at an Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye event: Yasuda managed to take him down and submit him by pressing his forearm against Le Banner's throat, getting the biggest win of his MMA career."
"He would later lost to fellow NJPW wrestler Kazuyuki Fujita in an Universal Fighting-Arts Organization event. Yasuda then fought superheavyweight kickboxer Jan Nortje, but he had to retire from the match when he hurt a leg seriously. His last fight was a rematch against Rooze, losing the fight again, this time by TKO."

"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in). In addition, overlapping regions of coplanar faces can cancel each other out. The difference between the fillings of this polyhedron is very slight, but still present."

"Sounds like Chicken also had rotation on the radio station Triple J, mainly with their double A-side single ""Take a Bullet to the Grave""/""El Chupanebre"" and their other single ""Global Domination""."
"After their breakup, SLC released all their previous recordings under Creative Commons (by-nc-sa), for free online distribution."
The band reformed for a once-off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for independent record store Fist2face.
"Sounds Like Chicken began in 1999 when Nathanael Kitingan (Nat Kitingan) met Nyall Dawson at Monash University in Melbourne. Nat and Nyall attempted to start an unnamed musical project with Hugh Ogilvy (also from Monash University) featuring Nyall on electric violin, Hugh on guitar and Nat on drums. This trio did not get off the ground and so brothers Joel and Elliot Dawson joined to form Sounds Like Chicken, a ska project taking influences from Voodoo Glow Skulls, The O.C. Supertones, The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy. This early lineup was Nyall (vocals), Nat (bass/vocals), Elliot (drums), Joel (sax) and Hugh (guitar)."
"Sounds Like Chicken's first show was at Joel's 21st birthday party in mid-2000. Hugh left the band at the end of 2000 due to other commitments and was replaced by Tom Dowding on guitar. Tom was an extremely accomplished bass player and so Nat decided to swap to playing guitar so that Tom's talent could be fully utilised. The band decided they needed another horn and so after a number of unsuccessful audition attempts, in 2001 Nat met Natalie Parker at university and invited her to a practice. Natalie was initially apprehensive but was eventually convinced by the boys to join the band. During her second practice she was already laying down trumpet tracks on their first demo recording which ended up becoming the band's self-made demo EP, ""Slowly Going the Way of the Chicken""."
"Sounds Like Chicken toured interstate for the first time under this lineup in September 2001, playing in Sydney and Canberra and also at the Black Stump Music Festival. In 2002, Tom Dowding departed from Sounds like Chicken to be replaced by Joshua Diemar on bass. It was in this year that Sounds Like Chicken released their first studio EP, ""I Am Gibbon, Hear Me Roar"", produced by David Carr (Antiskeptic, Taxiride). The EP gave the band airplay on community radio, Christian radio, and Triple J."
"In early 2004, the band were signed to Boomtown Records, a Melbourne-based indie record label distributing through Shock Records and MGM. Deciding that a bigger ensemble was required, Sounds Like Chicken asked long-time friend Dave Powys (ex Staff Discount and Never In Doubt) to join on second guitar, making them a 7-piece band. Dave moved down from Canberra and recorded on the single Global Domination, their first release with Boomtown and distributed through MGM. The single received national airplay and spot airplay on Triple J and was sold out within 2 months of its limited pressing. It was noted that producer Dave Carr's production was a big step up from previous releases."
"It was shortly after this that the band decided it was time to move on and the band was without a bass-player. They were booked in to record an album and so asked if Carlos Echeverria (ex Know Exit and Wishful Thinking) would fill in and record bass for them. Their first full-length album, ""...Like a Cannonball to the Ocean Floor"" was released late that year through Boomtown, also doing well on the airwaves. The album drew acclaim from reviewers as a ""brilliantly released debut album"", although the length of 17 tracks drew some criticism. Sounds Like Chicken did a joint national tour with label-mates Wishful Thinking to launch the album. Carlos officially joined shortly after the album's release."
"In early 2005 founding member and manager, Elliot, decided to part ways with the band. Mike ""Carcass"" Haydon (of Melbourne band ""The Knockabouts""), only 17 at the time, was able to fill the role of drummer. Mike had been a tour roadie for the band for the past 3 years and so was already well-acquainted with their songs. That year Sounds Like Chicken released the second double-A side single off the album, ""Take a Bullet to the Grave/El Chupanebre"" through Boomtown Records, and completed a national tour over 3 months to launch it."
"On 3 November 2006, founding member, Nyall Dawson, announced his decision to depart the band early in 2007."
Sounds Like Chicken have played and toured with numerous well-known Australian and international acts and have been featured on various international and Australian compilations and soundtracks such as Turn the Other Cheek Volume 1.
"On 18 December 2006 Sounds Like Chicken announced they were calling it a day in a bulletin released on the band's MySpace. The main factors in the breakup was the future departure of Nyall Dawson and other key members of the band, the band stated..."
"""""We guess it’s time for some of us to move on. There was other plans for our lives and with the impending departure of some key members, we felt that SLC would simply not be SLC if we went on without them. We all feel at peace about this decision."""""
"Shortly after, the band announced plans for an Australia wide farewell tour to take place in February–March 2007, along with the release of a final limited-edition compilation disk titled ""Death To The Crow"" to coincide with the tour."
"Sounds Like Chicken's final show was held at TLC Bayswater, Victoria on Saturday 17 March 2007."
The band's entire discography (except for Death To The Crow) was made available for free download on their website and on Jamendo
"In April 2007, former SLC members Mike Haydon, Dave Powys, Ben Hobson, Nat Kitingan and Joel Dawson together with new addition Paul McCasker formed reggae band San Salvador. They released an EP ""How To Hear"", two singles ""Like a Train"" and ""Spark the Fire"" and later the mini-album ""Rugged Are The Mountains""."
Former members Mike Haydon and Joe Ireland later joined indie band The Middle East which featured two tracks in Triple J's hottest 100 in 2010. Dave Powys also went on to join indie folk band The Paper Kites.
"On 31 March 2014 it was announced on the band's fan-run Facebook page that they were reforming for a once off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for Fist2face record store. The show was held at Ding Dong Lounge and featured supports from Antiskeptic, The Ramshackle Army, Best Before, Payoff and more. The show sold out."

"Full Scale (formerly known as Full Scale Deflection, later known as Full Scale Revolution) is an Australian alternative metal band that formed in Perth, Western Australia during 1998. The band relocated to Melbourne in 2001."
"Full Scale released two extended plays; ""Black Arrows"" and ""White Arrows"" both in 2003 on Popstar Records. They also released a self-titled studio album issued in 2005 on Columbia Records, ""Full Scale""."
"Full Scale were formed in 1998 in Perth as Full Scale Deflection. By 1999, they consisted of Ezekiel the Ox on lead vocals, Nic Frey on drums, Chris Frey on bass guitar, Forrester Savell on synthesiser, and Jimmy Tee on guitar. Matt Crute (aka Crutey) soon replaced Nic Frey on drums. Rob Kaay replaced Chris Frey on bass guitar by 2000. They released the album, ""Symptoms of Chaos"", on 11 November 2000. The band dropped the word Deflection from their name and then moved to Melbourne in 2001. Despite playing their original songs for some of their shows, they developed new music."
"Kaay and Andrew McGuiness (a lawyer) formed a record label, Popstar Records, and Full Scale released their debut extended play, ""Black Arrows"" in March 2003. This was followed by a second EP, ""White Arrows"" in August. There was a brief line-up change; Tee left the band, being replaced by Tristan Ross for about six months. Under the management of Kaay, the band toured the east coast extensively."
"According to Allmusic's reviewer, Johnny Loftus, ""the band's hard-hitting, gristly sound – led by Ox's vocal seethe – caught the interest of American majors"". By the end of the year, Tee rejoined and the band moved to Los Angeles where they were signed to Columbia Records (SonyBMG) and released their self-titled album, ""Full Scale"", on 8 March 2005. After the album's release they toured the United States as the opening act for US rap rock band, Hed PE."
"Upon returning to Australia, Crutey and Tee decided to play one last show with the band and Ben Brennan (Seven, Full Scale Revolution) played his first show with Full Scale on bass guitar at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne on 17 March 2006. Ox moved on to a new group, Mammal."
"In January 2016 Ox and Tee announced that they were reforming the band with a new rhythm section of Chris Webber (Webbsy) and Leigh Miller. They announced February 2016 tour dates in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth."
"The band released a new song entitled ""Jurassic Graveyard"" in January 2018, and embarked on a national tour of Australia. So far, no new album has yet been announced."
"After Full Scale, Ox became the front man for Mammal, from March 2006, they released an EP, ""Mammal"". Their single ""Slaves"" was produced by Ox's ex-bandmate Savell. They later released two albums ("""" and ""The Majority"") and disbanded in 2009. He was the front-man of The Ox & the Fury with Brennan, Lucius Borich and Dom Italiano, as an alternate country music group. Ox also appeared in theatre, and produced music for hip hop groups. Ox later became the front man of Over-Reactor (based in Melbourne), which released their album, ""Lose Your Delusion""."
"Kaay became an author and entrepreneur. He used the business management skills he had acquired to build Full Scale into the band that was signed to Columbia Records to start his own Australian company. Right after Full Scale, he joined Sunk Loto in September 2006, until they broke up in December 2007. After that he worked with the Brown brothers for nearly two years on an unreleased project tentatively entitled, ""The Flood The Flood"". Deciding to retire from the live-music-touring scene in 2008, Kaay released a series of books, ""Robkaay Journals. Vol. I, My Glorious Nightmare"" (2008), based on his recollections of his music career over a period of ten years. Vol. II followed in 2010 as ""This is what it's really like being in a band"". He has also written two fantasy fiction novels, ""Silverbirch: A Tear in the Fabric of the Night Sky""(2009) and Silverbirch: Fall of the Epicenter. His first Silverbirch novel cracked the Top 10 Amazon.com chart in its first week of release in the Science Fiction category.

Players can take two different jets into battle and switch between them using a collectable power-up. In all, there are nine different airplanes, thirty-three arenas, and five game modes.

"The PlayStation 2 version received ""mixed"" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Frank Provo, writing for GameSpot, said of the same console version that the developers deserved credit for ""creating a dog-fighting system that is simultaneously intuitive and diverse"". He went on to criticize the graphics, specifically, ""muddy textures, 2D explosions, blocky structures, disappearing polygons, and frequent slowdown"". David Smith of IGN shared similar sentiment with regards to the graphics of the same console version, noting the dull palette of greens, browns, and grays and the muddy textures. He went on to praise the simple controls and entertaining voice acting, but denounced the gameplay as dull and easy. He concluded that ""Four-player support should have been included."""

"The administrative divisions of Illinois are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and special-purpose districts. The basic subdivisions of Illinois are the 102 counties. Illinois has more units of local government than any other state—over 8,000 in all. The Constitution of 1970 created, for the first time in Illinois, a type of ""home rule"", which allows localities to govern themselves to a certain extent. Illinois also has several types of school districts and additional units of government that oversee many other functions."
"Property taxes are a major source of tax revenue for local government taxing districts. The property tax is a local tax, imposed by counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, and special taxation districts. The property tax in Illinois is imposed only on real property. Illinois counties, townships, cities, and villages may also promulgate local ordinances."
Autocomplete allows quickly typing names in the context of the code. It can be further improved to assist the developer.
"For example, in an XML context, when the developer types an opening tag ""<"" he is offered a list of tags via autocomplete, contextualized following the DTD or XML schema of the document. As the developer types more letters, the offered choices are filtered to only retain the relevant completions. When the developer finally completes the tag, the editor automatically generates the closing tag."
"Other autocomplete techniques exist. For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can just type in the first letter if lowercase and the uppercase letters from a type/variable name then press Ctrl+space to be offered all the choices that match the entered letters that are valid for the current context (class name, interface name, variable or field names)."
Code snippets allow the developer to add a complex coding structure by typing a minimal amount of text. Code snippets can only be used in a valid context (statements snippets are only offered when you can insert statements).
"For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can type in ""instanceof"" then press Ctrl+space which will replace ""instanceof"" by the following code snippet:"
"This code snippet can be further customised by the developer, with the IDE placing the cursor:"
= = = First Leisure Corporation = = =
First Leisure Corporation plc was a leisure operator in the United Kingdom between the years 1981 and 2004.
"Originally based in Soho Square, London, and with other offices in Blackpool and Leicester, its operations included Blackpool Tower, the WinterGardens and all three of Blackpool's piers, as well as five other piers, health and fitness clubs, nightclubs and bars, tenpin bowling centres and other mainstream UK high street entertainment venues."
"In 2000 a management buyout (MBO) financed by 3i and PPM Holdings saw First Leisure shed all but its Nightclubs and Bars division, which retained the First Leisure brand and consisted of approximately fifty mainstream high street venues. The MBO saw the company de-listing from the stock exchange (whilst retaining its plc status) and moving its operations to Leicester."
"At that time, the Health and Fitness chain was spun off as Esporta."
"By 2004, the company had shrunk its operations from 50 to 25 nightclubs; in so doing, it had sold its premises leases to rival operators. A clause of such sales mandated that should those new operators be unable to meet their obligations under the leases that they would be automatically reassigned to First Leisure with little warning or ceremony."
"At the end of 2004, such an automatic reassignment took place following competitors' defaults on a number of previously sold leases. Unable to meet the dramatically increased month-to-month obligations brought about by this mandatory re-acquisition, the company was subject to a Winding Up Order by a trade creditor and hence placed into Compulsory Liquidation by the Official Receiver."
"A 'Phoenix' company, named The Nightclub Company, was formed virtually immediately by the incumbent management team. Such an operation was short-lived, however, and it too was placed into administration in 2005. The precise circumstances regarding the collapse of TNC are unclear."
"The remaining leases were sold, mostly to long-time rival Luminar Leisure."

"Gillis van Stralen, Antonie's father, was a textile merchant. The family originated in Weert but moved between 1584-1590 to Gorkum, presumably because of Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma's armies marching through the area."
"We don't hear much from Anthonie Verstraelen, until 1635 when he married Catalijntje van Oosten from Antwerp. The location of the wedding is unknown. The couple went to live in Oude Spiegelstraat, near Singel. In Amsterdam Antonie got into a dispute with the Sint Lucasgilde, for its laxness in allowing in too many non-citizen painters."
"In 1641 he was buried in the Westerkerk. In 1644 his two children inherited two hundred guilder each from the sale of their father's paintings. The paintings must have been sold very cheap.

The game launched with 25 single-player missions, with an additional campaign released as downloadable content. The console versions feature an exclusive cooperative horde mode."
"After years of rumored or cancelled handheld ""Halo"" projects, ""Spartan Assault"" was the franchise's first mobile game.

"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" is a shooter game where players view gameplay from an overhead top-down perspective. The control method for the game depends on the host device. On touchscreen mobile devices, players control the character through virtual joysticks—the left stick controls movement and the right stick controls the direction of the character's fire—along with buttons along the edge of the screen.

"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" takes place in the 26th century between the events of ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"". Following the events of ""Halo 3"", the human UNSC and alien Covenant separatists signed a ceasefire to end a decades-long war. Gameplay follows through the perspective of the Spartan supersoldiers Sarah Palmer or Spartan Davis. The campaign is divided into chapters, then further subdivided into individual missions."
"Spartans Palmer and Davis are stationed on the planet Draetheus V when it comes under attack from a rogue group of Covenant who have ignored the ceasefire. Palmer and Davis work to repel the invaders. This new Covenant leadership discovers that Draetheus' moon is actually a weapon built by an ancient race known as the Forerunners. The Covenant activates the weapon, tearing apart Draetheus and triggering an evacuation. Spartan Davis gives his life to allow the remaining human forces enough time to escape. Spartan Palmer tracks down the Covenant leader Merg Vol, kills him, sabotages the Forerunner weapon, and escapes the moon."

""If we'd gone down the first-person shooter route, we might have built something compelling, but it couldn't on its own merit play as well as a traditional ""Halo"" game,"" O'Connor recalled. While focusing on optimizing the game for touch controls, the developers wanted to make sure the elements that made ""Halo"" distinctive—its weapon sandbox, abilities, and look—remained. The focus on a mobile game experience also meant that the developers broke up the game's missions into smaller chunks for short playthroughs.

"Because the game was designed to be played on mobile devices, Salta and the music team worked to make sure audio quality would be high on small mobile speakers as well as through headphones or higher-end hardware.

"AVX-512 is not the first 512-bit SIMD instruction set that Intel has introduced in processors: the earlier 512-bit SIMD instructions used in the first generation Xeon Phi coprocessors, derived from Intel's Larrabee project, are similar but not binary compatible and only partially source compatible."
AVX-512 consists of multiple extensions that may be implemented independently. This policy is a departure from the historical requirement of implementing the entire instruction block. Only the core extension AVX-512F (AVX-512 Foundation) is required by all AVX-512 implementations.
"The AVX-512 instruction set consists of several separate sets each having their own unique CPUID feature bit; however, they are typically grouped by the processor generation that implements them."
"The VEX prefix used by AVX and AVX2, while flexible, did not leave enough room for the features Intel wanted to add to AVX-512. This has led them to define a new prefix called EVEX."
"Compared to VEX, EVEX adds the following benefits:"
"The extended registers, SIMD width bit, and opmask registers of AVX-512 are mandatory and all require support from the OS."
"The AVX-512 instructions are designed to mix with 128/256-bit AVX/AVX2 instructions without a performance penalty. However, AVX-512VL extensions allows the use of AVX-512 instructions on 128/256-bit registers XMM/YMM, so most SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions have new AVX-512 versions encoded with the EVEX prefix which allow access to new features such as opmask and additional registers. Unlike AVX-256, the new instructions do not have new mnemonics but share namespace with AVX, making the distinction between VEX and EVEX encoded versions of an instruction ambiguous in the source code. Since AVX-512F only works on 32- and 64-bit values, SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions that operate on bytes or words are available only with the AVX-512BW extension (Byte & Word support)."
"The width of the SIMD register file is increased from 256 bits to 512 bits, and expanded from 16 to a total of 32 registers ZMM0-ZMM31. These registers can be addressed as 256 bit YMM registers from AVX extensions and 128-bit XMM registers from Streaming SIMD Extensions, and legacy AVX and SSE instructions can be extended to operate on the 16 additional registers XMM16-XMM31 and YMM16-YMM31 when using EVEX encoded form."
"Most AVX-512 instructions may indicate one of 8 opmask registers (k0–k7). For instructions which use a mask register as an opmask, register `k0` is special: a hardcoded constant used to indicate unmasked operations. For other operations, such as those that write to an opmask register or perform arithmetic or logical operations, `k0` is a functioning, valid register. In most instructions, the opmask is used to control which values are written to the destination. A flag controls the opmask behavior, which can either be ""zero"", which zeros everything not selected by the mask, or ""merge"", which leaves everything not selected untouched. The merge behavior is identical to the blend instructions."
"The opmask registers are normally 16 bits wide, but can be up to 64 bits with the AVX-512BW extension. How many of the bits are actually used, though, depends on the vector type of the instructions masked. For the 32-bit single float or double words, 16 bits are used to mask the 16 elements in a 512-bit register. For double float and quad words, at most 8 mask bits are used."
"The opmask register is the reason why several bitwise instructions which naturally have no element widths had them added in AVX-512. For instance, bitwise AND, OR or 128-bit shuffle now exist in both double-word and quad-word variants with the only difference being in the final masking."
"The opmask registers have a new mini extension of instructions operating directly on them. Unlike the rest of the AVX-512 instructions, these instructions are all VEX encoded. The initial opmask instructions are all 16-bit (Word) versions. With AVX-512DQ 8-bit (Byte) versions were added to better match the needs of masking 8 64-bit values, and with AVX-512BW 32-bit (Double) and 64-bit (Quad) versions were added so they can mask up to 64 8-bit values. The instructions KORTEST and KTEST can be used to set the x86 flags based on mask registers, so that they may be used together with non-SIMD x86 branch and conditional instructions."
"Many AVX-512 instructions are simply EVEX versions of old SSE or AVX instructions. There are, however, several new instructions, and old instructions that have been replaced with new AVX-512 versions. The new or majorly reworked instructions are listed below. These ""foundation"" instructions also include the extensions from AVX-512VL and AVX-512BW since those extensions merely add new versions of these instructions instead of new instructions."
A possible new utilization for crambe are biofuels since the oil composition is suitable for processing.
"Genetically, ""C. abyssinica"" has a set of 2n=90 chromosomes and is hexaploid. However, it shows low genetic variation in important agronomic traits, e.g. erucic acid content. Thus, improvement of cultivars through selection is difficult to achieve. A new source of variation could be found in the related taxon ""Crambe hispanica"". Recent efforts are found in the field of gene technology. To overcome the limited genetic variation, gene technology has been used in recent years to improve different important agronomic traits of crambe. Site-directed mutagenesis could be another tool for further improvement of the crop. However, the genetic control of many agronomic traits are unknown, thus the potential for genetic improvement is limited at the moment. Additionally further research aims to assess the potential of using the seed cake in protein-based plastic production and to find further uses for the whole plant."

"231st Street is a local station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of West 231st Street and Broadway in the Kingsbridge and Riverdale sections of the Bronx, it is served by the 1 train at all times."
"This station opened on January 27, 1907 as the 230th Street station, but was built near the site of the originally proposed northern terminus of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line at Bailey Avenue and 230th Street, a block southeast of the current station. It was also near two former Kingsbridge railroad stations owned by two separate branches inherited by the New York Central Railroad; one was along a former segment of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad (now the Hudson Line), and the other was for the New York and Putnam Railroad (now abandoned)."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On July 9, 1948, the platform extensions at stations between 207th Street and 238th Street were opened for use at the cost of $423,000."
"In 2002, it was announced that 231st Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations. The station was extensively renovated in 2003–2004, which included installation of elevators for both platforms to make it fully ADA-accessible and replacing the exit-only turnstiles on the 242nd Street-bound platform with High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles ones, allowing both access and exit from that side."
"This elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center track that bypasses this station is not used in revenue service. This is the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line's southernmost station in the Bronx (Marble Hill–225th Street station is physically on the mainland of New York State, but legally part of Manhattan)."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and outlines in the center and green waist-high, steel fences at either ends with lampposts at regular intervals. The platforms are offset with the Manhattan-bound platform to the south of the 242nd Street-bound one. The station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering."
"There are two sets of artwork at this station. One of them was made in 1991 and is called ""Elevated Nature I-IV"" by Wopo Holup. It consists of gray marble tiles with a green border on the platform walls of the station house. It is also located at four other stations on this line. The other artwork was made in 2007 by Felipe Galindo and is called ""Magic Realism in Kingsbridge"". It consists of stained glass panels on the platform windscreens depicting images of the surrounding area."
"Each platform has an adjacent same-level station house in the center. However, only the Manhattan-bound platform is open to the public. A set of doors from the platform leads to a small waiting area and a bank of turnstiles. On the 242nd Street-bound platform, a set of High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles lead to a passageway around the station house separated from the platform by a metal fence."
"Outside fare control on the Manhattan-bound platform, there is a token booth, two staircases going down to either western corners of 231st Street and Broadway, and one elevator going down to the southwest corner. Two emergency gates on the platform lead directly to each of the staircases. Outside fare control on the 242nd Street-bound platform, there are two staircases going down to either eastern corners of 231st Street and Broadway and one elevator going down to the northeast corner."

"Strickland had libertarian, socialist and atheist ideas. His anti-British and anti-imperialist activities were widely reported in the English-speaking press, making him somewhat of a celebrity, while his wandering led him to be dubbed a ""gypsy."""
"Strickland believed he was the subject of assassination plots by the British. In a letter to a London newspaper, he wrote, ""The vulgar, ungentlemanly, and, indeed, murderous persecution to which I have been subjected is exclusively British."" According to British intelligence, Strickland was thought to be of ""doubtful sanity."""
"In 1909, Guy Aldred, founder of the Glasgow Anarchist Group, was sentenced to 12 months' hard labour for printing the August issue of ""The Indian Sociologist"", an Indian nationalist newspaper edited by Shyamji Krishnavarma. Strickland heard of Aldred's action and sent him a telegram of congratulations at the prison and a cheque for £10. Several of his writings were published in ""The Indian Sociologist"" between 1911–14."
As related by Albert Meltzer:
"""After the publication of Hyde Park in 1938 support for Aldred in London fell off and he had burned his bridges in London and Glasgow, but then an extraordinary chance ended his days of poverty. Sir Walter Strickland, a millionaire whose family practically owned Malta, had during the First World War taken to him and was disgusted with the British Government after the Versailles Treaty. In acknowledgment of the newly created State of Czechoslovakia, the first fruits of League of Nations liberal idealism, Strickland became naturalised Czech (1923), though he never went to that country. In 1938 Strickland died and left a fortune to Aldred, who promptly formed the Strickland Press, bought a hall, bookshop and machinery and proceeded reprinting all his old pamphlets, before actually getting the money. Then the Strickland relatives brought a suit saying the will was invalid. Strickland had said in his will he left the money to Aldred ""for socialist and atheist propaganda"", illegal under Czech law. There was a complicated legal case which ended as such things usually do, with the money in the hands of the lawyers. Aldred, used to defending his own cases personally and handling courts with ease on matters of obstruction and sedition, found himself outgunned among the moneyed lawyers."""
"According to John Taylor Caldwell: ""Walter was an eccentric. He preferred books to the pursuits of normal young men of his class, and had no interest in sport, drink, gambling or women. His father was disappointed and disgusted. One day when he was having it out with Walter (probably not for the first time) about his unsatisfactory life-style, and the fact that he was nearing forty and still not married, Walter rose from the table and, so the story goes, proposed to the first girl he met, who happened to be the kitchen maid."""
"He gave Sun Yat Sen £10,000 ""to help him start a revolt against the Emperor of China."""

The Rough Guide to True Crime is a non-fiction paperback reference guide to national and international true crime cases by American crime writer Cathy Scott. It was released in the UK and US in August 2009 by Penguin Books through its Rough Guides imprint.
"""The Rough Guide to True Crime"" is a compilation of a variety of cases, including historic crimes, with sections broken down by the type of offenses and who committed them. It includes black-and-white photos as illustration. Psychological profiles are included throughout by forensic expert Dr. Louis B. Schlesinger, who explains the psychology of serial killers, murderers, hit men and burglars. The book features serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, mob hitman Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski, John Wayne Glover ""The Granny Killer,"" and British ""Doctor of Death"" Harold Shipman."
"Scott's story from ""The Rough Guide to True Crime"" about mob enforcer Herbert Blitzstein was selected for inclusion in the July 2012 retrospective of crime writing, ""Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre""."
"The author appeared on BlogTalkRadio's ""True Murder"" show and described some of the crimes included in the book that were committed in the 19th century as ""a different time in America, where people like Billy the Kid could walk in and just rob a bank"" and get away with it. And while ""there was nothing glamorous about what they did, they are a part of lore."""

Kashubian Americans are Americans of Kashubian descent.
"The two earliest Kashubian American settlements in the United States were in the Winona, Minnesota area, including the towns of Fountain City, Pine Creek, Dodge, and Trempealeau across the Mississippi River in Wisconsin, and in Portage County, Wisconsin, including the towns of Polonia, Sharon, and Hull. The Winona settlement is traditionally dated to 1855, but actually began in 1859; the Portage County settlement can definitely be traced back to 1858. Winona is dubbed ""Kashubian Capital of America"", because of the largest population of Kashubians there."
"After the American Civil War and the German Kulturkampf of the early 1870s, Kashubians emigrated to the United States in much larger numbers. While some headed for the Winona area and for Portage County, many Kashubians wound up living in major urban centers such as Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, and Milwaukee. A smaller number of Kashubians settled in small farming communities scattered throughout Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana. By the turn of the century, Kashubian Americans tended to identify themselves completely as Polish Americans, although in Winona (at least) the Kashubian language would survive for another generation or two."

The hospital was named in honor of Frances Siedliska, the founder of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. The hospital opened on March 18, 1937 – one day ahead of schedule – to care for victims of the New London School explosion."
"In 1948, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth completed the purchase of the hospital from the City of Tyler and in October 1965, Mother Frances Week was celebrated in Tyler, dedicating a new wing. This $4.5 million wing added 110 new patient beds and a new cafeteria to the hospital."
"In 1934, The Trinity Clinic began as The Bryant Clinic. It was founded by Dr. William Howard Bryant and Dr. Sidney W. Bradford. The Bryant Clinic received the first call for help in Tyler to treat the victims of the New London tragedy. In 1948, The Bryant Clinic changed its name to The Medical & Surgical Clinic and later, with the addition of two other Tyler-area medical practices, became Trinity Clinic. Today, Trinity Clinic is the area's biggest multi-specialty medical group, with over 300 providers representing 38 specialties in 36 clinic locations in East Texas."

The firm was formally incorporated on May 23, 1899, and held the distinction of being ""the largest business of its kind outside of New York City."" The store was first located at 187-189 South State Street in the Chicago Loop (the city of Chicago's central business and shopping district) and later moved to the John Crerar Library building at 150 North Michigan Avenue where it remained until the department store ceased operations in 1979. At the time of its closing, Shayne's was a department store specializing in women's ready-to-wear, couture and furs."
"The achievements of the Shayne brothers in the manufacture of fine furs helped to bring a newfound respect for American manufactured furs which were primarily reserved only for the elite European manufacturing houses of Russia, France and Germany. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (also known as the Chicago's World Fair), ""The New York Times"" reported, ""The joint exhibit of C.C Shayne of New-York and John T. Shayne of this city has received awards which, by reason of their number and their language, leave no doubt that the Shayne fur products surpass those made in any part of the world."""
"On July 10, 1894, John T. Shayne commented to the Committee of Finance of the United States Senate that U.S. furriers were losing significant income from garments that were manufactured overseas and then brought back to this country duty-free by tourists. Shayne stated to the Committee of Finance, ""I could get up a petition that would almost reach from the Senate Chamber to the White House, but do not wish to encroach upon your valuable time."""
John T. Shayne & Company was one of the earliest Chicago retailers to join in America's burgeoning mail order business during the turn of the 20th century. Shayne's first mail order publication dates back to 1906 and is featured in the Chicago Public Library Trade Catalog Collection at the Harold Washington Library.
"Mail order merchandising played an important role in retail distribution during the 20th century. These catalogues provided rural communities access to an array of merchandise; items ranging from tooth paste to prefabricated houses were marketed to small towns and remote rural communities, transforming the way American's purchased goods."
"Chicago area retailers were among the nation's first companies to publish mail orders. The city was ideally suited for America's growing mail order business due to its central location, access to a national rail system and advances made in mail delivery. Chicago became a nationally recognized city through the many images that found their way into these mail order catalogs. These publications shaped the nation's perspective of Chicago and encouraged tourism to the city."
"On March 21, 1899, ""The New York Times"" reported, ""John T. Shayne, a wealthy furrier, and a prominent Democratic politician, brother of C.C. Shayne of New York, was shot, and probably fatally wounded, this afternoon by Harry H. Hammond, a tailor.

"National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a poverty alleviation project implemented by Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. This scheme is focused on promoting self-employment and organization of rural poor. The basic idea behind this programme is to organize the poor into SHG (Self Help Groups) groups and make them capable for self-employment. In 1999 after restructuring Integrated Rural Development Programme(IRDP), Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) launched Swarnajayanti Grameen Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) to focus on promoting self-employment among rural poor. SGSY is now remodeled to form NRLM thereby plugging the shortfalls of SGSY programme. This scheme was launched in 2011 with a budget of $5.1 billion and is one of the flagship programmes of Ministry of Rural Development. This is one of the world's largest initiatives to improve the livelihood of poor. This programme is supported by the World Bank with a credit of $1 Billion. The scheme was succeeded by Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana on 25 September 2015."
The basic idea behind this scheme was to form SHG groups and help them to start some entrepreneurial activities but later SHG group failed.
"The core belief of National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is that the poor have innate capabilities and a strong desire to come out of poverty. They are entrepreneurial, an essential coping mechanism to survive under conditions of poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful livelihoods and enable them to come out of poverty."
"""To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self- employment and skilled wage employment opportunities resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong and sustainable grassroots institutions of the poor."""
The core values which guide all the activities under NRLM are as follows:
"In order to build, support and sustain livelihood of the poor, NRLM will harness their capability and complement them with capacities (information, knowledge, skill, tools, finance and collectivization), so that the poor can deal with the external world.

An XML document has an information set if it is well-formed and satisfies the namespace constraints. There is no requirement for an XML document to be valid in order to have an information set.
An information set can contain up to eleven different types of information items:
"XML was initially developed without a formal definition of its infoset. This was only formalised by later work beginning in 1999, first published as a separate W3C Working Draft at the end of December that year."
"Infoset recommendation Second Edition was adopted on 4 February, 2004. If a 2.0 version of the XML standard is ever published, it is likely that this would absorb the Infoset recommendation as an integral part of that standard."
"Infoset augmentation or infoset modification refers to the process of modifying the infoset during schema validation, for example by adding default attributes. The augmented infoset is called the post-schema-validation infoset, or PSVI."
"Infoset augmentation is somewhat controversial, with claims that it is a violation of modularity and tends to cause interoperability problems, since applications get different information depending on whether or not validation has been performed."
Infoset augmentation is supported by XML Schema but not RELAX NG.
"Typically, XML Information Set is serialized as XML. There are also serialization formats for Binary XML, CSV, and JSON."

"Tubism is a term coined by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles in 1911 to describe the style of French artist Fernand Léger. Meant as derision, the term was inspired by Léger's idiosyncratic version of Cubism, in which he emphasized cylindrical shapes. The style was developed by Léger in his paintings of 1909–1919, such as ""Nudes in the Forest"" (1909-10) and ""The Card Players"" (1917)."

"Doomdark's Revenge is a role-playing and strategy video game developed by Mike Singleton and published by Beyond Software for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC in 1985. It is a sequel to Singleton's 1984 seminal ""The Lords of Midnight"" and has similar game mechanics but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased."
"In ""Doomdark's Revenge"", the hero of the first game, Luxor the Moonprince, goes into the savage wastes of Icemark to save his son Morkin and defeat the evil Empress Shareth, daughter of his enemy Doomdark. Despite what the title suggests, Doomdark himself, who was killed in the first game, does not actually return in the sequel."
"Like its predecessor, ""Doomdark's Revenge"" was a major critical success and a commercial hit. It was supposed to be followed the sequel titled ""Eye of the Moon"" in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, """", was eventually released in 1995."
A novelisation of Doomdark's Revenge has been announced and is planned to be released towards the end of 2019
"The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, the Barbarians, the Dwarfs, the Giants, and the Icelords. The main difference between this game and ""The Lords of Midnight"" is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. The enemy leader, Shareth, also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers. This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some lords can only be recruited by certain others. Certain lords are vassals of certain others, and some may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not, however, automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game. There are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle', as well as magic crowns, and the landscape and its features hold many surprises for the player."
"""Doomdark's Revenge"" reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of the main protagonist Luxor. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the mere rescue of Luxor's son Morkin from Shareth's spell of enchantment and retreat to Midnight, to the complete destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, as well as Luxor's companions Rorthron and Tarithel."
