What's the difference between displacement and distance?
"Displacement is how fast it's going, the speed."
Miles per hour.
"Show me something that is erm arm's length away from, from your right shoulder."
"Okay, show me something else that's an arm's length from  That's your right shoulder isn't it."
Arm's length .
I was expecting you to go like this.
"Right, okay, that, show me something else that's arm's length from your right shoulder."
Right.
Up there
Right.
That's distance.
Mm.
Displacement is distance in a specified direction.
"So if I said show me something that's arm's length from your right shoulder north, or up, or west or some way, okay, or on a bearing of thirty seven degrees"
Yeah.
that's displacement.
"We don't usually tend to bother with distance much, so when, when the police measure your speed, they're actually measuring"
My dad's
your
my dad's speed.
your dad's speed.
Not mine.
You don't drive?
"No, no, no."
"Yeah, of course."
Can't be my speed.
"Not unless I'm on me bi on my bike, and I doubt if they'd measure me ."
"you, you did eighty on your, on your bike did you?"
"Over, over fifty on a pushbike."
Do you know Bo ?
Yeah.
You
"Last time he flew out, you were frightened."
"Our Tom don't like it when he flies and yet, they're not bothered about him, that one, that's the one that bites."

"On a  were it last Sunday, yeah it were last Sunday when I took  off, er Lisa always goes down to 'elp 'er, when, like what, you know when Eileen cut her finger, what did she do to her finger?"
"She did have it all bandaged up, she were she were cleaning toilet at bottom, and er, apparently there was a piece out of it and she didn't know, and she wiped round it, it sliced it, and it were bleeding like mad, well she came across to our 'ouse, and we weren't in, and then she went to Kevin's and she had she had it, but it, now it's just like a line now,"

Hope I've got my glasses with me or I can't see the prices.
"Oh, I haven't got my purse."

"So he'd obviously sa not said it, I mean Pete was really shocked!"
He'd

"He said it to Andy though, and I mean  I don't, I don't know, Andy really surprises me because like  he always seems to be like, the quiet one doesn't it?"
"I mean, when we're all like, laughing and joking and everything he's like, oh yeah really in with it  but when everyone's like arguing or whatever he  he"
Mm.

"But like  everybody,eve"
It's his house everyone goes to isn't it?
Everybody seems to  Andy seems to know everything!
"Like, Andy knows about me!"
"And like, Scott told me  and  thinking about it  if I'd of been in  in the frame, frame of mind that I'm in know for example, I would of sort of  pah!"
What right has he got to know or anything?
"But like, I don't mind  cos I know he won't say anything."
Yeah cos you gotta lay out money aren't you?
Yeah so if I decide to
"Oh he said, when he's finished  I don't whether he's not picking it up till later on."
Ooh and another  that's what I wanted  to tell you about  well I don't think we can help him out.
Oh well.
Gentleman wanted a minibus

Well what time is Toby coming back?
Well so he can't have that one then?
"And the Isle of Ely college is going out for a meal, so that won't be back, so he can't have that one, so we haven't got one!"
No.
"For Friday night, but he can have one  sort of, first thing Saturday morning."
But otherwise we haven't got one.
No  er
"erm, and that lady's gonna ring about the Fiesta"
and then that young boy's gonna ring about the van.
Oh.
Well they've not warmed them up.
If I'd known you was coming I would have done that bit of chicken.
I've got some sausage rolls here.
"I needed some change so I got two sausage rolls, I'm gonna wire them up on microwave in a bit right?"
Er   mixed with some beans and
Er got bread Bill.
Oh aye .
"Oh what's, what's the difference between a penis and a works bonus?"
I don't know.
The wife don't mind blowing the works bonus.
I were told that other day.
I like that one.
Do you wanna hear another one?
Steve'll like that one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Er why d why do women parachutists wear jockstraps?
To stop them whistling on the way down.
Tt
"told that one as well  and why, why do  oh what's other one?"
Why  why don't blind people parachute?
Don't know.
Scares the shit out of guide dogs.
"Cos I read these in a paper  and I thought hey these are very good ones here, I thought  I'll get them, I'll remember them."
You get worse.
"It's like our Albert, he tells that many jokes I can never remember half of what he tells me."
He told me one twice
I still can't remember the bleeder.
"He's pillock brained, your father, yesterday."
"There he is with the car, drives straight into the garage and the aerial goes ping!"
So he's waiting for you to come up and have a look at it.
"So  but we fair enjoyed them , they think, the younger ones don't like them nowadays but"
Mhm.
we enjoyed them.
"Cos I like, I like the accordion, I like country dancing."
Did you go to the Country Dancing Club at all?
Oh yes.
"Went to the Country Dancing Club, used to go all over to the Country Dances"
Oh?
to different places.
"It was supposed to have been quite good up at ,?"
"Aye it was sti , yes it was still going when I came up here."
Mhm
Aha.
"Was it Mrs , from  took it ?"
And were there men went to the country dancing as well?
"Oh yes , oh yes, aye."
Not so many men as went ladies but er
Do you think
there was a lot of men.
"the rise of the Country Dancing Clubs was maybe be to kind of try and compensate in a way for the dances themselves going down, ordinary dances, folk were wanting to do the Scottish dancing and things?"
It could have been but you found
"you found at the Country Dancing, it was different people that was at the Country Dancing than what than what it was at the  more at the the ordinary dances."
Folk that maybe would have been shy to go to a
Mhm.
a big dance?
Yes er maybe but
would come to the country dancing.
Or some of the older folk maybe that
"Folk, I think yes, it was more, mhm."
Right.
But you get country dancing that's very energetic really.
Yes.
"We've got twelve people coming, right?"
Er yep  what's that gotta do with anything?
Well cos I'm gonna have  pairs  I think here
And one you!
Oh  singles then?
It's more
No
fun in pairs isn't it cos the people can have the scraggle and talk to each other.
You'll have to have pairs and put one three.
Chips.
Well that's not fair then.
Put Michael with
Oh yeah
"if you put Michael with two other people, it's completely fair."
But then your implying something aren't you.
"Why don't you say if you're a child  you can go in a group of three, if your adults you'll have to be in a group of two, so the children can attach themselves to any group."
Right.
Right.
You've got eleven people you need four groups  you don't have four groups it's not worth doing is it?
"Gotta share it all out perfect even  why don't you say, stick it on the wall, give them each a piece of paper and they've gotta do it  I've got an idea, you can compile a quiz"
Fine I'm
and then you could have a treasure hunt for the children
you know
Couldn't I.
Most amusing
Are you gonna sort of read out the question and they each gonna scribble down their answer.
Nope.
What you gonna do?
"No, just leave"
Have a chart.
your father!
What?
Yellow flag coming out of his aerial.
Oh where would you prefer your ae aerial?
Would you like it there  up there or at the back?
Up there's alright.
"I like it the way the ones that you can  close each time, now I'm sure my aerial will last longer."
Cos you can
What do you mean close.
Well it compacts.
Oh yeah.
"The ones that stick out all the time, they  I suppose that is good."
"If you have one that doesn't compact, you you're best to have one in the middle cos it's less likely to get pranged there isn't it?"
Yeah.
Here like walkers by can bend it and  Oh look.
Here's my next one.
Six.
I've let six go now.
You must have let someone go before now.
"I didn't, no I haven't."
No.
Haven't had the opportunity to.
What is this lady dressed up like?
What has she got on  ?
What has she got on her hair?
Weird.
Bunch of wool .
She'll be thinking where's that wool?
Oh it's on my head.
Look at those tiny rugby posts.
"Yeah, I don't know why they do that, I was gonna ask that, why they chop those off, look like they've been vandalized don't they?"
Yeah.
It's only for junior rugby though.
They haven't replaced that garage have they?
What's that one?
That's what my brother's son did to his father.
bloody having them then is he?
"I paid fi fifteen bleeding quid for that  and I sai cos this year, I didn't know he'd done this  cos he sits it like that"
Mm.
or clips it like that and you can't tell
Mm.
"anyway he give it to his father and, well I'd already bought the other one I'd"
Mm
cos I says if he looks after it I'll buy him one with radio on as well
Yeah.
so  I just paid that one  with radio.
"But I wish he'd stop nicking my bleeding torch, he's getting a swine for that."
"I only got it back, you know when I got it back?"
When he moved out.
No when batteries are dead.
Oh.
I get all me torches back when battery's dead.
"I got one with a big chunky battery, it should've lasted about six month to a year"
Yeah.
"a right good'un it were, our Arthur give me torch and I had to buy a battery, I paid about three pound odd for this battery"
Tell you what I bet he had it under the blankets  reading his books.
He did.
You've got it.
Exactly.
I wondered what that was?
It's something clanging round in your washing machine.
It'll be zip on his erm  tracksuit.
"I found jacket, did I tell you?"
No.
I got jacket and bottom.
And some underwear.
Yeah.
How much did he cost?
Three hundred and fifty.
Three hundred and fifty.
"No it wasn't, it was three hundred."
It was two
Yes it was.
Three hundred and fifty.
"Oh anyway, it was still pretty good wasn't it?"
"Wasn't cheap, I mean"
"No, but I mean you could see   play really well ."
"I mean Southgate's all the more pleasing when you think he's somebody that's worked his way up, right?"
Yeah.
That's really nice to see.
And he played really well.
Southgate is a harder person to mark isn't he?
Yeah.
"I think I'd drop Mortimer  oh look, Palace."
Red car  it's like ours isn't it?
Yeah.
"I'd drop, I'd drop Paul Mortimer"
Yeah.
and have Collymore in right?
"And encourage  that's the trouble, you drop Mortimer you drop somebody who can er flip the ball in but  I think you definitely want to take the heat off Wright."
Now if if all Collymore does is distract   but Mortimer was not playing enough of the game.
"We can't afford  people like Mortimer to, I mean he scored a goal  but I mean"
Yeah.
Eddie  I think is worth  sheer sort of  opening teams up.
"Well he does open, there's no  not many players can play a team better like  than opening up"
"So what'd you do, say you had  back next week so our next game against Birmingham."
What would you do then?
"Well I mean they've got, they've got, he's gotta do something because you're gonna lose that Birmingham game."
It's got a whole tin in that dish  that'll fill it up won't it?
Never mind.
Oh  see him.
"Well I know, but he didn't have top dog meat since he's been here."
Not since he's been back for a week.
"Say that whole tin will do it, won't it?"
"Today  I tried to get a whole tin every day, it's just because it happened."
Say that.
"Leave her alone, come on!"
You have been feeding it though?
"Course I have, been giving it a what we've had, like  when the kids didn't eat their dinner or we ain't eat all our dinner  been giving it what's left on the plate, well"
and he's had chops and mash and all that lot.
Bananas.
Had a bit of everything  chips   We'll put it all in one dish an it'll eat it all.
Shouldn't pe leave her to lick the plates though.
"No, no  I scrape them from the plates into its own dish  Greg  come here  let's have you having dinner  come on."

Woof woof

Arghh!
La laces are a thing of the past.
Watch this space or something.
Yeah.
Something like that.
I thought it was a built in egg timer or something .
Obviously another time saving device.
Yeah.
To save you what  say thirty seconds?
Oh at least.
Ah there's no point getting cynical is there?
"Not at this time of the day, no."
Not on a Monday.
Rest of the week.
Exactly.
Where did he go?
I thought you were going out?
I  I'm  finishing early but I'm not go going out.
Watch you don't er swallow that the wrong way.
I didn't even have anything in me mouth.
Sharp intake of breath.
Excuse me?
For their telephone number I've just put a question mark  and I've put a note here to say I was internally transferred.
S sounds like I've had an operation doesn't it?
I'm being internally transferred .
Oh.
Someone pressed the I C M button.
Yeah.
"Oh   I told you didn't I that  er the fellow with the Portakabins that does work for the B B C, he had the Portakabin and then your tables are two pound each, and your chairs range from fifty pence to one pound fifty."
I think the ones that are fifty pence are those blue and white striped ones off the  prom at Prestatyn
job lot.
And er  he didn't say how much the toilet was but that'll probably be separate.
"You know, it's a separate thing so there must be a separate price, it would cost a bloody fortune."
"little dollops all over, and there's one spot, little"
Well why doesn't he put bloody newspaper there?
"No it does all over the place, wherever  put newspaper down, he does it on the carpet  so  kept doing it by the cooker so we put newspaper down there, and put the toys away, see they was in the way you see, put newspaper down there and then next   wouldn't have that,."
Ooh God!

Well last weekend I bought a
No go like that

And all the money went in the bank.
"You, you !"
So I got  in my leg.

Yeah but it attracts the
The
water in
the
"the air, into the salt!"
"and of course, once it's in the salt, it's steams!"
Well it's only now it feels like this!
It was not like this when we were down here washing it.
Well that's common sense when you think about it isn't it?
"You put, you put a drop of water on it  you put er  a bowl of salt  and  that will go down  eventually!"
Mm.
If the air is damp.
It's collected the water .
"Once that's damp, that's rising the steam!"

The other one's all arrived over safely and the bloke's driven it and he's all happy with it
No bloody way he said!

"I thought to myself well yo if Laura had a house and then thought Pete was in that in that position, I'd of helped him."
Did he really?
Yeah  well they've had they've had a big  today.
Who have?
.
Oh?
Well I thought she said I ain't gotta  then have they?
A hundred pou thous thousand in debt  they had two lo two bloody great Morgan cars!
About what was that?
Well I reckon that's her  either his mother or her mother.
Yeah.
Cos when I was coming home from Pete's  a bloke stopped me  er  whatever's that noise?
I dunno.
A bloke stopped and he said er  can you tell me where  is?
"I said well you're in the   oh he said I'll tell you what I want, a little black and white house  I said it's just there look  I said nearly you're nearly on top!"
"He got a few yards down, he said  so I said well  have yo you haven't come round to view the house today have you?"
"Oh no he said, I said because they got a funeral on, he said that's what we've coming for, we're coming to pick granddad up."
Oh.
Well I thought well I didn't want people going round there
No.
"Well  that was a waste of their time if they'd have gone round there to view them, weren't it?"
Yeah.
So that  was not having a lot of flipping luck is she?
No.
But they haven't put them out their home.
No.
"Alright, but I think they've gotta re-house them first haven't they?"
I dunno.
"Well yeah they just shove you out on the street, they gotta  especially if you got children they gotta re-house you."
Yeah.
Yeah but well you look that  that jaguar  four litres!
. Four litre car!
Yeah but what are you gonna do with four litres?
I dunno.
Well quite.
It does about  eighteen miles to the gallon.
How many miles do we do to the gallon?
I hope we do something like thirty six.
Thirty six!
Don't think it's much more than that.
"How can his, well  if ours is one point six  there's three times"
No it doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work like that?
No.
So what  how long will it take him to get eighty miles filling up every ?
Well I mean do they have huge tanks?
"I mean they take  if you, if you filled up you could put I think it's about twenty six gallons in that car."
And how many can we put in?
Nine?
Eleven?
Cor.
Eleven.
"It was eight, nine."
I think this might take eleven.
So how much do they spend if they filled it ?
"Don't forget if you've got all that weight, you've got that you're gonna lose even more petrol."
"So if you filled that up, how much would that cost them?"
"Well, twenty six  I think it's something like  isn't it something like two pounds a gallon now?"
"You don't, they do it all by litres now so it's really hard"
About fifty P?
"About fifty, fifty pounds?"
Fifty pounds to fill up!

You don't have to worry too much about money do you really so long as you can manage with it.
"Ha Harry, Harry Secombe is said after his heart attack there's no pocket in the shroud."
No.
"Well he's right, there are no pocket's in a shroud and he's seemed much happier since."
"Yeah, oh yeah."
It's a shame with .
"That's what annoys me with erm these big company's you know, opening on Sunday's really, because er, you can only get the money, I mean they've only got a certain amount"
Yeah.

"But, still beggars can't be choosers, they are cheap, they had loads of offers on them."
Mm.
"Tins of baked beans, fourteen P."
"Do, what do they taste like, though?"
"Well, I should imagine they're just the same as their normal ones, and they've stuck a, a whacking great white label on them, but I mean, you know, perhaps they're of an inferior quality, I don't know."
I haven't tasted them yet.
Julia's had them and she said they were fine.
"Erm, well, rice pudding."
Only
I don't like anything like that.
"I, I wouldn't buy it, but,"
Emily eats it for breakfast.

Why don't you like it?
"Not that I'd ever tried it, but, that sort of thing, semolina, and all that,"
"I hate it, urgh."
"Yoghurt, you like yoghurt, though."
"We haven't got the   oh yes there is, oh course there is, that's a lie  we go through  yeah."
Yeah well what about if the fire's between the box room and this exit?
"Well that's where they are      I went  that slid across there like that, phewf!"
Where are you going?
What ab oi!
Don't ask then!

Oh!
Said in yesterday's paper  that someone had had a wheelbarrow  valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden  and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill.
Where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible.
"So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds."
Mm.
"Cos it didn't, it didn't say  a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow."
Well those er  four tapes

About power lifting equipment.

Cup of tea for the driver.
What we actually put
"Cup of tea, sustenance , yeah."
"What we actually put is, er, it is the responsibility in the conditions of carriage."
It is a responsibility.
Where would you find the conditions of carriage.
On the back of every erm  contract out there.
On the back of every contract.
Because  it is subject to the conditions of carriage  that we accept their business and therefore we have to provide them with written information.
"I, put me in a detention centre because I was shoplifting  and I didn't like it there so I left!"
Tt tt tt tt tt tt tt tt!
What is your name?
Sarah.
From London?

Have you cut holes in your trousers to put
sixteen.
big triangles of cloth in and turn them into flares  then ?
No!
Not quite!
Do you go begging?
"Well  sometimes, but sometimes I just pickpocket  it's much easier that way."
Have you turned to prostitution as a way of getting money?
"No, I don't think that's a really good idea, it's not safe."
It's not   .
Do you sleep in shop doorways or do you go to a hostel so sometimes?
"Well, I haven't got much money but  well sometimes I do go to hostels, yeah  but, most of the time I just sleep anywhere I can find a shelter."
Bus shelters are quite helpful.
Have you ever thought about going back home?
I was gonna say that!
No.
I don't i if  it would be no point.
But why?
Yeah.
The  scheme
The Board's
did that didn't it?
Yeah.
the Board considers the B R employe employees who transfer involuntary involuntarily to the private sector should return an indefensible right to remain as members of the joint industry
scheme .
We've seen all that.
"But that, that's only a suggestion."
It's not been
Yes.
Yeah.
"I mean wasn't this, wasn't this"
Well.
They're not
one of these things where they
"Let's, let's pick out something positive."
"they actually put forward some proposals, whereby what do you call him withdrew the clause and wrote another one which negated anything that was said before?"
Pardon?
That sounds a wonderful idea when does it
Who's what's her name?
.
Pass.
What do you call the secretary of state?
Freeman.
McGregor?
Oh.
Freeman.
Roger Freeman Secretary for
Yeah.
No.
McGregor's Secretary of State.
Yes we'd have to check.
erm I should first check.
"Check with them, yeah quite."
"So I I do, you do Tesco."
I'll do the swimming pool.
"I, I, I  would check who actually  is responsible for that"
.
But of course all paper now is
All paper?
All paper.
What about this  chap then?
It's in the library th with his number.
"Well, you ring him but if he, if he gets upset or, or"
Oh I see.
it's it's strange  you can give that as an address.
Any Uttlesford  town of some size has got a comprehensive recycling centre now that takes any paper
Do you have to sort it?
Do you have to take it sorted?
No.
No.
It's just a big skip?
And it says
at Stanstead
Do they then sort it?
the car park
"No, they it's  the council collects it and  in Uttlesford, that's why I said we should get at the same time  an Uttlesford councillor because I would"
"Yes, yeah"
"like to know a, whether their new scheme is only temporary, is about to break down."
Mm.
Or whether they actually get the disposals cost incorporated into this skip collecting cost.
Because the  money they can get for this  mixed paper must be a pittance.
Mm.
How am I gonna get them in the van?
What van?
"In, back into the caravan."
On me own.
Oh.
"It's a double mattress, a double bedded mattress."
I can't bloody lift that.
So the only thing that I would suggest is to
Well still Mark will be  there.
Or he could come down with you on Saturday?
Or Sally maybe would be able to come down with you Saturday and help you?
Unless we went over the same day that Susan went over.
And kept the mattresses till Susan goes.
But the understanding is  that like Mark has got the caravan this week.
Mm.
"But if they had a booking to go into it, Mark's gotta get out."
Oh well he could ring you up and you could take them back down but at least they would be dried.
Cos if anybody  who could they come on if they caught cold and and
Well I dunno.
You or him?
I dunno.
It's like fighting a losing battle isn't it?
If someone else
I wouldn't worry at all.
I wouldn't hesitate.
It's an embarrassment for people to come in and catch cold and think it's your mattresses that's done it.
Mm.
"If those men were not working on the gas I would go over there now, and I'd switch the fire and I'd leave it on."
Mm.
Yes.
The thing is old Mark is there to see to it.
Mark won't be there to see to it?
"Yo you can't put it in that he said, it's brand new!"
"That'll be alright  so cos he slid his  my brief case  and er I got all the way home, no problem at all, I'd got newspaper under the back, so it didn't scratch the back  when I come to  come down Mill Road  this lorry's go , I mean I got the tail gate up  and er  I sort of looked in the mirror, I thought oh my goodness my tail gate, I could hear it so   and I braked a bit sharp and that slid down  and scratched along the dash board!"
Oh dear!
"Trying to get it out , sort of plastic dash went creeeh!"
Cor!

"I mean, no one 's gonna see it there are they?"
fewer localities now.
This will be shorter.
I think we can easily put erm pits for daily life or how to be environmental.
And then
Oh a few tips.
Oh
With respect I really think it ought to be recycling and nothing else.
Mm.
"Well I just find these, I mean we had quite a few  now"
Cos recycling sort of comes into the tips for daily life as well though doesn't it.
It's part of it.
Like protecting  people don't just save bottles they save their glass jars
seem to be patronizing people when really you just want to give information.
as well.
People don't always think of.
Yeah.
"Re-using things, re-using things is almost the same  as recycling isn't it?"
Re-use?
Yes.
Yeah!
I suppose it's I mean
Well it is really isn't it?
re-using is better than recycling.
Yeah.
Erm.
So.
Erm I take
So it
"Reduce or re-use, recycling?"
Has anybody got a con
punchlines are much better than sort of er  .
Because people'll read those.
Friday the thirteenth.
What a day to buy a motorbike.
"See the value of the bike came down, the value of the insurance came down cos I put the value at twelve hundred pounds."
See erm there was a ten percent discount if you had it erm  under twelve hundred and fifty pounds.
Yeah.
So in some ways it's cheaper insurance but in others  it's erm  a bit of a sting.
Have you done?
Come on.
Oy.
See that machine there?
What does it do?
It hides behind mother so that Brian can't get at it.
No.
This plates go in this way.
Well I'm not allowed to use this machine so er
Knives and forks should go in  that way.
Right?
Why that way?
There are glass plates   somewhere.
Have you made any tea Mary?
No.
No.
Do you want some tea?
I want to get into the habit of finishing  and getting the dishwasher on and ge cleaning the kitchen completely.
I told him to ring  I told him ring Apex up in case they were recruiting.
Because there are jobs up on the notice board.
But he said Apex  didn't know anything about it at the moment.
"So I mean, if Apex don't know anything about it I don't know why they don't ."
Now you know I don't get on with plastic.
Oh I got it first time.
I got it first time.
Oh god.
"oh right, oh I didn't realize, there were just two parcels on the erm"
Yeah look
"on the thing and, and I picked them both up"

I thought they were both for me.
Oh dear.
Ah!
Oh well erm
Yeah I didn't fancy
let's see
going up to the senile
No I don't I don't blame you.
Erm
I sort of started to feel a bit ill before so
Yeah.
Well do er do come in er  well did you have a pleasant trip down?
"Erm yeah it was okay, it wasn't too bad."
Mm.
Alright  cos I think we've been sent these on approval to see if we want to adopt them for course material
Yeah.
you see so erm
They seem quite nice.
Yeah.
"Erm well I, I don't know quite what erm they'll be teaching you out of in your er abnormal course but erm er I do find the, the  the sort of current generation of American textbooks quite erm"
Mm.
"quite a nice, quite exciting erm I tell you what, swivel that swivel chair round and, and sit on that"
Okay.
Do you have a drink please or
Yes of course.
Now erm what sort of flavours appeal?
"Now we've got ordinary tea, we've got herbal tea, we've got coffee out of a coffee machine, we've got Lapsang Souchong, we've got ordinary tea  I've mentioned that already haven't I?"
Erm
no no no but I'm pa if
So go on yo
I were in power there wouldn't be any money  no need for it!
Then you
Well I
wouldn't have all
I
the arguments!
I know that!
So you wouldn't
Yeah.
say that at all!
No.
Yeah.
And what would you do
But in the case of these people that  start off
So why why should
"Fair do's they start off in University, clever blokes  and a lot of them worked in the mines, Shinwells  what's his name?"
Beven  miners
Just for money!
Well I won't say  Beven  because it's a bloody shame what happened to him!
But never the less  a lot of them started off like that didn't they?
Another one is Foot.
Ah but er he
"And  as they get into, as you say, power and I quite agree  somebody has a talk with them so look here"
We know
we know you're a socialist
But you still earned a few bob to get on.
"But er, you you we're gonna make you a nice one and join the bloody club  so you'll be  an armchair socialist  and we look after you  and that's what they are!"
Callaghan is another example  two or three homes  big Jim with all his bloody money what does he care about working people?
"And this feller Kinnock's the same, you can see the style of them!"
I think he must be
Closed!
Well
"Yeah but I'm, I I know I don't"
Well some of them certainly
And they closed one the other week that's flooded now
will definitely
so that's
Yeah.
I don't think that this
"They, they won't they they wouldn't"
can't rescind that!
they wouldn't bring
But I
money on the mining
And that goes for a lot of businesses!
"I mean, there's enough coal  in the United Kingdom to last for another two hundred years!"
Yeah!
"And that could possibly be the only, and ah  I mean it's it's a"
Ah but
"it's a dirty fuel to use at the moment but they're all, there are means being developed even now on"
Well I've no doubt in twenty
I mean
years time the tories will re-open them
much  it's it's far
at at great cost to us!
Ah but you see
Nothing to stop them!
that  it's
Well
very short sighted to get rid of that now!
"I mean, we're buying coal which is subsidised abroad  so therefore it's cheaper for us to buy it  and bring it in, but what happens when all, all our home supplies have dried up"
I know  I know
Was Bleep in?
Yeah  he had a big do with the council man.
Why?
The council bloke come down
"Oh, what is Val's accent?"
Well west
is it?
Yeah.
to be exact.
"Well  I don't know  well that'll be on there if they want to know anyway now, you've just said it."
Mm  erm  yeah the council bloke come down and went in while his father was there
I see you've got no carpets down anywhere  the door's not painted  and he said you've been living here for two years!
Well what's the council man got to do with that?
Well they got a grant you see.
Well carpets ain't got nothing to do with it surely?
Yes they have  that's when I  the house is finished.
Oh.
"When your carpets were down, you moved in  so he's coming back December the eighth."
I thought he would have to tell them  got his carpets down.
He had a carpet just put down in his lounge.
Well he's got a lot to do then.
He was belly aching .
Cor!
How's how's the thing between Blue and
Completely  by now.
Good heavens!
Even the first day back  there was hardly any atmosphere at all very serious mood they were  but Kim keeps well out of it.
Oh I think she's the trouble maker there myself.
Yeah  she'll just keep well out of it.
I think  that's what started it all off I think she's running off.
Yeah.
Oh whatever you done?
"And Mark's there, I said he'll switch it off at night."
"Fine she said, as long as there's nothing left too near the fire."
"So I took the envelope off those tickets and I tore that up and wrote down and I stuck it in the  water heater that the sitting room fire may be on, please check."
I put another one then on the draining board.
"Cos if they're going to fix it round the sink, he doesn't know where they're gonna put it."
"You know, while I was there Darren came in."
And he said er have all the jobs been done yet?
And I said well no I said there's some water I said.
Mark's on holiday this week I said.
they've put him in another.
Oh that's right he said.
"I heard something about this he said, er  I was on holidays  all last week he said but erm  it's bloody lies cos I saw him last week."
And he said erm  yeah he said cos we've gotta pay this he said because it's all in the guarantee.
In the warranty.
And he came in and I said and the mirror on the dressing table isn't done.
You know and  that's gone and I said feel these beds I said.
They're soaking wet.
And he felt them and he said they are a bit he said.
"So I said well I  Danny rang this morning and he got permission to put the fire on  and put them, I'm going to move them all into the  front  and erm to air them up."
And I said there's no way anybody can sleep in there.
That's alright he said.
And he checked and then he went  So I took the bags off the pillows in case they were sweating in the bags and I put them out on the seats.
I put the quilts all out on the seats.
And .
"Because there's eight  there's er   seven, there's eight pillows then and"
He's done nothing.
Yeah.
He
Mm?
"The girl in the coun the girl behind the counter, the little tiny one."
Small and
She's still there?
Yeah?
"So in a way yo you're doing  different hours and all  so your pay, was that based on forty hour week?"
Or was that just based on  you being there whenever  you had to be there.
"Don't forget he's only started th , the job's only started a week!"
I'm just asking dear!
I'm paying for supper.
Yeah.
They're paying me for forty hours.
And anything you do above forty hours you can extra for?
Yeah.
"But, saying that  means you got a lot"
You don't have forty hours only to do.
I have.
"Because  the hour, the hours  forty  but   there's loads to be done ."
Yeah.
I'm getting them sorted out with Roy
"Well erm  have you had your pay yet from them, no?"
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
"So you, well then you'll still not know what you're going out with because you still have a few days from last week to get ."
"So you don't know what you'll start with, you'll actually bring in."
I will do.
Do you?
On my pay slip.
It doesn't make any difference  .
Do you remember the  form David got with the tax form and all?
"He's gonna give it into  Mericlean and Mericlean , just said we'll have to send it off  to the tax office to get your tax code changed."
"It's er, the tax code on his P forty five is ."
Well
His
it's like I'll get
twenty five.
Cos a lot of stuff isn't in.
They could be put a manager in and   the benefits.
I suppose they would.
Mm.
Perhaps they do.
And then there's staff there to run it.
I dunno.
"Well the man with the bike, that's his business."
"And the ma and the people then with clothes last year, who were they now?"
To the shop?
Was M was Mark's caravan warm?
"Well he didn't have a fire on, nothing."
He was just lying there watching telly and reading the paper and
Did he have a paper?
Mm.
"Should have brought it back, did you?"
No.
He bought the Saturday one that's got the week  part in it.
Why didn't he come over and fetch the car then?
"Because he said there's no point, I don't want it."
"Well I've got to take his over now, he'll have to bring me back."
Yeah.
"What I was going to tell him, if he was to come over, take my car there  when I'd have taken this car over, I would have had a car to come back."
Well that's what he said.
He said you'd better keep the car there in case his won't be ready or something.
Mm.
Lot of kids about though.
In another couple of weeks  spring then.
Would if the weather would take up.
But still they book regardless of weather don't they?
Mm.
Mm.
"Yeah, yeah."
"No, last week  ."
"Well we took him , took him for his injection in October"
"Yeah,three or four months ."
They'd have been there about a couple of weeks .
"But the little dog I went, I took a friend to collect her little dog from the vet it's had a double hernia, hasn't it, double hernia, it, it had a tremendous operation dear little thing, but she said he had a wart under he's eye and on it's own accord it dried up and dropped off."
Oh did it?
Mm.
"So, so Tessa's might"
It might be it's just under the eye
"Yeah,"
down below
yeah.
it's very tiny at the moment.
"but, we don't like the look of it, you know"
No.
"but eh, she, it doesn't seem to worry her it's not causing her any"
No.
"Rocky, doesn't worry him."
It seems to be worry you  .
"Oh, I'm careful with the brush , I'm careful, obviously with a brush and comb, I'd hate to, hate to jab it  well we've got to go I suppose."
"Ah,."
"That German Shepherd having a good, oh he's gone, it's the   oh dear"
Were lucky to have this place aren't we?
"Oh it's lovely isn't it, it's beautiful."
"Were lucky to  you go and lo look round anywhere else, no where like Sanders"
No.
"because, what with this, the bridges and rivers"
Edge Borough.
", yeah and, and then the recreation ground is, is, when the gypsies's are not there."
"Yeah, yeah, well the di the difficult is now in Simon's Wood, in the car park at Simon's Wood."
Ah .
Oh this one is?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
"She phoned this morning  and I said I can't come and collect it cos I'm here by myself she said oh I'll bring it in, that's alright, no problem but er we're going away to Gloucester at two o'clock"
Oh I see I
"oh I said we'll try and see if we can get it done I says, so"
Oh I see.
I said if it doesn't come in at two anyway and I'll lend you something
Mm very good.
so
"Oh well that's good, right."
otherwise we'll go down
I think we could let her off this time.
that's er all your overheads paid innit?
"That's right, yeah."
"I think Ian used to sell these  things, whatever they are."
Yeah that's what I said he said no it didn't come from me he said but I think they did used to sell something like that.
He popped in a couple of times.
His missus earns nineteen grand a year.
Pardon?
His missus earns nineteen grand a year at the bank.
Cor!
"And he gets about, he didn't say what he got but it's over the twenty three thousand drawings that er they're worried about the level of er tax, you know, for the next"
My goodness.
"So he must, they must get forty grand a year"
"Between them, yeah."
"Well I did a proje projection for the erm guy at Nationwide, I said well it's probably gonna be about a hundred and fifty grand turnover  and about twenty five to thirty percent clear, you know"
Ah
net profit.
"Which is about right I suppose, yeah."
So I said
Yeah.
Bye.
See ya.
Bye.
See you later.
"Oh no, she's got to walk round with him."
"The thing is, you can't really, you couldn't sort of see this jagged mess."
He's made a right mess of it.
"He shaved up the back, hasn't he?"
It's odd and even.
"Yeah, but, yeah"
"And you get this, this bit here"
"he's all shaved, his hair come back over it."
"See like, long hair here, so it's hanging down, scraggily,so you've got like a shaved head, with all these bits here ain't ya?"
"So it covers it up a little bit, but it looks like he's gone bald."
No.
"Because he's like, long bits of hair, like this thick, hanging over, a shaved head,and you know, you know Tina, you know Tina Turner, you know her husband kept on going like this all the time  yeah  mine does that all the time  yeah, I go oh pack it in."
"Like Peter, you know, he does all this, like he keeps going, oh show it to me, I can't I'm trying to grow it."
"I'm trying it down, like, so it's round here."
"Do you think it'd be good like that, and I went, yes Ryan it'd look much better."
"Cos he keeps growing his hair, to sort of there, and then he has it cut off, don't he, he's shaved."
"Cos he has to have it undercut, cos that's hard."
"He's full of being hard, isn't he, Ryan?"
"He is, ain't he, just full of it."
"Oh  I've got something, erm, Peter's in prison,"
"Oh no, really?"
Three years.
You're joking.
No.
Really?
"I  when I went, you know when I went down, do you remember I told you that I got caught up with him?"
Yeah.
You want a change?
How
Yeah.
was you thinking of having it cut?
Short.
What short short?
Yeah.
"Actually I think it suits you, I mean really i like  it's not on her face anyway isn't it?"
No  so short
So I think
No.
short hair would suit you cos you haven't got it all over your face have you?
Cos I saw erm  a photo when I was eighteen and I it was  sort of short in the neck  over my ears  short in there and then sort of fuller there and then just a bit of  you know a light fringe not a heavy fringe  and I thought I might have it like that so
Yeah.
That'll be nice  I can't really remember
Well I think if that was me  I'd have that done now  in case you don't like it by the time you  you get married and that could be growing again.
Oh no I wouldn't have it cut until after I got married.
Oh
No.
you'd have it cut after?
Yeah.
Oh.
Cos I definitely want my hair long for when we get married.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah  so that I can either have it  up or down really.
Yeah.
I've got the choice then.
Yeah  I do do you know I don't like to see brides with their hair down  if you've got long hair i
Oh.
but I don't think  sometimes I think  well if it looks nice  but some of them brides on there that just hangs   don't it?
"Oh yeah, I'm not having it like that."
By a total stranger?
Well I suppose I wouldn't do that with a total stranger.
She did.
"I know, but a stra , what do you mean, what do you classify as a stranger?"
Someone you don't know
Yeah.
anything about.
I know that they're they're
Because I go out
they're involved in the ca
if
"in the, erm the choir."
Just because you work with the guy
But you've never had a conversation with him.
Mm mm.
Just because you know the guy from Marks and Spencers.
I did that with Graham.
"I went out, I hadn't even  I'd said hello to him, that was it."
"You see, I think that's really strange  in this day and age."
Yes but you're meeting in a public place.
"Not like, I mean I was making my way there, he was making his way there  and  I wouldn't want them to come and pick me up in the car"
Mm mm.
"and me go off, I wouldn't do that  without really  you know, having been out with him a few times."
But I'd make
Good.
my own way there and meet them.
In a public place.
"But if I met, but then that's slightly different because if I met someone in a  nightclub or  something like that  then I would be quite wary."
Mm mm.
I don't think I'd  I don't know  I don't know what I'd do.
I'd feel quite differently.
"But something like the choir or where you've been working, I don't know you, I, I've got this thing which is"
Fog gets in.
Course it does.
All caravans are like that.
"But you've got to have those caravan, those vents because the van is so small and you've got gas supplied."
It's rules and regulations.
If you've got a gas fire in
It it means that they haven't been doing their duty in the winter then.
If they guarantee to put the mattresses all up  in the dry  they asked you to do yours  or did they say they would do it?
They done it.
Well how's the damn thing on the bed then?
Because they put it back there for these people  that was coming in.
Oh.
They didn't seemingly.
We don't know.
Do we?
No.
Well there were no  there anyway.
So they say.
It's all hearsay.
Well alright.
Perhaps the man was working part-time.
Perhaps he never noticed the .
Perhaps the people were in the van  and found the beds wet and said well we can't sleep here and they slept in the sit with the fire on.
I dunno.
It could have been.
cos there was only two here.
cold weather in any case.
Eh?
It's cold weather in any case.
That's right.
Shut the lights.
You don't know.
Yes.
"That was er  that, yeah well it's not out yet is it?"
Looks like a  looks like the front of a B M W to me.
I think that's what they're trying to emulate.
Oh that one.
How much is it?
Supposed to be.
Don't know how much it costs.
"Should think it starts at about sixteen, seventeen thousand  ."
Yeah .
A three's heavy isn't it?
Look.
Yeah.
"So you got any ideas what you're gonna get, what you should get mum for ?"
Er.
We could just  fall back on a bit of sweets and chocolate or something in the end but I'd like to get some
What  what sort of thing are you gonna get her?
there's some funny little weird shops down Thornton Heath aren't there?
What sort of thing are we talking about?
Well I dunno.
Something  I'm not  I've no idea until I see it.
Well something like soap or what?
"Could get her some, some toiletries or something."
I dunno.
I was hoping for something even more er
a Moss chemist might be able to get her some Bromley don't they?
There is a Moss chemist on the way.
Oh yes she did tell me that she'd like some of that.
Yes there is one isn't there?
By  shops.
"Right we, we'll  we'll treat that as a fail safe then."
If we can't see anything more unusual suppose we could always fall back on  the bubble baths or the  anyway I think that's a bit more than  but there you go.
"Funny way of writing it, but you ca you could write it that way."
Ten X.
Erm  people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Yeah.
And you'd get some sort of shape.
But you'd miss a lot of important points.
Yeah.
Erm if they took it from minus ten to plus ten
Yeah.
you'd see a lot more things of interest and maybe  say oh I'll take it from minus fifteen to plus fifteen.
"But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like?"
When X is gigantic.
Ten times.
"If, if X was a million say, you could forget about a million minus ten, let's just call it a million,"
times ten
Ten.
"minus a million, we'll forget about the ten, just think of the minus a million."
So it's a million times minus a million.
Roughly.
A million times minus a million?
Ah.
Minus.
"What's, okay, let's come down a bit."
What's plus three times minus three?
Three.
What's plus three times plus three?
Nine.
Right.
"And, minus three times minus three?"
Minus nine.
No.
Minus three times minus three?
I mean you can't compare it can you?
And the bedrooms!
"You can't compare it, it's the rolls royce of caravans."
"That's, that Darren said oh aye, he's the one, he's in the maroon one he said."
He's in the rolls royce.
Top of the range he said.
Beautiful thing.
Good god there's a mirror in the sitting room as big as that wall.
You'll see it when you go over there.
Beautiful thing.
"Yes,"
And I said I've bought a box of matches for him to go down and light this fire  thinking you know he might need two or three matches at a time.
But er  well I gave him a box of matches to go with him and I thought oh well  he'll have plenty of matches then.
"And I took them in, he says  what do you buy them for?"
He said.
I've got loads of matches.
In this caravan everything's electronic.
"Fridge, light switches ooh  beautiful thing it is."
Ten times the price of ours I expect.
"A caravan is a caravan after all, isn't it?"
But for what we want it for  ours is good enough.
Good enough.
That's what I'm saying perhaps  they must let it out though.
If we were having
Why's Malcolm got it?
"if we were having a caravan like that, I'd be too frightened to let it."
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't
Well there we are.
let it.
There we are.
I couldn't afford to pay for it then could I?
And she said well it does take a time for the vans to dry out.
Mm.
Not until the sun comes hot and heavy on it.
"So whoever goes there, to anybody's van, that's what they're getting."
"Oh well, I should take advantage now Mark is in, bring the damn things from there."
Then you can get him to help you take them back on Friday.
I think we'd have to ring them up and let them know what we're doing.
Well go in office and tell them.
You can talk  personally better than on the phone.
Cos they are your mattresses aren't they?
When you take them back they're there for their inspection.
Unless you  you  take electric blanket down?
"Put it on, oh  You can't put that on a damp bed can you?"
Not really.
Don't think so.
Not
Well they are protected.
What?
Er er electric blankets.
Don't know.
"They're built er pretty, pretty good that way I think."
I don't know what about the lags for the wall
"And another thing, I didn't even look in Mark's room."
Was there pillows and blankets and quilts in his  caravan?
I didn't look.
Well perhaps Sally had a hunt
Dunno.

But it's  very hard
But  went to the dentist and he said leave it  pushed it right back and he said it will grow back.
Did it?
Oh yes.
Ah it must
Long as the roots are
"Oh well yes, oh well yeah, oh well now obviously"
So er
I mean my boy had a er a terrible accident ten years ago and smashed all his face  all his teeth were   when we first saw his face he'd got no teeth left  but it's  got them all back.
"And they're all back and  yeah even though they were all, they were all loose  I mean  still fresh you see the, the break."
"And it's, the life is in the, still in the tooth if you can find it, but of course sometimes they've gone haven't they?"
Too late for us
Put up with what we've got eh?
What?
Put up with what we've got.

"Oh yes that's stupid that, he he'll end up  if he doesn't go, with a mou a mouth of  sort of black"
"He, he'll have them all out."
Yes.
If he  we used to   the children

"even our grandchildren were, I mean er right from the beginning even if they only go and sit in the surgery  and just watch,ju you know just go and visit"
"Yeah that's, that's what they do now yeah."
"Get them trained, get them"
"Yes, yeah so they're not terrified."
"That's right, I mean  there's no pain"
Well I firmly believe in building up a library .
So do I.
Good I'm glad

In the school.

Well up until the time I would be about eight years old  when my father decided there was a change in the estate then and it was off to Argyllshire Dalmally that Sir Douglas  and Lady  as she was then decided to go and wanted my father to come with him.
But him being from up there and my mother also and their people were still alive which was my grandparents on both sides they were very reluctant to sort of go.
But when a job came he he would be wanting a diff different  shooting ground in in Argyllshire comparison to the hard rocks of Sutherland.
Mm.
Mm.
And it was either thinking about the wage packet at end of week which I was at first.
Mm.
"And then  I were coming home and I were, I were really awful."
And I thought why should I?
And then on Thursday  I went in to work and I had had enough.
"And I come home and I says to him, I'm not having this no more."
"I said no,."
Mm.
He says well if you want to pack it in love
Bless you.

No?
"No, I've got to take it all again."
"You're talking about sixteen, seventeen hundred pound to get you through."
Yeah.
"But you see with this bank thing with the government, you can have a loan  I think it's up to about four thousand pound  like a restart."
And it's a free loan for fifteen months.
Mm.
And then on the sixteenth month you've gotta pay it back.

"It'll be awkward getting cars in and out, when you know, with one more to be out and, all these cars in road, like, but."
That's the only difficulty.
"You'll probably end up say, leaving one on road all night."
Yeah.
"Don't hurt  I mean,"
"Oh, not leaving one on bloody road"
"Well, we could put 'em at night time, it's just through time, if one backs in, comes in behind other."

"And they say, you."
Still.
So what is it about you?
Trouble.

Ambition ?
Long hair.

You know.
Been around a long time.
"Erm I  what is it, who knows, who cares?"
"You know, if I'm president of the board of trade, I'm a loyal member of John Major's cabinet."
I intend to go on doing that as long as he wants me.
And the inevitable qu you'd expect me to ask this to you.
"If John Major fell under a privatized train, would your hat still be in the ring?"
Or
Well
"would you say, I've had it all now, I do"
Yeah.

Oh aye?
But I thought that'd be more of a hindrance than a help
Yeah.
"for what we were doing so  when I got back to the office I rung and I tempor well provisionally booked this, the smallest of the two which I think will be brill."
So
So what did she say about the money when you tried her for less money?
Or didn't you actually say?
"Well that one you have to ring the head office in Bangor, I had to ring her when I got back."
"They only er  showed me the rooms, they do the bookings  and I just said"
And it's actually in the  like the  council offices?
Yeah.
They have all like them chambers there as well you know?
But  I just said that it was for the Welsh Office  cos I thought if er they knew it was for a  Authority you know?

"So I said well, that's like this Pete, you live the way you want to  and I'll live the way I want to, I said it's immaterial to me."
"Your paying me to keep it  a bit tidy, I said and that's what I'm paid for, I said I ain't  paid to pass an opinion whether it's clean or dirty  he said you sound just like me June, I said oh do I?"
"I said well I'm not bothered what other people do, I said they can"
Well if he was tidy you wouldn't have a job would you?
What?
"If he kept the place tidy, you wouldn't have a job."
"Well I nearly said that to him, but I thought ooh no!"
"But, I thought to myself well  that's up to him how he li , he, he lives his life."
Yeah.

"Di , no,th October."
police took him in that night cos they thought he'd burnt it out himself.
"And it's taken all this time, it's gone to court and all the rest of it, and they haven't got a case."
"So, they couldn't do anything in the meantime."
I should think
Well they

Oh!
They're trying to get somewhere now  with the police but  it could have happened anywhere!

At the end of the day it's just greed and profit to gain
If you want a decent tree to grow

If you want decent trees it takes a long time to grow them!
"Well the hardwoods, yeah."

had put down the end.
"Anyway he got all his bricks and everything  and er  he got all his ideas what he wanted  and then they turned round and said no, we're not gonna let you build down there."
So we bought his bricks.
"So he's got all his bricks up  virtually I think he said, but I ain't worried about it cos I'll get rid of them somewhere  and I helped him out, I sold this car and, and told him what I was doing  and he come I've just the thing for you, just  cos  was having bricks like your dad's, the sand grain sort of brick, you know."

"Unless you're a chicken, or to put it boldly, animals have rights too!"
But exactly what rights do they have?
And does supporting animal rights justify violence?
"The animal rights lobby is a forceful one  by various means, some legal, some not, some specific, some violent."
Campaigners seek to convince the unconverted that animals deserve a better deal!
Which animals?
To rebuild his rear end.

Hundred and thirty!
Well  that's what is says there .
You could
quite a lot don't they?
Protestors were joined by York MP Hugh Bailey and City Councillors as they gathered at Heworth on Saturday.
Erm I'm surprised that slightly surprised that with council and Hugh were willing to go down given what we had given our information about how dangerous or not the site actually is.
That it's not very nice but it's er
I didn't know Heworth was gonna be that
Yes.
until it mentioned
They're also apparently  with ill health and amongst people living in the surrounding area.
Whether there's any truth in this is  and the A A E who did the er survey include Atomic Energy Authority who who's  like that as well.
Right okay.

We did.
Mm.
Right any tasks to carry forward?
Well erm Steve asked  to write letters to to Penny .
I don't know whether Jean got John  to have written to Jean  or not.
I think he might have done but he didn't say.
Erm apart from that I think we've done everything this week.

"I said you  overtime  you're moaning cos you gotta do, oh yeah  we're always"
Yeah.
"the one's that have gotta   I said and as soon as you ain't got no overtime  ooh we aren't allowed a lot this week, we're a bloody flat week da and a   I said I don't know what to do to keep you happy!"
"I said if you said to me, Geoff, I want all the overtime I can get  I can get the overtime  I'll go round and I'll try and   or if you say to me well  I don't want the overtime, I'm quite happy with a flat week  then I'll know what I am  but I said you change from day to day, one day you wannit, another day you don't!"
You
Yeah.
"just want  the job, to suit you  if you wa , if you want to go and pick your kids up from school you'd think that  oh why should we do work today, you know, let somebody else do it!"
So I said
Right.

You gotta take it when it's there ain't you?
"That's right I said, you know, I can't understand you!"
I says yo you go out to your flipping  eleven pound a week
Mummy !
Oh no!
and er he gets a thirty five pound a week child allowance on his for his four kids!
"Typical innit, though!"
So you're saying it's better on the streets than at home?
Yeah.
Is it worse
You're giving up before you've even tried!
Do you think you should try?
What is the point in trying?
Because you might find out it works and then you wouldn't have
But my mother wouldn't care about me!
How do you know that?
How can you be so sure?
Cos she beats me up!
Fine!
Can't say anything to that!
Well that could just be a sort of way of life.
"I mean, when people get beaten up when they're younger it me"
"this is true, I saw it on a T V programme"
Carry on.
they can erm  it can affect them in their later life and they hit out at people to show their affection.
Mm!
Don't believe that!
She never said a nice word to me in my life!
Haven't you got any other relatives where you could go?
"No, I wouldn't go near them!"
They're all snotty nosed little
Mm.
Don't you
But not
think you're being a little thoroughly class conscious?
No.
"I think you've got some, some attitude problems!"
"They don't care about me , so why should I care about them!"
"Yes, I think you've got a serious attitude problem!"
What is it?
Ten P off.
Oh!
That's it.
No.
Oh no he's
He's very good!
He's very
Oh well
good!
He's a good boy!
He's !
"Yeah, all fluffy and  good aren't you?"
Tongue hanging out!
Got lovely bright eyes!
Looking very well these days!
"Masters again, yeah."
What do you mean masters?
Mastered to get into the race.
"Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and initiative and you're in!"
"I bet, I bet  he's scared"
"I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's  for security guards."
You cannot walk past them if  you're going in that way.
So we had to go  past this little shed which is right up  right up this stupid grass earthy bank  right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in.
"Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great  hole in the gate  massive!"
"Walked through there and got to the simulator  took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in  walked straight past and we were right on site!"
We wasn't aware it was there.
"Well I thought, saved us twenty quid!"
So all  ?
"We were going , we were in!"
We're in!
We're in!
Oh they call it
oh I thought you did
"No I didn't, no"
"cos I say cos erm Bill never got a bag, and it four pounds something now"
Where'd he get it from?
"Oh I don't know, but it was"
I don't know
"her last ones, about two pound something a bag"
They're two fifty a bag in there
ain't you?
Yeah
Weather I suppose got something to do with it  had a weekend down there with her and Ant
Oh yeah
cos she weren't very well really
"No, no, they broke down didn't they?"
Ah?
They broke down
Oh I dunno she didn't say nothing about that
"Yeah, no, she and Colin they broke down they, they broke down at the"
"Oh she didn't, no"
"Yeah, they got they'd got half hour's drive from Minehead and that their car broke down, they had to go up, they had to call the, was it the A are they?"
Oh yeah
They got there but they had to go in second gear look
"Oh dear, oh I wonder how they'd got down there, I wonder whether they sort of"
No they got down
got down at their own steam I suppose
"Yeah they went down in convoy car and I think they, four or five cars went down there"
Oh yeah
"there were sixteen of them, sixteen of them all there"
Sixteen?
"Yeah sixteen of them, well the more of them you see the cheaper it is"
Yeah  she said that er they walked into Minehead on Sunday
Probably doesn't matter does it?
No I would have thought
The other thing might be to ring up  Borough Council  cos they've got offices in Caernarvon.
"Suppose that  that place  they might, there might be a er a parish hall there or something"
That pub would be alright wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Okay, or"
"That would be twenty five pound a day as well, or fifty pound a day as well ."
Anyway it's a thought.
I mean if we have to
er obviously what you're saying with  it's already in use and we can't have it?
Yeah.
It's not erm  it's no good just saying oh we can have three days out of the week anyway.
No.
"You know, it's gotta be Monday to Friday or none at all hasn't it?"
Mm.
Well if it was four days it would be alright but
Mm.
anyway
Okay so they're a few options to try as regards the coding
Alright and if we can't find anyway where we'll have to   out and come back here.
Yeah.
problem as well.
"I think we, we should find somewhere."
Yeah.
Really.
Erm so that's a few options as regards the coding.
Now
Right
The interviewing  and the briefing session I think we'll probably get away with in  Debbie  's
"Yeah we're not going to, I mean we're only going to  we're, we're"
Well it's not a sort of formal interview
This.
I mean I have been into this  window frame business.
Mm
Because we have to have sash and  sash  soft wood.
So anyway  various companies wrote.
Well they do use tropical rainforest wood but
Yeah.
it's government  er schemes.
Yeah it's like some sort of erm okay.
Yeah.
"And I mean I have, I I remember that on some T V programmes they they said it's all  bogus"
Mm.
I mean that it is not really government run er .
They reforest it but what they reforest is eucalyptus or
Yeah palm erm they  oil palm plantations
Mm.
Mm.
They just er .
"Actually I've got a, I've got a brilliant picture that I took outside the train."
Erm we were travelling through Malaysia and erm  it's just one canopy tree standing on its own  in the middle of nowhere.
And there's all this sort of undergrowth.
"And it's obviously that one wasn't, just didn't want it or it was dead or something and they just left it."
Mhm.
And it's just the one.
"And then  I've got all the pictures of all the logs on the  train wagons and er that was really  it was a, it was a good picture actually cos I thought oh look at that poor old tree there it's"
Yeah.
all its friends and then it was just standing there on the ground.
But really it's completely  it's completely wiped out Malaysia the whole of central Malaysia is just  just gone.
And all the soil's eroding cos it's sort of  sand and it's red.
And it goes into dust.
So it goes everywhere so I mean there's gonna be trouble with that in the future .
It's where they get all the flooding isn't it?
"And walked round  ah so they er  got a, sort of court bailiff involved."
"For sixty two pound, it must of cost them more than that!"
Cost a lot of money I would of thought.
They obviously don't like him do they?
No  well  erm  it's a big firm so
Perhaps it's
what they did in  is er  .
Yeah but he's got his self a bad name now isn't he?
Yeah.
"It made me laugh when your mum kept on about him last night, about having all his hampers stolen."
Yeah.
Twenty two grand!
Ridiculous innit?
The blokes on the make isn't he?
Yeah.
You see he's  and then he had the cheek to charge me for insurance!
Well I expect him to pay the insurance.
Who did pay the insurance?
"did, but I  gonna give it back."
"Well I should think so,gonna get twenty two grand out of it!"
"Cos he'd have taken them to court and said well he didn't even pay it, I did!"
Well actually they erm  I think the  maximum they'll pay out is eighteen thousand.
Yeah but I don't think that's gonna be such an easy case to .
"Well, I don't."
You know it looks to me
They said they'd got it.
"they think that it's all cut and dry, well  they haven't got the  then people will come round and investigate yet!"
No.
Mum that'll come out on the tape!
Well I can't stop it cos the kettle's boiling!
Don't be silly!
Mum is there any shandy please?
Oh Sari .
Yes I spoke to her .
"Yes, she's definitely going isn't she?"
"Mm, mm."
"Any, anybody else."
Anybody else thinking of going?
Any other offers?
"Cos, cos you're going by car are you or?"
"I'll, I'll drive yeah, so there are three seats spare in my car, vehicle."
So that you  Plymouth .
"Instead of writing a check, send the cheque ."
If you can stand the strain of the noise and diesel engine all that way.
.
All the girls in the back.
"You can get there, you can get there, perhaps, if you can get there"
I've got a seat in the back mate.
"You can get there on motorway, erm, all the way practically, can't you?"
.
Mm.
You can get there on motorway all the way.
"I ha I haven't looked at the round there, yeah, I'm, I'm sure it's not too bad really, you know, you know ."
M four .
Right is there anybody else cos we have got forms haven't we?.
.
"It's not that long if that's the case then, er, not that long a journey either."
No.
It's motorway all the way.
"Erm, anybody else interested for it, you said not didn't you."
It's not to late to book I think it says something about surcharge after sixth of March or something on the form doesn't it?

Right.
I say it's
Shall we leave it till then?
responsibility.
Right.
"Let, let us leave it till then because I mean otherwise we're gonna get bogged down in this and whe when we really are briefing procedures."
Yeah.

No.
Well  they collect aluminium cans.
Oh do they?
"Yeah, that's what I was told."
I acted on what everyone had told me I then asked my friend who had a contact in Tesco's about it she said well there is one.
"It's just inside the doors, where you don't see it."
walk in like that and you're looking at all the things in the shop not where
It's not in the recycling centre.
Why don't they put it in the recycling centre?
"I think it's cos, it looks like it's made out of cardboard."
"It's, it's probably run by the scouts."
They're in charge of it like
"Yeah, cos there's one at the swimming pool isn't there?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
"Does anybody know anything about, there's this little note in  about erm recycling paper, all sorts of paper magazines, cardboard er on the first Monday of the month."
Does anybody know anything about that?
Is this for Boots?
every first Monday of the mo month is the Birchanger scout
scout
and he gave me that information repeatedly and he's terribly involved.
"It, it's fantastic."
And I said
Didn't bother with them.
See they're alright.
"I said then  well I said from the time now, I said  there is nobody I said, can sleep on those mattresses."
"No she said, it does take a while for caravans to dry out."
Well  say what you were saying
So in other words  you don't go to the caravan.
". Let it be their responsibility, they put them in there."
"Well Mark's going in at his own risk, see?"
They sold them to you complete.
So?
So they're yours.
What's the good of a bed  a bed without a mattress?
I'm talking about the mattresses.
What are you talking about?
The caravan!
Well I thought you was talking about mattresses airing in front of the fire.
Well that subject's gone!
Oh well
"I'm saying  that  Park, what the woman said that she went down to check the vans  last summer"
Mm.
end of last summer.
long time since then .
And to see that the salt was there and the mattresses were up and that was great.
And she went down to check in the winter time and she said your van was really dry.
Oh.
Well it all depends how she checked.
perhaps.
Well then they then they went and put the mattresses back  in their places.
Now the mattresses are soaking.
Mm.
And I said there's nobody can go and sleep on those mattresses.
Was it?
It is when you see us struggling against Birmingham.
What do you think the score's gonna be against Birmingham?
Three one to Palace.
Three one to Palace?
Be great if that is.
We will score first.
They will equalize and we'll score two more.
We have got to get another goalgetter.
I mean old erm   does his bit  crossing and splitting defences and getting goals but not scoring them.
"What do you mean, getting goals and then not"
"Now, well now  it's just now we've got nobody who, who score actually really scores goals  except Thomas I would say at the moment."
We really do need somebody who regularly pops them in.
What about Gabbiadini?
What about Gabiadini?
Well  he's coming along.
I don't see him
"I think he  he had a really good first half  I think it like, I think that  to be fair, apart from Coleman an Southgate everybody faded in the second half didn't they?"
Yo.
Yo
Yeah.
"What's that, Man United fans?"
Wallington.
Where's Wallington?
Oh that's boring.
Why are we going this way then?
"Are, are Manchester United not the most cockiest fans going aren't they?"
They really are cocky .
Yeah.
"Leeds, I like Man United, I don't, I don't hate them or anything I just, they get a bit I dunno."
"Mind you not that they've had an awful lot of success recently but they are, really are a cocky lot."
Leeds are aggressive so you're always quite glad that you've beaten them but .
"Anyway he's just rotting his bowel, he'll be rotting his liver next!"
"Yeah  I said to him   Cliff, I think it's tragic mate!"
"I said that's none of my business, nothing to do with me  but I said I should think it's a tragic waste for you  and I say, it wastes your money  but that's  entirely down to you."
And what did he say?
Nothing.
"He didn't say a word, no."
Well it is a shame innit?
"Mm  I mean, you know when he gave up the drink"
He was a different man.
"he was a different bloke, yeah."
Mm.
"And the trouble is you see  they all make laugh of it  old Cliff, old Cliff, old Cliff!"
"And that makes him worse, really."
"Yeah well I said to him, what you don't realise is Cliff  they laugh at you  to your face"
But they talk
at the
behind your back!
end of the day when you do something wrong they're the first to nip in that office and say what you've done wrong  and why you've done it wrong.
"Yeah,."
But I think I shall have a quiet word with him tomorrow morning when I get to work.
Gonna see him?
Yeah.
And say what?
"Well, you know  I just can't sort of let it go on."
Well he perhaps won't do it any more now you've told him.
"As soon he gets his mouth round a Guinness bottle mate, that's it!."
"Well for heaven's sake, how many does he have?"
"Well it's roughly about five pound and, one pound and  I thought he said one pound forty a pint."
How many bottles does he have?
Well he got through fifty quid on Saturday and Sunday  so that's forty pints innit?
That's twenty pints each day
What and  forty pints in a night !
So I would think that we're working on a five minute schedule .
"Don't forget that when they first did this, people would not have had personal watches."
And there may only have been one clock in the town where they worked and that would have been on the  town hall or the church.
Clocks are a very  recent er  introduction as far as ordinary er working conditions are concerned.
What might have they have had to measure the time as it passed?
Egg timer.
Sundial.
"Sundial, yes."
But that might not have been too convenient.
Egg timer.
Say it was night for instance.
Pardon?
One of them sand things.
One of them sand things.
Who knows what they're called?
Egg timer.
An egg timer is what we use them for now.
Do you know what the traditional name for them is?
Anybody know?
It's called an hourglass.
Have you heard that before?
No.
Sir.
You scratched your nose and you've got acid on them gloves.
Right.
I did didn't I?
Yeah.
But I  I should come out in great welts soon and start looking like an American werewolf in London.
"Right, my face will start falling off."
Quite right.
You must be careful not to unconsciously  touch anything with  even the gloves.
And you should wash the gloves  as soon as you've touched the acid.
Mm.
"kingpin fairy, she sat on someone's head and she had this massive gown all over her, and that was really visual."
Erm
Yeah.
"he we wanted to her get off he just ran up to this erm, ladder and she just grabbed onto him, he just pulled it away."
Is that ?
Yeah.
"It's really hard, yeah."
You cannot visualize something taking place.
It's really wordy isn't it?
It's really sort of.
"And also, I mean, so many of the, the jokes just are  very"
quick jokes.
Yeah.
"They're based on maybe one word in a sentence but if you miss that, you've missed it."
And that doesn't really matter in the theatre because you carry on
Yeah.
"along by the visual gags, so neither of them when"
Yeah.
"you're reading it, you feel you've got to  you've got to follow the  follow the script."
"And the other thing about visual things, let's, let's say  there is a reference to somebody having piles, but they make it a visual gag"
Yeah.
Yeah.
whereas on the page it is  you know
Yeah.
schoolboy humour.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
"Erm  I mean, nevertheless, obviously it's just somebody on the  scene is a bit"
and that free way of talking  about pain.
And wrote it like that and published it like that.
Oh fabulous!
What?
"You mean, in other words, you won't have life insurance left."
"So money you've put into life insurance, goes?"
"Well that's what the life insurance is for, to pay the house off."
Oh!
Put that against the value of the house.
"Oh, great!"
So
So
in other words the money from your life insurance will pay the mortgage?
Yes.
So we've not got that much hassle then?
"No, not yet."
"So  well then, what you worrying about?"
I wasn't worried!
Good!
Glad to hear it!
Now where was I?
What happened to the grand throw out this year?
I wasn't worried at all.
"Listen though if, we can't keep everything again!"
If we go through and chuck out all the grotty stuff.
Like what?
"Well, wardrobes and stuff like that."
"Cos, we can get rid of these can't we?"
Sell these?
No!
"That, this and that."
No!
"But keep th , keep the"
Absolutely not!
Occasionally.
"I mean, at the moment there's no housekeeper so unless I actually say to the maid will you just put something in the oven for me?"
That's it.
That's appalling though!
"And on , on erm  Thursday  Thursday evening before they were going out to Mark  she came home at  just about half one."
She came and made me a ham sandwich  and the maid just look at her   to eat it now.
Brilliant!
There really was not a scrap of .
That's awful!
"Because the housekeeper  sorts all that out, so when she's away no one does it?"
"But she bought all these things for me from Marks and Spencers, you know breaded chicken and"
Mm mm.
Mm.
breasts.
Yeah.
I put them all in the deep freeze.
"Unless you think about it, you know the day before  or the"
Yeah
Yeah.
morning you come in.
But surely you can just defrost it in the microwave?
She doesn't have a microwave.
Does she not?
Why doesn't she use a
She doesn't like them.
microwave?
Doesn't like them.
But she bought you one.
She get you one.
That was quite funny because  it was our first Christmas down there  and I was saying to the housekeeper that I  I wouldn't mind having people come and stay and    not a problem because we've got a lovely cooker  and we're going to bring our microwave down from .
"Said it's electric, I'm just going to unplug it and bring it down and put it on the work top."
The only thing is that it's chocolate brown and my kitchen's all white.
I should have done that straight away.
Well spotted.
I will do it now.
"Say that again Paul, please."
"I'm sorry Paul, I can't understand you."
Something about an extractor?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It might be harmful to your lungs.
It hasn't been used yet.
But it's not er as good as
Well that's what it says it is on the erm  on the outside.
Orange spot on me notes .
Mm?
see what it was.
Now it's green.
That means it's been used with  copper.
We have a suspicion that  very little reaction has taken place because in fact very few bubbles have  risen to the surface.
This could be  I don't think acid spends itself as it sits in a bottle does it?
No.
It stays the same configuration.
Mm.
It's erm if you've used that lots and lots of times it may have used up all the .
It  may have exhausted mayn't it?
Yeah.
So  because it worked last time I used it.
I'm hoping that it has worked this time.
It's been in there much longer than  I'd normally leave it.
"So, it will either have not worked at all for some obscure reason  or it will have worked well and ."
"So whatever has happened, I'm now going to remove it from the acid."
I'm going to wash it.
Is it Brian?
"No, this one's driving a car."
He were looking at that bus.
He might be another one of them from the er   from the council.
"Yeah, well it's, they've done nowt but look at it for last three month."
I like his registration .
Well he parked car there
Mm.
"walked up there right to your house, eyed bus up  and then walked back again."
"Yeah because what they did they  they've done it a few a times though different people, look and see how far it is before it's a blind spot."
Your Bill nearly hit it other week he were telling me.
"I dunno but like er  say the d a driver's coming this way, he wants to see how far down the road it is before it's a blind spot again."
"And if they're from the council or whatever, or whoever does the roads or whatever  they'll probably get in contact with him again."
I should imagine they are from the council.
That weren't too bad that one.
Oh
That was only a oner.
It sounded better.
have a real good do.
Wouldn't mind if I could just bloody bring it up.
And it won't?
No it won't shift.
Mm.
Bloody come up one way or the other.
Oh I could fancy a nice  horse.
I like leg.
"I don't want corned beef, that's, that, I don't want that."
I like leg.
You like leg?
Yeah.
Mm.
"I'm just debating whether to run in that kitchen and put that kettle on again, what do you reckon?"
"But like I said, it  it's just, it's gonna get moved like, no cost to you like, you know what I mean?"
It's er
Yeah.
But an advantage to them!
Is that what you mean?
"But if something went wrong then, this caravan was burnt  that's the end of it!"
They  might just take those down.
"Well i , cos the co , the insurance wouldn't cover it?"
Cos they have got these records   will have these records.
"No, you'll have a certificate then, and all, saying that the caravan covered, it'll be tested every year then."
So it isn't going to be used this week?
"But, no"
You know?
not this week.
"No, not this week."
So we shall lose our insurance?
"like that, yeah."
innit?
"See that man and woman that , yeah?"
Did you see these people in there?
What people?
A man and a woman.
There was two people sitting there.
They've just gone out.
No.
After you came.
"Well they've, they bought a  a caravan down here, a brand new one!"
Yeah.
And they bought it last summer  and they've had trouble ever since!
And they're going around asking people what !
What's up with their's then?
Well they've had to move the caravan !
You can't have  all in cardboard boxes.
It's erm  not easy to organize.
You can't  and keep them open at the same time.
What is the most common problem you've experienced in your dealings with  Street?
It's phoning them up and the person I want to talk to isn't there!
I think.
"Have you had any, anybody else  phone them up or written to them?"
No?
No.
I think they're quite abrupt and rude whenever I've phoned them up.
Are they?
They're not terribly friendly.
"Oh they're usually okay I, I mean what they don't know  ."
I mean I just find it annoying cos you get through  to somebody who then passes you on to somebody else and then they'll talk to you and say well the person you want to talk to isn't here at the moment so you've had all this phone call and then you've got to ring again.
And you have to do it in office hours as well.
What has been your proudest moment this year?
Oh that was Rob.
When he was able er to enter the sub committee.
Oh yes.
"He was really proud of that and he, he made a point of that being"
I'll write that down.
for him  years of struggle  to get any influence to finally find himself
Oh good one.
What sort of committee is it then?
Hearing aid!
"Well I think one does speak a bit louder in public meetings, it's just ."
And I I can only do this work I'm sorry.
Sorry I didn't hear
Oh  I I didn't hear  either.
Turn that thing off.
I was asking what sub committee it was.
Er the environmental.
I shall mar all of that he has made and foraged.
This way!
This way!
Why?
Who am I then my love?
Who am I?
"I'll tell you, since you know about yourself."
Did you know ?
Yes she belongs to time not long past.
The good honest  that kept your master's worship house when he requires .
Will you please go out?
Since  translated so that I'll be the Captain.
By your needs such as those .
With the amount of my money all this must  .
.
"Okay, we'll sto stop there."
Now  even in that had a fairly dry reading through.
"Are there any things you want to add to that list, just looking at that?"
"Di different language and er, and what's going on."
Yeah.
In  I think  the people were speaking faster.
Alright.
"You, looking through it and almost laughing at the ."
Right.
"I think that  almost , we've got another  aspect of  erm   comedy, comedy  it's really on the basis of arguments, fighting  complication between people."
"Which, as you quite rightly say  you really need to hear, hear the voices going on."
and I'll get some people
"along the middle in a moment and, and do it."
"Any, any other things?"
Did anybody snigger on anything
No.
in those thirty lines?
"Well it says in the book, push them back with  a stick ."
With a what?
With a stick and a piece of
Yeah
"Well if it's frozen there's no way  so er I rang up Mobil you see in  and the fellow said oh if it's been on for s you know  few years he said, take your calliper off, put it in the vice and just lever it back  that's what we do"
Yeah.
"Goes to get the flexible hose off  that was ruddy frozen, you the, the union?"
"Yeah, yeah"
"Rang him up again he said oh aye well we usually change those he said, the weather gets on them."
Said they're not like the old ones that go like  as though they're welded
Yeah.
and you're turning the whole pipe.
"He said the only, the other thing you can do is  loosen it off  take the calliper b and turn the calliper round."
Yeah.
"It's like turning the car round to take off a bloody  bolt, you know?"
Oh I thought I'll do that to save another hose.
Anyway did that  course he said you'll have to bleed it out
Yeah.
Did the first one  right  this was on er  Wednesday  afternoon you see?
"So came to do the other side, went to the same routine  the nipple snapped off."
"So any rate I rang this fellow   I said eh he said  oh he said you've got no chance mate, he said."
He said you can drill it out but he said you  oh aye your  the thread gets damaged  and the seating
"That's right, yeah."
and he said if you get one leak on that your brakes
Yeah.
you're shot.
So a new calliper  how much do you think for a new calliper?
No idea.
Seventy pound plus VAT from Volvo's.
Bloody hell!
"So I thought there's no way, so I rang round the scrapyards."
Yeah.
All of it?
"Yeah, don't usually get them for nothing"
"three, four out, half a dozen"
"No tomorrow, I went into town and then I went to Emma's"
Oh did you?
Yeah
Did you have a look at the wallpaper?
"I forgot all about it, when I got to Emma's then I realized, I'm going over"
I don't usually buy that sort anyway but the last couple of
"They've got so much work, those safety ones"
"that's it, yeah"
Cor they dunno
well they would I
oh dear
all depends on the nature of
they won't need
If they thought it was that bad they would of picked it up on the M O T wouldn't they?
"That's what they said, cos I, I said is it something that has to be checked regularly, he said no, it doesn't really go that often"
Yeah
so erm  something
so you'd be paying out for some more tyres if you don't have that checked or anything
Yeah
ain't you?
"So Emma's given me his present to drop round, ha"
How long
she doesn't finish work until about half past five
Oh
and in between time she goes to meet Gordon so er
Oh yeah
"I don't know where they live, I know the court but I don't know whereabouts they are."
No
only where erm Mrs  and that live and that's about it
I don't think she's fat though
I know she doesn't eat that much but what she is eating i everything's sweet.
Chocolate
Pardon?
Well sh I don't know.
.
"if anyone offered me a chocolate when I was nursing, yes I would eat it but there was always ."
"Which reminds me, I meant to get weighed this morning before I had my breakfast and I forgot."
"Remind me tomorrow, before I eat anything."
I think I'd better put some washing in before I go out.
Are those ankle boots dry?
What?
achilles tendon
It's better now.
"I d on Wednesday I did the erm  said to me don't do the high heel part if you think it's going to hurt again, you can still have the support under it, but I managed ok."
It didn't hurt.
"The pink one's the dish cloth, the little one's the one I wipe up small spills off the floor."
I wonder how Bryony is?
What?
"I said, I wonder how Bryony is?"
She wasn't very well yesterday.
"Every time she got a bump or a knock off one of the others, she was howling instead of clouting them back."
"And Richard had, I don't think Richard's very well either."
"I said I don't, well stop running the tap."
I said I don't think Richard's very well either.
He cried more than usual.
I wonder what kind of a night Trevor had with them on his own?
What do you think of Granny Jean offering offering again to get Martin from school to save Trevor walking him home?
I don't know.
I like her.
Mhm?
I like her
Have a chart.
Heart.
You'll let people  overlook each other then  sort of overlooking
Cheating you mean!
"Yes I mean that's the first thing you have to say, you have to think  when you look at   you keep, anybody who does the whispering"
Is Mum.
"is giving their answers away  in fact, what we did, the team of four, is they all had a little pad of paper, if you spotted something you knew, you went  and you wrote it down  because people we there."
You did it in silence.
Yeah  tried to do  and they obviously can't.
Why aren't you gonna  for faces.
Well this th this is the the faces and I thought I'd do the maps and the rest were questions I don't know whether y should do some questions.
Well you'll have to think of some.
Yeah  I'll see how I go any
You got the maps of South America?
Yeah.
"I've got one at work  a blank, you should of asked me for it."
"What all split up, yeah?"
Yeah.
Oh.

Yeah could you?
Blanked out without the er the countries names
Yes
in it?
Oh yeah.
"I've got all the countries blanks  might not oh I might not even have the countries on but if you had blanks you could put countries in, that'll be easier than"
No that'll be harder.
No  what the boundaries?
"Yes  because if you've got the scale  you just drop, trace it all off  where as you got the you've the you gotta sort out work out  i th the scale of everything, haven't you?"
No you just draw the lines.
Yeah but how do you ge
What scale?
They let British come into America
"Yeah, it's the accommodations."
Yeah.
Come on girl.
Not the other way round of course.
"No, no."
Dogs from Britain can practically live anywhere
Yeah.
"Hel hello Topsy, hello Topsy, I'll shall squeeze your feet if you do it any more, I'll shall squeeze your paws and you won't like it."
Is that a good way of stopping her doing it?
"Mm, I always use to do it with my German Shepherd."
"Yeah, but they don't ."
"Cos, cos they're big enough, if they even in love, they can knock a child, well they could knock a grown up flat on your back."
She'll not be too .
"Yes, no squeeze the paws ,"
"We got  ,"
"not, not too hard for her but enough so that it's uncomfortable"
yeah.
"and they hate it, and after, after a week, after a week of having their paws squeezed every time they jump up,stop ."
"I've a lot, a lot of my friends have got  big dogs and they say oh they will jump up and I say squeeze her paws, it usually works"
Mm.
"in a week, ten days, something like."
I'll have to do that.
"They're a very , but they can still knock you flat on your back."
"Oh yeah, well she's had a, a some old chap who was walking around here, she just ran past him"
Yeah.
and she just caught the back of his leg  .
"Oh yeah , behind your knees you can."
He just crumpled up.
"I say she's only doing, she's only playing around."
"Oh yes, it's all affection."
"Mm, I'll have to try that with the feet, come on."
"And if we if if we ring up, he puts he just puts the phone straight down, soon as you tell him who it is."
Probably goes back from when they went
"He said, I, she said I can live without him anyhow."
"It'll drop off, that."
It won't.
It will.
"Come on,yella."
"I found some Mighty Muscle in garage, you know."
How much.
You know that big round tin.
"I, not how much is in it, but it'll probably be about that much in bottom."
"I know  wanting  to do this room, really, 'cos it would be too cold."
Get away with one.
I wish we'd just  too cold.
"You won't, as far as  we're having to buy coal at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
how much.
You know that big round tin?
Yeah.
"I don't know how much is in it, but probably be about that much in bottom."
"might be  really, couldn't  too cold."
Get away with one.
"I wish we'd afford some  I mean, it's cold."
"You won't  while we're having the buy coal, at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
"We'll probably just buy some, and that lad'll ring up."
He probably will.
Especially if this mild weather stops.
"But it is mild today, ain't it."
Yeah.
I don't know  but they must of done it sometime.
"It weren't when, the other when we got all pissed?"
"No, but I mean"
Why's she think she's pregnant then?
"I mean, didn't they use anything for"
Yeah!
"But she  well she didn't, I mean she didn't tell me the intimate details or anything  I don't even know whether she has, she wo , she might have ju ge , been getting over dramatic or something!"
But she  but  her period was a week and half late  and she started well panicking!
"Yeah, well she"
"And you know , you know when we thought, yeah  well she'd, she'd just come on when she came down to my house  and she was really, really, really in a happy mood!"
"And er  you know, you know when we saw them two walking"
Yeah.
the other day?
"That was what she was upset about  she thought, oh dear,Scotty's a going to be a daddy !"
"Fucking hell,!"
I hope she hadn't done it that Saturday when we all were outside and we watching
"She might not have done it, done it  but like  she might have"
like
like  yeah.
"Cos you never know, I mean  Andrew  wipe spunk all over somebody, you know!"
"Yeah, I I should think she like  she's done some  done naughty things"
Well we all do  though
"and, yeah"
"If she's given him a blow job, I mean"
"But I mean, she's probably done something like that  and  she's just got over dramatic about it!"
Guess what  she's said she's gonna write to go on the pill!
Did she?
Well not to me !
"She did and she says, she goes, I wanna go on the pill while I've got the courage!"
But I don't think I can rely on myself to take them everyday!
"If you was there you could take them, too pissed I should think!"
Probably!
"So she said, Val said I thought  good for you mate, you didn't get pushed out  he's gone  they're all gone  till the new year innit?"
Well I wouldn't of wanted to go with them myself.
"Well not after that little escapade, nor would I."
"I wouldn't of thought so  I would of sa I would of said well if I bloody ju good enough for living with I bleeding come on a  I don't think she'd want him on holiday with her anyway  and her sister said is she hadn't got enough money, she'd pay for it."
That's right  that's what Val told me.
She don't have time for him.
What?
She hasn't got a lot of time for him now.
Who hasn't  her sister?
Her sister.
No  she just says he's a bloody big head!
Well he is isn't he?
Well yeah.
Ah I mustn't I must admit I don't think I know any worse than him.
But I think he's quite harmless really Geoff  I don't think he
Oh yeah.
"means any harm, that's his way."
Well that's yeah but I I must admit I find it quite tiring.
Well he's always been pleasant to me  you gotta
I can honestly say  he's the sort of bloke I would sort of try not to get lumbered with at a party or somewhere like that   I mean I don't mind I didn't mind talking to her  but I find her
Well I find her  boring.
Yeah.
I find her very boring  although she's a very kind person.
"Yeah, no I could talk to her more than I could talk to him."
"I'm surprised  you know, she isn't stuck for them children mo any more if he'd been"
Oh yeah.
like this  that's it.
Let's face it she erm  I mean she was the one who bloody married him!
Well she hates him!
Yeah.
She literally hates him!
Yeah.
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing-time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"-LSB- Illustration : One day they were overheard by a fairy -RSB- He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , ` Is it to-day ? '"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him .
"` In case you should feel cold , ' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , ` I 'm afraid nurse would see me , so I sha n't be able to do it . '"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , ` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , ' and in a whisper , ` Then you can hide , ' and off they ran ."
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"` Brave , brave ! '"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight crept over the Gardens , and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , ` So that 's all right . '"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm-tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The little people weave their summer curtains from skeleton leaves -RSB- She was about to say , ' I never knew you could speak ! '"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , ' I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? '"
"and the elm replied , ` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , ' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
"Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing , and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her ."
"So when he had freed Wendy , he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others , and himself took her place by the mast , her cloak around him so that he should pass for her ."
Then he took a great breath and crowed .
To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin ; and they were panic-stricken .
"Hook tried to hearten them ; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs , and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him ."
"`` Lads , '' he said , ready to cajole or strike as need be , but never quailing for an instant , `` I 've thought it out ."
There 's a Jonah aboard . ''
"`` Ay , '' they snarled , `` a man wi ' a hook . ''"
"`` No , lads , no , it 's the girl ."
Never was luck on a pirate ship wi ' a woman on board .
We 'll right the ship when she 's gone . ''
Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint 's .
"`` It 's worth trying , '' they said doubtfully ."
"`` Fling the girl overboard , '' cried Hook ; and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak ."
"`` There 's none can save you now , missy , '' Mullins hissed jeeringly ."
"`` There 's one , '' replied the figure ."
`` Who 's that ? ''
`` Peter Pan the avenger ! ''
came the terrible answer ; and as he spoke Peter flung off his cloak .
"Then they all knew who 't was that had been undoing them in the cabin , and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed ."
In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke .
"At last he cried , `` Cleave him to the brisket ! ''"
but without conviction .
"`` Down , boys , and at them ! ''"
Peter 's voice rang out ; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship .
"Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won ; but the onset came when they were still unstrung , and they ran hither and thither , striking wildly , each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew ."
"Man to man they were the stronger ; but they fought on the defensive only , which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry ."
"Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea ; others hid in dark recesses , where they were found by Slightly , who did not fight , but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces , so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys ."
"There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons , an occasional screech or splash , and Slightly monotonously counting -- five -- six -- seven eight -- nine -- ten -- eleven ."
"I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook , who seemed to have a charmed life , as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire ."
"They had done for his dogs , but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all ."
"Again and again they closed upon him , and again and again he hewed a clear space ."
"He had lifted up one boy with his hook , and was using him as a buckler -LSB- shield -RSB- , when another , who had just passed his sword through Mullins , sprang into the fray ."
"I should , I think , have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face ."
"It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness -- a haggard old man 's smile ; but there was , besides that , a grain of derision , a shadow of treachery , in his expression as he craftily watched , and watched , and watched me at my work ."
"26 Israel Hands THE wind , serving us to a desire , now hauled into the west ."
We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet .
"Only , as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther , time hung on our hands ."
"The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to ; after a good many trials I succeeded , and we both sat in silence over another meal ."
"`` Cap'n , '' said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile , `` here 's my old shipmate , O'Brien ; s ` pose you was to heave him overboard ."
"I ai n't partic ` lar as a rule , and I do n't take no blame for settling his hash , but I do n't reckon him ornamental now , do you ? ''"
"`` I 'm not strong enough , and I do n't like the job ; and there he lies , for me , '' said I. `` This here 's an unlucky ship , this HISPANIOLA , Jim , '' he went on , blinking ."
`` There 's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA -- a sight o ' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol .
"I never seen sich dirty luck , not I ."
"There was this here O'Brien now -- he 's dead , ai n't he ?"
"Well now , I 'm no scholar , and you 're a lad as can read and figure , and to put it straight , do you take it as a dead man is dead for good , or do he come alive again ? ''"
"`` You can kill the body , Mr. Hands , but not the spirit ; you must know that already , '' I replied ."
"`` O'Brien there is in another world , and may be watching us . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
says he .
"`` Well , that 's unfort ` nate -- appears as if killing parties was a waste of time ."
"Howsomever , sperrits do n't reckon for much , by what I 've seen ."
"I 'll chance it with the sperrits , Jim ."
"And now , you 've spoke up free , and I 'll take it kind if you 'd step down into that there cabin and get me a -- well , a -- shiver my timbers !"
"I ca n't hit the name on ` t ; well , you get me a bottle of wine , Jim -- this here brandy 's too strong for my head . ''"
"Now , the coxswain 's hesitation seemed to be unnatural , and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy , I entirely disbelieved it ."
The whole story was a pretext .
He wanted me to leave the deck -- so much was plain ; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine .
"His eyes never met mine ; they kept wandering to and fro , up and down , now with a look to the sky , now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien ."
"All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty , embarrassed manner , so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception ."
"I was prompt with my answer , however , for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end ."
`` Some wine ? ''
I said .
`` Far better .
Will you have white or red ? ''
"One , tailing out behind the rest , was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey 's ; the rest were revenue officers , whom he had met by the way , and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once ."
"Some news of the lugger in Kitt 's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction , and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death ."
"Pew was dead , stone dead ."
"As for my mother , when we had carried her up to the hamlet , a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again , and she was none the worse for her terror , though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money ."
"In the meantime the supervisor rode on , as fast as he could , to Kitt 's Hole ; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle , leading , and sometimes supporting , their horses , and in continual fear of ambushes ; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way , though still close in ."
He hailed her .
"A voice replied , telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him , and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm ."
"Soon after , the lugger doubled the point and disappeared ."
"Mr. Dance stood there , as he said , `` like a fish out of water , '' and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B -- to warn the cutter ."
"`` And that , '' said he , `` is just about as good as nothing ."
"They 've got off clean , and there 's an end ."
"Only , '' he added , `` I 'm glad I trod on Master Pew 's corns , '' for by this time he had heard my story ."
"I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow , and you can not imagine a house in such a state of smash ; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself ; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain 's money-bag and a little silver from the till , I could see at once that we were ruined ."
Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene .
"`` They got the money , you say ?"
"Well , then , Hawkins , what in fortune were they after ?"
"More money , I suppose ? ''"
"`` No , sir ; not money , I think , '' replied I. `` In fact , sir , I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , I should like to get it put in safety . ''"
"`` To be sure , boy ; quite right , '' said he ."
"`` I 'll take it , if you like . ''"
`` I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey -- '' I began .
"`` Perfectly right , '' he interrupted very cheerily , `` perfectly right -- a gentleman and a magistrate ."
"And , now I come to think of it , I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire ."
"Master Pew 's dead , when all 's done ; not that I regret it , but he 's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty 's revenue , if make it out they can ."
"Now , I 'll tell you , Hawkins , if you like , I 'll take you along . ''"
"I thanked him heartily for the offer , and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were ."
By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle .
"`` Dogger , '' said Mr. Dance , `` you have a good horse ; take up this lad behind you . ''"
"As soon as I was mounted , holding on to Dogger 's belt , the supervisor gave the word , and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey 's house ."
6 The Captain 's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey 's door .
The house was all dark to the front .
"Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock , and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by ."
Then pare your squash and potatoes . ''
"`` There is only one potato , '' giggled Sally ."
"`` Cut it in four pieces , so it will go into the little kettle , and put the bits into cold water till it is time to cook them . ''"
`` Do I soak the squash too ? ''
"`` No , indeed !"
"Just pare it and cut it up , and put in into the steamer over the pot ."
"It is drier so , though it takes longer to cook . ''"
"Here a scratching at the door caused Sally to run and open it , when Kit appeared with a covered basket in his mouth ."
`` Here 's the butcher boy ! ''
"cried Daisy , much tickled at the idea , as she relieved him of his load , whereat he licked his lips and began to beg , evidently thinking that it was his own dinner , for he often carried it to his master in that way ."
"Being undeceived , he departed in great wrath and barked all the way downstairs , to ease his wounded feelings ."
"In the basket were two bits of steak -LRB- doll 's pounds -RRB- , a baked pear , a small cake , and paper with them on which Asia had scrawled , `` For Missy 's lunch , if her cookin ' do n't turn out well . ''"
"`` I do n't want any of her old pears and things ; my cooking will turn out well , and I 'll have a splendid dinner ; see if I do n't ! ''"
"cried Daisy , indignantly ."
`` We may like them if company should come .
"It is always well to have something in the storeroom , '' said Aunt Jo , who had been taught this valuable fact by a series of domestic panics ."
"`` Me is hundry , '' announced Teddy , who began to think what with so much cooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something ."
"His mother gave him her workbasket to rummage , hoping to keep him quiet till dinner was ready , and returned to her housekeeping ."
"`` Put on your vegetables , set the table , and then have some coals kindling ready for the steak . ''"
"What a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot ; to peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer ; to whisk open the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on , and at last when the coals were red and glowing , to put two real steaks on a finger-long gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork ."
"The potatoes were done first , and no wonder , for they had boiled frantically all the while ."
"The were pounded up with a little pestle , had much butter and no salt put in -LRB- cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment -RRB- , then it was made into a mound in a gay red dish , smoothed over with a knife dipped in milk , and put in the oven to brown ."
"So absorbed in these last performances had Sally been , that she forgot her pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato , then a wail arose , for alas !"
alas !
the little pies were burnt black !
"`` Oh , my pies !"
My darling pies !
They are all spoilt ! ''
"cried poor Sally , wringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work ."
"The tart was especially pathetic , for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in all directions from the blackened jelly , like the walls and chimney of a house after a fire ."
"`` Dear , dear , I forgot to remind you to take them out ; it 's just my luck , '' said Aunt Jo , remorsefully ."
"`` Do n't cry , darling , it was my fault ; we 'll try again after dinner , '' she added , as a great tear dropped from Sally 's eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart ."
"`` Nicely ; she is getting quite mannerly , and begins to see the error of her wild ways . ''"
`` Do n't the boys encourage her in them ? ''
"`` Yes ; but I keep talking , and lately she has improved much ."
"You saw how prettily she shook hands with you , and how gentle she was with Bess ."
"Daisy 's example has its effect upon her , and I 'm quite sure that a few months will work wonders . ''"
"Here Mrs. Jo 's remarks were cut short by the appearance of Nan tearing round the corner at a break-neck pace , driving a mettlesome team of four boys , and followed by Daisy trundling Bess in a wheelbarrow ."
"Hat off , hair flying , whip cracking , and barrow bumping , up they came in a cloud of dust , looking as wild a set of little hoydens as one would wish to see ."
"`` So , these are the model children , are they ?"
"It 's lucky I did n't bring Mrs. Curtis out to see your school for the cultivation of morals and manners ; she would never have recovered from the shock of this spectacle , '' said Mr. Laurie , laughing at Mrs. Jo 's premature rejoicing over Nan 's improvement ."
`` Laugh away ; I 'll succeed yet .
"As you used to say at College , quoting some professor , ` Though the experiment has failed , the principle remains the same , ' '' said Mrs. Bhaer , joining in the merriment ."
"`` I 'm afraid Nan 's example is taking effect upon Daisy , instead of the other way ."
Look at my little princess !
"she has utterly forgotten her dignity , and is screaming like the rest ."
"Young ladies , what does this mean ? ''"
"and Mr. Laurie rescued his small daughter from impending destruction , for the four horses were champing their bits and curvetting madly all about her , as she sat brandishing a great whip in both hands ."
"`` We 're having a race , and I beat , '' shouted Nan ."
"`` I could have run faster , only I was afraid of spilling Bess , '' screamed Daisy ."
`` Hi !
go long ! ''
"cried the princess , giving such a flourish with her whip that the horses ran away , and were seen no more ."
`` My precious child !
come away from this ill-mannered crew before you are quite spoilt .
"Good-by , Jo !"
"Next time I come , I shall expect to find the boys making patchwork . ''"
`` It would n't hurt them a bit .
"I do n't give in , mind you ; for my experiments always fail a few times before they succeed ."
"Love to Amy and my blessed Marmee , '' called Mrs. Jo , as the carriage drove away ; and the last Mr. Laurie saw of her , she was consoling Daisy for her failure by a ride in the wheelbarrow , and looking as if she liked it ."
"Great was the excitement all the week about the repairs in the carriage-house , which went briskly on in spite of the incessant questions , advice , and meddling of the boys ."
"Old Gibbs was nearly driven wild with it all , but managed to do his work nevertheless ; and by Friday night the place was all in order roof mended , shelves up , walls whitewashed , a great window cut at the back , which let in a flood of sunshine , and gave them a fine view of the brook , the meadows , and the distant hills ; and over the great door , painted in red letters , was `` The Laurence Museum . ''"
"All Saturday morning the boys were planning how it should be furnished with their spoils , and when Mr. Laurie arrived , bringing an aquarium which Mrs. Amy said she was tired of , their rapture was great ."
"The afternoon was spent in arranging things , and when the running and lugging and hammering was over , the ladies were invited to behold the institution ."
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"-LSB- Illustration : A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them -RSB- Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping-beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though this had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
Poor little Peter Pan !
"he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease for ever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"` Look at your nightgown , if you do n't believe me , ' Solomon said ; and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
` How many of your toes are thumbs ? '
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw , to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"` Ruffle your feathers , ' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Put his strange case before old Solomon Caw -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- ' I think I shall go back to mother , ' he said , timidly ."
"` Good-bye , ' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
` Why do n't you go ? '
the old one asked politely . '
"I suppose , ' said Peter huskily , ' I suppose I can still fly ? '"
You see he had lost faith .
` Poor little half-and-half ! '
"said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , ` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . '
` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? '
Peter asked tragically .
` How could you get across ? '
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
Next moment I was face to face with Anderson .
"He roared aloud , and his hanger went up above his head , flashing in the sunlight ."
"I had not time to be afraid , but as the blow still hung impending , leaped in a trice upon one side , and missing my foot in the soft sand , rolled headlong down the slope ."
"When I had first sallied from the door , the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us ."
"One man , in a red night-cap , with his cutlass in his mouth , had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across ."
"Well , so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture , the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over , another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade ."
"And yet , in this breath of time , the fight was over and the victory was ours ."
"Gray , following close behind me , had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow ."
"Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony , the pistol still smoking in his hand ."
"A third , as I had seen , the doctor had disposed of at a blow ."
"Of the four who had scaled the palisade , one only remained unaccounted for , and he , having left his cutlass on the field , was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him ."
`` Fire -- fire from the house ! ''
cried the doctor .
"`` And you , lads , back into cover . ''"
"But his words were unheeded , no shot was fired , and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood ."
"In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen , four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade ."
The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter .
"The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets , and at any moment the fire might recommence ."
"The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke , and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory ."
"Hunter lay beside his loophole , stunned ; Joyce by his , shot through the head , never to move again ; while right in the centre , the squire was supporting the captain , one as pale as the other ."
"`` The captain 's wounded , '' said Mr. Trelawney ."
`` Have they run ? ''
asked Mr. Smollett .
"`` All that could , you may be bound , '' returned the doctor ; `` but there 's five of them will never run again . ''"
`` Five ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Come , that 's better ."
Five against three leaves us four to nine .
That 's better odds than we had at starting .
"We were seven to nineteen then , or thought we were , and that 's as bad to bear . ''"
"* * The mutineers were soon only eight in number , for the man shot by Mr. Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound ."
"But this was , of course , not known till after by the faithful party ."
The door was opened almost at once by the maid .
`` Is Dr. Livesey in ? ''
I asked .
"No , she said , he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire ."
"`` So there we go , boys , '' said Mr. Dance ."
"This time , as the distance was short , I did not mount , but ran with Dogger 's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens ."
"Here Mr. Dance dismounted , and taking me along with him , was admitted at a word into the house ."
"The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library , all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them , where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat , pipe in hand , on either side of a bright fire ."
I had never seen the squire so near at hand .
"He was a tall man , over six feet high , and broad in proportion , and he had a bluff , rough-and-ready face , all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels ."
"His eyebrows were very black , and moved readily , and this gave him a look of some temper , not bad , you would say , but quick and high ."
"`` Come in , Mr. Dance , '' says he , very stately and condescending ."
"`` Good evening , Dance , '' says the doctor with a nod ."
"`` And good evening to you , friend Jim ."
What good wind brings you here ? ''
"The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson ; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other , and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest ."
"When they heard how my mother went back to the inn , Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh , and the squire cried `` Bravo ! ''"
and broke his long pipe against the grate .
"Long before it was done , Mr. Trelawney -LRB- that , you will remember , was the squire 's name -RRB- had got up from his seat and was striding about the room , and the doctor , as if to hear the better , had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll ."
At last Mr. Dance finished the story .
"`` Mr. Dance , '' said the squire , `` you are a very noble fellow ."
"And as for riding down that black , atrocious miscreant , I regard it as an act of virtue , sir , like stamping on a cockroach ."
"This lad Hawkins is a trump , I perceive ."
"Hawkins , will you ring that bell ?"
Mr. Dance must have some ale . ''
"`` And so , Jim , '' said the doctor , `` you have the thing that they were after , have you ? ''"
"`` Here it is , sir , '' said I , and gave him the oilskin packet ."
"The doctor looked it all over , as if his fingers were itching to open it ; but instead of doing that , he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat ."
"`` Squire , '' said he , `` when Dance has had his ale he must , of course , be off on his Majesty 's service ; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house , and with your permission , I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup . ''"
"`` As you will , Livesey , '' said the squire ; `` Hawkins has earned better than cold pie . ''"
"So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable , and I made a hearty supper , for I was as hungry as a hawk , while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed ."
"`` And now , squire , '' said the doctor ."
"asked Sally , all impatience to begin ."
"`` Shut the lower draught of the stove , so that the oven may heat ."
"Then wash your hands and get out the flour , sugar , salt , butter , and cinnamon ."
"See if the pie-board is clean , and pare your apple ready to put in . ''"
"Daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be expected , from so young a cook ."
"`` I really do n't know how to measure for such tiny pies ; I must guess at it , and if these do n't succeed , we must try again , '' said Mrs. Jo , looking rather perplexed , and very much amused with the small concern before her ."
"`` Take that little pan full of flour , put in a pinch of salt , and then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate ."
"Always remember to put your dry things together first , and then the wet ."
It mixes better so . ''
`` I know how ; I saw Asia do it .
Do n't I butter the pie plates too ?
"She did , the first thing , '' said Daisy , whisking the flour about at a great rate ."
`` Quite right !
"I do believe you have a gift for cooking , you take to it so cleverly , '' said Aunt Jo , approvingly ."
"`` Now a dash of cold water , just enough to wet it ; then scatter some flour on the board , work in a little , and roll the paste out ; yes , that 's the way ."
"Now put dabs of butter all over it , and roll it out again ."
"We wo n't have our pastry very rich , or the dolls will get dyspeptic . ''"
"Daisy laughed at the idea , and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand ."
"Then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin , and having got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it ."
"Next the apple was sliced in , sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it , and then the top crust put on with breathless care ."
"`` I always wanted to cut them round , and Asia never would let me ."
How nice it is to do it all my ownty donty self ! ''
"said Daisy , as the little knife went clipping round the doll 's plate poised on her hand ."
"All cooks , even the best , meet with mishaps sometimes , and Sally 's first one occurred then , for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped , turned a somersault in the air , and landed the dear little pie upside down on the floor ."
"Sally screamed , Mrs. Jo laughed , Teddy scrambled to get it , and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen ."
"`` It did n't spill or break , because I pinched the edges together so hard ; it is n't hurt a bit , so I 'll prick holes in it , and then it will be ready , '' said Sally , picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into shape with a child-like disregard of the dust it had gathered in its fall ."
"`` My new cook has a good temper , I see , and that is such a comfort , '' said Mrs. Jo ."
"`` Now open the jar of strawberry jam , fill the uncovered pie , and put some strips of paste over the top as Asia does . ''"
"`` I 'll make a D in the middle , and have zigzags all round , that will be so interesting when I come to eat it , '' said Sally , loading the pie with quirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild ."
`` Now I put them in ! ''
"she exclaimed ; when the last grimy knob had been carefully planted in the red field of jam , and with an air of triumph she shut them into the little oven ."
`` Clear up your things ; a good cook never lets her utensils collect .
"And for the exposure -- if ye were an ugly hunchback , and the children gecked at you upon the street , ye would count your body cheaper , and an hour of glory worth a life ."
"Howbeit , if ye will , let us ride on and visit the other posts ."
"Sir Richard here , my namesake , he shall still hold this entry , where he wadeth to the ankles in hot blood ."
Him can we trust .
"But mark it , Sir Richard , ye are not yet done ."
The worst is yet to ward .
Sleep not . ''
"He came right up to young Shelton , looking him hard in the eyes , and taking his hand in both of his , gave it so extreme a squeeze that the blood had nearly spurted ."
Dick quailed before his eyes .
"The insane excitement , the courage , and the cruelty that he read therein filled him with dismay about the future ."
"This young duke 's was indeed a gallant spirit , to ride foremost in the ranks of war ; but after the battle , in the days of peace and in the circle of his trusted friends , that mind , it was to be dreaded , would continue to bring forth the fruits of death ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY -LRB- Concluded -RRB- Dick , once more left to his own counsels , began to look about him ."
The arrow-shot had somewhat slackened .
"On all sides the enemy were falling back ; and the greater part of the market-place was now left empty , the snow here trampled into orange mud , there splashed with gore , scattered all over with dead men and horses , and bristling thick with feathered arrows ."
On his own side the loss had been cruel .
"The jaws of the little street and the ruins of the barricade were heaped with the dead and dying ; and out of the hundred men with whom he had begun the battle , there were not seventy left who could still stand to arms ."
"At the same time , the day was passing ."
"The first reinforcements might be looked for to arrive at any moment ; and the Lancastrians , already shaken by the result of their desperate but unsuccessful onslaught , were in an ill temper to support a fresh invader ."
"There was a dial in the wall of one of the two flanking houses ; and this , in the frosty winter sunshine , indicated ten of the forenoon ."
"Dick turned to the man who was at his elbow , a little insignificant archer , binding a cut in his arm ."
"`` It was well fought , '' he said , `` and , by my sooth , they will not charge us twice . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said the little archer , `` ye have fought right well for York , and better for yourself ."
Never hath man in so brief space prevailed so greatly on the duke 's affections .
That he should have entrusted such a post to one he knew not is a marvel .
"But look to your head , Sir Richard !"
"If ye be vanquished -- ay , if ye give way one foot 's breadth -- axe or cord shall punish it ; and I am set if ye do aught doubtful , I will tell you honestly , here to stab you from behind . ''"
Dick looked at the little man in amaze .
`` You ! ''
he cried .
`` And from behind ! ''
"`` It is right so , '' returned the archer ; `` and because I like not the affair I tell it you ."
"Ye must make the post good , Sir Richard , at your peril ."
"The woman had been surprised before at the disappearance of her food , but she was more astonished still when , instead of the plank , she beheld a baby ."
"However , she was fond of children and had none of her own , so she made up her mind that she would keep it and take care of it ."
"The baby grew and throve as no baby in that country had ever done , and in four days he was a man , and as tall and strong as any brave of the tribe ."
"` You have treated me well , ' he said , ` and meat shall never fail to your house ."
"But now I must go , for I have much work to do . '"
Then he set out for his home .
"It took him many days to get there , and when he saw his son sitting in his place his anger was kindled , and his heart was stirred to take vengeance upon him ."
"So he went out quickly into the forest and shed tears , and each tear became a bird ."
"` Stay there till I want you , ' said he ; and he returned to the hut . '"
"I saw some pretty new birds , high up in a tree yonder , ' he remarked ."
And the son answered : ` Show me the way and I will get them for dinner . '
"The two went out together , and after walking for about half an hour they old man stopped ."
"` That is the tree , ' he said ."
And the son began to climb it .
Now a strange thing happened .
"The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be , and when he looked down the earth below appeared no bigger than a star ."
"Sill he tried to go back , but he could not , and though he could not see the birds any longer he felt as if something were dragging him up and up ."
"He thought that he had been climbing that tree for days , and perhaps he had , for suddenly a beautiful country , yellow with fields of maize , stretched before him , and he gladly left the top of the tree and entered it ."
"He walked through the maize without knowing where he was going , when he heard a sound of knocking , and saw two old blind women crushing their food between two stones ."
"He crept up to them on tiptoe , and when one old woman passed her dinner to the other he held out his hand and took it and ate if for himself ."
"` How slow you are kneading that cake , ' cried the other old woman at last ."
"` Why , I have given you your dinner , and what more do you want ? '"
replied the second .
"` You did n't ; at least I never got it , ' said the other . '"
I certainly thought you took it from me ; but here is some more . '
And again the young man stretched out his hand ; and the two old women fell to quarrelling afresh .
"But when it happened for the third time the old women suspected some trick , and one of them exclaimed : ' I am sure there is a man here ; tell me , are you not my grandson ? '"
"` Yes , ' answered the young man , who wished to please her , ` and in return for your good dinner I will see if I can not restore your sight ; for I was taught in the art of healing by the best medicine man in the tribe . '"
"And with that he left them , and wandered about till he found the herb which he wanted ."
"Then he hastened back to the old women , and begging them to boil him some water , he threw the herb in ."
"As soon as the pot began to sing he took off the lid , and sprinkled the eyes of the women , and sight came back to them once more ."
"There was no night in that country , so , instead of going to bed very early , as he would have done in his own hut , the young man took another walk ."
"Never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore , being stunned with the horror of that screaming ; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach when Hoseason woke up , as if out of a muse , and bade them lay hands upon Alan ."
"They hung back indeed , having little taste for the employment ; but Hoseason was like a fiend , crying that Alan was alone , that he had a great sum about him , that he had been the means of losing the brig and drowning all their comrades , and that here was both revenge and wealth upon a single cast ."
It was seven against one ; in that part of the shore there was no rock that Alan could set his back to ; and the sailors began to spread out and come behind him .
"`` And then , '' said Alan , `` the little man with the red head -- I havenae mind of the name that he is called . ''"
"`` Riach , '' said I. `` Ay '' said Alan , `` Riach !"
"Well , it was him that took up the clubs for me , asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment , and , says he ` Dod , I 'll put my back to the Hielandman 's mysel ' . '"
"That 's none such an entirely bad little man , yon little man with the red head , '' said Alan ."
`` He has some spunks of decency . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` he was kind to me in his way . ''"
"`` And so he was to Alan , '' said he ; `` and by my troth , I found his way a very good one !"
"But ye see , David , the loss of the ship and the cries of these poor lads sat very ill upon the man ; and I 'm thinking that would be the cause of it . ''"
"`` Well , I would think so , '' says I ; `` for he was as keen as any of the rest at the beginning ."
But how did Hoseason take it ? ''
"`` It sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill , '' says Alan ."
"`` But the little man cried to me to run , and indeed I thought it was a good observe , and ran ."
"The last that I saw they were all in a knot upon the beach , like folk that were not agreeing very well together . ''"
`` What do you mean by that ? ''
"said I. `` Well , the fists were going , '' said Alan ; `` and I saw one man go down like a pair of breeks ."
But I thought it would be better no to wait .
"Ye see there 's a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull , which is no good company for a gentleman like me ."
"If it hadnae been for that I would have waited and looked for ye mysel ' , let alone giving a hand to the little man . ''"
"-LRB- It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach 's stature , for , to say the truth , the one was not much smaller than the other . -RRB-"
"`` So , '' says he , continuing , `` I set my best foot forward , and whenever I met in with any one I cried out there was a wreck ashore ."
"Man , they didnae stop to fash with me !"
Ye should have seen them linking for the beach !
"And when they got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run , which is aye good for a Campbell ."
I 'm thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the brig went down in the lump and didnae break .
"But it was a very unlucky thing for you , that same ; for if any wreck had come ashore they would have hunted high and low , and would soon have found ye . ''"
"CHAPTER XIX THE HOUSE OF FEAR Night fell as we were walking , and the clouds , which had broken up in the afternoon , settled in and thickened , so that it fell , for the season of the year , extremely dark ."
"The way we went was over rough mountainsides ; and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner , I could by no means see how he directed himself ."
"At last , about half-past ten of the clock , we came to the top of a brae , and saw lights below us ."
"It seemed a house door stood open and let out a beam of fire and candle-light ; and all round the house and steading five or six persons were moving hurriedly about , each carrying a lighted brand ."
"` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight , ' she said , with her eyes shining ."
"` And one ca n't get a fellow like this in summer either , ' said the young man , pointing to the Snow-man ."
` He 's a beauty ! '
"The girl laughed , and nodded to the Snow-man , and then they both danced away over the snow ."
` Who were those two ? '
asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog .
` You have been in this yard longer than I have .
Do you know who they are ? '
` Do I know them indeed ? '
answered the yard-dog .
"` She has often stroked me , and he has given me bones ."
I do n't bite either of them ! '
` But what are they ? '
asked the Snow-man .
` Lovers ! '
replied the yard-dog .
"Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther , who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe ."
To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide .
Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered ; and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account .
What he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method .
"On the other hand , this , as destroying the element of surprise , would have made his strategy of no avail , so that the whole question is beset with difficulties ."
"One can not at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme , and the fell -LSB- deadly -RSB- genius with which it was carried out ."
What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment ?
"Fain -LSB- gladly -RSB- would his dogs have known , as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses , they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook , and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man ."
"Elation must have been in his heart , but his face did not reflect it : ever a dark and solitary enigma , he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance ."
"The night 's work was not yet over , for it was not the redskins he had come out to destroy ; they were but the bees to be smoked , so that he should get at the honey ."
"It was Pan he wanted , Pan and Wendy and their band , but chiefly Pan ."
Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man 's hatred of him .
"True he had flung Hook 's arm to the crocodile , but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led , owing to the crocodile 's pertinacity -LSB- persistance -RSB- , hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant ."
The truth is that there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy .
"It was not his courage , it was not his engaging appearance , it was not -- ."
"There is no beating about the bush , for we know quite well what it was , and have got to tell ."
"There he sat , lighted up by the flames from the burning house opposite , both hands holding tightly on his red cap , in which lay the treasure ; and now he knew what his heart really valued most -- to whom he really belonged ."
"But when the fire was put out , and the Goblin thought it over -- then -- ' I will divide myself between the two , ' he said . '"
"I can not quite give up the grocer , because of the jam ! '"
And it is just the same with us .
We also can not quite give up the grocer -- because of the jam .
The House in the Wood From the German of Grimm .
A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest .
"One morning as he was going to his work , he said to his wife , ` Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood ; and so that she shall not lose her way , I will take a bag of millet with me , and sprinkle the seed on the path . '"
"When the sun had risen high over the forest , the girl set out with a basin of soup ."
"But the field and wood sparrows , the larks and finches , blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago , and the girl could not find her way ."
"She went on and on , till the sun set and night came on ."
"The trees rustled in the darkness , the owls hooted , and she began to be very much frightened ."
Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees .
"` There must be people living yonder , ' she thought , ` who will take me in for the night , ' and she began walking towards it ."
Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows .
"She knocked at the door , and a gruff voice called , ` Come in ! '"
"The girl stepped into the dark entrance , and tapped at the door of the room ."
"` Just walk in , ' cried the voice , and when she opened the door there sat an old gray-haired man at the table ."
"His face was resting on his hands , and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground ."
"By the stove lay three beasts , a hen , a cock , and a brindled cow ."
"The girl told the old man her story , and asked for a night 's lodging ."
"The man said : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"` Duks , ' answered the beasts ; and that must have meant , ` We are quite willing , ' for the old man went on , ` Here is abundance ; go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper . '"
"The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen , and cooked a good meal , but she did not think of the beasts ."
"She placed the full dishes on the table , sat down opposite the gray-haired man , and ate till her hunger was appeased ."
"When she was satisfied , she said , ` But now I am so tired , where is a bed in which I can sleep ? '"
"The beasts answered : You have eaten with him , You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Sleep then as you ought !"
"Then the old man said , ` Go upstairs , and there you will find a bedroom ; shake the bed , and put clean sheets on , and go to sleep . '"
"The maiden went upstairs , and when she had made the bed , she lay down ."
"After some time the gray-haired man came , looked at her by the light of his candle , and shook his head ."
"And when he saw that she was sound asleep , he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar ."
"The woodcutter came home late in the evening , and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food ."
"I could not help wondering who it was that had `` got itt , '' and what `` itt '' was that he got ."
A knife in his back as like as not .
"`` Not much instruction there , '' said Dr. Livesey as he passed on ."
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries .
"There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money , as in common account-books , but instead of explanatory writing , only a varying number of crosses between the two ."
"On the 12th of June , 1745 , for instance , a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone , and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause ."
"In a few cases , to be sure , the name of a place would be added , as `` Offe Caraccas , '' or a mere entry of latitude and longitude , as `` 62o 17 ' 20 '' , 19o 2 ' 40 '' . ''"
"The record lasted over nearly twenty years , the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on , and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions , and these words appended , `` Bones , his pile . ''"
"`` I ca n't make head or tail of this , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
"`` The thing is as clear as noonday , '' cried the squire ."
`` This is the black-hearted hound 's account-book .
These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered .
"The sums are the scoundrel 's share , and where he feared an ambiguity , you see he added something clearer ."
"` Offe Caraccas , ' now ; you see , here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast ."
God help the poor souls that manned her -- coral long ago . ''
`` Right ! ''
said the doctor .
`` See what it is to be a traveller .
Right !
"And the amounts increase , you see , as he rose in rank . ''"
"There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French , English , and Spanish moneys to a common value ."
`` Thrifty man ! ''
cried the doctor .
`` He was n't the one to be cheated . ''
"`` And now , '' said the squire , `` for the other . ''"
"The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal ; the very thimble , perhaps , that I had found in the captain 's pocket ."
"The doctor opened the seals with great care , and there fell out the map of an island , with latitude and longitude , soundings , names of hills and bays and inlets , and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores ."
"It was about nine miles long and five across , shaped , you might say , like a fat dragon standing up , and had two fine land-locked harbours , and a hill in the centre part marked `` The Spy-glass . ''"
"There were several additions of a later date , but above all , three crosses of red ink -- two on the north part of the island , one in the southwest -- and beside this last , in the same red ink , and in a small , neat hand , very different from the captain 's tottery characters , these words : `` Bulk of treasure here . ''"
"Over on the back the same hand had written this further information : Tall tree , Spy-glass shoulder , bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet ."
"The bar silver is in the north cache ; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock , ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it ."
"The arms are easy found , in the sand-hill , N. point of north inlet cape , bearing E. and a quarter N. J.F. ."
"Jims writhed in those big , firm , capable hands of Mary -- oh yes , she is capable all right -- and choked and wheezed -- and choked and wheezed -- and I felt that he was being tortured to death -- and then all at once , after what seemed to me an hour , though it really was n't long , he coughed up the membrane that was killing him ."
Mary turned him over and laid him back on his bed .
He was white as marble and the tears were pouring out of his brown eyes -- but that awful livid look was gone from his face and he could breathe quite easily . ''
` Was n't that some trick ? '
said Mary gaily . '
"I had n't any idea how it would work , but I just took a chance ."
"I 'll smoke his throat out again once or twice before morning , just to kill all the germs , but you 'll see he 'll be all right now . '"
"`` Jims went right to sleep -- real sleep , not coma , as I feared at first ."
"Mary ` smoked him , ' as she called it , twice through the night , and at daylight his throat was perfectly clear and his temperature was almost normal ."
When I made sure of that I turned and looked at Mary Vance .
She was sitting on the lounge laying down the law to Susan on some subject about which Susan must have known forty times as much as she did .
But I did n't mind how much law she laid down or how much she bragged .
"She had a right to brag -- she had dared to do what I would never have dared , and had saved Jims from a horrible death ."
It did n't matter any more that she had once chased me through the Glen with a codfish ; it did n't matter that she had smeared goose-grease all over my dream of romance the night of the lighthouse dance ; it did n't matter that she thought she knew more than anybody else and always rubbed it in -- I would never dislike Mary Vance again .
I went over to her and kissed her . ''
` What 's up now ? '
she said . ''
"` Nothing -- only I 'm so grateful to you , Mary . ' ''"
"` Well , I think you ought to be , that 's a fact ."
"You two would have let that baby die on your hands if I had n't happened along , ' said Mary , just beaming with complacency ."
"She got Susan and me a tip-top breakfast and made us eat it , and ` bossed the life out of us , ' as Susan says , for two days , until the roads were opened so that she could get home ."
"Jims was almost well by that time , and father turned up ."
He heard our tale without saying much .
Father is rather scornful generally about what he calls ` old wives ' remedies . '
"He laughed a little and said , ` After this , Mary Vance will expect me to call her in for consultation in all my serious cases . '"
"`` So Christmas was not so hard as I expected it to be ; and now the New Year is coming -- and we are still hoping for the ` Big Push ' that will end the war -- and Little Dog Monday is getting stiff and rheumatic from his cold vigils , but still he ` carries on , ' and Shirley continues to read the exploits of the aces ."
"Oh , nineteen-seventeen , what will you bring ? ''"
"CHAPTER XXV SHIRLEY GOES `` No , Woodrow , there will be no peace without victory , '' said Susan , sticking her knitting needle viciously through President Wilson 's name in the newspaper column ."
"`` We Canadians mean to have peace and victory , too ."
"You , if it pleases you , Woodrow , can have the peace without the victory '' -- and Susan stalked off to bed with the comfortable consciousness of having got the better of the argument with the President ."
But a few days later she rushed to Mrs. Blythe in red-hot excitement .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , what do you think ?"
Sometimes he fell and cut himself ; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion ; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably .
"In the meantime , we could never make out where he got the drink ."
That was the ship 's mystery .
"Watch him as we pleased , we could do nothing to solve it ; and when we asked him to his face , he would only laugh if he were drunk , and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water ."
"He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men , but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright , so nobody was much surprised , nor very sorry , when one dark night , with a head sea , he disappeared entirely and was seen no more ."
`` Overboard ! ''
said the captain .
"`` Well , gentlemen , that saves the trouble of putting him in irons . ''"
"But there we were , without a mate ; and it was necessary , of course , to advance one of the men ."
"The boatswain , Job Anderson , was the likeliest man aboard , and though he kept his old title , he served in a way as mate ."
"Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea , and his knowledge made him very useful , for he often took a watch himself in easy weather ."
"And the coxswain , Israel Hands , was a careful , wily , old , experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything ."
"He was a great confidant of Long John Silver , and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship 's cook , Barbecue , as the men called him ."
"Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hands as free as possible ."
"It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and propped against it , yielding to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore ."
Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck .
"He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces -- Long John 's earrings , they were called ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now using the crutch , now trailing it alongside by the lanyard , as quickly as another man could walk ."
Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced .
"`` He 's no common man , Barbecue , '' said the coxswain to me ."
`` He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded ; and brave -- a lion 's nothing alongside of Long John !
I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together -- him unarmed . ''
All the crew respected and even obeyed him .
He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service .
"To me he was unweariedly kind , and always glad to see me in the galley , which he kept as clean as a new pin , the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner ."
"`` Come away , Hawkins , '' he would say ; `` come and have a yarn with John ."
"Nobody more welcome than yourself , my son ."
Sit you down and hear the news .
"Here 's Cap'n Flint -- I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint , after the famous buccaneer -- here 's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v ` yage ."
"Was n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"And the parrot would say , with great rapidity , `` Pieces of eight !"
Pieces of eight !
Pieces of eight ! ''
"If we had been allowed to sit idle , we should all have fallen in the blues , but Captain Smollett was never the man for that ."
"All hands were called up before him , and he divided us into watches ."
"The doctor and Gray and I for one ; the squire , Hunter , and Joyce upon the other ."
"Tired though we all were , two were sent out for firewood ; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth ; the doctor was named cook ; I was put sentry at the door ; and the captain himself went from one to another , keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted ."
"From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes , which were almost smoked out of his head , and whenever he did so , he had a word for me ."
"`` That man Smollett , '' he said once , `` is a better man than I am ."
"And when I say that it means a deal , Jim . ''"
Another time he came and was silent for a while .
"Then he put his head on one side , and looked at me ."
`` Is this Ben Gunn a man ? ''
he asked .
"`` I do not know , sir , '' said I. `` I am not very sure whether he 's sane . ''"
"`` If there 's any doubt about the matter , he is , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island , Jim , ca n't expect to appear as sane as you or me ."
It does n't lie in human nature .
Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for ? ''
"`` Yes , sir , cheese , '' I answered ."
"`` Well , Jim , '' says he , `` just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food ."
"You 've seen my snuff-box , have n't you ?"
"And you never saw me take snuff , the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese -- a cheese made in Italy , very nutritious ."
"Well , that 's for Ben Gunn ! ''"
Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze .
"A good deal of firewood had been got in , but not enough for the captain 's fancy , and he shook his head over it and told us we `` must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier . ''"
"Then , when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog , the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects ."
"It appears they were at their wits ' end what to do , the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came ."
"But our best hope , it was decided , was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA ."
"From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen , two others were wounded , and one at least -- the man shot beside the gun -- severely wounded , if he were not dead ."
"Every time we had a crack at them , we were to take it , saving our own lives , with the extremest care ."
"And besides that , we had two able allies -- rum and the climate ."
"As for the first , though we were about half a mile away , we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night ; and as for the second , the doctor staked his wig that , camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies , the half of them would be on their backs before a week ."
"`` So , '' he added , `` if we are not all shot down first they 'll be glad to be packing in the schooner ."
"It 's always a ship , and they can get to buccaneering again , I suppose . ''"
"When two people do n't care overly much for each other , Nora May , a quarrel never amounts to much between them , and it 's soon made up ."
But when they love each other better than life it cuts so deep and hurts so much that nine times out of ten they wo n't ever forgive each other .
"The more you love anybody , Nora May , the more he can hurt you ."
"To be sure , you 're too young to be thinking of such things ."
"It all came like a thunderclap on Gil 's friends here at Greendale , because we had n't ever suspected things were going wrong ."
"The first thing we knew was that Anne had gone up west to teach school again at St. Mary 's , eighty miles away , and Gilbert , he went out to Manitoba on a harvest excursion and stayed there ."
It just about broke his parents ' hearts .
He was their only child and they just worshipped him .
"Gil and Anne both wrote to me off and on , but never a word , not so much as a name , did they say of each other ."
"I 'd ` a ' writ and asked 'em the rights of the fuss if I could , in hopes of patching it up , but I ca n't write now -- my hand is too shaky -- and mebbe it was just as well , for meddling is terribly risky work in a love trouble , Nora May ."
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddles with is worse than the first .
"So I just set tight and said nothing , while everybody else in the clan was talking Anne and Gil sixty words to the minute ."
"Well , last birthday morning I was feeling terrible disperrited ."
"I had made up my mind that my birthday was always to be a good thing for other people , and there did n't seem one blessed thing I could do to make anybody glad ."
Emma Matilda and George and the children were all well and happy and wanted for nothing that I could give them .
"I begun to be afraid I 'd lived long enough , Nora May ."
"When a woman gets to the point where she ca n't give a gift of joy to anyone , there ai n't much use in her living ."
I felt real old and worn out and useless .
"I was sitting here under these very trees -- they was just budding out in leaf then , as young and cheerful as if they was n't a hundred years old ."
"And I sighed right out loud and said , `` Oh , Grandpa Holland , it 's time I was put away up on the hill there with you . ''"
"And with that the gate banged and there was Nancy Jane Whitmore 's boy , Sam , with two letters for me ."
One was from Anne up at St. Mary 's and the other was from Gil out in Manitoba .
I read Anne 's first .
She just struck right into things in the first paragraph .
"She said her year at St. Mary 's was nearly up , and when it was she meant to quit teaching and go away to New York and learn to be a trained nurse ."
"She said she was just broken-hearted about Gilbert , and would always love him to the day of her death ."
"But she knew he did n't care anything more about her after the way he had acted , and there was nothing left for her in life but to do something for other people , and so on and so on , for twelve mortal pages ."
"Anne is a fine writer , and I just cried like a babe over that letter , it was so touching , although I was enjoying myself hugely all the time , I was so delighted to find out that Anne loved Gilbert still ."
"I was getting skeered she did n't , her letters all winter had been so kind of jokey and frivolous , all about the good times she was having , and the parties she went to , and the new dresses she got ."
New dresses !
"When I read that letter of Anne 's , I knew that all the purple and fine linen in the world was just like so much sackcloth and ashes to her as long as Gilbert was sulking out on a prairie farm ."
"Well , I wiped my eyes and polished up my specs , but I might have spared myself the trouble , for in five minutes , Nora May , there was I sobbing again ; over Gilbert 's letter ."
He may not stand alone ; 't is not in nature . ''
"`` They that have no judgment should not draw the sword , '' replied the young lady ."
"`` Ye that fight but for a hazard , what are ye but a butcher ?"
"War is but noble by the cause , and y ' have disgraced it . ''"
"`` Madam , '' said the miserable Dick , `` I do partly see mine error ."
I have made too much haste ; I have been busy before my time .
"Already I stole a ship -- thinking , I do swear it , to do well -- and thereby brought about the death of many innocent , and the grief and ruin of a poor old man whose face this very day hath stabbed me like a dagger ."
"And for this morning , I did but design to do myself credit , and get fame to marry with , and , behold !"
I have brought about the death of your dear kinsman that was good to me .
"And what besides , I know not ."
"For , alas !"
"I may have set York upon the throne , and that may be the worser cause , and may do hurt to England ."
"O , madam , I do see my sin ."
I am unfit for life .
"I will , for penance sake and to avoid worse evil , once I have finished this adventure , get me to a cloister ."
I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arms .
"I will be a friar , and pray for your good kinsman 's spirit all my days . ''"
"It appeared to Dick , in this extremity of his humiliation and repentance , that the young lady had laughed ."
"Raising his countenance , he found her looking down upon him , in the fire-light , with a somewhat peculiar but not unkind expression ."
"`` Madam , '' he cried , thinking the laughter to have been an illusion of his hearing , but still , from her changed looks , hoping to have touched her heart , `` madam , will not this content you ?"
I give up all to undo what I have done amiss ; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham .
"And all this upon the very day that I have won my spurs , and thought myself the happiest young gentleman on ground . ''"
"`` O boy , '' she said -- `` good boy ! ''"
"And then , to the extreme surprise of Dick , she first very tenderly wiped the tears away from his cheeks , and then , as if yielding to a sudden impulse , threw both her arms about his neck , drew up his face , and kissed him ."
A pitiful bewilderment came over simple-minded Dick .
"`` But come , '' she said , with great cheerfulness , `` you that are a captain , ye must eat ."
Why sup ye not ? ''
"`` Dear Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick , `` I did but wait first upon my prisoner ; but , to say truth , penitence will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food ."
"I were better to fast , dear lady , and to pray . ''"
"`` Call me Alicia , '' she said ; `` are we not old friends ?"
"And now , come , I will eat with you , bit for bit and sup for sup ; so if ye eat not , neither will I ; but if ye eat hearty , I will dine like a ploughman . ''"
"So there and then she fell to ; and Dick , who had an excellent stomach , proceeded to bear her company , at first with great reluctance , but gradually , as he entered into the spirit , with more and more vigour and devotion : until , at last , he forgot even to watch his model , and most heartily repaired the expenses of his day of labour and excitement ."
"He often played ships at the Round Pond , but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on the grass ."
"Of course , he had never seen a hoop , and he wondered what you play at with them , and decided that you play at pretending they are boats ."
"This hoop always sank at once , but he waded in for it , and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond , and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops ."
"Another time , when he found a child 's pail , he thought it was for sitting in , and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of it ."
Also he found a balloon .
"It was bobbing about on the Hump , quite as if it was having a game by itself , and he caught it after an exciting chase ."
"But he thought it was a ball , and Jenny Wren had told him that boys kick balls , so he kicked it ; and after that he could not find it anywhere ."
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely , and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."
"So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him , but this time it ran at him , and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat ."
"You must not think , however , that he was a coward , for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other , but the perambulator had gone , and he never saw another one ."
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle .
"It was a child 's spade which he had found near St. Govor 's Well , and he thought it was a paddle ."
Do you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes ?
"If so , I think it rather silly of you ."
"What I mean is that , of course , one must pity him now and then , but to pity him all the time would be impertinence ."
"He thought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens , and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it ."
"He played without ceasing , while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"He could be neither of these things , for he had never heard of them , but do you think he is to be pitied for that ?"
"Oh , he was merry ."
"He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your father ."
"Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment ."
Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?
That is how Peter leaps them .
And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"The Little House Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
"It was red and hot , and now and again it was a little darkened -- as it were , the embers of a bonfire smouldering ."
For the life of me I could not think what it might be .
At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing .
"The western end was already steeped in moonshine ; the rest , and the block house itself , still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light ."
"On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady , red reverberation , contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon ."
There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze .
"I stopped , with much wonder in my heart , and perhaps a little terror also ."
"It had not been our way to build great fires ; we were , indeed , by the captain 's orders , somewhat niggardly of firewood , and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent ."
"I stole round by the eastern end , keeping close in shadow , and at a convenient place , where the darkness was thickest , crossed the palisade ."
"To make assurance surer , I got upon my hands and knees and crawled , without a sound , towards the corner of the house ."
"As I drew nearer , my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened ."
"It is not a pleasant noise in itself , and I have often complained of it at other times , but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep ."
"The sea-cry of the watch , that beautiful `` All 's well , '' never fell more reassuringly on my ear ."
"In the meantime , there was no doubt of one thing ; they kept an infamous bad watch ."
"If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them , not a soul would have seen daybreak ."
"That was what it was , thought I , to have the captain wounded ; and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard ."
So he bade them farewell and set out .
"For three days he wandered by the most out-of-the-way paths , but no signs of a tower were to be seen anywhere ."
"On the fourth morning it was just the same , and , filled with despair , he flung himself on the ground under a tree and hid his face in his hands ."
"In a little while he heard a rustling over his head , and looking up , he saw a turtle dove watching him with her bright eyes ."
` Oh dove ! '
"cried the boy , addressing the bird in her own language , ` Oh dove !"
"tell me , I pray you , where is the castle of Come-and-never-go ? '"
"` Poor child , ' answered the dove , ` who has sent you on such a useless quest ? '"
"` My good or evil fortune , ' replied the boy , ' I know not which . '"
"` To get there , ' said the dove , ` you must follow the wind , which to-day is blowing towards the castle . '"
"The boy thanked her , and followed the wind , fearing all the time that it might change its direction and lead him astray ."
But the wind seemed to feel pity for him and blew steadily on .
"With each step the country became more and more dreary , but at nightfall the child could see behind the dark and bare rocks something darker still ."
"This was the tower in which dwelt the witch ; and seizing the knocker he gave three loud knocks , which were echoed in the hollows of the rocks around ."
"The door opened slowly , and there appeared on the threshold an old woman holding up a candle to her face , which was so hideous that the boy involuntarily stepped backwards , almost as frightened by the troop of lizards , beetles and such creatures that surrounded her , as by the woman herself ."
` Who are you who dare to knock at my door and wake me ? '
cried she .
"` Be quick and tell me what you want , or it will be the worse for you . '"
"` Madam , ' answered the child , ' I believe that you alone know the way to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and I pray you to show it to me . '"
"` Very good , ' replied the witch , with something that she meant for a smile , ` but to-day it is late ."
To-morrow you shall go .
"Now enter , and you shall sleep with my lizards . ' '"
"I can not stay , ' said he . '"
"I must go back at once , so as to reach the road from which I started before day dawns . '"
"` If I tell you , will you promise me that you will bring me this jar full of the many-coloured water from the spring in the court-yard of the castle ? '"
asked she .
` If you fail to keep your word I will change you into a lizard for ever . ' '
"I promise , ' answered the boy ."
"Then the old woman called to a very thin dog , and said to him : ` Conduct this pig of a child to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and take care that you warn my friend of his arrival . '"
"And the dog arose and shook itself , and set out ."
"At the end of two hours they stopped in front of a large castle , big and black and gloomy , whose doors stood wide open , although neither sound nor light gave sign of any presence within ."
"The dog , however , seemed to know what to expect , and , after a wild howl , went on ; but the boy , who was uncertain whether this was the quarter of an hour when the giant was asleep , hesitated to follow him , and paused for a moment under a wild olive that grew near by , the only tree which he had beheld since he had parted from the dove ."
"Imagine , when we returned here , we met some linnets who , just as the spring and the flowers and the long days had come , were setting out for the north and the cold ?"
Out of pure compassion we tried to persuade them to give up this folly ; but they only replied with the utmost insolence . '
` How shocking ! '
exclaimed the city swallow .
"` Yes , it was ."
"And worse than that , the crested lark , that was formerly so timid and shy , is now no better than a thief , and steals maize and corn whenever she can find them . ' '"
I am astonished at what you say . '
` You will be more astonished when I tell you that on my arrival here for the summer I found my nest occupied by a shameless sparrow !
"`` This is my nest , '' I said ."
`` Yours ? ''
"he answered , with a rude laugh ."
"`` Yes , mine ; my ancestors were born here , and my sons will be born here also . ''"
And at that my husband set upon him and threw him out of the nest .
I am sure nothing of this sort ever happens in a town . '
"` Not exactly , perhaps ."
But I have seen a great deal -- if you only knew ! '
` Oh !
do tell us !
do tell us ! '
cried they all .
"And when they had settled themselves comfortably , the city swallow began : ` You must know , then that our king fell in love with the youngest daughter of a tailor , who was as good and gentle as she was beautiful ."
"His nobles hoped that he would have chosen a queen from one of their daughters , and tried to prevent the marriage ; but the king would not listen to them , and it took place ."
"Not many months later a war broke out , and the king rode away at the head of his army , while the queen remained behind , very unhappy at the separation ."
"When peace was made , and the king returned , he was told that his wife had had two babies in his absence , but that both were dead ; that she herself had gone out of her mind and was obliged to be shut up in a tower in the mountains , where , in time , the fresh air might cure her . '"
` And was this not true ? '
asked the swallows eagerly .
"` Of course not , ' answered the city lady , with some contempt for their stupidity ."
"` The children were alive at that very moment in the gardener 's cottage ; but at night the chamberlain came down and put them in a cradle of crystal , which he carried to the river ."
"` For a whole day they floated safely , for though the stream was deep it was very still , and the children took no harm ."
In the morning -- so I am told by my friend the kingfisher -- they were rescued by a fisherman who lived near the river bank . '
"The children had been lying on the bench , listening lazily to the chatter up to this point ; but when they heard the story of the crystal cradle which their foster-mother had always been fond of telling them , they sat upright and looked at each other ."
"` Oh , how glad I am I learnt the birds ' language ! '"
"Then I was afraid Jerry would go and make a fuss , and Bob would run off , or do something desperate , being worried , and I said I 'd pay it for him , if I could ."
"So he went home pretty jolly , and I scratched ` round for the money ."
"Got it , too , and was n't I glad ? ''"
"Jack paused to rub his hands , and Frank said , with more than usual respect , `` Could n't you get hold of Jerry in any other place , and out of school time ?"
"That did the mischief , thanks to Joe ."
"I thrashed him , Jill -- did I mention it ? ''"
"`` I could n't get all my money till Friday morning , and I knew Jerry was off at night ."
"I looked for him before school , and at noon , but could n't find him , so afternoon recess was my last chance ."
"I was bound to do it and I did n't mean to break the rule , but Jerry was just going into the shop , so I pelted after him , and as it was private business we went to the billiard-room ."
"I declare I never was so relieved as when I handed over that money , and made him say it was all right , and he would n't go near Bob ."
"He 's off , so my mind is easy , and Bob will be so grateful I can keep him steady , perhaps ."
"That will be worth two seventy-five , I think , '' said Jack heartily ."
"`` You should have come to me , '' began Frank ."
"`` And got laughed at -- no , thank you , '' interrupted Jack , recollecting several philanthropic little enterprises which were nipped in the bud for want of co-operation ."
"`` To me , then , '' said his mother ."
`` It would have saved so much trouble . ''
"`` I thought of it , but Bob did n't want the big fellows to know for fear they 'd be down on him , so I thought he might not like me to tell grown people ."
"I do n't mind the fuss now , and Bob is as kind as he can be ."
"Wanted to give me his big knife , but I would n't take it ."
"I 'd rather have this , '' and Jack put the letter in his pocket with a slap outside , as if it warmed the cockles of his heart to have it there ."
"`` Well , it seems rather like a tempest in a teapot , now it is all over , but I do admire your pluck , little boy , in holding out so well when every one was scolding at you , and you in the right all the time , '' said Frank , glad to praise , now that he honestly could , after his wholesale condemnation ."
"`` That is what pulled me through , I suppose ."
"I used to think if I had done anything wrong , that I could n't stand the snubbing a day ."
"I should have told right off , and had it over ."
"Now , I guess I 'll have a good report if you do tell Mr. Acton , '' said Jack , looking at his mother so wistfully , that she resolved to slip away that very evening , and make sure that the thing was done ."
"`` That will make you happier than anything else , wo n't it ? ''"
"asked Jill , eager to have him rewarded after his trials ."
"`` There 's one thing I like better , though I 'd be very sorry to lose my report ."
"It 's the fun of telling Ed I tried to do as he wanted us to , and seeing how pleased he 'll be , '' added Jack , rather bashfully , for the boys laughed at him sometimes for his love of this friend ."
"`` I know he wo n't be any happier about it than someone else , who stood by you all through , and set her bright wits to work till the trouble was all cleared away , '' said Mrs. Minot , looking at Jill 's contented face , as she lay smiling on them all ."
"Jack understood , and , hopping across the room , gave both the thin hands a hearty shake ; then , not finding any words quite cordial enough in which to thank this faithful little sister , he stooped down and kissed her gratefully ."
Chapter XV .
She picked her steps carefully back with her precious specimens .
The stranger eyed her severely as she stepped on the rocks .
"`` I should think you would have more sense than to risk your life in that fashion for a handful of seaweeds , '' he said ."
"`` I have n't the faintest idea what you mean , '' said Miss Rangely ."
"`` You do n't look crazy , but you talk as if you were . ''"
`` Do you mean to say you do n't know that what the people hereabouts call the Bottomless Pit is situated right off that point -- the most dangerous spot along the whole coast ? ''
"`` No , I did n't , '' said Katherine , horrified ."
"She remembered now that Aunt Elizabeth had warned her to be careful of some bad hole along shore , but she had not been paying much attention and had supposed it to be in quite another direction ."
`` I am a stranger here . ''
"`` Well , I hardly thought you 'd be foolish enough to be out there if you knew , '' said the other in mollified accents ."
"`` The place ought not to be left without warning , anyhow ."
It is the most careless thing I ever heard of .
There is a big hole right off that point and nobody has ever been able to find the bottom of it .
A person who got into it would never be heard of again .
The rocks there form an eddy that sucks everything right down . ''
"`` I am very grateful to you for calling me in , '' said Katherine humbly ."
`` I had no idea I was in such danger . ''
"`` You have a very fine bunch of seaweeds , I see , '' said the unknown ."
But Katherine was in no mood to converse on seaweeds .
"She suddenly realized what she must look like -- bare feet , draggled skirts , dripping arms ."
And this creature whom she had taken for a lunatic was undoubtedly a gentleman .
"Oh , if he would only go and give her a chance to put on her shoes and stockings !"
Nothing seemed further from his intentions .
"When Katherine had picked up the aforesaid articles and turned homeward , he walked beside her , still discoursing on seaweeds as eloquently as if he were commonly accustomed to walking with barefooted young women ."
"In spite of herself , Katherine could n't help listening to him , for he managed to invest seaweeds with an absorbing interest ."
"She finally decided that as he did n't seem to mind her bare feet , she would n't either ."
He knew so much about seaweeds that Katherine felt decidedly amateurish beside him .
He looked over her specimens and pointed out the valuable ones .
"He explained the best method of preserving and mounting them , and told her of other and less dangerous places along the shore where she might get some new varieties ."
"When they came in sight of Harbour Hill , Katherine began to wonder what on earth she would do with him ."
"It was n't exactly permissible to snub a man who had practically saved your life , but , on the other hand , the prospect of walking through the principal street of Harbour Hill barefooted and escorted by a scholarly looking gentleman discoursing on seaweeds was not to be calmly contemplated ."
The unknown cut the Gordian knot himself .
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"`` Brave , brave ! ''"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight came on , and scores and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , `` So that 's all right . ''"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"She was about to say , `` I never knew you could speak ! ''"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , `` I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? ''"
"and the elm replied , `` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , '' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca Holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her .
She was not in the least cold .
"She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse and had the hood over her head , so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls ."
The rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball .
She was about forty round the waist .
"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk , when Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk ."
"They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly , but that was because they used crutches ."
"An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces , and they all had crutches ."
The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs .
"They were quite familiar objects to Maimie , but she had never known what they were for until to-night ."
She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy .
He was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees .
"The way he did it was this , he pressed a spring in the trunk and they shut like umbrellas , deluging the little plants beneath with snow ."
"`` Oh , you naughty , naughty child ! ''"
"Maimie cried indignantly , for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears ."
"Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot , but the chrysanthemums heard her , and they all said so pointedly `` Hoity-toity , what is this ? ''"
"He went in a hurry in the end , because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
Oh !
"he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit -RSB- But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , ` Mother !"
mother ! '
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her !
"Ah , Peter !"
"we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right -- there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .
The iron bars are up for life .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- V THE LITTLE HOUSE Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way every one may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together ; and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night , and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the light , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him , and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting , she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra -RSB- But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully ; and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
Then I tell myself ` mere coincidence ' -- ` subconscious memory ' and so forth . ''
"`` I do not see how any memory could remember a thing before it was ever said at all , '' persisted Susan , `` though of course I am not educated like you and the doctor ."
"I would rather not be , if it makes anything as simple as that so hard to believe ."
"But in any case we need not worry over Verdun , even if the Huns get it ."
Joffre says it has no military significance . ''
"`` That old sop of comfort has been served up too often already when reverses came , '' retorted Gertrude ."
`` It has lost its power to charm . ''
`` Was there ever a battle like this in the world before ? ''
"said Mr. Meredith , one evening in mid-April ."
"`` It 's such a titanic thing we ca n't grasp it , '' said the doctor ."
`` What were the scraps of a few Homeric handfuls compared to this ?
The whole Trojan war might be fought around a Verdun fort and a newspaper correspondent would give it no more than a sentence .
I am not in the confidence of the occult powers '' -- the doctor threw Gertrude a twinkle -- `` but I have a hunch that the fate of the whole war hangs on the issue of Verdun .
"As Susan and Joffre say , it has no real military significance ; but it has the tremendous significance of an Idea ."
If Germany wins there she will win the war .
"If she loses , the tide will set against her . ''"
"`` Lose she will , '' said Mr. Meredith : emphatically ."
`` The Idea can not be conquered .
France is certainly very wonderful .
It seems to me that in her I see the white form of civilization making a determined stand against the black powers of barbarism .
I think our whole world realizes this and that is why we all await the issue so breathlessly .
It is n't merely the question of a few forts changing hands or a few miles of blood-soaked ground lost and won . ''
"`` I wonder , '' said Gertrude dreamily , `` if some great blessing , great enough for the price , will be the meed of all our pain ?"
Is the agony in which the world is shuddering the birth-pang of some wondrous new era ?
Or is it merely a futile struggle of ants In the gleam of a million million of suns ?
"We think very lightly , Mr. Meredith , of a calamity which destroys an ant-hill and half its inhabitants ."
Does the Power that runs the universe think us of more importance than we think ants ? ''
"`` You forget , '' said Mr. Meredith , with a flash of his dark eyes , `` that an infinite Power must be infinitely little as well as infinitely great ."
"We are neither , therefore there are things too little as well as too great for us to apprehend ."
To the infinitely little an ant is of as much importance as a mastodon .
"We are witnessing the birth-pangs of a new era -- but it will be born a feeble , wailing life like everything else ."
I am not one of those who expect a new heaven and a new earth as the immediate result of this war .
"This was a very important point , and needed much discussion ."
A thousand names were proposed and rejected for a thousand silly reasons .
"One was another reminded the queen of somebody she did not like ; but at length an idea flashed into the queen 's head , and she called out : ' I know !"
We will call her Muffette . '
"` That is the very thing , ' shouted the frog , jumping high into the air ; and so it was settled ."
The princess Muffette was about six months old when the frog noticed that the queen had begun to grow sad again .
` Why do you have that look in your eyes ? '
"she asked one day , when she had come in to play with the baby , who could now crawl ."
"The way they played their game was to let Muffette creep close to the frog , and then for the frog to bound high into the air and alight on the child 's head , or back , or legs , when she always sent up a shout of pleasure ."
"There is no play fellow like a frog ; but then it must be a fairy frog , or else you might hurt it , and if you did something dreadful might happen to you ."
"Well , as I have said , our frog was struck with the queen 's sad face , and lost no time in asking her what was the reason . '"
"I do n't see what you have to complain of now ; Muffette is quite well and quite happy , and even the Lion Fairy is kind to her when she sees her ."
What is it ? '
` Oh !
if her father could only see her ! '
"broke forth the queen , clasping her hands ."
` Or if I could only tell him all that has happened since we parted .
"But they will have brought him tidings of the broken carriage , and he will have thought me dead , or devoured by wild beasts ."
"And though he will mourn for me long -- I know that well -- yet in time they will persuade him to take a wife , and she will be young and fair , and he will forget me . '"
"And in all this the queen guessed truly , save that nine long years were to pass before he would consent to put another in her place ."
"The frog answered nothing at the time , but stopped her game and hopped away among the cypress trees ."
"Here she sat and thought and thought , and the next morning she went back to the queen and said : ' I have come , madam , to make you an offer ."
"Shall I go to the king instead of you , and tell him of your sufferings , and that he has the most charming baby in the world for his daughter ?"
"The way is long , and I travel slowly ; but , sooner or later , I shall be sure to arrive ."
"Only , are you not afraid to be left without my protection ?"
Ponder the matter carefully ; it is for you to decide . '
"` Oh , it needs no pondering , ' cried the queen joyfully , holding up her clasped hands , and making Muffette do likewise , in token of gratitude ."
But in order that he may know that you have come from me I will send him a letter . '
"And pricking her arm , she wrote a few words with her blood on the corner of her handkerchief ."
"Then tearing it off , she gave it to the frog , and they bade each other farewell ."
"It took the frog a year and four days to mount the ten thousand steps that led to the upper world , but that was because she was still under the spell of a wicked fairy ."
"By the time she reached the top , she was so tired that she had to remain for another year on the banks of a stream to rest , and also to arrange the procession with which she was to present herself before the king ."
"Dick told him his name , and presented Lord Foxham 's signet , which the duke immediately recognised ."
"`` Ye come too soon , '' he said ; `` but why should I complain ?"
"Ye are like me , that was here at watch two hours before the day ."
"But this is the first sally of mine arms ; upon this adventure , Master Shelton , shall I make or mar the quality of my renown ."
"There lie mine enemies , under two old , skilled captains -- Risingham and Brackley -- well posted for strength , I do believe , but yet upon two sides without retreat , enclosed betwixt the sea , the harbour , and the river ."
"Methinks , Shelton , here were a great blow to be stricken , an we could strike it silently and suddenly . ''"
"`` I do think so , indeed , '' cried Dick , warming ."
`` Have ye my Lord Foxham 's notes ? ''
inquired the duke .
"And then , Dick , having explained how he was without them for the moment , made himself bold to offer information every jot as good , of his own knowledge ."
"`` And for mine own part , my lord duke , '' he added , `` an ye had men enough , I would fall on even at this present ."
"For , look ye , at the peep of day the watches of the night are over ; but by day they keep neither watch nor ward -- only scour the outskirts with horsemen ."
"Now , then , when the night watch is already unarmed , and the rest are at their morning cup -- now were the time to break them . ''"
`` How many do ye count ? ''
asked Gloucester .
"`` They number not two thousand , '' Dick replied ."
"`` I have seven hundred in the woods behind us , '' said the duke ; `` seven hundred follow from Kettley , and will be here anon ; behind these , and further , are four hundred more ; and my Lord Foxham hath five hundred half a day from here , at Holywood ."
"Shall we attend their coming , or fall on ? ''"
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` when ye hanged these five poor rogues ye did decide the question ."
"Churls although they were , in these uneasy , times they will be lacked and looked for , and the alarm be given ."
"Therefore , my lord , if ye do count upon the advantage of a surprise , ye have not , in my poor opinion , one whole hour in front of you . ''"
"`` I do think so indeed , '' returned Crookback ."
"`` Well , before an hour , ye shall be in the thick o n't , winning spurs ."
"A swift man to Holywood , carrying Lord Foxham 's signet ; another along the road to speed my laggards !"
"Nay , Shelton , by the rood , it may be done ! ''"
Therewith he once more set his trumpet to his lips and blew .
This time he was not long kept waiting .
In a moment the open space about the cross was filled with horse and foot .
"Richard of Gloucester took his place upon the steps , and despatched messenger after messenger to hasten the concentration of the seven hundred men that lay hidden in the immediate neighbourhood among the woods ; and before a quarter of an hour had passed , all his dispositions being taken , he put himself at their head , and began to move down the hill towards Shoreby ."
His plan was simple .
"He was to seize a quarter of the town of Shoreby lying on the right hand of the high road , and make his position good there in the narrow lanes until his reinforcements followed ."
"If Lord Risingham chose to retreat , Richard would follow upon his rear , and take him between two fires ; or , if he preferred to hold the town , he would be shut in a trap , there to be gradually overwhelmed by force of numbers ."
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon .
"`` I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , '' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"`` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , '' he said coaxingly ."
"`` I promise to come back , '' he said solemnly and meant it , too ."
"And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
Many nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long .
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as `` Never put off laying to-day , because you can lay to-morrow , '' and `` In this world there are no second chances , '' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as `` I wish the grass was not so wet , '' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , `` I do wish you would keep time ! ''"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , `` I wish -- '' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , `` I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , '' they had to tickle his shoulder and let him go ."
"He went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
"Oh , he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , `` Mother !"
mother ! ''
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her .
"Ah , Peter , we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right ; there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .
_BOOK_TITLE_ : James_Matthew_Barrie___Peter_and_Wendy.txt.out
Excuse me for a moment . ''
"Rilla flew upstairs , wishing quite frankly that soup tureens had never been invented ."
"But when Jims , at sight of her , lifted his little arms entreatingly and swallowed several sobs , with tears rolling down his cheeks , resentment went out of her heart ."
"After all , the poor darling was frightened ."
She picked him up gently and rocked him soothingly until his sobs ceased and his eyes closed .
Then she essayed to lay him down in his crib .
Jims opened his eyes and shrieked a protest .
This performance was repeated twice .
Rilla grew desperate .
She could n't leave Ken down there alone any longer -- she had been away nearly half an hour already .
"With a resigned air she marched downstairs , carrying Jims , and sat down on the veranda ."
"It was , no doubt , a ridiculous thing to sit and cuddle a contrary war-baby when your best young man was making his farewell call , but there was nothing else to be done ."
Jims was supremely happy .
He kicked his little pink-soled feet rapturously out under his white nighty and gave one of his rare laughs .
He was beginning to be a very pretty baby ; his golden hair curled in silken ringlets all over his little round head and his eyes were beautiful .
"`` He 's a decorative kiddy all right , is n't he ? ''"
said Ken .
"`` His looks are very well , '' said Rilla , bitterly , as if to imply that they were much the best of him ."
"Jims , being an astute infant , sensed trouble in the atmosphere and realized that it was up to him to clear it away ."
"He turned his face up to Rilla , smiled adorably and said , clearly and beguilingly , `` Will -- Will . ''"
It was the very first time he had spoken a word or tried to speak .
Rilla was so delighted that she forgot her grudge against him .
She forgave him with a hug and kiss .
"Jims , understanding that he was restored to favour , cuddled down against her just where a gleam of light from the lamp in the living-room struck across his hair and turned it into a halo of gold against her breast ."
"Kenneth sat very still and silent , looking at Rilla -- at the delicate , girlish silhouette of her , her long lashes , her dented lip , her adorable chin ."
"In the dim moonlight , as she sat with her head bent a little over Jims , the lamplight glinting on her pearls until they glistened like a slender nimbus , he thought she looked exactly like the Madonna that hung over his mother 's desk at home ."
He carried that picture of her in his heart to the horror of the battlefields of France .
"He had had a strong fancy for Rilla Blythe ever since the night of the Four Winds dance ; but it was when he saw her there , with little Jims in her arms , that he loved her and realized it ."
"And all the while , poor Rilla was sitting , disappointed and humiliated , feeling that her last evening with Ken was spoiled and wondering why things always had to go so contrarily outside of books ."
She felt too absurd to try to talk .
"Evidently Ken was completely disgusted , too , since he was sitting there in such stony silence ."
Hope revived momentarily when Jims went so thoroughly asleep that she thought it would be safe to lay him down on the couch in the living-room .
"till you wondered that it was not out of breath , or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage ."
"`` Now , that bird , '' he would say , `` is , maybe , two hundred years old , Hawkins -- they live forever mostly ; and if anybody 's seen more wickedness , it must be the devil himself ."
"She 's sailed with England , the great Cap'n England , the pirate ."
"She 's been at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello ."
She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships .
"It 's there she learned ` Pieces of eight , ' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , Hawkins !"
"She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she was ; and to look at her you would think she was a babby ."
"But you smelt powder -- did n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"`` Stand by to go about , '' the parrot would scream ."
"`` Ah , she 's a handsome craft , she is , '' the cook would say , and give her sugar from his pocket , and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on , passing belief for wickedness ."
"`` There , '' John would add , `` you ca n't touch pitch and not be mucked , lad ."
"Here 's this poor old innocent bird o ' mine swearing blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that ."
"She would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain . ''"
And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men .
"In the meantime , the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another ."
The squire made no bones about the matter ; he despised the captain .
"The captain , on his part , never spoke but when he was spoken to , and then sharp and short and dry , and not a word wasted ."
"He owned , when driven into a corner , that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew , that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well ."
"As for the ship , he had taken a downright fancy to her ."
"`` She 'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir ."
"But , '' he would add , `` all I say is , we 're not home again , and I do n't like the cruise . ''"
"The squire , at this , would turn away and march up and down the deck , chin in air ."
"`` A trifle more of that man , '' he would say , `` and I shall explode . ''"
"We had some heavy weather , which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA ."
"Every man on board seemed well content , and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise , for it is my belief there was never a ship 's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea ."
"Double grog was going on the least excuse ; there was duff on odd days , as , for instance , if the squire heard it was any man 's birthday , and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy ."
"`` Never knew good come of it yet , '' the captain said to Dr. Livesey ."
"`` Spoil forecastle hands , make devils ."
That 's my belief . ''
"But good did come of the apple barrel , as you shall hear , for if it had not been for that , we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery ."
This was how it came about .
We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after -- I am not allowed to be more plain -- and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night .
"Let him alone , and it will all come out soon enough , '' answered Frank , who laughed at his brother , but loved him none the less for the tender heart that often got the better of his young head ."
"But for once Frank was mistaken ; the mystery did not come out , and Jack worked like a beaver all that week , as orders poured in when Jill and Annette showed their elegant cards ; for , as everybody knows , if one girl has a new thing all the rest must , whether it is a bow on the top of her head , a peculiar sort of pencil , or the latest kind of chewing-gum ."
"Little play did the poor fellow get , for every spare minute was spent at the press , and no invitation could tempt him away , so much in earnest was our honest little Franklin about paying his debt ."
"Jill helped all she could , and cheered his labors with her encouragement , remembering how he stayed at home for her ."
"`` It is real good of you to lend a hand , and I 'm ever so much obliged , '' said Jack , as the last order was struck off , and the drawer of the type-box held a pile of shining five and ten cent pieces , with two or three quarters ."
"`` I love to ; only it would be nicer if I knew what we were working for , '' she said demurely , as she scattered type for the last time ; and seeing that Jack was both tired and grateful , hoped to get a hint of the secret ."
"`` I want to tell you , dreadfully ; but I ca n't , because I 've promised . ''"
"`` What , never ? ''"
`` Never ! ''
and Jack looked as firm as a rock .
"`` Then I shall find out , for I have n't promised . ''"
`` You ca n't . ''
`` See if I do n't ! ''
"`` You are sharp , but you wo n't guess this ."
"It 's a tremendous secret , and nobody will tell it . ''"
`` You 'll tell it yourself .
You always do . ''
`` I wo n't tell this .
It would be mean . ''
"`` Wait and see ; I can get anything out of you if I try ; '' and Jill laughed , knowing her power well , for Jack found it very hard to keep a secret from her ."
`` Do n't try ; please do n't !
"It would n't be right , and you do n't want to make me do a dishonorable thing for your sake , I know . ''"
"Jack looked so distressed that Jill promised not to make him tell , though she held herself free to find out in other ways , if she could ."
"Thus relieved , Jack trudged off to school on Friday with the two dollars and seventy-five cents jingling in his pocket , though the dear gold coin had to be sacrificed to make up the sum ."
"He did his lessons badly that day , was late at recess in the afternoon , and , as soon as school was over , departed in his rubber boots `` to take a walk , '' he said , though the roads were in a bad state with a spring thaw ."
"Nothing was seen of him till after tea-time , when he came limping in , very dirty and tired , but with a reposeful expression , which betrayed that a load was off his mind ."
"Frank was busy about his own affairs and paid little attention to him , but Jill was on tenter-hooks to know where he had been , yet dared not ask the question ."
`` Merry 's brother wants some cards .
He liked hers so much he wishes to make his lady-love a present .
"Here 's the name ; '' and Jill held up the order from Harry Grant , who was to be married in the autumn ."
`` Must wait till next week .
"I 'm too tired to do a thing to-night , and I hate the sight of that old press , '' answered Jack , laying himself down upon the rug as if every joint ached ."
"`` The Russians are doing splendidly , however , and they have saved Italy ."
But even when the daily news of their sweeping advance comes we do n't feel like running up the flag as we used to do .
"As Gertrude says , Verdun has slain all exultation ."
We would all feel more like rejoicing if the victories were on the western front .
` When will the British strike ? '
Gertrude sighed this morning .
` We have waited so long -- so long . '
`` Our greatest local event in recent weeks was the route march the county battalion made through the county before it left for overseas .
"They marched from Charlottetown to Lowbridge , then round the Harbour Head and through the Upper Glen and so down to the St. Mary station ."
"Everybody turned out to see them , except old Aunt Fannie Clow , who is bedridden and Mr. Pryor , who had n't been seen out even in church since the night of the Union Prayer Meeting the previous week ."
`` It was wonderful and heartbreaking to see that battalion marching past .
There were young men and middle-aged men in it .
"There was Laurie McAllister from over-harbour who is only sixteen but swore he was eighteen , so that he could enlist ; and there was Angus Mackenzie , from the Upper Glen who is fifty-five if he is a day and swore he was forty-four ."
"There were two South African veterans from Lowbridge , and the three eighteen-year-old Baxter triplets from Harbour Head ."
"Everybody cheered as they went by , and they cheered Foster Booth , who is forty , walking side by side with his son Charley who is twenty ."
"Charley 's mother died when he was born , and when Charley enlisted Foster said he 'd never yet let Charley go anywhere he dare n't go himself , and he did n't mean to begin with the Flanders trenches ."
At the station Dog Monday nearly went out of his head .
He tore about and sent messages to Jem by them all .
Mr. Meredith read an address and Reta Crawford recited ` The Piper . '
"The soldiers cheered her like mad and cried ` We 'll follow -- we 'll follow -- we wo n't break faith , ' and I felt so proud to think that it was my dear brother who had written such a wonderful , heart-stirring thing ."
And then I looked at the khaki ranks and wondered if those tall fellows in uniform could be the boys I 've laughed with and played with and danced with and teased all my life .
Something seems to have touched them and set them apart .
They have heard the Piper 's call .
"`` Fred Arnold was in the battalion and I felt dreadfully about him , for I realized that it was because of me that he was going away with such a sorrowful expression ."
I could n't help it but I felt as badly as if I could .
"`` The last evening of his leave Fred came up to Ingleside and told me he loved me and asked me if I would promise to marry him some day , if he ever came back ."
He was desperately in earnest and I felt more wretched than I ever did in my life .
"I could n't promise him that -- why , even if there was no question of Ken , I do n't care for Fred that way and never could -- but it seemed so cruel and heartless to send him away to the front without any hope of comfort ."
"I cried like a baby ; and yet -- oh , I am afraid that there must be something incurably frivolous about me , because , right in the middle of it all , with me crying and Fred looking so wild and tragic , the thought popped into my head that it would be an unendurable thing to see that nose across from me at the breakfast table every morning of my life ."
"There , that is one of the entries I would n't want my descendants to read in this journal ."
But it is the humiliating truth ; and perhaps it 's just as well that thought did come or I might have been tricked by pity and remorse into giving him some rash assurance .
If Fred 's nose were as handsome as his eyes and mouth some such thing might have happened .
"remarked Miss Draper , who felt uncomfortably near crying herself ."
`` You might go out and pick a basket of Golden Gems .
I want to make some jelly for Patty . ''
Margaret 's Patient -LSB- Illustration : `` DID DR. FORBES THINK SHE OUGHT TO GIVE UP HER TRIP ? '' -RSB-
Margaret paused a moment at the gate and looked back at the quaint old house under its snowy firs with a thrill of proprietary affection .
"It was her home ; for the first time in her life she had a real home , and the long , weary years of poorly paid drudgery were all behind her ."
Before her was a prospect of independence and many of the delights she had always craved ; in the immediate future was a trip to Vancouver with Mrs. Boyd .
"For I shall go , of course , thought Margaret , as she walked briskly down the snowy road ."
"I 've always wanted to see the Rockies , and to go there with Mrs. Boyd will double the pleasure ."
She is such a delightful companion .
Margaret Campbell had been an orphan ever since she could remember .
"She had been brought up by a distant relative of her father 's -- that is , she had been given board , lodging , some schooling and indifferent clothes for the privilege of working like a little drudge in the house of the grim cousin who sheltered her ."
The death of this cousin flung Margaret on her own resources .
"A friend had procured her employment as the `` companion '' of a rich , eccentric old lady , infirm of health and temper ."
"Margaret lived with her for five years , and to the young girl they seemed treble the time ."
"Her employer was fault-finding , peevish , unreasonable , and many a time Margaret 's patience almost failed her -- almost , but not quite ."
In the end it brought her a more tangible reward than sometimes falls to the lot of the toiler .
"Mrs. Constance died , and in her will she left to Margaret her little up-country cottage and enough money to provide her an income for the rest of her life ."
"Margaret took immediate possession of her little house and , with the aid of a capable old servant , soon found herself very comfortable ."
"She realized that her days of drudgery were over , and that henceforth life would be a very different thing from what it had been ."
Margaret meant to have `` a good time . ''
She had never had any pleasure and now she was resolved to garner in all she could of the joys of existence .
"`` I 'm not going to do a single useful thing for a year , '' she had told Mrs. Boyd gaily ."
"`` Just think of it -- a whole delightful year of vacation , to go and come at will , to read , travel , dream , rest ."
"After that , I mean to see if I can find something to do for other folks , but I 'm going to have this one golden year ."
And the first thing in it is our trip to Vancouver .
I 'm so glad I have the chance to go with you .
"It 's a wee bit short notice , but I 'll be ready when you want to start . ''"
"Altogether , Margaret felt pretty well satisfied with life as she tripped blithely down the country road between the ranks of snow-laden spruces , with the blue sky above and the crisp , exhilarating air all about ."
"There was only one drawback , but it was a pretty serious one ."
"It 's so lonely by spells , Margaret sometimes thought wistfully ."
All the joys my good fortune has brought me ca n't quite fill my heart .
"When the dusk came , Ernest and Maxwell had to catch the last train for town , and the other guests went home , with the exception of Bertha , who was to stay all night ."
"Just as soon as her resignation could be effected , she was to join her brother ."
"`` Meanwhile , I 'll see about getting a house to put you in , '' said Max ."
"`` No more boarding out for me , Ernest ."
You may consider me as a family man henceforth . ''
Frances and Alma talked it all over before they went to sleep that night .
"`` Just think , '' said Frances , `` if we had n't asked her here today she might never have found her brother !"
"It 's all Mother 's doing , bless her !"
"Things do happen like a storybook sometimes , do n't they , Al ?"

A Correspondence and A Climax At sunset Sidney hurried to her room to take off the soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking .
She had milked eight cows and pumped water for the milk-cans afterward in the fag-end of a hot summer day .
"She did that every night , but tonight she had hurried more than usual because she wanted to get her letter written before the early farm bedtime ."
She had been thinking it out while she milked the cows in the stuffy little pen behind the barn .
This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life .
"Existence would have been , so Sidney thought , a dreary , unbearable blank without it ."
She cast aside her milking-dress with a thrill of distaste that tingled to her rosy fingertips .
As she slipped into her blue-print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below .
Sidney ran out to the dark little entry and leaned over the stair railing .
"Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing , crying , quarrelling children , and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl 's disgusted nostrils ."
Aunt Jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year-old baby clinging to the other .
She was a big shapeless woman with a round good-natured face -- cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was Aunt Jane at all times and occasions .
"`` I want to run over and see how Mrs. Brixby is this evening , Siddy , and you must take care of the baby till I get back . ''"
Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby .
It never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it .
"She had all her aunt 's sweetness of disposition , if she resembled her in nothing else ."
"She had not grumbled because she had to rise at four that morning , get breakfast , milk the cows , bake bread , prepare seven children for school , get dinner , preserve twenty quarts of strawberries , get tea , and milk the cows again ."
"All her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went , but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly ."
But she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter .
"She carried the baby to her room , spread a quilt on the floor for him to sit on , and gave him a box of empty spools to play with ."
"Fortunately he was a phlegmatic infant , fond of staying in one place , and not given to roaming about in search of adventures ; but Sidney knew she would have to keep an eye on him , and it would be distracting to literary effort ."
She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow .
"One by one all the kites went up , and floated far overhead like gay birds , balancing themselves on the fresh breeze that blew steadily over the hill ."
Such a merry time as they had !
"running and shouting , sending up the kites or pulling them down , watching their antics in the air , and feeling them tug at the string like live creatures trying to escape ."
"Nan was quite wild with the fun , Daisy thought the new play nearly as interesting as dolls , and little Bess was so fond of her `` boo tite , '' that she would only let it go on very short flights , preferring to hold it in her lap and look at the remarkable pictures painted on it by Tommy 's dashing brush ."
"Mrs. Jo enjoyed hers immensely , and it acted as if it knew who owned it , for it came tumbling down head first when least expected , caught on trees , nearly pitched into the river , and finally darted away to such a height that it looked a mere speck among the clouds ."
"By and by every one got tired , and fastening the kite-strings to trees and fences , all sat down to rest , except Mr. Bhaer , who went off to look at the cows , with Teddy on his shoulder ."
`` Did you ever have such a good time as this before ? ''
"asked Nat , as they lay about on the grass , nibbling pennyroyal like a flock of sheep ."
"`` Not since I last flew a kite , years ago , when I was a girl , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
"`` I 'd like to have known you when you were a girl , you must have been so jolly , '' said Nat ."
"`` I was a naughty little girl , I am sorry to say . ''"
"`` I like naughty little girls , '' observed Tommy , looking at Nan , who made a frightful grimace at him in return for the compliment ."
"`` Why do n't I remember you then , Aunty ?"
Was I too young ? ''
asked Demi .
"`` Rather , dear . ''"
`` I suppose my memory had n't come then .
"Grandpa says that different parts of the mind unfold as we grow up , and the memory part of my mind had n't unfolded when you were little , so I ca n't remember how you looked , '' explained Demi ."
"`` Now , little Socrates , you had better keep that question for grandpa , it is beyond me , '' said Aunt Jo , putting on the extinguisher ."
"`` Well , I will , he knows about those things , and you do n't , '' returned Demi , feeling that on the whole kites were better adapted to the comprehension of the present company ."
"`` Tell about the last time you flew a kite , '' said Nat , for Mrs. Jo had laughed as she spoke of it , and he thought it might be interesting ."
"`` Oh , it was only rather funny , for I was a great girl of fifteen , and was ashamed to be seen at such a play ."
"So Uncle Teddy and I privately made our kites , and stole away to fly them ."
"We had a capital time , and were resting as we are now , when suddenly we heard voices , and saw a party of young ladies and gentlemen coming back from a picnic ."
"Teddy did not mind , though he was rather a large boy to be playing with a kite , but I was in a great flurry , for I knew I should be sadly laughed at , and never hear the last of it , because my wild ways amused the neighbors as much as Nan 's do us . ''"
` What shall I do ? '
"I whispered to Teddy , as the voices drew nearer and nearer . ''"
"` I 'll show you , ' he said , and whipping out his knife he cut the strings ."
"Away flew the kites , and when the people came up we were picking flowers as properly as you please ."
"They never suspected us , and we had a grand laugh over our narrow escape . ''"
"`` Were the kites lost , Aunty ? ''"
asked Daisy .
"The drummer did not reflect long; he sprang into the midst of the flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe a hair of his head. He carried the log out, and laid it down. Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was transformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden garments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the King’s daughter. But the old woman laughed venomously, and said, “Thou thinkest thou hast her safe, but thou hast not got her yet!” Just as she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the youth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up on high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed over her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be burnt."
"Then the King’s daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw that he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked his life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said, “Thou hast ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything for thine."
"Promise to be true to me, and thou shalt be my husband. We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here.” She led him into the house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the old woman’s treasures. The maiden left the gold and silver where it was, and took only the precious stones. She would not stay any longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her, “Seat thyself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like birds.” “I do not like the old saddle,” said she, “I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.” “Very well, then,” answered the drummer, “then wish us in front of the town-gate.” In the twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said, “I will just go to my parents and tell them the news, wait for me outside here, I shall soon be back.” “Ah,” said the King’s daughter, “I beg thee to be careful. On thy arrival do not kiss thy parents on the right cheek, or else thou wilt forget everything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and deserted.” “How can I forget thee?” said he, and promised her to come back very soon, and gave his hand upon it. When he went into his father’s house, he had changed so much that no one knew who he was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain had been three years. Then he made himself known, and his parents fell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had said, and kissed them on both cheeks. But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek, every thought of the King’s daughter vanished from him. He emptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table. The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches. Then the father built a magnificent castle all surrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a prince were going to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said, “I have found a maiden for thee, and the wedding shall be in three days. The son was content to do as his parents desired.”"
"The poor King’s daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man. When evening came, she said, “He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek, and has forgotten me.” Her heart was full of sorrow, she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would not return to her father’s court. Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man’s house; he often saw her, but he no longer knew her. At length she heard the people saying, “The wedding will take place to-morrow.” Then she said, “I will try if I can win his heart back.”"
"On the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress as bright as the sun.” Instantly the dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been woven of real sunbeams. When all the guests were assembled, she entered the hall. Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress, and the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her. “Not for money,” she answered, “but if I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where your betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.” The bride could not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a sleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night, which made him fall into a deep sleep, When all had become quiet, the King’s daughter crouched down by the door of the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But it was all in vain, the drummer did not awake, and when morning dawned, the King’s daughter was forced to go back again as she came. On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said, “A dress as silvery as the moon.” When she appeared at the feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again excited the desire of the bride, and the King’s daughter gave it to her for permission to pass the second night also, outside the door of the bedroom. Then in the stillness of the night, she cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thy heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught, could not be aroused. Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest."
"But the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the stranger-maiden, and told the bridegroom about it. They told him also that it was impossible that he could hear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry had poured a sleeping-draught into his wine."
"On the third evening, the King’s daughter turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress glittering like the stars.” When she showed herself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself with the splendour of the dress, which far surpassed the others, and she said, “I must, and will have it.” The maiden gave it as she had given the others for permission to spend the night outside the bridegroom’s door."
"The bridegroom, however, did not drink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed, but poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he heard a sweet voice which called to him,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou held me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"Suddenly, his memory returned to him. “Ah,” cried he, “how can I have acted so unfaithfully; but the kiss which in the joy of my heart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame for it all, that is what stupefied me!” He sprang up, took the King’s daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents’ bed. “This is my true bride,” said he; “if I marry the other, I shall do a great wrong.” The parents, when they heard how everything had happened, gave their consent. Then the lights in the hall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought, friends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself satisfied."
194 The Ear of Corn
"In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now; then the ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five hundred-fold."
"Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top o f the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the length of the ear. Men however are so made, that when they are too well off they no longer value the blessings which come from God, but grow indifferent and careless. One day a woman was passing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running beside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock. On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and cleaned the frock with them."
"George Whitefield the eloquent, who often addressed audiences (even in those days, when advertising was still in its infancy and the advance agent was unheard of) of from five thousand to forty thousand people, founded an orphan asylum. One audience consisted of sixty thousand people. The money from this work all went to help and sustain the orphan asylum. While reading of him we are reminded of our own Dr. Talmage, who is said to be the wealthiest apostle on the road."
"The trustees of Georgia limited the size of a man's farm, did not allow women to inherit land, and forbade the importation of rum or of slaves."
"Several of these rules were afterwards altered, so that as late as 1893 at least a gentleman from Washington, D.C., well known for his truth and honesty, saw rum inside the State twice, though Bourbon whiskey was preferred. Slaves also were found inside the State, and the negro is seen there even now; but the popularity of a negro baby is nothing now to what it was at the time when this class of goods went up to the top notch."
Need I add that after a while the people became dissatisfied with these rules and finally the whole matter was ceded to the crown? From this time on Georgia remained a royal province up to the Revolution. Since that very little has been said about ceding it to the crown.
"North Carolina also remained an English colony up to the same period, and, though one of the original thirteen Colonies, is still far more sparsely settled than some of the Western States."
"Virginia Dare was the first white child born in America. She selected Roanoke, now in North Carolina, in August, 1587, as her birthplace. She was a grand-daughter of the Governor, John White. Her fate, like that of the rest of the colony, is unknown to this day."
"The author begs leave to express his thanks here for the valuable      aid furnished him by the following works, viz.: ""The Horse and his      Diseases,"" by Mr. Astor; ""Life and Times of John Oglethorpe,"" by      Elias G. Merritt; ""How to Make the Garden Pay,"" by Peter Henderson;      ""Over the Purple Hills,"" by Mrs. Churchill, of Denver, Colorado,      and ""He Played on the Harp of a Thousand Strings, and the Spirits      of Just Men Made Perfect,"" by S. P. Avery."
CHAPTER XI.
INTERCOLONIAL AND INDIAN WARS.
"Intercolonial and Indian wars furnished excitement now from 1689 into the early part of the eighteenth century. War broke out in Europe between the French and English, and the Colonies had to take sides, as did also the Indians."
"Canadians and Indians would come down into York State or New England, burn a town, tomahawk quite a number of people, then go back on snow-shoes, having entered the town on rubbers, like a decayed show with no printing."
"There was an attack on Haverhill in March, 1697, and a Mr. Dustin was at work in the field. He ran to his house and got his seven children ahead of him, while with his gun he protected their rear till he got them away safely. Mrs. Dustin, however, who ran back into the house to remove a pie from the oven as she feared it was burning, was captured, and, with a boy of the neighborhood, taken to an island in the Merrimac, where the Indians camped. At night she woke the boy, told him how to hit an Indian with a tomahawk so that ""the subsequent proceedings would interest him no more,"" and that evening the two stole forth while the ten Indians slept, knocked in their thinks, scalped them to prove their story, and passed on to safety. Mrs. Dustin kept those scalps for many years, showing them to her friends to amuse them."
"King William's War lasted eight years. Queen Anne's War lasted from 1702 to 1713. The brunt of this war fell on New England. Our forefathers had to live in block-houses, with barbed-wire fences around them, and carry their guns with them all the time. From planting the Indian with a shotgun, they soon got to planting their corn with the same agricultural instrument in the stony soil."
"The French and Spanish tried to take Charleston in 1706, but were repulsed with great loss, consisting principally of time which they might have employed in raising frogs' legs and tantalizing a bull at so much per tant."
"This war lasted eleven years, including stops, and was ended by the treaty of Utrecht (pronounced you-trecked)."
"After this, what was called the Spanish War continued between England and Spain for some time. An attempt to capture Georgia was made, and a garrison established itself there, with good prospects of taking in the State under Spanish rule, but our able friend Oglethorpe, the Henry W."
"Grady of his time, managed to accidentally mislay a letter which fell into the enemy's hands, the contents of which showed that enormous reinforcements were expected at any moment. This was swallowed comfortably by the commander, who blew up his impregnable works, changed the address of his Atlanta Constitution, and sailed for home."
"Oglethorpe wore a wig, but was otherwise one of our greatest minds. It is said that anybody at a distance of two miles on a clear day could readily distinguish that it was a wig, and yet he died believing that no one had ever probed his great mystery and that his wig would rise with him at the playing of the last trump."
"King George's War, which extended over four years, succeeded, but did not amount to anything except the capture of Cape Breton by English and Colonial troops. Cape Breton was called the Gibraltar of America; but a Yankee farmer who has raised flax on an upright farm for twenty years does not mind scaling a couple of Gibraltars before breakfast; so, without any West Point knowledge regarding engineering, they walked up the hill, and those who were alive when they got to the top took it. It was no Balaklava business and no dumb animal show, but simply revealed the fact that brave men fighting for their eight-dollar homes and a mass of children are disagreeable people to meet on the battle-field."
"The French and Indian War lasted nine years, viz., from 1754 to 1763."
"From Quebec to New Orleans the French owned the land, and mixed up a good deal socially with the Indians, so that the slender settlement along the coast had arrayed against it this vast line of northern and western forts, and the Indians, who were mostly friendly with the French, united with them in several instances and showed them some new styles of barbarism which up to that time they had never known about."
The half-breed is always half French and half Indian.
"The English owned all lands lying on one side of the Ohio, the French on the other, which led a great chief to make a P. P. C. call on Governor Dinwiddie, and during the conversation to inquire with some naïveté where the Indian came in. No answer was ever received."
"We pause here to ask the question, Why did the pale-face usurp the lands of the Indians without remuneration? It was because the Indian was not orthodox. He may have been lazy from a Puritanical stand-point, and he may also have hunted on the twenty-seventh Sunday after Easter; but still was it not right that he should have received a dollar or two per county for the United States? No one would have felt it, and possibly it might have saved the lives of innocent people."
"Verbum sap., however, comes in here with peculiar appropriateness, and the massive-browed historian passes on."
"The French had three forts along in the Middle States, as they are now called, and Western Pennsylvania; and George Washington, of whom more will be said in the twelfth chapter, was sent to ask the French to remove these forts. He started at once."
"The commanders were some of them arrogant, but the general, St. Pierre, treated him with great respect, refusing, however, to yield the ground discovered by La Salle and Marquette. The author had the pleasure of being arrested in Paris in 1889, and he feels of a truth, as he often does, that there can be no more polite people in the world than the French. Arrested under all circumstances and in many lands, the author can place his hand on his heart and say that he would go hundreds of miles to be arrested by a John Darm."
"Washington returned four hundred miles through every kind of danger, including a lunch at Altoona, where he stopped twenty minutes."
"Things were very much unsettled. England had not sent a minister to this country, and had arranged no commercial treaty with us."
Washington's Cabinet consisted of three portfolios and a rack in which he kept his flute-music.
"The three ministers were the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Treasury. There was no Attorney-General, or Postmaster-General, or Secretary of the Interior, or of the Navy, or Seed Catalogue Secretary."
"Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, advised that Congress at the earliest moment provide itself with a national debt, which was done, the war debt being assumed by the Congressional representatives of the thirteen Colonies."
"A tax was levied on spirits, and a mint started, combining the two, and making the mint encourage the consumption of spirits, and thus the increase of the tax, very likely."
"A Whiskey Rebellion broke out in 1794. Pennsylvania especially rebelled at the tax on this grocery, but it was put down. (Those wishing to know which was put down will find out by consulting the Appendix, which will be issued a year from this winter.)"
"A few Indian wars now kept the people interested, and a large number of the red brothers, under Little Turtle, soon found themselves in the soup, as Washington put it so tersely in his message the following year."
Twenty-five thousand square miles north of the Ohio were obtained by treaty from the Indians.
"England claimed that traffic with America was not desirable, as the Americans did not pay their debts. Possibly that was true, for muskrat pelts were low at that time, and England refused to take cord-wood and saw-logs piled on the New York landing as cash."
"Chief-Justice Jay was sent to London to confer with the king, which he did. He was not invited, however, to come to the house during his stay, and the queen did not call on Mrs. Jay. The Jays have never recovered from this snub, and are still gently guyed by the comic papers."
"But the treaty was negotiated, and now the Americans are said to pay their debts as well as the nobility who marry our American girls instead of going into bankruptcy, as some would do."
"The Mississippi and the Mediterranean Sea were opened for navigation to American vessels now, and things looked better, for we could by this means exchange our cranberries for sugar and barter our Indian relics for camel's-hair shawls, of which the pioneers were very much in need during the rigorous winters in the North."
"The French now had a difficulty with England, and Washington, who still remembered La Fayette and the generous aid of the French, wished that he was back at Mount Vernon, working out his poll-tax on the Virginia roads, for he was in a tight place."
"It was now thought best to have two political parties, in order to enliven editorial thought and expression. So the Republican party, headed by Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph, and the Federalist party, led by Hamilton and Adams, were organized, and public speakers were engaged from a distance."
"The latter party supported the administration, which was not so much of a job as it has been several times since."
"Washington declined to accept a third term, and wrote a first-rate farewell address. A lady, whose name is withheld, writing of those times, closes by saying that President Washington was one of the sweetest men she ever knew."
"John Adams succeeded Washington as President, and did not change his politics to amount to much."
"He made a good record as Congressman, but lost it as President largely because of his egotism. He seemed to think that if he neglected to oil the gearing of the solar system about so often, it would stop running."
We should learn from this to be humble even when we are in authority.
"Adams and Jefferson were good friends during the Revolution, but afterwards political differences estranged them till they returned to private life. Adams was a poor judge of men, and offended several members of the press who called on him to get his message in advance."
"Our country was on the eve of a war with France, when Napoleon I. was made Consul, and peace followed."
"Adams's administration made the Federalists unpopular, owing to the Alien and Sedition laws, and Jefferson was elected the successor of Adams, Burr running as Vice-President with him. The election was so close that it went to the House, however."
"Jefferson, or the Sage of Monticello, was a good President, noted for his simplicity. He married and brought his bride home to Monticello prior to this. She had to come on horseback about one hundred miles, and, as the house was unfinished and no servants there, they had to sleep on the work-bench and eat what was left of the carpenter's lunch."
"Jeffersonian simplicity was his strong point, and people who called at the White House often found him sprinkling the floor of his office, or trying to start a fire with kerosene."
"Burr was Vice-President, and, noticing at once that the office did not attract any attention to speak of, decided to challenge Mr. Alexander Hamilton to fight a duel with him."
"The affair took place at Weehawken, July 11, 1804. Hamilton fell at the first fire, on the same spot where his eldest son had been killed in the same way."
"The artist has shown us how Burr and Hamilton should have fought, but, alas! they were not progressive men and did not realize this till too late. Another method would have been to use the bloodless method of the French duel, or the newspaper customs adopted by the pugilists of 1893."
The time is approaching when mortal combat in America will be confined to belligerent people under the influence of liquor. A newspaper assault instead of a duel might have made Burr President and Hamilton Vice-President.
"Burr went West, and was afterwards accused of treason on the ground that he was trying to organize Mexico against the United States government."
131 Fair Katrinelje and Pif-Paf-Poltrie
"“Good-day, Father Hollenthe.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your daughter?” “Oh, yes, if Mother Malcho (Milch-cow), Brother High-and-Mighty, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.”"
"“Where is Mother Malcho, then?” “She is in the cow-house, milking the cow.”"
"“Good-day, Mother Malcho.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your daughter?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Brother High-and-Mighty, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.” “Where is Brother High-and-Mighty, then?” “He is in the room chopping some wood.” “Good-day, Brother High-and-Mighty.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your sister?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.” “Where is Sister Käsetraut, then?” “She is in the garden cutting cabbages.” “Good-day, sister Käsetraut.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your sister?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Brother High-and-Mighty, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you may have her.”"
"“Where is fair Katrinelje, then?” “She is in the room counting out her farthings.” “Good day, fair Katrinelje.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “Wilt thou be my bride?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Brother High-and-Mighty, and Sister Käsetraut are willing, I am ready.”"
"“Fair Katrinelje, how much dowry do hast thou?” “Fourteen farthings in ready money, three and a half groschen owing to me, half a pound of dried apples, a handful of fried bread, and a handful of spices."
"And many other things are mine, Have I not a dowry fine?"
"“Pif-paf-poltrie, what is thy trade? Art thou a tailor?” “Something better.” “A shoemaker?” “Something better.” “A husbandman?” “Something better.” “A joiner?” “Something better.” “A smith?” “Something better.”"
"“A miller?” “Something better.” “Perhaps a broom-maker?” “Yes, that’s what I am, is it not a fine trade?”"
132 The Fox and the Horse
"A peasant had a faithful horse which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master would no longer give him anything to eat and said, “I can certainly make no more use of thee, but still I mean well by thee; if thou provest thyself still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will maintain thee, but now take thyself away out of my stable,” and with that he chased him into the open country. The horse was sad, and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. Then the fox met him and said, “Why dost thou hang thy head so, and go about all alone?” “Alas,” replied the horse, “avarice and fidelity do not dwell together in one house. My master has forgotten what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plough well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out.” “Without giving thee a chance?” asked the fox. “The chance was a bad one. He said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he well knows that I cannot do that.”"
"The fox said, “I will help thee, just lay thyself down, stretch thyself out, as if thou wert dead, and do not stir.” The horse did as the fox desired, and the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said, “A dead horse is lying outside there, just come with me, thou canst have a rich meal.” The lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, “After all, it is not very comfortable for thee here I tell thee what I will fasten it to thee by the tail, and then thou canst drag it into thy cave, and devour it in peace.”"
"This advice pleased the lion: he lay down, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, he kept quite quiet. But the fox tied the lion’s legs together with the horse’s tail, and twisted and fastened all so well and so strongly that no strength could break it."
"When he had finished his work, he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, “Pull, white horse, pull.” Then up sprang the horse at once, and drew the lion away with him. The lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew out in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and dragged him over the country to his master’s door. When the master saw the lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, “Thou shalt stay with me and fare well,” and he gave him plenty to eat until he died."
133 The Shoes That Were Danced to Pieces
"There was once upon a time a King who had twelve daughters, each one more beautiful than the other. They all slept together in one chamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when they were in them the King locked the door, and bolted it. But in the morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to pass. Then the King caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and be King after his death, but that whosoever came forward and had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have forfeited his life. It was not long before a King’s son presented himself, and offered to undertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses’ sleeping-chamber."
"His bed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and danced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place, the door of their room was left open."
"But the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles. On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his head was struck off without mercy. Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives. Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King lived. There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. “I hardly know myself,”"
"answered he, and added in jest, “I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become King.”"
"“That is not so difficult,” said the old woman, “you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep.” With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, “If you put on that, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.” When the soldier had received this good advice, he went into the thing in earnest, took heart, went to the King, and announced himself as a suitor. He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him. He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the ante-chamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop. Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep. The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said, “He, too, might as well have saved his life.” With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance. Only the youngest said, “I know not how it is; you are very happy, but I feel very strange; some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.” “Thou art a goose, who art always frightened,” said the eldest. “Hast thou forgotten how many Kings’ sons have already come here in vain? I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, in any case the clown would not have awakened.” When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves quite secure. The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it; it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first. The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest. Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress; she was terrified at that, and cried out, “What is that? who is pulling my dress?” “Don’t be so silly!” said the eldest, “you have caught it on a nail.” Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier thought, “I must carry a token away with me,” and broke off a twig from one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report. The youngest cried out again."
"“Something is wrong, did you hear the crack?” But the eldest said, “It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got rid of our prince so quickly.” After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds; he broke off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes. They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little boats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were waiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the soldier seated himself by the youngest. Then her prince said, “I can’t tell why the boat is so much heavier to-day; I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it across.” “What should cause that,” said the youngest, “but the warm weather? I feel very warm too.”"
"On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums."
"They rowed over there, entered, and each prince danced with the girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when one of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty when she carried it to her mouth; the youngest was alarmed at this, but the eldest always made her be silent. They danced there till three o’clock in the morning when all the shoes were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off; the princes rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated himself by the eldest. On the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return the following night. When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on in front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up slowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him, and they said, “So far as he is concerned, we are safe.” They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down. Next morning the soldier was resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings on, and again went with them. Then everything was done just as it had been done the first time, and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces. But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token. When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the cup, and went to the King, but the twelve stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say. When the King put the question, “Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the night?” he answered, “In an underground castle with twelve princes,”"
"and related how it had come to pass, and brought out the tokens. The King then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all."
"Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have to wife? He answered, “I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.” Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom was promised him after the King’s death. But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve."
134 The Six Servants
"In former times there lived an aged Queen who was a sorceress, and her daughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. The old woman, however, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to destruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever wished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die. Many had been dazzled by the daughter’s beauty, and had actually risked this, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined them to do, and then no mercy was shown; they had to kneel down, and their heads were struck off. A certain King’s son who had also heard of the maiden’s beauty, said to his father, “Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage.” “Never,” answered the King; “if you were to go, it would be going to your death.” On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and for seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him. When the father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he said to him, “Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other means of curing you.” When the son heard that, he rose from his bed and was well again, and joyfully set out on his way."
"And it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from afar something like a great heap of hay lying on the ground, and when he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man, who had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small mountain."
"When the fat man saw the traveller, he stood up and said, “If you are in need of any one, take me into your service.” The prince answered, “What can I do with such a great big man?” “Oh,” said the Stout One, “this is nothing, when I stretch myself out well, I am three thousand times fatter.” “If that’s the case,” said the prince, “I can make use of thee, come with me.” So the Stout One followed the prince, and after a while they found another man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the turf. “What art thou doing there?” asked the King’s son. “I am listening,” replied the man. “What art thou listening to so attentively?” “I am listening to what is just going on in the world, for nothing escapes my ears; I even hear the grass growing.” “Tell me,”"
"said the prince, “what thou hearest at the court of the old Queen who has the beautiful daughter.” Then he answered, “I hear the whizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer’s head.” The King’s son said, “I can make use of thee, come with me.” They went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a pair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body. When they had walked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to the head also. “Why,” said the prince, “what a tall rascal thou art!” “Oh,” replied the Tall One, “that is nothing at all yet; when I really stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and taller than the highest mountain on earth."
"I will gladly enter your service, if you will take me.” “Come with me,”"
"said the prince, “I can make use of thee.” They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes. The prince said to him, “Hast thou weak eyes, that thou canst not look at the light?”"
"""I'm going to try if I can find the Princesses,"" answered the soldier."
"""So are we,"" said the captain, ""and since your errand is the same, you may keep company with us, for if we don't find them, you are not likely to find them either, my lad,"" said he."
"When they had gone awhile the soldier left the high road, and took a path into the forest."
"""Where are you going?"" said the captain; ""it is best to follow the high road."""
"""That may be,"" said the soldier, ""but this is my way."""
"He kept to the path, and when the others saw this they turned round and followed him. Away they went further and further, far across big moors and along narrow valleys."
"And at last it became lighter, and when they had got out of the forest altogether they came to a long bridge, which they had to cross. But on that bridge a bear stood on guard. He rose on his hind legs and came towards them, as if he wanted to eat them."
"""What shall we do now?"" said the captain."
"""They say that the bear is fond of meat,"" said the soldier, and then he threw a fore quarter to him, and so they got past. But when they reached the other end of the bridge, they saw a lion, which came roaring towards them with open jaws as if he wanted to swallow them."
"""I think we had better turn right-about, we shall never be able to get past him alive,"" said the captain."
"""Oh, I don't think he is so very dangerous,"" said the soldier; ""I have heard that lions are very fond of bacon, and I have half a pig in my wallet;"" and then he threw a ham to the lion, who began eating and gnawing, and thus they got past him also."
"In the evening they came to a fine big house. Each room was more gorgeous than the other; all was glitter and splendour wherever they looked; but that did not satisfy their hunger. The captain and the lieutenant went round rattling their money, and wanted to buy some food; but they saw no people nor could they find a crumb of anything in the house, so the soldier offered them some food from his wallet, which they were not too proud to accept, nor did they want any pressing. They helped themselves of what he had as if they had never tasted food before."
The next day the captain said they would have to go out shooting and try to get something to live upon. Close to the house was a large forest where there were plenty of hares and birds. The lieutenant was to remain at home and cook the remainder of the food in the soldier's wallet. In the meantime the captain and the soldier shot so much game that they were hardly able to carry it home. When they came to the door they found the lieutenant in such a terrible plight that he was scarcely able to open the door to them.
"""What is the matter with you?"" said the captain. The lieutenant then told them that as soon as they were gone a tiny, little man, with a long beard, who went on crutches, came in and asked so plaintively for a penny; but no sooner had he got it than he let it fall on the floor, and for all he raked and scraped with his crutch he was not able to get hold of it, so stiff and stark was he."
"""I pitied the poor, old body,"" said the lieutenant, ""and so I bent down to pick up the penny, but then he was neither stiff nor stark any longer. He began to belabour me with his crutches till very soon I was unable to move a limb."""
"""You ought to be ashamed of yourself! you, one of the king's officers, to let an old cripple give you a thrashing, and then tell people of it into the bargain!"" said the captain. ""Pshaw! to-morrow I'll stop at home, and then you'll hear another story."""
The next day the lieutenant and the soldier went out shooting and the captain remained at home to do the cooking and look after the house.
"But if he fared no worse, he certainly fared no better than the lieutenant. In a little while the old man came in and asked for a penny. He let it fall as soon as he got it; gone it was and could not be found. So he asked the captain to help him to find it, and the captain, without giving a thought, bent down to look for it. But no sooner was he on his knees than the cripple began belabouring him with his crutches, and every time the captain tried to rise, he got a blow which sent him reeling. When the others came home in the evening, he still lay on the same spot and could neither see nor speak."
"The third day the soldier was to remain at home, while the other two went out shooting. The captain said he must take care of himself, ""for the old fellow will soon put an end to you, my lad,"" said he."
"""Oh, there can't be much life in one if such an old crook can take it,"" said the soldier."
"They were no sooner outside the door, than the old man came in and asked for a penny again."
"""Money I have never owned,"" said the soldier, ""but food I'll give you, as soon as it is ready,"" said he, ""but if we are to get it cooked, you must go and cut the wood."""
"""That I can't,"" said the old man."
"""If you can't, you must learn,"" said the soldier. ""I will soon show you. Come along with me down to the wood-shed."" There he dragged out a heavy log and cut a cleft in it, and drove in a wedge till the cleft deepened."
"""Now you must lie down and look right along the cleft, and you'll soon learn how to cut wood,"" said the soldier. ""In the meantime I'll show you how to use the axe."""
"The old man was not sufficiently cunning, and did as he was told; he lay down and looked steadily along the log. When the soldier saw the old man's beard had got well into the cleft, he struck out the wedge; the cleft closed and the old man was caught by the beard. The soldier began to beat him with the axe handle, and then swung the axe round his head, and vowed that he would split his skull if he did not tell him, there and then, where the Princesses were."
"""Spare my life, spare my life, and I'll tell you!"" said the old man."
"""To the east of the house there is a big mound; on top of the mound you must dig out a square piece of turf, and then you will see a big stone slab. Under that there is a deep hole through which you must let yourself down, and you'll then come to another world where you will find the Princesses. But the way is long and dark and it goes both through fire and water."""
"When the soldier got to know this, he released the old man, who was not long in making off."
"When the captain and lieutenant came home they were surprised to find the soldier alive. He told them what had happened from first to last, where the Princesses were and how they should find them. They became as pleased as if they had already found them, and when they had had some food, they took with them a basket and as much rope as they could find, and all three set off to the mound. There they first dug out the turf just as the old man had told them, and underneath they found a big stone slab, which it took all their strength to turn over."
"They then began to measure how deep it was; they joined on ropes both two and three times, but they were no nearer the bottom the last time than the first. At last they had to join all the ropes they had, both the coarse and fine, and then they found it reached the bottom."
"The captain was, of course, the first who wanted to descend; ""But when I tug at the rope you must make haste to drag me up again,"" he said."
"An effort was made to get up a fight between the French fleet and the English at Newport for the championship, but a severe storm came up and prevented it."
"In July the Wyoming Massacre, under the management of the Tories and Indians, commanded by Butler, took place in that beautiful valley near Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania."
"This massacre did more to make the Indians and Tories unpopular in this country than any other act of the war. The men were away in the army, and the women, children, and old men alone were left to the vengeance of the two varieties of savage. The Indians had never had gospel privileges, but the Tories had. Otherwise they resembled each other."
"In 1779 the English seemed to have Georgia and the South pretty well to themselves. Prevost, the English general, made an attack on Charleston, but, learning that Lincoln was after him, decided that, as he had a telegram to meet a personal friend at Savannah, he would go there. In September, Lincoln, assisted by the French under D'Estaing, attacked Savannah. One thousand lives were lost, and D'Estaing showed the white feather to advantage. Count Pulaski lost his life in this fight. He was a brave Polish patriot, and his body was buried in the Savannah River."
"The capture of Stony Point about this time by ""Mad Anthony Wayne"" was one of the most brilliant battles of the war."
"Learning the countersign from a negro who sold strawberries to the British, the troops passed the guard over the bridge that covered the marsh, and, gagging the worthy inside guard, they marched up the hill with fixed bayonets and fixed the enemy to the number of six hundred."
"The countersign was, ""The fort is won,"" and so it was, in less time than it takes to ejaculate the word ""scat!"" Wayne was wounded at the outset, but was carried up the hill in command, with a bandage tied about his head. He was a brave man, and never knew in battle what fear was. Yet, strange to say, a bat in his bed would make him start up and turn pale."
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE CLOSE OF THE REVOLUTION.
"The atrocities introduced into this country by the Tories and Indians caused General Sullivan to go out against the measly enemy, whip him near Elmira, and destroy the fields of corn and villages in the Genesee country, where the Indian women were engaged in farming while their men-folks attended to the massacre industry."
The weak point with the Americans seemed to be lack of a suitable navy.
"A navy costs money, and the Colonists were poor. In 1775 they fitted out several swift sailing-vessels, which did good service. Inside of five years they captured over five hundred ships, cruised among the British isles, and it is reported that they captured war-vessels that were tied to the English wharves."
"Paul Jones had a method of running his vessel alongside the enemy's, lashing the two together, and then having it out with the crew, generally winning in a canter. His idea in lashing the two ships together was to have one good ship to ride home on. Generally it was the one he captured, while his own, which was rotten, was allowed to go down. This was especially the case in the fight between the Richard and the Serapis, September 23, 1779."
"In 1780 the war was renewed in South Carolina. Charleston, after a forty days' siege, was forced to surrender. Gates now took charge of the South, and also gave a sprinting exhibition at Camden, where he was almost wiped off the face of the earth. He had only two troops left at the close of the battle, and they could not keep up with Gates in the retreat. This battle and the retreat overheated Gates and sowed the seeds of heart-disease, from which he never recovered. He should have chosen a more peaceful life, such as the hen-traffic, or the growth of asparagus for the market."
"Benedict Arnold has been severely reproached in history, but he was a brave soldier, and possibly serving under Gates, who jealously kept him in the background, had a good deal to do with the little European dicker which so darkened his brilliant career as a soldier."
"Unhappy man! He was not well received in England, and, though a brilliant man, was forced to sit in a corner evening after evening and hear the English tell his humorous stories as their own."
"The Carolinas were full of Tories, and opposition to English rule was practically abandoned in the South for the time, with the exception of that made in a desultory swamp-warfare by the partisan bands with such leaders as Marion, Sumter, and Pickens."
Two hundred thousand dollars of Continental money was the sum now out.
"Forty dollars of it would buy one dollar's worth of groceries; but the grocer had to know the customer pretty well, and even then it was more to accommodate than anything else that he sold at that price."
"The British flooded the country with a counterfeit that was rather better-looking than the genuine: so that by the time a man had paid six hundred dollars for a pair of boots, and the crooked bills had been picked out and others substituted, it made him feel that starting a republic was a mighty unpopular job."
"General Arnold had married a Tory lady, and lived in Philadelphia while recovering from his wounds received at Quebec and Saratoga. He was rather a high roller, and ran behind, so that it is estimated that his bills there per month required a peach-basket-full of currency with which to pay them, as the currency was then quoted. Besides, Gates had worried him, and made him think that patriotism was mostly politics. He was also overbearing, and the people of Philadelphia mobbed him once. He was reprimanded gently by Washington, but Arnold was haughty and yet humiliated. He got command of West Point, a very important place indeed, and then arranged with Clinton to swap it for six thousand three hundred and fifteen pounds and a colonelcy in the English army."
"Major André was appointed to confer with Arnold, and got off the ship Vulture to make his way to the appointed place, but it was daylight by that time, and the Vulture, having been fired on, dropped down the river. André now saw no way for him but to get back to New York; but at Tarrytown he was met by three patriots, who caught his horse by the reins, and, though André tried to tip them, he did not succeed. They found papers on his person, among them a copy of Punch, which made them suspicious that he was not an American, and so he was tried and hanged as a spy. This was one of the saddest features of the American Revolution, and should teach us to be careful how we go about in an enemy's country, also to use great care in selecting and subscribing for papers."
"In 1781, Greene, who succeeded Gates, took charge of the two thousand ragged and bony troops. January 17 he was attacked at Cowpens by Tarleton. The militia fell back, and the English made a grand charge, supposing victory to be within reach. But the wily and foxy troops turned at thirty yards and gave the undertaking business a boom that will never be forgotten."
"Morgan was in command of the Colonial forces. He went on looking for more regulars to kill, but soon ran up against Cornwallis the surrenderer."
"General Greene now joined Morgan, and took charge of the retreat. At the Yadkin River they crossed over ahead of Cornwallis, when it began for to rain. When Cornwallis came to the river he found it so swollen and restless that he decided not to cross. Later he crossed higher up, and made for the fords of the Dan at thirty miles a day, to head off the Americans. Greene beat him, however, by a length, and saved his troops."
"The writer has seen the place on the Yadkin where Cornwallis decided not to cross. It was one of the pivotal points of the war, and is of about medium height."
"A fight followed at Guilford Court-House, where the Americans were driven back, but the enemy got thinned out so noticeably that Cornwallis decided to retreat. He went back to Washington on a Bull Run schedule, without pausing even for feed or water. Cornwallis was greatly agitated, and the coat he wore at the time, and now shown in the Smithsonian Institution, shows distinctly the marks made where the Colonists played checkers on the tail."
"The battle of Eutaw Springs, September 8, also greatly reduced the British forces at that point."
"Arnold conducted a campaign into Virginia, and was very brutal about it, killing a great many people who were strangers to him, and who had never harmed him, not knowing him, as the historian says, from ""Adam's off ox."""
"""Who run?"" inquired Wolfe."
"""The French! The French!"" came the reply."
"""Now God be praised,"" said Wolfe, ""I die happy."""
"Montcalm had a similar experience. He was fatally wounded. ""They run!"
"They run!"" he heard some one say."
"""Who run?"" exclaimed Montcalm, wetting his lips with a lemonade-glass of cognac."
"""We do,"" replied the man."
"""Then so much the better,"" said Montcalm, as his eye lighted up, ""for I shall not live to see Quebec surrendered."""
This shows what can be done without a rehearsal; also how the historian has to control himself in order to avoid lying.
"The death of these two brave men is a beautiful and dramatic incident in the history of our country, and should be remembered by every school-boy, because neither lived to write articles criticising the other."
"Five days later the city capitulated. An attempt was made to recapture it, but it was not successful. Canada fell into the hands of the English, and from the open Polar Sea to the Mississippi the English flag floated."
What an empire!
What a game-preserve!
"Florida was now ceded to the already cedy crown of England by Spain, and brandy-and-soda for the wealthy and bitter beer became the drink of the poor."
"Pontiac's War was brought on by the Indians, who preferred the French occupation to that of the English. Pontiac organized a large number of tribes on the spoils plan, and captured eight forts. He killed a great many people, burned their dwellings, and drove out many more, but at last his tribes made trouble, as there were not spoils enough to go around, and his army was conquered. He was killed in 1769 by an Indian who received for his trouble a barrel of liquor, with which he began to make merry. He remained by the liquor till death came to his relief."
"The heroism of an Indian who meets his enemy single-handed in that way, and, though greatly outnumbered, dies with his face to the foe, is deserving of more than a passing notice."
"The French and Indian War cost the Colonists sixteen million dollars, of which the English repaid only five million. The Americans lost thirty thousand men, none of whom were replaced. They suffered every kind of horror and barbarity, written and unwritten, and for years their taxes were two-thirds of their income; and yet they did not murmur."
"These were the fathers and mothers of whom we justly brag. These were the people whose children we are. What are inherited titles and ancient names many times since dishonored, compared with the heritage of uncomplaining suffering and heroism which we boast of to-day because those modest martyrs were working people, proud that by the sweat of their brows they wrung from a niggardly soil the food they ate, proud also that they could leave the plough to govern or to legislate, able also to survey a county or rule a nation."
CHAPTER XII.
PERSONALITY OF WASHINGTON.
It would seem that a few personal remarks about George Washington at this point might not be out of place. Later on his part in this history will more fully appear.
"The author points with some pride to a study of Washington's great act in crossing the Delaware, from a wax-work of great accuracy. The reader will avoid confusing Washington with the author, who is dressed in a plaid suit and on the shore, while Washington may be seen in this end of the boat with the air of one who has just discovered the location of a glue-factory on the side of the river."
"A directory of Washington's head-quarters has been arranged by the author of this book, and at a reunion of the general's body-servants to be held in the future the work will be on sale."
The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that made him appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large feet and a mouth made to fit an old-fashioned full-dress pumpkin pie.
"George Washington's face has beamed out upon us for many years now, on postage-stamps and currency, in marble and plaster and in bronze, in photographs of original portraits, paintings, and stereoscopic views. We have seen him on horseback and on foot, on the war-path and on skates, playing the flute, cussing his troops for their shiftlessness, and then, in the solitude of the forest, with his snorting war-horse tied to a tree, engaged in prayer."
"We have seen all these pictures of George, till we are led to believe that he did not breathe our air or eat American groceries. But George Washington was not perfect. I say this after a long and careful study of his life, and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the proud history of the Father of his Country. I say it simply that the boys of America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so timid about trying it."
"When I say that George Washington, who now lies so calmly in the lime-kiln at Mount Vernon, could reprimand and reproach his subordinates, at times, in a way to make the ground crack open and break up the ice in the Delaware a week earlier than usual, I do not mention it in order to show the boys of our day that profanity will make them resemble George Washington. That was one of his weak points, and no doubt he was ashamed of it, as he ought to have been. Some poets think that if they get drunk and stay drunk they will resemble Edgar A. Poe and George D. Prentice. There are lawyers who play poker year after year and get regularly skinned because they have heard that some of the able lawyers of the past century used to come home at night with poker-chips in their pockets."
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let out the star;"" and with these words she carried off the babe."
"But when those who were on the watch woke, they thought the queen had eaten her own child, and the old queen was all for burning her alive, but the Prince was so fond of her that at last he begged her off, but he had hard work to set her free."
"So the next time the young queen was to have a child, twice as strong a watch was set as the first time, but the same thing happened over again, only this time her Foster-mother said:"
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let the moon out."""
"And the queen begged and prayed, and wept; for when her Foster-mother was there, she could speak but it was all no good."
"And now the old queen said she must be burnt, but the Prince found means to beg her off. But when the third child was to be born, a watch was set three times as strong as the first, but just the same thing happened. Her Foster-mother came while the watch slept, took the babe, and cut its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood, telling her now she should be as grieved as she had been when the Lassie let out the sun."
"And now the Prince could not save her any longer. She must and should be burnt. But just as they were leading her to the stake, all at once they saw her Foster-mother, who came with all three children two she led by the hand, and the third she had on her arm; and so she went up to the young queen and said:"
"""Here are your children; now you shall have them again. I am the Virgin Mary, and so grieved as you have been, so grieved was I when you let out sun, and moon, and star. Now you have been punished for what you did, and henceforth you shall have your speech."""
"How glad the Queen and Prince now were, all may easily think, but no one can tell. After that they were always happy; and from that day even the Prince's mother was very fond of the young queen."
THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE
"Once on a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thought his Wife did anything right in the house. So, one evening, in haymaking time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth and making a dust."
"""Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man,"" said his goody; ""to-morrow let's change our work. I'll go out with the mowers and mow, and you shall mind the house at home."""
"Yes! the Husband thought that would do very well. He was quite willing, he said."
"So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over her neck, and went out into the hayfield with the mowers, and began to mow; but the man was to mind the house, and do the work at home."
"First of all, he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned a while, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap into the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen. Then off he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as he could, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but when he got up, and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was running all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick, that piggy lay for dead on the spot. Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in his hand; but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run out of the cask."
"Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have at dinner. When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milking cow was still shut up in the byre, and hadn't had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then all at once he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'd just get her up on the house top for the house, you must know, was thatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now the house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cow up."
"But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babe crawling about on the floor, and ""if I leave it,"" he thought, ""the child is safe to upset it."" So he took the churn on his back, and went out with it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow before he turned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water out of the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well."
"Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; so he thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, he thought the cow might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So he got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast to the cow's neck and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied round his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now began to boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal."
"So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell the cow off the house-top after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man up the chimney by the rope. There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she hung half-way down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for she could neither get down nor up."
"And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her Husband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call they had. At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home. But when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she ran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe. But, as she did this, down came her Husband out of the chimney; and so, when his old dame came inside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in the porridge pot."
THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND
"Once on a time there was an old widow who had one son; and as she was poorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down the steps, there came the North Wind puffing and blowing, caught up the meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the Lad went back into the safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the North Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff:"
"and, more than that, he did so the third time. At this the Lad got very angry; and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so, he thought he'd just look him up, and ask him to give up his meal."
"So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but at last he came to the North Wind's house."
"""Good day!"" said the Lad, ""and thank you for coming to see us yesterday."""
"""GOOD DAY!"" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff, ""AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?"""
"""Oh!"" answered the Lad, ""I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we haven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morsel we have, there'll be nothing for it but to starve."""
"""I haven't got your meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but if you are in such need, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, if you only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes!'"""
"With this the Lad was well content. But, as the way was so long he couldn't get home in one day, so he turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going to sit down to supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
"He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who stood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady. So, when all were fast asleep at dead of night, she took the Lad's cloth, and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from the North Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread."
"""Heaven bless and help us! what a stout heart you have got!"" said the old dame. ""Don't you see we have got amongst Trolls?"""
"""Stuff and nonsense!"" said the lad; ""no harm if we have."""
"In a little while, back came the man with an ox so fat and big, the lad had never seen its like, and he gave it one blow with his fist under the ear, and down it fell dead on the floor. When that was done, he took it up by all the four legs and laid it on the glowing embers, and turned it and twisted it about till it was burnt brown outside."
"After that, he went to a cupboard and took out a great silver dish, and laid the ox on it; and the dish was so big that none of the ox hung over on any side. This he put on the table, and then he went down into the cellar and fetched a cask of wine, knocked out the head, and put the cask on the table, together with two knives, which were each six feet long. When this was done he bade them go and sit down to supper and eat. So they went, the lad first and the old dame after, but she began to whimper and wail, and to wonder how she should ever use such knives. But her son seized one, and began to cut slices out of the thigh of the ox, which he placed before his mother. And when they had eaten a bit, he took up the cask with both hands, and lifted it down to the floor; then he told his mother to come and drink, but it was still so high she couldn't reach up to it; so he caught her up, and held her up to the edge of the cask while she drank; as for himself, he clambered up and hung down like a cat inside the cask while he drank. So when he had quenched his thirst, he took up the cask and put it back on the table, and thanked the man for the good meal, and told his mother to come and thank him too, and, a-feared though she was, she dared do nothing else but thank the man. Then the lad sat down again alongside the man and began to gossip, and after they had sat a while the man said:"
"""Well! I must just go and get a bit of supper too;"" and so he went to the table and ate up the whole ox hoofs, and horns, and all and drained the cask to the last drop, and then went back and sat on the bench."
"""As for beds,"" he said, ""I don't know what's to be done. I've only got one bed and a cradle; but we could get on pretty well if you would sleep in the cradle, and then your mother might lie in the bed yonder."""
"""Thank you kindly, that'll do nicely,"" said the lad; and with that he pulled off his clothes and lay down in the cradle; but, to tell you the truth, it was quite as big as a four-poster. As for the old dame, she had to follow the man who showed her to bed, though she was out of her wits for fear."
"""Well!"" thought the lad to himself, ""'twill never do to go to sleep yet. I'd best lie awake and listen how things go as the night wears on."""
"So, after a while, the man began to talk to the old dame, and at last he said:"
"""We two might live here so happily together, could we only be rid of this son of yours."""
"""But do you know how to settle him? Is that what you're thinking of?"""
said she.
"""Nothing easier,"" said he; at any rate he would try. He would just say he wished the old dame would stay and keep house for him a day or two, and then he would take the lad out with him up the hill to quarry corner-stones, and roll down a great rock on him. All this the lad lay and listened to."
"Next day the Troll for it was a Troll as clear as day asked if the old dame would stay and keep house for him a few days; and as the day went on he took a great iron crowbar, and asked the lad if he had a mind to go with him up the hill and quarry a few corner-stones. With all his heart, he said, and went with him; and so, after they had split a few stones, the Troll wanted him to go down below and look after cracks in the rock; and while he was doing this the Troll worked away, and wearied himself with his crowbar till he moved a whole crag out of its bed, which came rolling right down on the place where the lad was; but he held it up till he could get on one side, and then let it roll on."
"""Oh!"" said the lad to the Troll, ""now I see what you mean to do with me. You want to crush me to death; so just go down yourself and look after the cracks and refts in the rock, and I'll stand up above."""
"The Troll did not dare to do otherwise than the lad bade him, and the end of it was that the lad rolled down a great rock, which fell upon the Troll and broke one of his thighs."
"""Well! you are in a sad plight,"" said the lad, as he strode down, lifted up the rock, and set the man free. After that he had to put him on his back and carry him home; so he ran with him as fast as a horse, and shook him so that the Troll screamed and screeched as if a knife were run into him. And when he got home, they had to put the Troll to bed, and there he lay in a sad pickle."
"When the night wore on, the Troll began to talk to the old dame again, and to wonder how ever they could be rid of the lad."
"""Well,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't hit on a plan to get rid of him, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Let me see,"" said the Troll; ""I've got twelve lions in a garden; if they could only get hold of the lad, they'd soon tear him to pieces."""
"So the old dame said it would be easy enough to get him there. She would sham sick, and say she felt so poorly, nothing would do her any good but lion's milk. All that the lad lay and listened to; and when he got up in the morning his mother said she was worse than she looked, and she thought she should never be right again unless she could get some lion's milk."
"""Then I'm afraid you'll be poorly a long time, mother,"" said the lad, ""for I'm sure I don't know where any is to be got."""
"""Oh! if that be all,"" said the Troll, ""there's no lack of lion's milk, if we only had the man to fetch it;"" and then he went on to say how his brother had a garden with twelve lions in it, and how the lad might have the key if he had a mind to milk the lions. So the lad took the key and a milking pail, and strode off; and when he unlocked the gate and got into the garden, there stood all the twelve lions on their hind-paws, rampant and roaring at him. But the lad laid hold of the biggest, and led him about by the fore-paws, and dashed him against stocks and stones till there wasn't a bit of him left but the two paws. So when the rest saw that, they were so afraid that they crept up and lay at his feet like so many curs. After that they followed him about wherever he went, and when he got home, they lay down outside the house, with their fore-paws on the door sill."
"""Now, mother, you'll soon be well,"" said the lad, when he went in, ""for here is the lion's milk."""
He had just milked a drop in the pail.
"But the Troll, as he lay in bed, swore it was all a lie. He was sure the lad was not the man to milk lions."
"When the lad heard that, he forced the Troll to get out of bed, threw open the door, and all the lions rose up and seized the Troll, and at last the lad had to make them leave their hold."
"That night the Troll began to talk to the old dame again. ""I'm sure I can't tell how to put this lad out of the way he is so awfully strong; can't you think of some way?"""
"""No,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't tell, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Well!"" said the Troll, ""I have two brothers in a castle; they are twelve times as strong as I am, and that's why I was turned out and had to put up with this farm. They hold that castle, and round it there is an orchard with apples in it, and whoever eats those apples sleeps for three days and three nights. If we could only get the lad to go for the fruit, he wouldn't be able to keep from tasting the apples, and as soon as ever he fell asleep my brothers would tear him in pieces."""
"The old dame said she would sham sick, and say she could never be herself again unless she tasted those apples; for she had set her heart on them."
All this the lad lay and listened to.
"Chiriqui with a view to establishing a packing house there, but"
reported that the supply of cattle was inadequate for even the smallest
establishment. Yet the country is admirably adapted for cattle raising.
[Illustration: PRIMITIVE SUGAR MILL]
"The climate of this region is equable, both as to temperature and"
humidity. Epidemic diseases are practically unknown among either men or
beasts. Should irrigation in future seem needful to agriculture the
multitude of streams furnish an ample water supply and innumerable sites
for reservoirs.
Westward from David the face of the country rises gently until you come
"to the Caldera Valley which lies at the foot of the Chiriqui Peak, an"
extinct volcano perhaps 8000 feet high. Nowhere in Panama do the
"mountains rise very high, though the range is clearly a connection of"
the Cordilleras of North and South America. The Chiriqui Peak has not in
"the memory of man been in eruption, but the traces of its volcanic"
character are unmistakable. Its crater is a circular plain about half a
mile in diameter surrounded by a densely wooded precipitous ridge. As
the ascent is continued the woods give way to grass and rocks. While
"there is a distinct timber line, no snow line is attained. At the foot"
"of the mountain is El Bouquette, much esteemed by the Panamanians as a"
"health resort. Thither go Canal workers who, not being permitted to"
"remain on the Zone during their vacations, wish to avoid the long voyage"
to North American ports.

This neighborhood is the center of the coffee-growing industry which
should be profitable in Panama if a heavy protective tariff could make
it so. But not even enough of the fragrant berries are grown to supply

Appendix V.
"Since I have recorded this incident of my lecture in Chicago, it is"
peculiarly fitting and pleasant to be able to give the following
extract from the review of the first edition of this book printed in the
_Chicago Times_. No great daily paper would have dared to print such a
comment a few years ago. To-day it is stated as a matter quite beyond
controversy:
"""She takes considerable pains to show _what one would think"
"need scarcely be insisted upon in our day_, that the morals of"
"civilization--morals in general, indeed--are not at all based in or"
"dependent upon religion, certainly not on Christianity, since the"
"so-called 'golden rule' the highest principle of morality, antedates"
"Christianity a thousand years."""
ADDRESS TO THE CLERGY AND OTHERS.
Up to the present time I have tried to reply personally to each one
"who has favored me with a letter of thanks, criticism, or praise of the"
"little book, ""Men, Women, and Gods, and Other Lectures,"" just published,"
Equally strong in fascination and vigour is “The Splendid Idle
"Forties,” but as far removed from “The Conqueror” as were the"
Eastern and Western seaboards of this country in the times of
"which the stories treat, “the long, drowsy, shimmering days"
"before the Gringo came,” to the California of which she writes."
"“Pointed, spirited, and Spanish” are these “rich and impressive”"
stories; “such as could hardly have been told in any other
country since the Bagdad of the ‘Thousand and One Nights.’ The
"book is full of weird fascination, and will add to Mrs."
"Atherton’s deservedly high reputation,” says _The Athenæum_."
“In this book even more than in her others is shown that
imaginative brilliancy so striking as to set one
wondering what is the secret of the effect. . . . For
"the rest, her charm lies in temperament, magnetic,"
"restless, assertive, vivid.”—_Washington Times._"
In close relation to “The Conqueror” stands Mrs. Atherton’s
"still more recent selection of “A Few of Hamilton’s Letters,”"
chosen from the great bulk of his state papers and other letters
in such a way as to bring to the average reader the means of
estimating the personality of this remarkable man from his own
words. Incidentally it is the surest refutation of some of the
"hasty criticisms upon the picture of him in “The Conqueror,”"
"where, as Mr. Le Gallienne justly observes, “it was reserved for"
Mrs. Atherton to make him really alive to the present
generation.”
[Sidenote: The Footprints of Christ in Stone.]
"About two miles northeast of the Three Fountains, and the same distance"
"from the city, on the Appian Way, stands the Church of St. Sebastian."
"Over an altar on the right, as you enter, the attendant priest, drawing"
"aside a curtain, shows you a slab of dark red stone with two enormous"
"footprints on it. These, we are told, were made by the feet of Christ"
"during an interview with Peter which took place near here, on the site"
of the small Church of Domine Quo Vadis. The story is as follows: After
"the burning of Rome, Nero charged the Christians with having fired"
"the city. Straightway the first persecution broke forth, and many of"
the Christians were put to death with dreadful torture. The survivors
"besought Peter not to expose his life. As he fled along the Appian Way,"
Christ appeared to him travelling towards the city. The fleeing apostle
"exclaimed in amazement, ""_Domine, quo vadis?_"" (Lord, whither goest"
"thou?), to which, with a look of mild sadness, the Saviour replied,"
"""_Venio iterum crucifigi_"" (I come to be crucified a second time), then"
"vanished, whereupon the apostle, ashamed of his weakness, returned to"
"Rome, and shortly afterwards was crucified there himself."
[Sidenote: The Chains of St. Peter.]
Another relic of great interest connected with the same apostle is
"shown in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, and indeed gives"
the church its name. The church is not without interest for other
"reasons. For instance, it possesses portions of the crosses of St."
"Peter and St. Andrew, and we are told that the high altar covers the"
remains of the seven Maccabean brothers. But the basilica is specially
famous for the possession of the greatest masterpiece of sculpture
"since the time of the Greeks--the majestic ""Moses"" of Michelangelo,"
which draws thousands of sightseers who might otherwise never set foot
"countrymen in South Africa, there stood up a man himself nurtured in"
"luxury, to take up the burden of the disinherited. His wife too stood by"
"him, a lady of gentle birth. We all know who that man is--he is"
"Gandhi,--and what humiliations and suffering he went through. Do you"
think he suffered in vain and that his voice remained unheard? It was
"not so, for in the great vortex of passion for Justice, there were"
caught others--men like Polak and Andrews. Are they your countrymen? Not
"in the narrow sense of the word but truly in a larger sense, that these"
who choose to bear and suffer belong to one clan the clan from which
Kshatriya Chivalry is recruited. The removal of suffering and of the
cause of suffering is the Dharma of the strong Kshatriya. The earth is
the wide and universal theatre of man's woeful pageant. The question is
who is to suffer more than his share. Is the burden to fall on the weak
or the strong? Is it to be under hopeless compulsion or of voluntary
acceptance?
DEFENCE OF HOMELAND
In your services for your country there is no higher at the present
moment than to ensure for her security and peace. We have so long
enjoyed the security of peace without being called upon to maintain it.
But this is no longer so.
At no time within the recent history of India has there been so quick a
readjustment and appreciation as regards proper understanding of the
aspiration of the Indian people. This has been due to what India has
been able to offer not merely in the regions of thought but also in the
fields of battle.
MASS RESPONSE
"courage, I think we should have stayed there till daylight, and been"
caught like birds limed on a bough.
"As it was, we plunged and strove for more than an hour in that place,"
"the dark sky above us, the quaking bog below, the women's weeping in"
"our ears. Then, at last, when I had almost given up hope, we struggled"
"out one by one upon the road, and stood panting and shaking,"
astonished to find solid ground under our feet. We had still two miles
"to walk, but on dry soil; and though at another time the task might"
"have seemed to the women full of adventure and arduous, it failed to"
frighten them after what we had gone through. Steve took Fraulein
"Anna, and I one of the women. My lady and the Waldgrave went hand in"
"hand; the one giving, I fancy, as much help as the other. For Marie,"
"her small, white face was a beacon of hope in the darkness. In the"
marsh she had never failed or fainted. On the road the tears came into
my eyes for pity and love and admiration.
"At length Steve bade us stand, and leaving us in the way, plunged into"
"the denser blackness of a thicket, which lay between it and the river."
"I heard him parting the branches before him, and stumbling and"
"swearing, until presently the sounds died away in the distance, and we"
remained shivering and waiting. What if the horses were gone? What if
they had strayed from the place where he had tethered them early in
"the day, or some one had found and removed them? The thought threw me"
into a cold sweat.
"Then I heard him coming back, and I caught the ring of iron hoofs. He"
"had them! I breathed again. In a moment he emerged, and behind him a"
string of shadows--five horses tied head and tail.
'Quick!' he muttered. He had been long enough alone to grow nervous.
"'We are two hours gone, and if they have not yet discovered him they"
"""And so on it goes,"" he said, ""indicating that at some devilish"
distance--I've forgotten the figure but we had the master computer chew
it out on the big machine at Radiation once--an additional kilowatt
just shoves the signal coverage distance out by a micron. But if you
"don't put in your honest kilowatt, you don't excite the infraspace that"
"carries infrawaves. And if you put in a kilowatt and a half, you have"
"to dissipate the half."""
"Wilson grunted. ""Nice to have things come out even. Who'd have thunk"
that the Creator wanted the Terran kilowatt to equal one quanta of
"infrawave distance?"""
"Allison laughed. ""Poor argument, Commodore Wilson. Actually, the figure"
"is point nine, eight three four plus. Close, but no cigar. We've"
"just come to accept the figure as a kilowatt, just as for everyday"
"calculation we accept the less refined figure of two point, one eight"
"parsecs, or even two point, two. At any rate--"""
"There was a puff of something, and a sound like the puncture of a tire."
The green speckles on the dome merged with one another and became
a riot of flaming green. There were shouts and cries and a lot of
haphazard orders and several techs scrambled to snap toggle switches.
Down the room one of the techs went head-first into a rack with a pair
of pliers and a soldering iron. He backed out carrying a smoking little
shapeless thing that had lost any character it once possessed. The tech
"picked up a nice, shiny new doodad from a small box and went into the"
rack again. When he came out this time he gave a hoarse cheer. Toggles
were snapped back and the spreckles reappeared.
"One of the techs came up to Allison and said, ""See that spot up there,"
"sir? The one just this side of the eighty-one degree longitude circle,"
And then he had gone his way to those who needed him more.
Mrs. Berry knelt by the bedside. Her hands were folded. She had been
"praying, but exhaustion had overcome her, and her quiet, peaceful"
breathing contrasted strangely with the other sounds that filled the
"bungalow. Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice sat huddled close together,"
listening. They could do nothing--not even help the wounded men who
"lay so close to them. Everything was in pitch darkness, and no lights"
"were allowed. They could not go out and help in the stern, relentless"
struggle that was going on about them. They bore the woman's harder
"lot of waiting, inactive, powerless, fighting the harder battle"
against uncertainty and all the horrors of the imagination.
"""I am sorry the regiment has come,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""There"
is no doubt they will be massacred with the rest of us. What are a few
"hundreds against thousands? It is a pity. They are such fine fellows."""
"Her rough, tired voice had a ring of unconquerable pride in it. She"
was thinking of the gallant charge her husband's men had made only two
"weeks before; how they had broken through the wall of the enemy, and,"
"cheering, had rushed to meet the besieged garrison. That had been a"
"moment of rejoicing, transitory and deceptive. Then the wall closed in"
"about them again, and they knew that they were trapped."
"""Perhaps we can hold out till help comes,"" Beatrice said."
She tried not to be indifferent. For the sake of her companions she
"would gladly have felt some desire for life, but in truth it had no"
value for her. She could think of nothing but the evil she had done
and of the atonement that had been denied her. It was to no purpose
that she worked unceasingly for the wounded. The sense of
"responsibility never left her. Each moan, each death-sigh brought the"
leaning right over his patient. I had been conscious of a powerful
"impulse to duck down, but I grasped the table and gave way to the"
impulse so far as to lean slightly forward. This compromise saved me
from any violent expression of fear. The Sister was the only one of us
who showed no sign of fear at all.
The surgeon went on with his work and extracted several fragments of
bone from the injured limb. A few seconds passed and suddenly the
electric light went out in accordance with the orders that decreed that
all lights should be extinguished on the approach of hostile aeroplanes.
The surgeon cursed loudly and the Sister fetched an electric torch which
"she held over the knee. The operation continued, but it was not long"
before anti-aircraft fire broke out once more. Then there was a weird
"bustling, rushing sound, followed by a roar that again shook the theatre"
and rattled the windows. Six explosions followed in rapid succession.
"This time the orderly controlled himself, for he knew the Sister was"
"watching. Nevertheless, his knees trembled violently. The Sister held"
the torch steadily and the surgeon paused for a moment and went on with
the operation as soon as all was quiet.
In a few minutes it was finished. The wound was dressed and bandaged and
the patient carried away.
I stepped out into the clear night. The sky was thronged with glittering
"stars. Everything seemed strangely peaceful. I walked round the station,"
"trying to find out where the bombs had fallen, but nobody knew. I went"
"to the marquee and found Private Trotter sitting there, breathless and"
white. The neighbouring C.C.S. a few hundred yards away had been hit. A
Sister and an orderly had been killed and several patients wounded.
"""It didn't 'alf put me wind up,"" said Trotter, excitedly. ""When the"
first'n drops I lays down flat on the duckboards and one bursts just

It will be realised from the scanty number of examples offered in
"this section that it is only a side issue, a mere suggestion of an"
"occasional alternative for the Story-hour, as likely to develop the"
imagination.
I think it is well to have a good number of stories illustrating the
importance of common sense and resourcefulness. For this reason I
consider that stories treating of the ultimate success of the youngest
"son are very admirable for the purpose, because the youngest child,"
"who begins by being considered inferior to the elder ones, triumphs in"
"the end, either from resourcefulness, or from common sense, or from"
"some high quality, such as kindness to animals, courage in overcoming"
"difficulties, etc.[27]"
Thus we have the story of Cinderella. The cynic might imagine that it
was the diminutive size of her foot that ensured her success: the child
"does not realise any advantage in this, but, though the matter need not"
"be pressed, the story leaves us with the impression that Cinderella had"
"been patient and industrious, forbearing with her sisters. We know that"
"she was strictly obedient to her godmother, and in order to be this"
she makes her dramatic exit from the ball which is the beginning of
her triumph. There are many who might say that these qualities do not
"modesty. ""When I heard how the enemy plotted and Dawson"
counter-plotted with all those skilled workmen in his detective
"service, it occurred to me that an enemy with imagination might"
counter-counterplot by getting men inside Dawson's defences. I
"couldn't see how one would work it, but if German agents, say, could"
"manage to become trusted servants of Dawson himself, they would have"
"the time of their lives. So far I was guessing at a possibility,"
however improbable it might seem. Then when Dawson told us that he had
sent Trehayne into the _Antigone_ and that he was the one factor
common to both vessels--the workmen and the maintenance part were all
different--I began to feel that my wild theory might have something in
"it. I didn't say anything to you, Cary, or to Dawson--he despises"
"theories. Afterwards Trehayne came in and I spoke to him, and he to"
"me, in French. He did not utter a dozen words altogether, but I was"
absolutely certain that his French had not been learned at an English
public school and during short trips on the Continent. I know too much
of English school French and of one's opportunities to learn upon
Continental trips. It took me three years of hard work to recover from
"the sort of French which I learned at school, and I am not well yet."
The French spoken by Trehayne was the French of the nursery. It was
"almost, if not quite, his mother tongue, just as his English was."
Trehayne's French accent did not fit into Trehayne's history as
retailed to us by Dawson. From that moment I plumped for Trehayne as
"the cutter of gun wires."""
"Dawson had been listening, though he showed no interest in my speech."
"When I had quite finished, and was basking in the respectful"
"admiration emanating from dear old Cary, he upset over me a bucket of"
very cold water.
"""Very pretty,"" said he. ""But answer one question. Why did I send"
"Trehayne to the _Antigone_?"""
"after the summer of 1915, she lived very much alone, except that she"
had the Adams children from Marylebone to spend the day with her
occasionally.
"Poor Mrs. Adams, though a valiant worker, was very downcast and"
unhappy. She confided to Mrs. Rossiter that although she dearly
"loved her Bert--""and a better husband I defy you to find""--he never"
"seemed all hers. ""Always so wrapped up in that Miss Warren or 'er"
"cousin the barrister."" And no sooner had war broken out than off he"
"was to France, as a kind of missionary, she believed--the Young"
"Men's Christian Something or other; ""though before the War he didn't"
"seem particular stuck on religion, and it was all she could do to"
get him sometimes to church on a Sunday morning. Oh yes: she got 'er
money all right; and she couldn't say too much of Mr. and Mrs.
"Rossiter's kindness. There was Bert, not doin' a stroke of work for"
"the Professor, and yet his pay going on all the same. Indeed she was"
"putting money by, because Bert was kep' out there, and all found."""
However his two pretty children were some consolation to Mrs.
"Rossiter, whom they considered as a very grand lady and one that was"
lavishly kind.
Mrs. Rossiter tried sometimes in 1915 having working parties in her
house or in the studio; and if she could attract workers gave them
such elaborate lunches and plethoric teas that very little work was
"done, especially as she herself loved a long, aimless gossip about"
the Royal Family or whether Lord Kitchener had ever _really_ been in
"love. Or she tried, since she was a poor worker herself--her only"
jersey and muffler were really finished by her maid--reading aloud
"to the knitters or stitchers, preferably from the works of Miss"
Charlotte Yonge or some similar novelist of a later date. But that
was found to be too disturbing to their sense of the ludicrous. For
burst into a roar of laughter. For the moment the _gamin_ in him was
uppermost--the same curly-pated rascal who had climbed walls and stolen
apples from the market-women's stalls of Tortosa thirty years ago.
"""You are a brave fellow,"" cried the general, ""and I would to Heaven that"
your royal cousin had more of your spirit. Are all of your company of
"the same warlike kidney?"""
"""I trust I am afraid of no man on the field of honour,"" answered the"
"loyal little Frenchman, throwing out his chest. ""Yet I speak but the"
truth when I aver that there is not one of my companions who could not
"say grace and eat me up afterwards!"""
Among the letters which had formed part of Rollo's credentials there was
"one superscribed ""_To be opened in the camp of General Cabrera_."""
"Cabrera now dismissed the firing party with a wave of his hand, the"
officer in command exchanging an encouraging nod with Rollo. Then he
summoned that young man to approach. Rollo threw away the last inch of
"his cigarette, and going up easily, saluted the general with his usual"
self-possession.
"""Well, colonel,"" said the latter, ""I little thought to exchange"
civilities with you again; but for that you have to thank this young
lady. The fortune of war once more! But if young men will entrust
"precious papers to pretty girls, they must have a fund of gratitude upon"
"which to draw--that is, when the ladies arrive in time. On this occasion"
it was most exactly done. Yet you must have lived through some very
"crowded moments while you faced the muzzles of yonder rifles!"""
And he pointed to the lane down which the firing party was defiling.
"in his gorgeous chariot, driving furiously along the road which led to"
St. Albans.
"His boon companions, thus left to their own devices, went over to the"
"spot where the strange thing had befallen at the race, and where the"
country folk had gathered with shakings of the head and questionings
"beneath their breath; and there, plain for all men to see, was the"
"yawning hole with the open trap hanging down, and the marks of the heavy"
"fall of the good horse, whose escape with whole bones was little short"
of a miracle.
"An old countryman was holding forth to a knot of eager questioners, now"
swelled by Lord Sandford’s friends.
"""I mind well when there was a house here; ’twas pulled down when I were"
a young chap.  And the well must ha’ bin hereabouts.  That old trap has
"been in the ground ever since I can mind; but there be no water now, and"
"the sand has pretty nigh silted it up.  I’ve a-looked in many a time,"
and the hole gets less and less deep.  When I saw them setting up the
"brushwood and things here, I made sure they had covered the trap well."
"I walked about it, but never saw sign of it.  If I’d a thought of"
"danger, I’d ha’ told one of the fine folks.  I suppose they never seed"
it.  The grass and stuff do grow long and rank this time o’ year.  And
"so the gentleman’s horse trod on it, and it gave way with him.  Mercy"
"me, but ’tis a wonder he didn’t break his neck then and there!"""
"Lord Sandford’s comrades looked each other in the eyes, and drew a"
little away.  All knew that something strange had passed upon him of
"late, and that there was some rupture betwixt him and the man who had"
but lately accused him of seeking to compass his death.
"""Did he know?""  ""Was it plot or plan of his?"" whispered one and another;"
dead friends to receive the blessing of the archbishop after the battle
of Roncevalles[35]; and of Napoleon sending the sailor back to England.
There is a moment in the story of Gunnar when he pauses in the midst of
"the slaughter of his enemies, and says, “I wonder if I am less brave"
"than others, because I kill men less willingly than they.”"
And in the “Njal's Burning” from Andrew Lang's “Book of Romance” we
"have the words of the boy Thord when his grandmother, Bergthora, urges"
him to go out of the burning house.
"“You promised me when I was little, grandmother, that I never should go"
from you till I wished it of myself. And I would rather die with you
than live after you.”
Here the moral courage is so splendidly shown; none of these heroes
"feared to die in battle or in open single fight, but to face a death by"
fire for higher considerations is a point of view worth presenting to
the child.
In spite of all the dramatic excitement roused by the conduct of our
"soldiers and sailors,[36] should we not try to offer also in our"
stories the romance and excitement of saving as well as _taking_ life?
I would have quite a collection dealing with the thrilling adventures
"of the Life-Boat and the Fire Brigade, of which I hope to present"
examples in the final Story List.
"Finally, we ought to include a certain number of stories dealing with"
"Death, especially with children who are of an age to realise that it"
"must come to all, and that this is not a calamity but a perfectly"
natural and simple thing. At present the child in the street invariably
connects death with sordid accidents. I think they should have stories
Propped against the circular walls were the first lieutenant and two
seamen. All the occupants of the conning-tower had been overcome by
the noxious fumes from the highly-charged projectile.
Gasping for fresh air Terence flung himself upon the steam-steering
gear and put the helm hard over. A glimpse through one of the slits
revealed the fact that the cruiser was answering to her helm. Yet so
"narrowly had a collision been averted that the ""Sunderland's"""
"starboard side was within twenty feet of the ""Bradford's"" port"
quarter as the two vessels swung apart.
"The guns were now silent, for with the destruction of the foremast"
the fire-control platform and its occupants had been swept out of
existence. The cruiser was temporarily out of action.
"Terence was beginning to feel dizzy and faint. Why, he knew not."
Perhaps it was the pungent fumes. Leaning over the mouthpiece of the
speaking tube he ordered a couple of quartermasters to be sent to the
conning-tower. He could hardly recognize the sound of his own voice.
It seemed miles away.
Again he looked ahead. The cruiser was still drawing further and
further out of range. Having satisfied himself on that score and that
there was no fresh danger of colliding with any of the rest of the
"fleet, he staggered into the open air and leaned heavily against the"
"outer wall of the conning-tower, He was barely conscious that the"
metal was still hot.
"Up came the quartermasters. At their heels was a sub-lieutenant, his"
face grimed with smoke and his uniform torn.
"""Take over, Garboard,"" ordered the lieutenant brokenly. ""Report to"

"Fiorsen's bedroom was--as the maid would remark--""a proper pigsty""--until"
he was out of it and it could be renovated each day.  He had a talent for
"disorder, so that the room looked as if three men instead of one had gone"
"to bed in it.  Clothes and shoes, brushes, water, tumblers,"
"breakfast-tray, newspapers, French novels, and cigarette-ends--none were"
ever where they should have been; and the stale fumes from the many
cigarettes he smoked before getting up incommoded anyone whose duty it
"was to take him tea and shaving-water.  When, on that first real summer"
"day, the maid had brought Rosek up to him, he had been lying a long time"
"on his back, dreamily watching the smoke from his cigarette and four"
flies waltzing in the sunlight that filtered through the green
"sun-blinds.  This hour, before he rose, was his creative moment, when he"
could best see the form of music and feel inspiration for its rendering.
"Of late, he had been stale and wretched, all that side of him dull; but"
"this morning he felt again the delicious stir of fancy, that vibrating,"
half-dreamy state when emotion seems so easily to find shape and the mind
"pierces through to new expression.  Hearing the maid's knock, and her"
"murmured: ""Count Rosek to see you, sir,"" he thought: 'What the devil does"
"he want?' A larger nature, drifting without control, in contact with a"
"smaller one, who knows his own mind exactly, will instinctively be"
"irritable, though he may fail to grasp what his friend is after."
"And pushing the cigarette-box toward Rosek, he turned away his head.  It"
"would be money he had come about, or--that girl!  That girl--he wished"
"she was dead!  Soft, clinging creature!  A baby! God!  What a fool he had"
"been--ah, what a fool!  Such absurdity! Unheard of!  First Gyp--then her!"
He had tried to shake the girl off.  As well try to shake off a burr!
"How she clung!  He had been patient--oh, yes--patient and kind, but how"
"83,648. If a foreign professor would not come and serve in India for the"
"same remuneration as he obtained in his own country, the witness would"
certainly not force him to come.
"83,649. (Mr. Abdur Rahim). Recruitment for the Educational Service"
"should be made in the first place in India, if suitable men were"
available; but if not then he would allow the best outsiders to be
brought in. In the present state of the country it would be very easy to
fill up many of the chairs by selecting the best men in India.
"83,650. The aim of the universities should be to promote two classes of"
"work--first, research; and secondly, an all-round sound education. Men"
of different types would be required for these two duties.
"83,651. (Mr. Madge). Any idea that the educational system of India was"
"so far inferior to that of England, that Indians, who had made their"
"mark, had done so, not because of the educational system of the country,"
"but in spite of it, was quite unfounded. The standard of education"
prevailing in India was quite up to the mark of several British
universities. It was as true of any other country in the world as of
"India that education was valued as a means for passing examinations, and"
"not only for itself, and there was no more cramming in India than"
elsewhere.
"83,652. The West certainly brought to the East a modern spirit, which"
"was very valuable, but it would be dearly purchased by the loss of an"
honorable career for competent Indians in their own country.
"83,653. The educational system in India had in the past been too"
"mechanical, but a turn for the better was now taking place and the"
"universities were recognising the importance of research work, and were"
ten of them.
"At last they met with a French vessel, a Martinico ship, of twelve guns,"
"and hunger drove them to attack even so big a ship as this, but the sight"
of the Black flag so terrified the French crew that they surrendered
"without firing a shot. After this, they took several vessels, and matters"
began to look much brighter. Phillips quickly developed into a most
"accomplished and bloody pirate, butchering his prisoners on very little or"
on no provocation whatever. But even this desperate pirate had an
"occasional ""qualm of conscience come athwart his stomach,"" for when he"
"captured a Newfoundland vessel and was about to scuttle her, he found out"
"that she was the property of a Mr. Minors of that island, from whom they"
"stole the original vessel in which they went a-pirating, so Phillips,"
"telling his companions ""We have done him enough injury already,"" ordered"
"the vessel to be repaired and returned to the owner. On another occasion,"
"they took a ship, the master of which was a ""Saint"" of New England, by"
"name Dependance Ellery, who gave them a pretty chase before being"
"overhauled, and so, as a punishment, the ""Saint"" was compelled to dance"
the deck until he fell down exhausted.
"This pirate's career ended with a mutiny of his unruly crew, Phillips"
being tripped up and then thrown overboard to drown off Newfoundland in
"April, 1724."
"During the nine months of Phillips's command as a pirate captain, he"
accounted for more than thirty ships.
"PHILLIPS, JOSEPH."

"with willows growing round it. In the field beyond, a cow was grazing"
peacefully. The sky seemed a deeper blue through the willow-branches.
The tender green of the grass was wonderfully refreshing to the eyes.
The cow had a beautiful coat of glossy brown that shone in the sunlight.
I abandoned myself to the charm of the little idyll that was spread out
before me and forgot the war once again.
"And then all at once a gigantic, plume-shaped, sepia coloured mass rose"
"towering out of the ground. There was a rending, deafening, double"
thunder-clap that seemed to split my head. For a moment I was dazed and
my ears sang. Then I looked up--the black mass was thinning and
collapsing. The cow had disappeared.
I walked into the yard full of rage and bitterness. All the men had left
the sheds and were flocking into the road. Some were strolling along in
"leisurely fashion, some were walking with hurried steps, some were"
"running, some were laughing and talking, some looked startled, some"
"looked anxious, and some were very pale."
"We crossed the road and the railway. Then, traversing several fields, we"
"came to a halt and waited. We waited for nearly an hour, but nothing"
happened and we gradually straggled back to the yard.
Some of us walked to the spot where the shell had burst. There was a
"huge hole, edged by a ring of heaped-up earth, and loose mould and"
grassy sods lay scattered all round. Here and there lay big lumps of
bleeding flesh. The cow had been blown to bits. The larger pieces had
"already been collected by the farmer, who had covered them with a"
tarpaulin sheet from which a hoof protruded.
"The next day, at about the same hour, the dark cloud again rose from the"
ground and the double explosion followed. We again abandoned the yard
"defined attributes--like the ""Putois"" of Anatole France. Dawson and"
"""Bailey""; they are both ""nice men"" and little Jane's friends; she is"
"sure of them, and I expect that she is right. Children always are"
right.
"Dawson, after his outburst, glowered at me for a moment and then"
"laughed. ""I am a man,"" said he, ""though you may not think it, and I"
have my weaknesses. But I never give way to them when they interfere
"with business. Menteith is in my grip, and he won't get out of it. But"
he is a poor creature. He handed over the description of the
"_Rampagious_, saw it hidden in the sardine tin, and was ordered to"
take the food parcel to the Post Office. The German agent who used him
had no notion of risking his own skin. Then followed the discovery and
the arrest of the draughtsman who had drawn the plan. Those who had
seduced Menteith forbade him to come near them. They slipped away into
hiding--which profited them little since all of them were on our
string--after threatening Menteith that he would be murdered if he
"gave himself up to the police, as in his terror he seemed to want to"
"do. When nothing happened for two weeks, the vermin came out of their"
"holes, made up the last parcel, and forced Menteith to go to Carlisle"
"in order to post it. All through he has been the most abject of tools,"
and received nothing except the four pounds and various small sums
"spent in drinks."""
"""You have the principal all right?"""
"""Yes, I have him tight. The others associated with him I shall leave"
free; they will be most useful in future. They don't know that we know
"them; when they do know, their number will go up, for they will be"
"then of no further use to us. It is a beautiful system, Mr. Copplestone,"
"and you have had the unusual privilege of seeing it at work."""
Then I reached my own hut of last winter where I had passed so many lonely
months. I did not enter it.
"Or rather, I did enter it, for I had to spend the night there. But I shall"
"skip this, so for the sake of brevity, I call it not entering. This"
"morning I wrote something playful about Madame, the mouse I left here last"
spring; but tonight I am taking it out again because I am no longer in the
"mood, and because there is no point in it. Perhaps it would have amused"
"you to read it, my friend; but there is no point in amusing you now. I"
must deject you now and make you listen to me; there is not much more to
hear.
"Am I moralizing? I am explaining. No, I am not moralizing; I am"
"explaining. If it is moralizing to see the truth and tell it to you, then"
I am moralizing. Can I help that? Intuitively I see into what is distant;
"you do not, for this is something you cannot learn from your little"
schoolbooks. Do not let this rouse your hatred for me. I shall be merry
"again with you later, when my strings are tuned to merriment. I have no"
power over them. Now they are tuned to a chorale....

"At dawn, in the bright moonlight, I leave the hut and push on quickly in"
order to reach the village as soon as possible. But I must have started
"too early or walked too fast, for at this rate I shall reach the village"
at high noon. What am I chasing after? Perhaps it is feeling the nearness
"of the sea that drives me forward. And as I stand on the last high ridge,"
"with the glitter and roar of the sea far beneath, a sweetness darts"
"through me like a greeting from another world. ""_Thalatta!_"" I cry;"
and I wipe my eyeglasses tremblingly. The roar from below is sleepless and
"fierce, a tone of jungle passion, a savage litany. I descend the ridge as"
though in a trance and reach the first house.
"""A lamentable display of manners, my dear.  I shall withdraw now and"
"compose a stiff note to him.  The amenities must be observed."""
"Looking as severe as a naturally jovial face would permit him, and"
"wondering a little if he had pronounced ""amenities"" right, he strode"
to the library.
The library was his Majesty's favourite apartment.  Here in the
"mornings he would discuss affairs of state with his Chancellor, or"
receive any distinguished visitors who were to come to his kingdom in
"search of adventure.  Here in the afternoon, with a copy of _What to"
"say to a Wizard_ or some such book taken at random from the shelves,"
he would give himself up to meditation.
And it was the distinguished visitors of the morning who gave him most
to think about in the afternoon.  There were at this moment no fewer
"than seven different Princes engaged upon seven different enterprises,"
"to whom, in the event of a successful conclusion, he had promised the"
hand of Hyacinth and half his kingdom.  No wonder he felt that she
needed the guiding hand of a mother.
The stiff note to Barodia was not destined to be written.  He was
"still hesitating between two different kinds of nib, when the door was"
flung open and the fateful name of the Countess Belvane was announced.
The Countess Belvane!  What can I say which will bring home to you
"that wonderful, terrible, fascinating woman? Mastered as she was by"
"overweening ambition, utterly unscrupulous in her methods of achieving"
"her purpose, none the less her adorable humanity betrayed itself in a"
passion for diary-keeping and a devotion to the simpler forms of
lyrical verse.  That she is the villain of the piece I know well; in
"the Field hospital three days, during which time he exhibited"
"no serious abdominal symptoms, but during the journey to Orange"
River (53-1/2 miles) he was sick. He remained at Orange River
"two days, and while there an enema was administered, producing"
a normal motion. The abdomen was slightly distended; it moved
"fairly, there was slight rigidity, but little tenderness."
"Temperature 100.8°, pulse 120. No appearance of fæces in wound."
When seen on the sixth day the condition was as
follows:--Patient cheerful and not in great pain. Temperature
"99.2°; pulse 120; respirations 48, very shallow. Abdomen soft,"
"moving freely, no distension or general tenderness. Fluid fæces"
escaping in abundance from the wound in loin. Redness of skin
"and swelling below level of wound, and cellular emphysema"
above. Fæcal-smelling fluid was also escaping from the thoracic
wound.
"The wound was enlarged, but the patient rapidly sank, and died"
of septicæmia on the seventh day.
(183*) An exactly similar case came under observation from the
"battle of Modder River, except that the opening in the loin was"
"somewhat larger, and earlier and freer escape of fæces took"
place from it. In this also fæcal matter passed freely into the
"left pleural cavity, and fæcal matter was expectorated, while"
there was an almost complete absence of abdominal symptoms.
Death occurred on the fourth day.
"No _post-mortem_ examination was made in either case, but I"
believe in both the extra-peritoneal aspect of the colon was
implicated and that the septicæmia was in great part due to
"absorption from the pleural rather than the peritoneal cavity,"
"the German occupation lasted, or during that time receive a penny in"
compensation for the sequestration of the property.
The notes for the hundred thousand francs therefore were carefully
concealed in Mrs. Warren's bedroom at the Hotel Impérial and Vivie
for a few months afterwards felt slightly easier in her mind as to
"the immediate future; for, as a further resource, there were also"
the jewels and plate at the bank.
"They dared hope for nothing from Villa Beau-séjour. Von Giesselin,"
"after more entreaty than Vivie cared to make, had allowed them with"
a special pass and his orderly as escort to go in a military motor
to the Villa in the month of April in order that they might bring
away the rest of their clothes and personal effects of an easily
transportable nature. But the visit was a heart-breaking
disappointment. Their reception was surly; the place was little else
than a barrack of disorderly soldiers and insolent officers. Any
search for clothes or books was a mockery. Nothing was to be found
in the chests of drawers that belonged to them; only stale food and
unnameable horrors or military equipment articles. The garden was
trampled out of recognition. There had been a beautiful vine in the
"greenhouse. It was still there, but the first foliage of spring hung"
"withered and russet coloured. The soldiers, grinning when Vivie"
"noticed this, pointed to the base of the far spreading branches. It"
"had been sawn through, and much of the glass of the greenhouse"
deliberately smashed.
"On their way back, Mrs. Warren, who was constantly in tears,"
descried waiting by the side of the road the widow of their
"farmer-neighbour, Madame Oudekens. She asked the orderly that they"
might stop and greet her. She approached. Mrs. Warren got out of the
car so that she might more privately talk to her in Flemish. Since
(153) The patient was wounded at Paardeberg at a range of from
"500 to 700 yards. _Entry_, just to the left of the episternal"
"notch; _exit_, in the fifth left interspace posteriorly, midway"
between the spine and vertebral margin of the scapula. A
"quantity of bright blood was brought up at once, and later"
blood was coughed up in clots.
There was no great pain at the moment of the injury; the man
"again got up to the firing line, and later walked two miles to"
"the Field hospital without aid. He remained here a week, when"
"he was sent down to the Base, and during the first three days'"
journey in the wagon he began to get worse. On the fourth day
cough began to be very troublesome.
"When he arrived at the Base, fifteen days after the original"
"injury, there was much dyspnoea; the temperature was 102°,"
and the pulse 110. The left side of the chest was dull
"throughout; an aspirating needle was introduced, and a pint of"
very dark liquid blood drawn off. The whole of the blood was
not removed on account of the very severe cough and pain which
the evacuation occasioned. The man appeared to steadily improve
"until three weeks later, when the temperature, which throughout"
"had been uneven, became consistently high, and signs of fluid"
"at the base increased. An aspirating needle was introduced, and"
16 ounces of pus were drawn off. Two days later a piece of rib
was resected (Mr. Pegg) and another pint of pus evacuated.
"After this, rapid improvement took place, and in ten days the"
"man was able to be up and dressed, although a small amount of"
discharge still persisted. He eventually made an excellent
recovery.
"Secondary empyemata not uncommonly followed incision of the chest, or"
Prussia. How he had loved England in the days when he was military
"attaché there. He had once wanted to marry an Englishwoman, a Miss"
"Fraser, a so handsome daughter of a Court Physician."
"""Why, that must have been Honoria, my former partner,"" said Vivie,"
finding an intense joy in this link of memory. And she told much of
"her history to the sentimental Colonel, who was conceiving for her a"
sincere friendship and camaraderie. They opened up other veins of
"memory, talked of Lady Feenix, of the musical parties at the Parrys,"
"of Emily Daymond's playing, of this, that and the other hostess, of"
such-and-such an actress or singer.
The Colonel of course was often absent all day on military duties.
He advised Vivie strongly on such occasions not to go far from Mrs.
"Warren's little domain. ""I am obliged to remind you, dear young"
"lady, that you and your mother are my prisoners in a sense. Many bad"
things are going on--things we cannot help in war--outside this
"quiet place..."""
"In November, however, there was a change of scene, which in many"
ways came to Vivie and her mother with a sense of great relief.
Colonel von Giesselin told them one morning he had been appointed
"Secretary to the German Governor of Brussels, and must reside in the"
town not far from the Rue de la Loi. He proposed that the ladies
should move into Brussels likewise; in fact he delicately insisted
on it. Their pleasant relations could thus continue--perhaps--who
"knows?--to the end of this War, ""to that peace which will make us"
"friends once more?"" It would in any case be most unsafe if, without"
"his protection, they continued to reside at this secluded farm, on"
"the edge of the great woods. In fact it could not be thought of, and"
another officer was coming here in his place with a considerable
suite. Eventually compensation would be paid to Mrs. Warren for any
"law, and indeed _called_ 'mares' in certain counties where genuine old"
"English law is still preserved.""--Borrow."
"3. ""Contempt for woman, _the result of clerical teaching_, is shown in"
"myriad forms.""--Gage."
"4. ""The legal subordination of one sex to another is wrong in itself,"
"_and is now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement_.""--John"
Stuart Mill.
"5. ""I have no relish for a community of goods resting on the doctrine,"
"that what is mine is yours, but what is yours is not mine; and I should"
"prefer to decline entering into such a compact with anyone, _though I"
"were myself_ the person to profit by it.""--Ibid."
It will take a long time for that sort of morality to filter into the
"skull of the Church, and when it does the skull will burst."
"6. ""Certain beliefs have been inculcated, certain crimes invented, in"
order to intimidate the masses. Hence the Church made free thought the
"worst of sins, and the spirit of inquiry the worst of blasphemies.... As"
late as the time of Bunyan the chief doctrine inculcated from the pulpit
was obedience to the temporal power.... All these influences fell with
"crushing weight on woman.""--_Matilda Joslyn Gage_ in ""Hist. Woman"
"Suffrage."""
"7. ""Taught that education for her was indelicate and irreligious, she"
"has been kept in such gross ignorance as to fall a prey to superstition,"
and to glory in her own degradation... Such was the prejudice against a
"liberal education for woman, that the first public examination of a girl"
in geometry (1829) created as bitter a storm of ridicule as has since
"assailed women who have entered the law, the pulpit, or the medical"
"which these occasioned"" (Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. v, ed. cited"
"of _Works_, vol. iv, p. 387). ""It was only tanners, dyers, and"
apostate priests who were Protestants at that day in the
"Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 124). The same conditions would have had"
"similar results in Spain, where many Catholics thought Philip much"
"too religious for his age and station (Motley, p. 76)."
It seems necessary to insist on the elementary fact that it was
Netherlanders who put Protestants to death in the Netherlands; and
that it was Spaniards who were burnt in Spain. In the Middle Ages
"""nowhere was the persecution of heretics more relentless than in"
"the Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 36; cp. p. 132). Grenvelle, most"
"zealous of heresy-hunters, was a Burgundian; Viglius, an even"
"bitterer persecutor, was a Frisian. The statement of Prescott"
"(_Philip II_, Kirk's ed. 1894, p. 149) that the Netherlanders"
"""claimed freedom of thought as their birthright"" is a gratuitous"
"absurdity. As regards, further, the old hallucination of ""race"
"types,"" it has to be noted that Charles, a devout Catholic and"
"persecutor, was emphatically _Teutonic_, according to the"
established canons. His stock was Burgundo-Austrian on the father's
side; his Spanish mother was of Teutonic descent; he had the fair
"hair, blue eyes, and hanging jaw and lip of the Teutonic Hapsburgs"
"(see Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, cap. 341), and so had his"
"descendants after him. On the other hand, William the Silent was"
"markedly ""Spanish"" in his physiognomy (Motley, p. 56), and his"
reticence would in all ages pass for a Spanish rather than a
"""Teutonic"" characteristic. Motley is reduced to such shifts of"
"rhetoric concerning Philip II as the proposition (p. 75) that ""the"
Burgundian and Austrian elements of his blood seemed to have
"evaporated."" But his descendant, Philip IV, as seen in the great"
"portraits of Velasquez, is, like him, a ""typical"" Teuton; and the"
"stock preserved the Teutonic physiological tendency to gluttony, a"
remembered then that before going out to look for rooms she had
transferred half the notes from their hiding-place to an inner
pocket. They were still there. But what about her luggage and her
"mother's, and the remainder of the money? In her distress she wrote"
to Gräfin von Stachelberg. Minna came over from her hospital at half
past six in the evening. By that time the doctor had given the
"necessary certificate of the cause of death, and an undertaker had"
come on the scene to make his preparations.
Minna went over to the Hotel Impérial with Vivie. Appearing in her
"Red Cross uniform, she was admitted, announced herself as the Gräfin"
"von Stachelberg, and demanded to know what justification the manager"
could offer for his extraordinary brutality towards these English
"ladies, the result of which had been the death of the elder lady."
The manager replied that inasmuch as the All Highest himself was to
"arrive that very evening to take up his abode at the Hotel Impérial,"
"the hotel premises had been requisitioned, etc., etc. He still"
refused absolutely to allow Vivie to proceed to her room and look
for her money. She might perhaps be allowed to do so when the
Emperor was gone. As to her luggage he would have it sent over to
"the tea-shop. (The money, it might be noted, she never recovered."
There were many things also missing from her mother's trunks and no
satisfaction was ever obtained.)
"So there was Vivie, one dismal, rainy November evening in 1915;"
"homeless, her mother lying dead in a room of this tea-shop, and in"
her own pocket only a matter of thirty thousand francs to provide
for her till the War was over. A thousand pounds in fluctuating
value was all that was left of a nominal twenty thousand of the year
before.
But the financial aspect of the case for the time being did not
"Morgan was essentially a man of action, and a regular life on shore proved"
"irksome to him, for we learn from a report sent home by Lord Vaughan in"
"1674 that Morgan ""frequented the taverns of Port Royal, drinking and"
"gambling in unseemly fashion,"" but nevertheless the Jamaican Assembly had"
voted the Lieutenant-Governor a sum of £600 special salary. In 1676
Vaughan brought definite charges against Morgan and another member of the
"Council, Robert Byndloss, of giving aid to certain Jamaica pirates."
"Morgan made a spirited defence and, no doubt largely owing to his"
"popularity, got off, and in 1678 was granted a commission to be a captain"
of a company of 100 men.
"The Governor to succeed Vaughan was Lord Carlisle, who seems to have liked"
"Morgan, in spite of his jovial ""goings on"" with his old buccaneer friends"
"in the taverns of Port Royal, and in some of his letters speaks of"
"Morgan's ""generous manner,"" and hints that whatever allowances are made to"
"him ""he will be a beggar."""
"In 1681 Sir Thomas Lynch was appointed to be Governor, and trouble at once"
began between him and his deputy. Amongst the charges the former brought
"against Morgan was one of his having been overheard to say, ""God damn the"
"Assembly!"" for which he was suspended from that body."
"In April, 1688, the King, at the urgent request of the Duke of Albemarle,"
"ordered Morgan to be reinstated in the Assembly, but Morgan did not live"
"long to enjoy his restored honours, for he died on August 25th, 1688."
"An extract from the journal of Captain Lawrence Wright, commander of"
"H.M.S. _Assistance_, dated August, 1688, describes the ceremonies held at"
"Port Royal at the burial of Morgan, and shows how important and popular a"
man he was thought to be. It runs:
"""It were better,"" she cried--""better that I had died yesterday than"
"suffer like this.  You rescued me from death only to torture me."""
Her words aroused within me a distinct suspicion that her strange
"illness had been brought to pass because, using some mysterious means,"
she had made an attempt against her own life.  I believed that she had
"suffered, and was still suffering, from the effects of some poison, the"
exact nature of which neither Deane nor Trepard could as yet determine.
"""I do not seek to torture you, dearest,"" I protested.  ""Far from it.  I"
"merely want to know the truth, in order that I may share your"
"unhappiness, as your betrothed ought to do."""
"""But you are not my betrothed."""
"""I was once."""
"""But not now.  You taunt me with breaking that promise which I made"
"three years ago, yet you yourself it was who played me false--who left"
"me for your prim, strait-laced English miss!"""
In an instant the truth was plain.  She was aware that I had transferred
my affections to Edith!  Someone had told her--no doubt with a good many
"embellishments, or perhaps some scandalous story.  In the salons through"
"which we of the diplomatic circle are compelled to move, women's tongues"
are ever at work match-making and mischief-making.  On the Continent
love and politics run always hand-in-hand.  That is the reason why the
"most notorious of the demi-monde in Paris, in Vienna, and in Berlin are"
the secret agents of their respective Governments; and many are the
honest men innocently denounced through jealousy and kindred causes.  A
false declaration of one or other of these unscrupulous spies has before
now caused the downfall of a Ministry or the disgrace of a noble and
"persisted until the fourth day, when the patient was brought"
"down to Orange River, and the signs were as follows."
"Considerable pain in left half of abdomen, pulse 110, fair"
"strength, temperature 101°. Some general distension of abdomen"
with complete disappearance of hepatic dulness. Some movement
"of right half of abdomen, left half immobile, dulness extending"
from the flank as far forwards as linea semilunaris. An
"incision was made in left linea semilunaris, and Oj blood"
evacuated from the left loin. There was no lymph on the
intestines nor sign of inflammation. No perforation was
"discovered in either stomach or intestine, but on two coils of"
"jejunum there were deep slits 3/4 inch long, extending through"
"both peritoneal and muscular coats. Beyond these wounds, on"
"other coils oval patches of ecchymosis, due to direct bruising,"
were present. The peritoneal cavity was sponged free of all
blood and irrigated with boiled water; no bleeding point was
"discovered, and the abdomen was closed."
The next morning the patient was comfortable; temperature
"100.2°, pulse 100. Tongue clean and moist; he vomited once"
during the night.
"Some bloody discharge had collected in the dressing, and at the"
"lower angle of wound there was a local swelling, apparently in"
the abdominal wall. The flank was resonant.
"During the afternoon the patient became faint, and when seen at"
"6 P.M. was in a state of collapse, in which he shortly died."
Death was apparently due to renewal of the previous hæmorrhage.
No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
"not born a princess! It goes to my heart to make her a prisoner!"""
The Sergeant uttered a guttural grunt which intimated that in his
opinion the influence of the petticoat on the career of a soldier might
"be over-done. Otherwise he maintained his gravity, speaking only when he"
was directly appealed to and giving his judgment with due submission to
his superiors.
Finally it was judged that they should make a night march over the
"mountains, find some suitable place to lie up in during the day, and in"
the morning send in La Giralda and the Sergeant to San Ildefonso in the
guise of fagot sellers to find out if the gipsy boy of Baza had spoken
the truth.

San Ildefonso and La Granja are two of the most strangely situated
places in Spain. A high and generally snow-clad Sierra divides them from
Madrid and the south. The palace is one of the most high-lying upon
"earth, having originally been one of the mountain granges of the monks"
"of Segovia to which a king of Spain took a fancy, and, what is more"
"remarkable, for which he was willing to pay good money."
"Upon the site a palace has been erected, a miniature Versailles,"
"infinitely more charming than the original, with walks, fountains,"
"waterfalls all fed by the cold snow water of the Guadarrama, and fanned"
by the pure airs of the mountains. This Grange has been for centuries a
"favourite resort of the Court of Spain, and specially during these last"
"years of the Regent Cristina, who, when tired with the precision and"
"etiquette of the Court of Madrid, retired hither that she might do as"
she pleased for at least two or three months of the year.
"full of rocks, but it is straight. It will lead us somewhere, not round"
and round and round again--it will take us somewhere. And there is a
"light,' they said, 'before us, the light of a star. It is very small"
"now, but it is always steady; it never flickers or wanes. It is the star"
of Truth. Under that star we shall find that which we seek.'
"And so they went upon their road, toiling upon the rocks, falling now"
"and then, bleeding with wounds from the sharp points, sore-footed, but"
strong-hearted. And ever as they went they were farther and farther from
"the forest, farther and farther from the glades and the flowers with"
deadly scents; they heard less and less the crack of the whip of Time
falling upon the wanderers' shoulders.
"The star grew nearer and nearer, the light grew greater and greater, the"
"false lights died behind them, until at last they came out of the"
"forest, and there they found the lake that washes away all desire under"
the sun of Truth.
They had won their way. Time and Life and Fight and Struggle were behind
"them, could not follow them, as they came, weary and footsore, into the"
Great Peace.
"And of those who were left behind, of those who stayed in the glades to"
"gather the deadly flowers, to be driven ever forward by the whip of"
Time--what of them? Surely they will learn. The kindly whip of Time is
behind: he will never let them rest in such a deadly forest; they must
"go ever forward; and as they go they grow more and more weary, the"
"glades are more and more distasteful, the heavy-scented blossoms more"
and more repulsive. They will find out the thorns too. At first they
"forgot the thorns in the flowers. 'The blossoms are beautiful,' they"
"said; 'what care we for the thorns? Nay, the thorns are good. It is a"
pleasure to fight with them. What would the forest be without its
"pronounced it to be first-class petrol. There were seven drums, each"
containing four gallons.
"""This means we'll motor, not walk into Robat after all, sir,"" said"
"Allan, with a grin and sigh of relief. The thought of those miles of"
desert--nearly two hundred of them--which confronted us after the
mishap had been haunting us both like a nightmare.
"At this moment the _chokidar_ returned, in great trepidation, fearing"
a dressing-down for being absent from duty. But I was far too elated
at the turn of events to want to swear at anyone.
"I asked him where the petrol had come from, and whose it was. He"
"shook his head, and said he had no idea. It had always been there. It"
"belonged to no one, and no one had put it there, so far as he knew."
"He had never seen a car there before; in fact, he had never seen a"
"car anywhere before, and could not understand how it was that men"
"could travel on a thing which was not alive, which was not like any"
horse or camel he had ever seen.
"This was all very good hearing, so I proceeded to tell him that the"
"petrol belonged to me, and, as he quite cheerfully acquiesced, I gave"
him a receipt which he could show to any Government official in case
of needed absolution in the future. As we now had means to finish our
"journey by car, I decided to spend the night at the rest-house."
"After a simple camp meal Allan, worn out with the strenuous work of"
"the past two days and night, was quickly snoring in the deep sleep of"
"exhaustion, so I went for a stroll."
As I paced up and down I tried to draw up some preliminary plan
"for the coming campaign. But such occupation was somewhat futile,"
one hand and a dart in the Heart with three drops of Blood proceeding from
"it in the other."" They took nine Portuguese vessels off the coast of"
"Brazil, out of which they took plunder of very great value."
"Quelch now had the audacity to sail back to Marblehead, where his crew"
landed and quickly scattered with their plunder. Within a week Quelch was
"in gaol, and was taken to Boston, where his trial began on June 17th,"
"1704, and he was found guilty. The days between the sentence and the"
"execution must have, indeed, been trying for the prisoner. We read in a"
"pamphlet published at the time: ""The Ministers of the Town used more than"
ordinary Endeavours to Instruct the Prisoners and bring them to
"Repentance. There were Sermons Preached in their hearing Every Day, and"
"Prayer daily made with them. And they were Catechised, and they had many"
occasional Exhortations. And nothing was left that could be done for their
"Good."""
"On Friday, June 30th, 1704, Quelch and his companions marched on foot"
through the town of Boston to Scarlil's Wharf with a strong armed guard of
"musketeers, accompanied by various officials and two ministers, while in"
"front was carried a silver oar, the emblem of a pirate's execution. Before"
the last act the minister gave a long and fervent harangue to the wretched
"culprits, in all of whom were observed suitable signs of repentance except"
"Quelch, who, stepping forward on the platform, his hat in his hand, and"
"bowing left and right to the spectators, gave a short address, in which he"
"warned them ""They should take care how they brought Money into New England"
"to be Hanged for it."""
"QUITTANCE, JOHN."
One of Captain Quelch's crew of the brigantine _Charles_. Tried with the
"rest of that crew at the Star Tavern at Boston in June, 1704."
"Superior sell her help. Keep the money, lads. If I am not a fool you"
will need it more than the sisterhood of the Holy Innocents before you
"come to your journey's end."""
"And with that she blew them each a dainty kiss, distinguishing no one"
"above the other, dropped a curtsey to the general, whose eyes followed"
"her with more than usual interest, leaped on her white mare and rode"
"off, attended by La Giralda riding astride like a man, in the same"
fashion in which she had arrived.
"So little Concha was gone from his sight, and duty loomed up suddenly"
gaunt and void of interest before Rollo. To risk his life was nothing.
"When he got nearer to the goal, his blood would rise, that he knew. To"
"capture a queen and a regent at one coup, to upset a government, to"
bring a desolating war to an end--these were all in the day's work. But
"why, in the name of all that was sanest and most practical, did his"
heart feel like lead within him and his new dignity turn to Dead Sea
ashes in his mouth?
"It was not long before Cabrera dropped back, that he might talk over"
ways and means with the young colonel. It was clear that the _guerrilla_
chieftain did not believe greatly in the project.
"""I do not understand all this,"" he said; ""it is not my way. What have we"
"to do with taking women and children prisoners? Let us have no truck,"
"barter, or exchange with the government at Madrid except at the point of"
"the bayonet. That is my way of it, and if my advice had been taken"
"before, my master would at this moment have been in the royal palace of"
his ancestors. But these secret embassies in the hands of
"foreigners--what good can come of them?"""
Rollo explained such things as the Abbot of Montblanch had made clear to
But he would not be persuaded. He said he was _dying_ to go out and see
the fun.
"At the word ""fun"" I felt a sudden and violent contraction of all my"
muscles. I had an almost irresistible impulse to stand up and strike him
across the face. But I was in a public restaurant and I controlled
myself. He did not seem to notice anything.
The conversation drifted away from the war and became commonplace. I
"tried to relate a few of my experiences, but somehow or other they"
seemed unsuited to the occasion.
"I had set out with the intention of destroying a mouldering, tottering"
"edifice built up of illusions and ignorant prejudices, and I found"
"myself face to face with towering, strong, unshakable walls, strong and"
"unshakable precisely because it was built of illusions, lies, and"
prejudices.
"I felt the burden of war descending upon me with all its crushing,"
annihilating weight. I fought a losing fight against the conviction
that for the rest of my leave I would be able to talk of nothing else
and think of nothing else but the war. If only I could talk to someone
"who would understand, that at least would bring relief!"
"I longed to see my two friends, although I felt some anxiety lest they"
"might have changed, or rather lest they might not have changed with me."
It was in the evening of my first day that we met. At first the one
embarrassed me a little by his apparent cold aloofness. But his caustic
observations on the war soon made it clear that he had stood the test. I
"realized, from the hatred that lay behind them, that he had suffered as"
much as many a soldier in the trenches.
"were hundreds of pounds owing, it seemed, and, in addition, much to Rosek"
himself.  The thought of these debts weighed unbearably on her.  Why did
"he, HOW did he get into debt like this?  What became of the money he"
"earned?  His fees, this summer, were good enough.  There was such a"
"feeling of degradation about debt.  It was, somehow, so underbred to owe"
"money to all sorts of people.  Was it on that girl, on other women, that"
he spent it all?  Or was it simply that his nature had holes in every
pocket?
"Watching Fiorsen closely, that spring and early summer, she was conscious"
"of a change, a sort of loosening, something in him had given way--as"
"when, in winding a watch, the key turns on and on, the ratchet being"
broken.  Yet he was certainly working hard--perhaps harder than ever.
"She would hear him, across the garden, going over and over a passage, as"
if he never would be satisfied. But his playing seemed to her to have
"lost its fire and sweep; to be stale, and as if disillusioned.  It was"
"all as though he had said to himself: ""What's the use?""  In his face,"
"too, there was a change.  She knew--she was certain that he was drinking"
secretly. Was it his failure with her?  Was it the girl?  Was it simply
heredity from a hard-drinking ancestry?
Gyp never faced these questions.  To face them would mean useless
"discussion, useless admission that she could not love him, useless"
"asseveration from him about the girl, which she would not believe,"
useless denials of all sorts.  Hopeless!
"He was very irritable, and seemed especially to resent her music lessons,"
alluding to them with a sort of sneering impatience.  She felt that he
"despised them as amateurish, and secretly resented it. He was often"
"impatient, too, of the time she gave to the baby.  His own conduct with"
the little creature was like all the rest of him. He would go to the
"nursery, much to Betty's alarm, and take up the baby; be charming with it"
"""It is hardly worth while to begin now,"" Beatrice observed, and this"
simple acknowledgment that the end was at hand received no
contradiction.
"Once again the silence was unbroken, save for the soft swish of the"
"fan and Mrs. Cary's heavy, irregular breathing. Yet the five women who"
in the full swing of their life had been diametrically opposed to one
"another were now united in a common sympathy. Death, far more than a"
"leveler of class, is the melting-pot into which are thrown all"
"antagonisms, all violent discords of character. The one great fact"
"overshadows everything, and the petty stumbling-blocks of daily life"
are forgotten. More than that still--it is the supreme moment in man's
existence when the innermost treasures or unsuspected hells are
"revealed beyond all denial. And in these five women, hidden in two"
"cases at least beneath a mass of meanness, selfishness and"
"indifference, there lay an unusual power of self-sacrifice and pity."
"Death was drawing near to them all, and their one thought was how to"
make his coming easier for the other. When the silence grew
"unbearable, it was Mrs. Carmichael who had the courage to break it"
with a trivial criticism respecting the manner in which Lois was
making the sandwiches.
"""You should put the butter on before you cut them,"" she said tartly,"
"""and as little as possible. I'm quite sure it has gone rancid, and"
"then George won't touch them. He is so fussy about the butter."""
Mrs. Berry looked up. The perspiration of physical fear stood on her
"cold forehead, but her roused will-power fought heroically and"
conquered.
"""And, please, would you mind making one or two without butter?"" she"
One evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red
"mansions, ringing their bells. At the twelfth he rested his lean"
hand-baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and
"forehead. The bell sounded faint and far away in some remote, hollow"
depths.
"To the door of this, the twelfth house whose bell he had rung, came a"
"housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome, surfeited worm that"
had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy
with edible lodgers.
He asked if there was a room to let.
"“Come in,” said the housekeeper. Her voice came from her throat; her"
"throat seemed lined with fur. “I have the third floor back, vacant"
since a week back. Should you wish to look at it?”
The young man followed her up the stairs. A faint light from no
particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls. They trod
noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn.
"It seemed to have become vegetable; to have degenerated in that rank,"
sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to
the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter. At
each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall. Perhaps plants
had once been set within them. If so they had died in that foul and
"tainted air. It may be that statues of the saints had stood there, but"
it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them
forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished
pit below.
"“This is the room,” said the housekeeper, from her furry throat. “It’s"
"soul, possessed him,--and the comprehension of Christ's Sacrifice was"
"no longer a mystery! Yet he was so certain that death, sudden and"
"speedy closely, awaited him that he seemed to feel it in the very"
"air,--not like a coming chill of dread, but like the soft approach of"
some holy seraph bringing benediction. It mattered little to him that
"he was actually in the very plenitude of health and strength,--that"
perhaps in all his life he had never felt such a keen delight in the
"physical perfection of his manhood as now,--death, without warning and"
"at a touch, could smite down the most vigorous, and to be so smitten,"
"he believed, was his imminent destiny. And while he lingered on the"
"bridge, fancy-perplexed between grief and joy, a small window opened in"
a quaint house that bent its bulging gables crookedly over the gleaming
"water, and a girl, holding a small lamp, looked out for a moment. Her"
"face, fresh and smiling, was fair to see against the background of"
"dense shadow,--the light she carried flashed like a star,--and leaning"
"down from the lattice she sang half-timidly, half mischievously, the"
"first two or three bars of the old song.. ""Du, du, liegst in mein"
"Herzen ... !"" ""Ah! Gute Nacht, Liebchen!"" said a man's voice below."
"""Gute Nacht! Schlafen sie wohl!"""
"A light laugh, and the window closed, ""Good-night! Sleep well!"" Love's"
"best wish!--and for some sad souls life's last hope,--a ""good-night and"
"sleep well!"" Poor tired World, for whose weary inhabitants oftentimes"
the greatest blessing is sleep! Good-night! sleep well! but the sleep
"implies waking.--waking to a morning of pleasure or sorrow,--or labor"
"that is only lightened by,--Love! Love!--love divine,--love"
"human,--and, sweetest love of all for us, as Christ has taught when"
both divine and human are mingled in one!
"Alwyn, glancing up at the clustering stars, hanging like pendent"
"fire-jewels above him, thought of this marvel-glory of Love,--this"
"perverse, sportsmen's brains tingled and thrilled; they had successfully"
"eluded all the resorts on the way, and arrived here without being caught."
"There was the Blue Peak, like a mast against the sky! They hurried up so"
fast that Solem was hardly able to keep pace with them. They would have
felt for ever disgraced if they had neglected to stand on this admirable
"site of a disaster, this most excellent abyss. Some said it would be a"
lifelong source of regret to them if they did not climb the Blue Peak
"forthwith; others had no desire but to gloat over the lawyer's death fall,"
"and to shout down the abyss, gaping at the echo, and advancing so far out"
on the ledge that they stood with their toes on death.
"But it's an ill wind that blows good to none, and the resort earned a"
"great deal of money. Paul began to revive again, and the furrows in his"
face were smoothed out. A man of worth grows strong and active with good
fortune; in adversity he is defiant. One who is not defiant in adversity
is worth nothing; let him be destroyed! Paul stopped drinking; he even
"began to take an interest in the harvesting, and worked in the field in"
Solem's place. If only he had begun when the weather was still slow and
patient!
But at least Paul began to tackle things in the right spirit again; he
only regretted that he had set aside for the cotters those outlying fields
from which they were used to getting half the hay; this year he would have
"liked to keep it himself. But he had given his word, and there was nothing"
to be done about it.
"Besides, it was raining now. Haymaking had to stop; they could not even"
"stack what had already been gathered. Outside, three cartloads of fodder"
were going to waste.

his shoulder.
"Boswell and Trent, each with a little missive burning his pocket, turned"
"red, fidgeted, glared at the ocean, and made no remark. Severance darted"
"a glance at each of the three in succession, and then looked at the"
ground with a contemplative stare. At this moment Mrs. Pendleton
appeared.
Three of the men advanced to meet her with an awkward attempt at
"surprise, but she waved them back."
"“I have something to say to you,” she said."
The cold languor of her face had given place to an expression of haughty
triumph. A gleam of conscious power lay deep in her scornful eyes. The
"final act in the drama had come, and the dénouement should be worthy of"
her talents. She looked like a judge who had smiled encouragement to a
guilty defendant only to confer the sentence of capital punishment at
last.
"“Gentlemen,” she said, and even her voice was judicatorial, “I have"
"asked you all to meet me here this morning”—(three angry starts, but"
she went on unmoved)—“because I came to the conclusion last night that
"it is quite time this farce should end. I am somewhat bored myself, and"
"I have no doubt you are so, as well. Your joke was a clever one, worthy"
of the idle days of autumn. When I received your four proposals by the
"same mail, I appreciated your wit—I will say more, your genius—and"
"felt glad to do anything I could to contribute to your amusement,"
especially as all the world is away and I knew how dull you must be. So
"I accepted each of you, as you know, had four charming interviews and"
one memorable one of a more composite nature; and now that we have all
agreed that the spicy and original little drama has run its length I
be a crucial node where he could attach the device he'd brought.
"It had taken some doing, but he'd managed to assemble an item that"
should take care of his problem beautifully when the moment came. It
"was a radio-controlled, electrically operated blade that, when clamped"
"onto a strand of wires, could sever them in an instant. The radio range"
"was fifty meters, which would be adequate; the transmitter, no larger"
"than a small tape recorder, was going to be with him in his flight"
suit. The instant he switched the turboramjets over to the scramjet
"mode, he was going to activate it and blow their fucking AI module out"
of the system. Permanently.
He figured he had ten minutes before one of the security team came
looking to see what he was doing; he'd timed this moment to coincide
with their regular tea break. Even the Japanese didn't work around the
clock.
"Now, holding the penlight and shivering from the cold, he began"
"carefully checking the wires. Carefully, so very carefully. He didn't"
"have a diagram of their computer linkages, and he had to make sure he"
"didn't accidentally interrupt the main power source, since the one"
thing he didn't want to do was disconnect any of the other flight
control systems. He wanted to cut in somewhere between the AI module's
power supply and its central processor. The power source led in here .
". . and then up the side over to there, a high-voltage transformer . ."
. and then out from . . .
There. Just after the step-up transformer and before the motherboard
with the dedicated CPU and I/O. That should avoid any shorting in the
main power system and keep the interruption nice and localized.
"The line was almost half an inch thick, double-stranded, copper"
"body into which we may be born. It is the first duty of a monk, of him"
"who is trying to lead the purer life, to kill all these affections, or"
rather to blend them into one great compassion to all the world alike.
"'Gayüna,' compassion, that is the only passion that will be left to"
us. So say the learned.
"I met a little girl not long ago, a wee little maiden about seven years"
"old, and she told me all about her former life when she was a man. Her"
"name was Maung Mon, she said, and she used to work the dolls in a"
travelling marionette show. It was through her knowledge and partiality
"for marionettes that it was first suspected, her parents told me, whom"
she had been in her former life. She could even as a sucking-child
manipulate the strings of a marionette-doll. But the actual discovery
"came when she was about four years old, and she recognised a certain"
"marionette booth and dolls as her own. She knew all about them, knew"
"the name of each doll, and even some of the words they used to say in"
"the plays. 'I was married four times,' she told me. 'Two wives died, one"
"I divorced; one was living when I died, and is living still. I loved her"
"very much indeed. The one I divorced was a dreadful woman. See,'"
"pointing to a scar on her shoulder, 'this was given me once in a"
quarrel. She took up a chopper and cut me like this. Then I divorced
her. She had a dreadful temper.'
It was immensely quaint to hear this little thing discoursing like this.
"The mark was a birth-mark, and I was assured that it corresponded"
exactly with one that had been given to the man by his wife in just such
a quarrel as the one the little girl described.
The divorced wife and the much-loved wife are still alive and not yet
old. The last wife wanted the little girl to go and live with her. I
asked her why she did not go.
"no Dryasdust. He was a living human being, troubled as we are troubled,"
"and interested in the things which interest us. He spoke to us, not"
"from the skies, but from among a crowd of his fellow human beings, and"
we feel that he was one of ourselves. As such it is good that a
memorial of him should be placed where it may easily be seen.

CHAPTER I
EARLY LIFE
"It may be a truism, but it is none the less a fact, that it is not"
always he of whom the world hears most who influences most deeply the
thought of the age in which he lives. The name of James Frederick
Ferrier is little heard of beyond the comparatively small circle of
philosophic thinkers who reverence his memory and do their best to keep
it green: to others it is a name of little import--one among a
multitude at a time when Scotland had many sons rising up to call her
"blessed, and not perhaps one of the most notable of these. And yet,"
could we but estimate the value of work accomplished in the higher
sphere of thought as we estimate it in the other regions of practical
"work--an impossibility, of course--we might be disposed to modify our"
"views, and accord our praises in very different quarters from those in"
which they are usually bestowed.
James Ferrier wrote no popular books; he came before the public
comparatively little; he made no effort to reconcile religion with
confinement of Sicily. Room--give me room--give me room for my spirit:
and you can have all the toppling crags of romance.
"So we ran on through the gold of the afternoon, across a wide, almost"
"Celtic landscape of hills, our little train winding and puffing away"
"very nimbly. Only the heath and scrub, breast-high, man-high, is too big"
"and brigand-like for a Celtic land. The horns of black, wild-looking"
cattle show sometimes.
"After a long pull, we come to a station after a stretch of loneliness."
"Each time, it looks as if there were nothing beyond--no more"
habitations. And each time we come to a station.
Most of the people have left the train. And as with men driving in a
"gig, who get down at every public-house, so the passengers usually"
alight for an airing at each station. Our old fat friend stands up and
"tucks his shirt-tail comfortably in his trousers, which trousers all the"
"time make one hold one's breath, for they seem at each very moment to be"
"just dropping right down: and he clambers out, followed by the long,"
brown stalk of a wife.
"So the train sits comfortably for five or ten minutes, in the way the"
"trains have. At last we hear whistles and horns, and our old fat friend"
running and clinging like a fat crab to the very end of the train as it
sets off. At the same instant a loud shriek and a bunch of shouts from
"outside. We all jump up. There, down the line, is the long brown stork"
"of a wife. She had just walked back to a house some hundred yards off,"
"for a few words, and has now seen the train moving."
"Now behold her with her hands thrown to heaven, and hear the wild shriek"
"""Madonna!"" through all the hubbub. But she picks up her two skirt-knees,"
and with her thin legs in grey stockings starts with a mad rush after
_Cock._ That shall be done anon.
"_Gammer._ Nay, tarry, Hodge, till thou hast light, and then we'll"
seek each one.
_Ralph Roister Doister_ and _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ mark the end of the
Interlude stage and the commencement of Comedy proper. Leaving the
"latter at this point for the present, we shall return in the next"
chapter to study its fortunes at the hands of Lyly.
*       *       *       *       *
"Morality Plays, though theoretically quite as suitable for tragic effect"
"as for comic, since the former only required that Mankind should"
"sometimes fail to reach heaven, seem nevertheless to have developed"
"mainly the lighter side, setting the hero right at the finish and in the"
"meantime discovering, to the relief of otherwise bored spectators, that"
"wickedness, in some unexplained way, was funny. As long as propriety"
forbade that good should be overcome by evil it is hard to see how
"tragedy could appear. Had Humankind, in _The Castell of Perseverance_,"
"been fought for in vain by the Virtues, or had Everyman found no"
"companion to go with him and intercede for him, there had been tragedy"
indeed. But religious optimism was against any conclusion so
"discouraging to repentance. The lingering Miracles, it is true, still"
presented the sublimest of all tragedies in the Fall of Man and the
"apparent triumph of the Pharisees over Jesus. Between them, however, and"
"the kind of drama that succeeded the Moralities, too great a gulf was"
"fixed. Contemporaries of those original spirits, Heywood and Udall,"
could hardly revert for inspiration to the discredited performances of
villages and of a few provincial towns. Tragedy had to wait until there
was matured and made popular an Interlude from which the conflict of
"Virtues and Vices, with the orthodox triumph of the former, had been"
"""If your Lordship means to say that I wish to withdraw dishonorably from"
"my engagement with your sister, I crave the privilege of telling you that"
"you lie!"""
"I never was more calm in my life, and my words brought a cold smile to"
Hamilton's lips.
"""My friend De Grammont will have the honor of waiting on you to-morrow"
"morning,"" he answered, bowing politely."
"""I shall be delighted to see his Grace,"" I answered. ""Good night, my"
"lord!"""
Here was a solution of my problem in so far as it concerned my engagement
"with Mary Hamilton, for if I killed her brother, she would not marry"
"me, and if he killed me, I could not marry her. The fact that a gleam"
of joy came to me because of my unexpected release caused me to feel
"that I was a coward not to have broken the engagement in an honorable,"
straightforward manner rather than to have seized this opportunity to
force a duel upon her brother. It is true I had not sought the duel
deliberately and had not thought it possible one second before uttering
the word that made it necessary. Still it was my act that brought it
"about, and I felt that I had taken an unmanly course."
After leaving Count Anthony I walked across the room to where Mary
was standing at the outer edge of a circle of ladies and gentlemen who
"surrounded De Grammont, listening to a narrative in broken English, of"
"his adventures, fancied or real, I know not which, but interesting,"
and all of a questionable character.
"When I spoke to Mary, she turned and gave me her hand. I had not"
expected the least display of emotion on her part; therefore I was not
"tapering towards the end are made. The real Kula article, in which"
"the discs are much thinner, smaller in diameter and even in size from"
"one end of the necklace to the other, these were introduced into the"
"Kula at other points, and I shall speak about this subject in one"
"of the following chapters (Chapter XXI), where the other branches of"
the Kula are described.

"Now, having come to an end of this digression on kaloma, let us return"
"for another short while to our Sinaketan party, whom we have left"
on the Lagoon of Sanaroa. Having obtained a sufficient amount of the
"shells, they set sail, and re-visiting Tewara and Gumasila, stopping"
"perhaps for a night on one of the sandbanks of Pilolu, they arrive at"
last in their home Lagoon. But before rejoining their people in their
"villages, they stop for the last halt on Muwa. Here they make what is"
"called tanarere, a comparison and display of the valuables obtained"
"on this trip. From each canoe, a mat or two are spread on the sand"
"beach, and the men put their necklaces on the mat. Thus a long row of"
"valuables lies on the beach, and the members of the expedition walk"
"up and down, admire, and count them. The chiefs would, of course,"
"have always the greatest haul, more especially the one who has been"
the toli'uvalaku on that expedition.
"After this is over, they return to the village. Each canoe blows its"
"conch shell, a blast for each valuable that it contains. When a canoe"
"has obtained no vaygu'a at all, this means great shame and distress"
"for its members, and especially for the toliwaga. Such a canoe is"
"said to bisikureya, which means literally 'to keep a fast.'"
"eternal _à propos_. What he writes is never vague, never dark--it is"
always plausible. Everything seemingly flows of itself like a fountain.
"It always rings true as to tone, turn of phrase and accent. It has"
"almost the light harmony of Ariosto. And it is, like Ariosto, never"
"tragic, never truly heroic. It carries us away, indeed, but it is never"
itself truly enraptured.
The more artistic aspects of Erasmus's talent come out most
clearly--though they are everywhere in evidence--in those two
"recreations after more serious labour, the _Moriae Encomium_ and the"
_Colloquia_. But just those two have been of enormous importance for his
influence upon his times. For while Jerome reached tens of readers and
"the New Testament hundreds, the _Moria_ and _Colloquies_ went out to"
thousands. And their importance is heightened in that Erasmus has
nowhere else expressed himself so spontaneously.
"In each of the Colloquies, even in the first purely formulary ones,"
"there is the sketch for a comedy, a novelette or a satire. There is"
"hardly a sentence without its 'point', an expression without a vivid"
fancy. There are unrivalled niceties. The abbot of the _Abbatis et
eruditae colloquium_ is a Molière character. It should be noticed how
"well Erasmus always sustains his characters and his scenes, because he"
_sees_ them. In 'The woman in childbed' he never forgets for a moment
"that Eutrapelus is an artist. At the end of 'The game of knucklebones',"
"when the interlocutors, after having elucidated the whole nomenclature"
"of the Latin game of knuckle-bones, are going to play themselves,"
"Carolus says: 'but shut the door first, lest the cook should see us"
playing like two boys'.
"As Holbein illustrated the _Moria_, we should wish to possess the"
"_Colloquia_ with illustrations by Brueghel, so closely allied is"
Erasmus's witty clear vision of incidents to that of this great master.
"""Why? How can I tell? You said it was to make sure that the shore"
"party were all off the ship."""
"""I said! What does it matter what I say! What I do matters a heap, but"
what I say--pouf! I sent Trehayne to the _Antigone_ to test him. I
"sent him expecting that he would try to cut her wires, and he did."
"Then when I was sure, though I had no evidence for a law court, I sent"
"him to the _Malplaquet_, and I set my trap there for him to walk into."
How did I guess? I don't guess; I watch. The more valuable a man is to
"me, the more I watch him, for he might be even more valuable to"
"somebody else. Trehayne was an excellent man, but he had not been with"
me a month before I was watching him as closely as any cat. I hadn't
been a Marine and served ashore and afloat without knowing a born
"gentleman when I see one, and knowing, too, the naval stamp. Trehayne"
was too much of a gentleman to have become a workman in the _Vernon_
and at Greenock without some very good reason. He said that he was an
"orphan--yes; he said his parents left him penniless, and he had to"
"earn his living the best way he could--yes. Quite good reasons, but"
"they didn't convince me. I was certain sure that somewhere, some time,"
Trehayne had been a naval officer. I had seen too many during my
service to make any mistake about that. So when I stood there waiting
"in that damned cold corner behind that bulkhead, it was for Trehayne"
that I was waiting. I meant to take him or to kill him. When he killed
"himself, I was glad. As I watched his eyes fade out, it was as if my"
own son was dying on his feet in front of me. But it was better so
"than to die in front of a firing party. For I--I loved him, and I"
"wished him 'Good-bye,'"""
"Dawson pitched his cigar into the fire, got up, and walked away to the"
far side of the room. I had never till that moment completely
"reverenced the penetrative, infallible judgment of Little Jane."
"odor, free from yeastiness and a fruity, agreeable, slightly spirituous"
"taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. The Pharmacopoeia (1890)"
"directs that the wine should contain from 7 to 12 per cent, by weight,"
"of absolute alcohol. California Hock and Reisling, Ohio Catawba, Sherry,"
"Muscatel, Madeira or the stronger wines of the Rhine, Mediterranean and"
Hungary come within the pharmacopoeial limits. Wines containing more
"than 14 per cent of alcohol are usually fortified, i. e., have alcohol"
"or brandy added to them, and much imported Sherry and Madeira contain 15"
"to 20 per cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol."
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
VINUM RUBRUM--RED WINE
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid made by fermenting the juice of fresh
"colored grapes, the fruit of Vitis vinifera, in presence of their"
skins.
"PROPERTIES.--A deep red liquid, having a pleasant odor, free from"
"yeastiness, and a fruity moderately astringent, pleasant and slightly"
"acidulous taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. Should contain"
"not less than 7 nor more than 12 per cent, by weight, of alcohol. Native"
"Claret, Burgundy, Bordeaux and Hungarian wines may be included within"
the pharmacopoeial limits of vinum rubrum. Port (vinum portense) is
"fortified with brandy during fermentation, and contains 15 to 25 per"
"cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol. Port is astringent from tannic"
"acid in the grapes, skin and stalks, or the astringency may be due to"
"logwood. Red wines are said to be rough, contain tannic acid and"
therefore are astringents. Dry wines are those which contain little
sugar. The wines develop ethers with age and these improve their flavor
and action.
Everybody understood what he hinted. Sir Robert did not care to depend
on the will of Coxon and his seceders.
"""And what about Coxon and Puttock?"" was the next question."
"""Haven't I been indiscreet enough?"""
"""Well, what are you going to do yourself?"""
"""My duty,"" answered Mr. Kilshaw, with a smile, and the throng, failing"
"to extract any more from him, did at last set about the task of getting"
home to bed in good earnest.
They could rest sooner than the man who occupied so much of their
interest. It had been a busy evening for the defeated Minister; he had
"colleagues to see, letters to write, messages to send, conferences to"
"hold. No doubt there was much to do, and yet Norburn, who watched him"
"closely, doubted whether he did not make work for himself, perhaps as a"
"means of distraction, perhaps as a device for postponing an interview"
"with his daughter. He had seen her for a minute when he came in, and"
told her he would tell her all there was to tell some time that night;
but the moment for it was slow in coming. Norburn had been struck with
"Daisy's composure. She had seen the _Evening Mail_, and, without"
"attempting to discuss the matter with him, she expressed her conviction"
that there could be nothing distressing behind the mysterious paragraph.
Norburn did not know what to say to her. He felt that in a case of this
"sort a girl's mind was a closed book to him. He had himself, on the way"
"back from the House, heard a brief account of the whole matter from the"
"Premier's lips; it seemed to him, in the light of his ideas and"
"theories, a matter of very little moment. He was of course aware how"
"widely the judgment of many would differ from his, and when his mind was"
"""You're such a big baby to've been such a big soldier! Don't you know"
"that romance is always just over the hill, hand in hand with"
adventure--both lonely for someone to play with? Wars can't kill them!
"It's after wars, when a nation is wounded, that they become priceless!"""
"""By George, that's right,"" Dad cried. ""Come to think of it, that's"
exactly right! And Gates has the same crew of six--men you've always
"known! Even that rascal, Pete, cooks better 'n ever! The _Whim_, you"
"can't deny, is the smartest ninety-six foot schooner yacht that sails! I"
say again that if I had the chance I'd turn her free on whatever magic
"course the wings of the wind would take her! That I would--by George!"""
And there was a note of deep appeal in the Mater's voice as she asked:
"""Why not get that boy you wrote so much about--Tommy what's-his-name,"
"the Southerner? I like him!"""
"This plan, which I now saw had been so carefully prepared--fruit of the"
secret conference--was but one in the million or so of others throughout
"America nurtured and matured by the brave army of fathers, mothers,"
"wives, sisters, daughters, who stayed at home and gave their all,"
"waiting with alternate hopes and fears, looking with prayerful eyes to"
the day that would bring a certain one back into their arms. What
difference if some plans were elaborate and some as modest as a flower?
Who would dare distinguish between the cruise on a private yacht and the
cake endearingly made in a hot little kitchen for the husky lad just
returned from overseas? Each was its own best expression of pride and
"love. Each said in its tenderest way: ""Well done, my own!"""
A lump came into my throat.
"""It's rather decent of a fellow to have two such corking forbears,"" I"
Across the void from her world to my own she was signaling--trying to
tell me what?--and frantically my fancy sprang to translate the message.
"But as the man, with growing agitation, had been watching narrowly"
throughout this--a condition of which I felt sure she must be acutely
aware--I dared not make the slightest sign. Yet she seemed to understand
"and, joining him, they passed out."
I pounced upon that crumpled ball of paper and was back in my chair
unfolding it with nervous fingers. Feverishly pressing out the creases I
"saw that it was, indeed, a corner torn from the winecard, and written"
upon it--nothing. Absolutely nothing!
"Perhaps I should have laughed, but as a matter of fact I cursed. Deep in"
"my soul I cursed. Her little joke, her pretty bit of acting, had left a"
stinging sense of loss. As suddenly as this ruthless comet swept into my
orbit it had swung out and on; for one delicious moment we had touched
"across the infinite, but now my harmony was shattered, the strings of my"
"harp were snapped, curled up, and could not be made to play again."
"But the Spanish girl was playing her guitar, once more singing her"
"impassioned song of the enchanted island in its sea of love, which made"
me pity myself so much that I permitted the waiter again to fill my
glass. What a wondrous adventure this night might have brought!
Such thoughts wore not to be profaned by the companionship of Tommy and
"Monsieur, so I slipped away, hailed a cab and alighted at the Machina"
"wharf. The boatman there, whom I aroused to take me out, was one of the"
"most stupid fellows I've ever encountered. At any rate, someone was"
stupid.
Going aboard the yacht I stood for a moment listening to the lonely
Thus far what we call civilization has dealt less harshly with the
Indians of the Isthmus than with our own. They have at least survived it
and kept a great part of their territory for their own. The “squaw-man”
who figures so largely in our own southwestern Indian country is unknown
there. Unquestionably during the feverish days of the Spaniards’ hunt
"for gold the tribes were frightfully thinned out, and even today"
sections of the country which writers of Balboa’s time describe as
thickly populated are desert and untenanted. Yet much land is still held
"by its aboriginal owners, and unless the operation of the Canal shall"
turn American settlement that way will continue so to be held. The
Panamanian has not the energy to dislodge the Indians nor to till their
lands if he should possess them.
"Many studies of the Panama Indians as a body, or of isolated tribes,"
"have been made by explorers or scientists, and mainly by French or"
Spanish students. The Smithsonian Institution catalogues forty-seven
publications dealing with the subject. But there is an immense mine of
anthropological information yet to be worked in the Isthmus. It is not
"to be acquired readily or without heavy expenditure of energy, patience"
and money. A thoroughly scientific exploring expedition to unravel the
"riddle of the Darien, to count and describe the Indian tribes of the"
"Isthmus, and to record and authenticate traditions dating back to the"
"Spanish days, would be well worth the while of a geographical society, a"
university or some patron of exploring enterprises.
CHAPTER XVII
SOCIAL LIFE ON THE CANAL ZONE
"state of defence as is possible, since the attack of the gipsies may be"
"expected at any moment!"""
"Rollo stepped to the window to summon his company, but found them"
already assembled on the balcony. It was no time for formal
"introductions, yet, as each entered, Rollo, like a true herald,"
delivered himself of a brief statement of the position of the individual
"in the company. But when La Giralda entered, the stout waiting-maid rose"
with a shriek from the floor where she had been sitting.
"""Oh, my lady,"" she cried, ""do not trust these wicked people. They have"
come to murder us all. That woman is the very old goatherdess with whom
the Princess Isabel was so bewitched this morning! I knew some evil
"would come of such ongoings!"""
"""Hush, Susana,"" said her mistress with severity; ""when you are asked for"
"any information, be ready to give it. Till then hold your peace."""
"Which having said she turned haughtily back again to the strangers,"
without vouchsafing a glance at her husband or the trembling handmaiden.
"""I can well believe,"" she said, ""that you have come here to do us a"
"service in our present temporary difficulty, and for that, if I find you"
"of approved fidelity, you shall not fail to be rewarded. Meantime, I"
"accept your service, and I place you and the whole of your men under the"
"immediate command of his Excellency the Duke of Rianzares!"""
She turned to the tall exquisite who still continued to comb his
whiskers by the chimney-piece. Up till now he had not spoken a word.
"Rollo scarcely knew what to reply to this, and as for the Sergeant, he"
had the hardest work to keep from bursting into a loud laugh.
"utmost danger, and that she must instantly come downstairs, open the"
"gate, and accompany them to the palace."
"""I knew it,"" quavered the old woman, ""I knew it since ever my husband"
went away with the soldiers and left me here alone. I shall be murdered
"among you, but my blood will be on his hands. Indeed, sirs, he hath"
"never treated me well, but spent his wages at the wine tavern, giving me"
"but a beggarly pittance. Nay, how do I know but he had an intent in thus"
"deserting me? He hath, and I can prove it, cast eyes of desire on Maria"
"of the pork-shop, only because she is younger and more comely than I,"
who had grown old and wrinkled bearing him children and cooking him
"_ollas_! Aye, and small thanks have I got for either. As indeed I have"
told him hundreds of times. Such a man! A pretty fellow to be head
porter at a Queen's gate! I declare I will inform her Royal Majesty this
"very night, if I am to go to the palace, that will I!"""
"""Come down immediately and let us in, my good woman,"" said the Sergeant,"
soothingly. For it appeared as if this torrent of accusation against the
absent might continue to flow for an indefinite period.
"""But how am I to know that you are not the very rogues and thieves of"

"""Well,"" said the Sergeant forbearingly, ""as to that you must trust us,"
"mother. It is the best you can do. But fear nothing, we will treat you"
"gently as a cat her kitten, and you will come up to the palace with us"
"to show us in what part of it dwell the Queen and her daughter."""
"""Nay, not if it be to do harm to my lady and the sweet little maid who"

insisted on signing the pirate articles and boasted that he was the first
"surgeon that had ever done so, and he hoped, he said, to prove as great a"
rogue as any of them.
"When the African Company's Guinea ship, the _King Solomon_, was taken,"
Scudamore came aboard and helped himself to their surgeon's instruments
"and medicines. He also took a fancy for a backgammon board, but only kept"
it after a violent quarrel with another pirate. It came out at his trial
"that on a voyage from the Island of St. Thomas, in a prize, the _Fortune_,"
"in which was a cargo of slaves, Scudamore had tried to bring about a"
"mutiny of the blacks to kill the prize crew which was on board, and he was"
"detected in the night going about amongst the negroes, talking to them in"
the Angolan language. He said that he knew enough about navigation to sail
"the ship himself, and he was heard to say that ""this were better than to"
"be taken to Cape Corso to be hanged and sun dried."""
The same witness told how he had approached the prisoner when he was
"trying to persuade a wounded pirate, one James Harris, to join him in his"
"scheme, but fearing to be overheard, Scudamore turned the conversation to"
horse-racing.
"Scudamore was condemned to death, but allowed three days' grace before"
"being hanged, which he spent in incessant prayers and reading of the"
"Scriptures. On the gallows he sang, solo, the Thirty-first Psalm. Died at"
the age of 35.

"We rowed in the foam and feathery jets of spray. ""She's rising fast!"""
"cried Eilert, rowing with all his might."
I felt so wretched that Eilert told me to ship my oars; he would manage by
"himself. But for all my wretchedness, I remembered that they could see me"
"from the shore, and I would not put down my oars. Eilert's wife might see"
me and laugh at me.
"What a revolting business, this seasickness that forced me to put my head"
"over the gunwale and make a pig of myself! I had a moment's relief, and"
then it began all over again. Charming! I felt as though I were in labor;
"the wrong way up, of course, through my throat, but it was a delivery"
"nonetheless. It moved up, then stopped, came on again and stopped, came on"
"and stopped once more. It was a lump of iron--iron, did I say? No, steel;"
I had never felt anything like it before; it was not something I was born
with. All my internal mechanism was stopped by it. Then I took a running
"start far down inside me and began, strangely, to howl with all my"
"strength; but a howl, however successful, cannot break down a lump of"
"steel. The pains continued. My mouth filled with bile. Soon, thank heaven,"
my chest would burst. O--oh--oh.... Then we rowed inside the islands that
"served as a breakwater, and I was saved."
"Quite suddenly I was well again, and began to play the clown, imitating my"
"own behavior in order to deceive the people ashore. And I assured Eilert,"
"too, that this was the first time I had ever been seasick, so that he"
"should understand it was nothing to gossip about. After all, he had not"
heard about the great seas I had sailed without the slightest discomfort;
"once I had been four-and-twenty days on the ocean, with most of the"
"passengers in bed, and even the captain sick in cascades; but not me!"
"""Yes, I get seasick sometimes, too,"" says Eilert."
"folly. I don't doubt that he honestly thought he was dealing with me."""
"""He will have to be punished. The Admiral will insist upon that."""
"""We must make the punishment as light as we can. You shall help me"
with all the discretionary authority with which you are equipped. I
"can see, Dawson, from the tactful skill with which you have dealt with"
me that discretion is among your most distinguished characteristics.
"If you had been a stupid, bull-headed policeman, you would have been"
"up against pretty serious trouble."""
"""That was quite my own view,"" replied Dawson drily."
"""Who is the man described by our erring draughtsman?"""
"""He won't say. We have put on every allowable method of pressure, and"
some that are not in ordinary times permitted. We have had over this
spy hunt business to shed most of our tender English regard for
"suspected persons, and to adopt the French system of fishing"
inquiries. In France the police try to make a man incriminate himself;
in England we try our hardest to prevent him. That may be very right
"and just in peace time against ordinary law breakers; but war is war,"
and spies are too dangerous to be treated tenderly. We have
"cross-examined the man, and bully-ragged him, but he won't give up the"
name of his accomplice. It may be a relation. One thing seems sure.

"The stars of European science, who had been shining in a wonderful"
"constellation over Quebec, were just about to leave Canada in that"
"well-known comfortable liner, the _Nipigon_, when a most annoying"
"thing happened.  The cattle-ship _Abbitibbe_, never famous at any"
"time for minding her helm, got her steam steering gear jammed as she"
"was passing the _Nipigon_, and took a wide sheer to port when she"
should have altered her course to starboard.  The peaceful
"preparations of the passenger boat were broken up, and her crew"
"received the wild charge of the _Abbitibbe_ with curses, which,"
"though effectual in heating the atmosphere, were no use as a fender."
"The _Nipigon_ was cut down to the water's edge, and the scientific"
lights of Europe were much put out.  They hurried ashore in the most
"irregular and unscientific manner, and, having sent others for their"
"baggage, began to make preparations for going to New York, as no"
other good passenger boat was leaving the St. Lawrence for a week.
"But Nature, possibly out of revenge for the unseemly curiosity"
"evinced by all men of science, was beforehand with them."

Prepared for us since Adam's fall.
I think there is no doubt that we have made considerable progress in
this matter. Not only do we refrain from telling these highly moral
"(_sic_) stories but we have reached the point of parodying them,"
"in sign of ridicule, as, for instance, in such writing as Belloc's"
"“Cautionary Tales.” These would be a trifle too grim for a timid child,"
but excellent fun for adults.
It should be our study to-day to prove to children that the immediate
"importance to them is not to think of dying and going to Heaven, but"
"of living and--shall we say?--going to College, which is a far better"
preparation for a life to come than the morbid dwelling upon the
possibility of an early death.
"In an article signed “Muriel Harris,” I think, from a copy of the"
"_Tribune_, appeared a delightful article on Sunday Books, from which I"
quote the following:
"“All very good little children died young in the story-books, so that"
unusual goodness must have been the source of considerable anxiety to
affectionate parents. I came across a little old book the other day
called ‘Examples for Youth.’ On the yellow fly-leaf was written in
"childish, carefully sloping hand: ‘Presented to Mary Palmer Junior, by"
"her sister, to be read on Sundays,’ and was dated 1828. The accounts"
"are taken from a work on _Piety Promoted_, and all of them begin with"
unusual piety in early youth and end with the death-bed of the little
"paragon, and his or her dying words.”"
IX.--_Stories containing a mixture of Fairy Tale and Science._ By this
"combination you lose what is essential to each, namely, the fantastic"
"loves. Death, he says, and life are one; not antagonistic, but the same;"
and the only way to escape from one is to escape from the other too.
"Only in the Great Peace, when we have found refuge from the passion and"
"tumult of life, shall we find the place where death cannot come. Life"
and death are one.
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, repeated over and over again to his"
"disciples when they sorrowed for the death of Thariputra, when they"
were in despair at the swift-approaching end of the great teacher
"himself. Hear what he says to Ananda, the beloved disciple, who is"
mourning over Thariputra.
"'Ananda,' he said, 'often and often have I sought to bring shelter to"
your soul from the misery caused by such grief as this. There are two
"things alone that can separate us from father and mother, from brother"
"and sister, from all those who are most cherished by us, and those two"
"things are distance and death. Think not that I, though the Buddha, have"
not felt all this even as any other of you; was I not alone when I was
seeking for wisdom in the wilderness?
'And yet what would I have gained by wailing and lamenting either for
myself or for others? Would it have brought to me any solace from my
loneliness? Would it have been any help to those whom I had left? There
"is nothing that can happen to us, however terrible, however miserable,"
that can justify tears and lamentations and make them aught but a
weakness.'
"And so, we are told, in this way the Buddha soothed the affliction of"
"Ananda, and filled his soul with consolation--the consolation of"
resignation.
"For there is no other consolation possible but this, resignation to the"
"""I did not express that opinion,"" he hastened to protest.  ""Before we"
discuss the matter further it will be best for me to see her.  Death may
"have been due to natural causes, for aught we know."""
I stood motionless.  His suggestion that my sweetheart of the old days
had committed suicide because I had forsaken her was a startling one.
Surely that could not be so?
"""Come,"" my friend said, ""let us lose no time.  Which is the room?"""
"I led him along the corridor, and opened the door of the chamber in"
which she was lying so cold and still.  The light of the afterglow fell
"full upon her, tipping her auburn hair with crimson and illuminating her"
face with a warm radiance that gave her back the appearance of life.
"But it was only for a few moments.  The slanting ray was lost, and the"
pallor of that beautiful countenance became marked against the gold of
her wondrous hair.
"In silence I stood at the foot of the bed watching my friend, who was"
now busy with his examination.  He opened her eyes and closed them
"again, felt her heart, raised her arms, and examined her mouth, uttering"
no word.  His serious face wore a look as though he were infinitely
puzzled.
One after the other he examined the palms of her hands long and
"carefully, then, bending until his eyes were close to her face, he"
"examined her lips, brow, and the whole surface of her cheeks.  Upon her"
"neck, below the left ear, was a mark to which he returned time after"
"time, as though not satisfied as to its cause.  Upon her lower lip, too,"
"was a slight yellow discoloration, which he examined several times,"
comparing it with the mark upon the neck.  He was unable to account for
"corrected by him and all those divines, whom he distrusted, would watch"
him at close quarters. But it was only to be for a few months. 'I have
"removed to Louvain', he writes to the Archbishop of Canterbury, 'till I"
"shall decide which residence is best suited to old age, which is already"
knocking at the gate importunately.'
"As it turned out, he was to spend four years (1517-21) at Louvain. His"
"life was now becoming more stationary, but because of outward"
circumstances rather than of inward quiet. He kept deliberating all
"those years whether he should go to England, Germany or France, hoping"
at last to find the brilliant position which he had always coveted and
never had been able or willing to grasp.
The years 1516-18 may be called the culmination of Erasmus's career.
Applauding crowds surrounded him more and more. The minds of men were
seemingly prepared for something great to happen and they looked to
"Erasmus as the man! At Brussels, he was continually bothered with visits"
"from Spaniards, Italians and Germans who wanted to boast of their"
"interviews with him. The Spaniards, with their verbose solemnity,"
particularly bored him. Most exuberant of all were the eulogies with
which the German humanists greeted him in their letters. This had begun
"already on his first journey to Basle in 1514. 'Great Rotterdamer',"
"'ornament of Germany', 'ornament of the world' were some of the simplest"
"effusions. Town councils waited upon him, presents of wine and public"
banquets were of common occurrence. No one expresses himself so
hyperbolically as the jurist Ulrich Zasius of Freiburg. 'I am pointed
"out in public', he asserts, 'as the man who has received a letter from"
"Erasmus.' 'Thrice greatest hero, you great Jove' is a moderate"
"apostrophe for him. 'The Swiss', Zwingli writes in 1516, 'account it a"
great glory to have seen Erasmus.' 'I know and I teach nothing but
"Erasmus now,' writes Wolfgang Capito. Ulrich von Hutten and Henry"
"Glareanus both imagine themselves placed beside Erasmus, as Alcibiades"
ranks of library editions that no one reads. These stiff and formal
"backs, these ornamental edges, these dandified and dyed airs, repel me"
from my ancient friendships. The intimacy of years is broken--frozen.
"They open no longer eagerly at the old accustomed places, stained"
"with frequent thumbings, where my own hand cut the dear intimate"
leaves--they are deckle-edged and bedamned and horrible which were wont
to be delightfully impertinent. I cannot find my way in the old garden
"that I loved--the old dog-ears are smoothed out, gone--my pencillings"
"erased, their whisperings mute, they nudge my elbow no more. These, my"
one-time boon companions snub me; give me but the flabby handshake of
"necessity. They open their houses to me mincingly, and yawn affected"
"utterance. They no longer tickle me in the ribs, touching me on the"
"sleeve, nor beckon; they do not chuckle familiarly--nor brood with"
me upon the roll and march of the great significancies. Their new
clothes are insistent--upon them as upon me. They smell of the oil of
respectability like gagged Sunday-school children. We know each other
no longer--except with formal bow and elaborate etiquette--as when a
royal person enters the room of entertainment and puts good-fellowship
to the rout.”
"He made a pause, and, passing his gaunt hand over his brow, he added"
sadly:
“I have come home to find myself in a strange land.... Shining-faced
respectability has usurped my chair.... My kingdom has slipped from
me.... The flowers in my garden are dead.”
Noll patted him on the back:
"“Tut, tut, man--you have come into a new kingdom.”"
He heard Julia’s voice upon the stair; and he saw that the other had
ghost-like.  I had wronged her; I felt confident that I had.  All came
"back to me now--that cruel, scandalous denunciation I had uttered in the"
heat of my mad jealousy--the false tale which had struck her dumb by its
"circumstantial accuracy.  Ah! how bitter it all was, now that punishment"
"was upon me!  I remembered how, in the hour of my worldly triumph and of"
her highest hope--at the very moment when she had spoken words of
greater affection to me than she had ever used before--I had made the
"charge against her, and she had fallen back with her young heart crushed"
"within her.  My ring was there, still glittering mockingly upon her dead"
hand.  By the unfounded charge I had made against her I had sinned.  My
"sin at that moment arose from its grave, and barred the way for ever to"
all hope--to all happiness.
"The summer twilight was stealing on apace, and in the silence of the"
room there sounded the roar of life from the boulevard below.  Men were
"crying _Le Soir_ with strident voices, and all Paris was on its way to"
"dine, and afterwards to enjoy itself in idleness upon the terraces of"
the cafes or at those al-fresco variety performances in the Avenue des
"Champs Elysees, where the entrance fee includes a consommation."
"Deane still held my old love's hand, bending in the dim light until his"
"eyes were close to it, watching intently.  But I took no notice, for my"
"eyes were fixed upon that face that had held me in such fascination, and"
had been so admired at those brilliant receptions given by King Leopold
"and the Countess of Flanders.  The doctor stretched forth his hand, and"
of a sudden switched on the electric light.  The next instant I was
startled by his loud ejaculation of surprise.
"""Thank God!"" he cried.  ""She's not dead, after all!"""
"""Not dead!""  I gasped, unable fully to realise his meaning."
"""I fancy,--I think,--we have met,--before! May I, . . dare I, . . ask"
"your name?"""
"Slowly she unclasped her gently folded hands; slowly, very slowly, she"
"lifted her bent head, and smiled at him! Oh, the lovely light upon her"
"face! Oh, the angel glory of those strange, sweet eyes!"
"""My name is EDRIS!""--she said, and as the pure bell-like tone of her"
"voice smote the air with its silvery sound, the mysterious music of the"
"organ and the invisible singers throbbed away,--away,--away,--into"
"softer and softer echoes, that died at last tremulously and with a"
"sigh, as of farewell, into the deepest silence."
"""EDRIS!""--In a trance of passionate awe and rapture he caught her"
"hand,--the warm, delicate hand that yielded to his strong clasp in"
"submissive tenderness,--pulsations of terror, pain, and wild joy, all"
"commingled, rushed through him,--with adoring, wistful gaze he scanned"
"every feature of that love-smiling countenance,--a countenance no"
"longer lustrous with Heaven's blinding glory, but only most maiden-like"
"and innocently fair,--dazzled, perplexed, and half afraid, he could not"
at once grasp the true comprehension of his ineffable delight! He had
no doubt of her identity--he knew her well! she was his own
"heartworshipped Angel,--but on what errand had she wandered out of"
"paradise? Had she come once more, as on the Field of Ardath, to comfort"
"him for a brief space with the beauty of her visible existence, or did"
she bring from Heaven the warrant for his death?
"""Edris!"" he said, as softly as one may murmur a prayer, ""Edris, my"
"life, my love! Speak to me again! make me sure that I am not dreaming!"
Tell me where I have failed in my sworn faith since we parted; teach me
how I must still further atone! Is this the hour appointed for my
"spirit's ransom?--has this dear and sacred hand I hold, brought me my"
"prospect at a certain house half a mile up the road where, as they had"
"ridden rapidly by, a couple of pretty girls had looked out curiously at"
the tossing Carlist _boinas_.
Rollo and El Sarria were carrying their scanty provend to a house where
"a decent-looking woman had agreed to cook it for them, when their gloomy"
reveries were interrupted by a sudden apparition which burst upon them
as they stood on the crest of a deep hollow.
"The limestone hills had been rent asunder at the place, and from the"
bare faces of the rocks the neighbouring farmers and villagers had
quarried and carried away such of the overhanging blocks as could easily
be trimmed to suit their purposes.
"Part of what remained had been shaped into a _hornito_, or stone oven,"
"under which a fire had been kindled, and a strange figure moved about,"
stirring the glowing charcoal with a long bar of iron. On a smaller
"hearth nearer at hand a second fire blazed, and the smell of fragrant"
cookery rose to the expectant and envious nostrils of the four.
"It was Sergeant Cardono, who moved about whistling softly, now attending"
"to the steaming _olla_, now watching the rising bread in the _hornito_."
"Perceiving Rollo, he saluted gravely and remarked, ""Dinner will be"
"served in half an hour."" The others, as before, he simply ignored. But"
in deference to his new commander he stopped whistling and moved about
with his lean shoulders squared as if on parade.
"When the bread and the skinny chicken were placed in his hands, he"
glanced at them with somewhat of superciliousness.
"""The bread will serve for crumbs,"" he said, and immediately began to"
seem that the Emperor's power is in danger rather than Luther and his
"adherents. 'If I had been present', writes Erasmus, 'I should have"
endeavoured that this tragedy would have been so tempered by moderate
arguments that it could not afterwards break out again to the still
greater detriment of the world.'
The imperial sentence was pronounced: within the Empire (as in the
Burgundian Netherlands before that time) Luther's books were to be
"burned, his adherents arrested and their goods confiscated, and Luther"
was to be given up to the authorities. Erasmus hopes that now relief
will follow. 'The Luther tragedy is at an end with us here; would it had
"never appeared on the stage.' In these days Albrecht Dürer, on hearing"
"the false news of Luther's death, wrote in the diary of his journey that"
"passionate exclamation: 'O Erasmus of Rotterdam, where will you be?"
"Hear, you knight of Christ, ride forth beside the Lord Christ, protect"
"the truth, obtain the martyr's crown. For you are but an old manikin. I"
"have heard you say that you have allowed yourself two more years, in"
"which you are still fit to do some work; spend them well, in behalf of"
"the Gospel and the true Christian faith.... O Erasmus, be on this side,"
that God may be proud of you.'
"It expresses confidence in Erasmus's power, but at bottom is the"
expectation that he will not do all this. Dürer had rightly understood
Erasmus.
"The struggle abated nowise, least of all at Louvain. Latomus, the most"
"dignified and able of Louvain divines, had now become one of the most"
"serious opponents of Luther and, in so doing, touched Erasmus, too,"
"indirectly. To Nicholas of Egmond, the Carmelite, another of Erasmus's"
"compatriots had been added as a violent antagonist, Vincent Dirks of"
"Haarlem, a Dominican. Erasmus addresses himself to the faculty, to"
"defend himself against the new attacks, and to explain why he has never"
For the Burman's life and belief is one great whole.
"I thought before I began to write, and I have become more and more"
"certain of it as I have taken up subject after subject, that to all the"
great differences of thought between them and us there is one key. And
"this key is that they believe the world is governed by eternal laws,"
"that have never changed, that will never change, that are founded on"
"absolute righteousness; while we believe in a personal God, altering"
"laws, and changing moralities according to His will."
"If I were to rewrite this book, I should do so from this standpoint of"
"eternal laws, making the book an illustration of the proposition."
"Perhaps it is better as it is, in that I have discovered the key at the"
end of my work instead of at the beginning. I did not write the book to
"prove the proposition, but in writing the book this truth has become"
apparent to me.
"The more I have written, the clearer has this teaching become to me,"
"until now I wonder that I did not understand long ago--nay, that it has"
not always been apparent to all men.
Surely it is the beginning of all wisdom.
"Not until we had discarded Atlas and substituted gravity, until we had"
"forgotten Enceladus and learned the laws of heat, until we had rejected"
"Thor and his hammer and searched after the laws of electricity, could"
science make any strides onward.
An irresponsible spirit playing with the world as his toy killed all
science.
And so it was that Johnson decided to pass the night in the Girl's
"canopied bed while she herself, rolled up in a blanket rug before the"
"fire, slept on the floor."
"""This beats a bed any time,"" remarked the Girl, spreading out the rug"
"smoothly; and then, reaching up for the old patchwork, silk quilt that"
"hung from the loft, she added: ""There's one thing--you don't have to"
"make it up in the mornin'."""
"""You're splendid, Girl!"" laughed Johnson. Presently, he saw her quietly"
"closet herself in the cupboard, only to emerge a few minutes later"
dressed for the night. Over her white cambric gown with its coarse lace
"trimming showing at the throat, she wore a red woollen blanket robe held"
"in at the waist by a heavy, twisted, red cord which, to the man who got"
"a glimpse of her as she crossed the room, made her prettier, even, than"
she had seemed at any time yet.
"Quietly, now, the Girl began to put her house in order. All the lights,"
"save the quaintly-shaded lamp that was suspended over the table, were"
"extinguished; that one, after many unsuccessful attempts, was turned"
down so as to give the right minimum of light which would not interfere
with her lover's sleep. Then she went over to the door to make sure that
it was bolted. Outside the wind howled and shrieked and moaned; but
inside the cabin it had never seemed more cosey and secure and peaceful
to her.
"""Now you can talk to me from your bunk an' I'll talk to you from mine,"""
"she said in a sleepy, lazy voice."
Except for a prodigious yawn which came from the Girl there was an
ominous quiet hanging over the place that chilled the man. Sudden sounds
"startled him, and he found it impossible to make any progress with his"
"together apart like old friends. John Mortimer and Etienne, who"
"generally had little to say to each other, conversed freely upon"
wine-growing and the possibility of introducing cotton-spinning into the
South of France. For Etienne was not destitute of a certain Gascon eye
to the main chance.
Rollo alone rode gloomily apart. He was turning over the terms of his
"commission in his mind, and the more he thought, the less was he"
satisfied. It was not alone the desperateness of the venture that
"daunted Rollo, but the difficulty of providing for the Queen-Regent and"
little princess when captured. There were a couple of hundred miles to
ride back to those northern fastnesses where they would be safe; for the
most part without cover and through country swarming with Nationals and
Cristino partisans.
"Riding thus in deep meditation, Rollo, whose gaze was usually so alert,"
did not observe away to the right a couple of horses ridden at speed and
rapidly overtaking their more tired beasts.
"El Sarria, however, did not fail to note them, but, fearing a belated"
"message of recall from General Cabrera, he did not communicate his"
"discovery to his companions, contenting himself with keeping his eye"
upon the approaching riders.
"Rollo was therefore still advancing, his reins flung loosely upon his"
"beast's neck and his whole attitude betokening a melancholy resignation,"
"a couple of lengths before his companions, when a sudden clattering of"
"hoofs startled him. He looked up, and there, on her white mare,"
"well-lathered at girth and bridle, was little Concha Cabezos, sitting"
her panting beast with the grace of the true Andaluse.
Her hair was a little ruffled by the wind. Her cheeks and lips were
It was time to give the almost overheated starboard guns a chance to
"cool, so orders were given for the helm to be starboarded. Seeing the"
"cruiser in the act of turning, a destroyer tore across her bows,"
purposely throwing out huge volumes of black smoke from her four
"funnels in order to mask the ""Sunderland"" as she circled."
"Terence recognized the destroyer as his old ship the ""Livingstone,"""
"as she darted swiftly round the turning cruiser, then, leaving a"
"thick pall of smoke in her wake, hastened off to assist another"
destroyer that was evidently in difficulties.
"The ""Livingstone's"" manoeuvre undoubtedly saved the ""Sunderland"" from"
"destruction, for a fifty-two centimetre shell, aimed to hit the exact"
position where the cruiser would have been had she not altered
"course, struck the water with a tremendous splash not fifty yards on"
her beam.
"Before the ""Sunderland"" had drawn clear of the friendly cloud of"
smoke she had increased her distance from shore by nearly five
"cables' lengths; while, until the German gunners had found the range"
"anew, she was able to enjoy a brief respite."
"""Seaplanes returning,"" announced the gunnery-lieutenant on the"
"fire-control platform, who from his elevated post could command a"
wide and almost uninterrupted view.
"Their task done, the seaplanes, which had been engaged in dropping"
"bombs on the railway stations in the rear of the German batteries,"
were on their homeward way. Anxiously Terence counted them. Thank
heaven! Not one was missing.
Apparently the last but one of the aerial procession was in
"He was never short of money, for he had a purse which was never empty."
"He never was short of food, for he had a table-cloth on which, as soon"
"as he spread it, he found all he wanted to eat and drink. And, besides,"
he had a magic wishing cap. When he put it on he could wish himself
"wherever he wanted, and there he would be that very moment."
"There was only one thing that he lacked: he had no wife, and he was"
gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to
make haste.
"As he was walking sadly along one fine day, it occurred to him to wish"
himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world. No
sooner had he thought of it than he was there. And it was a land which
"he had never yet seen, and a city in which he had never yet been. And"
"the king had a daughter, so handsome that he had never yet beheld her"
"like, and he wanted to have her on the spot. But she would have nothing"
"to do with him, and was very haughty."
"Finally he despaired altogether, and was so beside himself that he could"
no longer be where she was not. So he took his magic cap and wished
"himself into the castle. He wanted to say good-by, so he said. And she"
"laid her hand in his. ""I wish we were far beyond the end of the world!"""
"said the youth, and there they were. But the king's daughter wept, and"
begged to be allowed to go home again. He could have all the gold and
"silver in the castle in return. ""I have money enough for myself,"" said"
"the youth, and he shook his purse so that money just rolled about. He"
"could sit down at the royal table and eat the finest food, and drink the"
"finest wines, said she. ""I have enough to eat and drink myself,"" said"
"the youth. ""See, you can sit down at the table,"" said he, and at once he"
spread his table-cloth. And there stood a table covered with the best
one might wish; and the king himself ate no better.
and distended. No lymph. Two wounds were found in the ileum on
"the opposite sides of one coil; the openings were circular,"
with the mucous membrane everted. No escape of fæcal matter was
"visible until the intestine was delivered, when intestinal"
contents spurted freely across the room. The openings were
sutured with five Lembert's stitches. The bowel was punctured
"in two places to relieve distension, and then returned into the"
"belly, after washing with boiled water."
Four pints of saline solution were infused into the median
"basilic vein, and 1/30 grain strychnine sulph. was injected"
hypodermically.
"The patient did not rally, and died twelve hours after the"
operation.
"(167*) Wounded at Graspan. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford), midway"
"between the umbilicus and pubes; _exit_, 1 inch to the left of"
the fifth lumbar spine. The patient was seen on the third day
"in the following condition: in great pain, expression extremely"
"anxious, vomiting constantly. Pulse 150 running, respirations"
"48. Temperature 100°, sweating freely. Great distension,"
"rigidity, and general tenderness of immobile abdomen. No"
improvement followed the administration of brandy and
"hypodermic injection of strychnine 1/30 grain, and operation"
was deemed hopeless.
In the evening the patient was apparently dying. Face blue and
"sunken and covered with sweat, eyes dull, speechless, pulse"
"imperceptible, restlessness extreme, bowels acting"
"involuntarily, no urine in bladder."
"and may you not sell that which is your property? Are not these dogs,"
"the people, your slaves, your property? Yet you stand in cowardly fear"
of a rabble which quakes if you but crook your finger. A like fear of his
subjects cost your father his head. The people will crawl before you if
"you kick them, but let them see that you fear them, and you will learn"
"that there is no cruelty like that of the good people."""
"De Grammont, the French exile, called attention to the French king's"
"successful tyranny, declaring that his master would sell Paris if he"
chose. De Grammont was acting secretly in the French king's interest.
"A weak man easily finds logic to justify the course he desires to take,"
"so Charles turned a deaf ear to Clarendon, and, listening to Castlemain,"
"announced that Dunkirk was for sale. As expected, a strong protest came"
"from the people, but no one is so stubborn as a fool in the wrong, so"
Charles remained firm in his determination.
"Finding that protest would avail nothing, the people of London offered to"
"buy Dunkirk, and began to bid for it against the French king. Louis,"
"knowing that London was a rich city, and believing that its people would"
"run up the price of Dunkirk to an exorbitant figure, took counsel with"
himself--his only adviser--and determined to employ other means than gold
alone to obtain the coveted city.
My first definite knowledge of the French king's new plan to buy Dunkirk
"at his own price came in a letter from Hamilton, which reached me at"
Lilly's house two or three weeks after my return from Dover. Like the
"others, it was written in cipher, but, translated, was as follows:--"
DEAR FRIEND:
"""Your warning letter reached me nearly a week ago, and I thank you for"
"this, in his own words, he ""just lived!  And lived well too, Devil take"
"it, and like one who knew how!"""
"He was a tall, broad-shouldered man of fifty, with a rawlooking face,"
"swollen with drunkenness, and with a dirty yellowish beard. His eyes"
"were large and grey, with an insolent expression of happiness.  He"
"spoke in a bass voice and with a sort of grumbling sound in his throat,"
and he almost always held between his teeth a German china pipe with a
long bowl.  When he was angry the nostrils of his big crooked red nose
"swelled, and his lips trembled, exposing to view two rows of large and"
"wolf-like yellow teeth.  He had long arms, was lame, and always dressed"
"in an old officer's uniform, with a dirty, greasy cap with a red band,"
"a hat without a brim, and ragged felt boots which reached almost to his"
"knees.  In the morning, as a rule, he had a heavy drunken headache, and"
"in the evening he caroused.  However much he drank, he was never drunk,"
and so was always merry.
"In the evenings he received lodgers, sitting on his brickmade bench"
with his pipe in his mouth.
"""Whom have we here?"" he would ask the ragged and tattered object"
"approaching him, who had probably been chucked out of the town for"
"drunkenness, or perhaps for some other reason not quite so simple.  And"
"after the man had answered him, he would say, ""Let me see legal papers"
"in confirmation of your lies.""  And if there were such papers they were"
"shown.  The Captain would then put them in his bosom, seldom taking any"
"interest in them, and would say:"
"""Everything is in order.  Two kopecks for the night, ten kopecks for"
"the week, and thirty kopecks for the month.  Go and get a place for"
"yourself, and see that it is not other people's, or else they will blow"
"you up.  The people that live here are particular."""
Having resumed their respective stations the cruiser and the
destroyer flotilla followed. Owing to the greatly reduced speed of
the hostile aircraft it was an easy matter to maintain a fixed
"relative distance between them and the British vessels, whose"
attention was divided between the prospect of an aerial meeting with
seaplanes and the risk of being intercepted by the torpedo of a
"German submarine, to say nothing of floating mines."
"""She's cast off!"" shouted a dozen voices."
"Such was the case. The two Zeppelins had parted company, one flying"
"off at a terrific speed, rising rapidly as she did so, while the"
"other, being without means of propulsion, drifted at the mercy of the"
winds.
It was now dawn. The grey light of morning was already overcoming the
strength of the searchlights and it was already possible to discern
the outlines of the abandoned Zeppelin by the natural light of day.
Pelting up from the eastward came the air squadron of seaplanes. Half
"a dozen circled and started off in pursuit of the fugitive airship,"
"which, travelling at high speed, was now but a faint speck against"
the ruddy sky.
"The rest advanced boldly upon the disabled Zeppelin, although"
"ignorant of the fact that she had jettisoned her guns, and, save for"
"a few rifles, was without means of defence."
"The seaplanes' automatic guns spat viciously, and as the range"
decreased almost every shot began to tell. The huge fabric once more
"began to drop, as the small projectile ripped through the flimsy"
aluminium envelope.
chill horror of the unknown. Something had happened--that they felt.
Lois crept to the doorway and peered out into the gathering daylight.
"Here and there, half hidden behind the shelter of the trees, she could"
"see the khaki-clad figures of the Gurkhas, some kneeling, some"
"standing, their rifles raised to their dark faces, waiting like"
"statues for the enemy that never came. A dead, petrified world, the"
"only living thing the sunshine, which played in peaceful indifference"
upon the scene of an old and a new tragedy! Lois thought of her
mother. By the power of an overwrought imagination she looked back
through a quarter of a century to a day of which this present was a
strange and horrible repetition. For a moment she lived her mother's
"life, lived through the hours of torturing doubt and fear, and when a"
stifled cry called her back to the reality and forced her to turn from
"the sunlight to the dark room, it was as though the dead had risen, as"
though her dreams had taken substance. She saw pale faces staring at
her; she saw on the rusty truckle-bed a figure which rose up and held
"out frantic, desperate arms toward her. But it was no dream--no"
"phantom. Mrs. Cary, wild-eyed and distraught, struggled to rise to her"
feet and come toward her.
"""Where is Beatrice?"" she cried hysterically. ""Where is Beatrice? I"
"dreamed she was dead!--It isn't true! Say it isn't true!"""
Lois hurried back. In the confusion of their retreat she had lost
"sight of Beatrice, and now a cold fear froze her blood. She called her"
"name, adding her voice to the half-delirious mother's appeal; but"
"there was no answer, and as she prepared to leave the shelter of the"
"bungalow to go in search of the lost girl, a pair of strong hands"
grasped her by the shoulders and forced her back.
"""Lois, stand back! They are coming!"""
"too. Besides, Josephine has little to play and be cheerful for; things"
"have gone badly this year, and may grow worse as time goes on. The"
"prospect is not a good one. ""But something will turn up,"" says Josephine."
"She need not worry, for she has money in the bank, and no doubt there is a"
"young man in the offing, on the other side of the fjeld."
"Oh, yes, Josephine will always manage; she thinks of everything. The other"
"day, for instance--when Miss Torsen and her friend left. The friend could"
"not pay his bill, and all he said was that he had expected money, but it"
"hadn't come, and he couldn't stay any longer because of his private"
"affairs. That was all very well, but when would the bill be paid? Why, he"
"would send it from the town, of course; that was where he had his money!"
"""But how do we know we'll get the money?--from him, anyway,"" said"
"Josephine. ""We've had these actor-people here before. And I didn't like"
"the way he swanked about outside, thinking he was as good as anybody, and"
throwing his stick up in the air and catching it again. And then when Miss
"Torsen came in to say good-bye, I told her, and I wondered if she couldn't"
"let me have the money for him. Miss Torsen was shocked, and said, 'Hasn't"
"he paid himself?' 'No,' I said, 'he hasn't, and this year being such a bad"
"one, we need every penny.' So then Miss Torsen said of course we should"
"get the money; how much was it? And I told her, and she said she couldn't"
"pay for him now, but she would see the money was sent; we could trust her"
"for that. And I think we can, too. We'll get the money all right, if not"
"from him. I daresay she'll send it herself...."""
And Josephine went off to serve me my dinner.
"Paul is on his feet now, too. Not that his step is always very steady, but"
at least he puts his feet to the ground. But he takes no interest in
things; he does little more than feeding the horses and chopping some
wood. He ought to be clearing the manure out of the summer cow houses for
brother-in-law forbidden information from a loyal desire to help him
and with no knowledge of the base use to which it would be put. When
"detected, he had sought at any cost to shield him."
"""I will do my best to help you,"" I said."
"His head drooped down till it rested upon his bent arms, and he"
groaned and panted under the torture of tears. His was not the stuff
of which criminals are made.
"I found Dawson's chuckling joy rather repulsive. I felt that, being"
"successful, he might at least have had the decency to dissemble his"
satisfaction. He might also have given me some credit for the rapid
clearing up of the problem in detection. But he took the whole thing
"to himself, and gloated like a child over his own cleverness. I"
neither obtained from him thanks for my assistance nor apologies for
"his suspicions. It was Dawson, Dawson, all the time. Yet I found his"
egotism and unrelieved vanity extraordinarily interesting. As we sat
together in his room waiting for the Carlisle train to come in he
"discoursed freely to me of his triumphs in detection, his wide-spread"
"system of spying upon spies, his long delayed ""sport"" with some, and"
his ruthless rapid trapping of others. Men are never so interesting as
"when they talk shop, and as a talker of shop Dawson was sublime."
"""If,"" said Dawson, as the time approached for the closing scene, ""our"
much-wanted friend has himself handed in the parcel at Carlisle--he
"would be afraid to trust an accomplice--our job will be done. If not,"
I will pull a drag net through this place which will bring him up
within a day or two. What a fool the man is to think that he could
"escape the eye of Bill Dawson."""
"A policeman entered, laid a packet upon the table before us, and"
"himself into an armchair with another laugh, telling Grey he was sorry"
"his knaves of servants, who looked for perquisites everywhere, had let"
"in this flood of rogues upon him, but added that he must needs have the"
"wherewithal to cut a proper figure in London town, and forthwith set"
about the business of ordering an outfit for the young man which almost
took his guest’s breath away.
"""Poof!"" he cried, when the latter strove to remonstrate, ""you have"
plenty of money; and these rascals can wait if it suits your pleasure.
"Father’s memory!  Oh, be hanged to all such mawkish sentiment!  You need"
not think less of your father because you wear a blue coat in lieu of a
black! Rabbit me! but you are of a different world from this if you keep
"alive your father’s memory for six months after his decease!  No, no;"
you must cut a figure.  Sir Hugh’s name is clean forgot by now. I’ll eat
my boots if ’tis not so.  I’ll have you as gay as my fancy paints you.
"No black—no sables for the gentleman, I tell you.  Let us see those"
"other patterns.  Ah! here is something more like."""
"Grey submitted.  In sooth, he cared but little for the colour of his"
"clothes, or the set of his hat, or the cut of his coat.  He let Lord"
"Sandford have his way for the most part, only insisting here and there"
"upon soft and tender tints, and showing a predilection for white, which"
his friend quite approved.
"""You shall be a foil to me, not a rival.  I have learned that art from"
the ladies.  I like to blaze like old Sol in his strength; you shall
rather recall gentle Luna amid her galaxy of stars.  Faugh! One’s tongue
"gets into this silly trick of speech, so that one cannot drop it even"
betwixt man and man!  But you are right to think that white becomes you
"well.  You will look a pretty fellow, in all conscience, when you have"
"added a peruke to your other adornments."""
the lieutenant had appeared in his room with a revolver and had
threatened to shoot him unless he produced a suit of civilian
clothes. Thus coerced he had given him his eldest son's Sunday
clothes left behind when the said son went off to join the Belgian
"army. The lieutenant, grateful for the assistance, had given him as"
a present his watch and chain.
On the other hand the German non-commissioned officers insisted
their lieutenant had been made away with in the night. The farmer's
allegation that he had deserted (as in fact he had) only enhanced
his crime. The finding of the court after a very summary trial was
"""guilty,"" and despite the frantic appeals of the wife, reinforced"
"later on by Mrs. Warren, the farmer had been taken out and shot."
The evening meal consequently was one of strained relations. Colonel
von Giesselin came to supper punctually and was very spruce in
appearance. But he was gravely polite and uncommunicative. And after
dessert the two ladies asked permission to retire. They lay long
"awake afterwards, debating in whispers what terror might be in store"
for them. Mrs. Warren cried a good deal and lamented futilely her
"indolent languor of a few days previously. _Why_ had she not, while"
"there was yet time, cleared out of Brussels, gone to Holland, and"
"thence regained England with Vivie, and from England the south of"
"France? Vivie, more stoical, pointed out it was no use crying over"
"lost opportunities. Here they were, and they must sharpen their wits"
to get away at the first opportunity. Perhaps the American Consul
might help them?
"The next morning, however, their guest, who had insensibly turned"
"host, told Vivie the tram service to Brussels, like the train"
"service, was suspended indefinitely, and that he feared they must"
resign themselves to staying where they were. Under his protection
afford the surest highways and land abutting them brings higher prices.

"David, the largest interior town of Panama, is the central point of the"
"cattle industry. All around it are woods, or jungles, plentifully"
"interspersed with broad prairies, or llanos, covered with grass, and on"
which no trees grow save here and there a wild fig or a ceibo. Cattle
"graze on the llanos, sleek reddish beasts with spreading horns like our"
Texas cattle. There are no huge herds as on our western ranges. Droves
of from ten to twenty are about the average among the small owners who
rely on the public range for subsistence. The grass is not sufficiently
"nutritious to bring the cattle up to market form, so the small owners"
"sell to the owners of big ranches who maintain potreros, or fattening"
ground sown with better grasses. A range fed steer will fetch $15 to
"$18, and after six or eight months on the potrero it will bring $30 to"
$35 from the cattle shipper at David. Since the cost of feeding a beeve
"for that period is only about one dollar, and as the demand is fairly"
steady the profit of the ranchman is a good one. But like all other
"industries in Panama, this one is pursued in only a retail way. The"
market is great enough to enrich ranchmen who would go into the business
"on a large scale, but for some reason none do."
[Illustration: BOLIVAR PARK AT BOCAS DEL TORO]
Passing from llano to llano the road cuts through the forest which
"towers dense and impenetrable on either side, broken only here and"
there by small clearings made by some native with the indispensable
machete. These in the main are less than four acres. The average
"softly crooning in an unknown tongue over the poor dead babe, she"
"lovingly closed its eyes, and taking a sheet from a wall-press that"
"stood partially open, she began to enwrap the little girl in its crisp"
"white folds. The Spaniards are like the Scottish folk in this, that they"
have universally stores of the best and finest linen.
La Giralda was about to lay the wooden puppet aside as a thing of little
"worth, but something in the clutch of the small dead hands touched and"
troubled her. She altered her intention.
"""No, you shall not be parted!"" she said, ""and if there be a resurrection"
"as the priests prate of--why, you shall e'en wake with the doll in your"
"arms!"""
"So the pair, in death not divided, were wrapt up together, and the gipsy"
woman prepared to carry her light burden afield. But before doing so she
"went to the bed. It was an ancient woman who lay thereon, clutching the"
"bed-clothes, and drawn together with the last agony. La Giralda gazed at"
her a moment.
"""You I cannot carry--it is impossible,"" she muttered; ""you must take"
"your chance--even as I, if so be that the plague comes to me from this"
"innocent!"""
"Nevertheless, she cast another coverlet over the dead woman's face, and"
"went down the broad stairs of red brick, carrying her burden like a"
"precious thing. La Giralda might be no good Catholic, no fervent"
"Protestant, but I doubt not the First Martyr of the faith, the Preacher"
"of the Mount, would have admitted her to be a very fair Christian. On"
the whole I cannot think her chances in the life to come inferior to
"those of the astute Don Baltasar Varela, Prior of the Abbey of"
"Montblanch, or those of many a shining light of orthodoxy in a world"
"of horns, the shouting of commands."
The duke and Francesco had dismounted and were gazing up towards the
storm-swept ramparts. Shrieks and curses rolled down upon them like
the tumbling of a cascade.
"Then they began to scale the ledge, the path dwindling to a goat's"
highway.
Above them rose a sheer wall on which there appeared not clinging
space for a lizard. The abyss below was ready to welcome them to
perdition if their feet slipped.
"After a brief respite they continued, the duke's men scrambling up"
"behind them, looking like so many ants on the white chalk-cliffs. The"
"air was hot to suffocation; the storm roared, the thunder bellowed in"
"deafening echoes through the skies, and the heavens seemed one blazing"
"cataract of fire, reflected in the throbbing mirror of the sea."
"They had reached a seam in the rock, where they paused for a moment to"
let their brains rest. There was hardly room for the duke and
"Francesco on the ledge, so narrow was the rocky shelf, and the latter"
was pushing close against the wall when he was suddenly forced to look
"up. He heard the din of the encounter above. The Pisans, having"
"attacked the Frangipani from the south, were driving them out at the"
"north. Suddenly two bodies whizzed by him, thrust over the ramparts in"
the fierceness of the assault. Another came; he seemed to have jumped
"for life, for he kept feet foremost for a distance through the air,"
"before he began to whirl. These fell clear of the scaling party, and"
"were impaled on the broken tops of the stunted trees, that bossed the"
side of the precipice. One came so near the duke that his flight
downward almost blew him off his narrow perch. His head struck the
and found. I am now within five thousand yards of what appears to be
"Lifeship One."""
"The entire fleet went silent, except for the detector ship, the scout"
"craft, and Wilson's flagship."
"Allison asked, ""Was that our target, Logan?"""
the habits of a lifetime which keeps the mind clear and the nerve
"firm. Lois went on quietly preparing some sandwiches, which in all"
"probability would never be eaten, and Mrs. Carmichael resigned martial"
occupation for the cutting-out of a baby's pinafore for an East-end
child whom she had under her special patronage. But her mind was
"active and, stern, self-opinionated martinet that she was, she could"
not altogether crush the regrets that swarmed up in this last
reckoning up of her life's activity. Better had her charity and
interest been centered on the dirty little children whom she had
indignantly tolerated on her compound! Better for them all would it
have been had each one of them sought to win the love and respect of
"the subject race! Then, perhaps, they would not have been deserted in"
this last hour of peril.
Mrs. Carmichael glanced at Beatrice Cary with a fresh pricking of
"conscience. What, after all, had she done to deserve the chief"
condemnation? She had played with fire. Had they not all played with
"fire? She had looked upon a native as a toy fit to play with, to break"
"and throw away. Did they not all, behind their seeming tolerance and"
"Christian principles, hide an equal depreciation? Was she even as bad"
"as some? How many men revealed to their syces their darkest moods,"
their lowest passions? How many women were to their ayahs subjects for
"contemptuous Bazaar gossip. They were all to blame, and this was the"
"harvest, the punishment for the neglect of a heavy responsibility. The"
which had acted upon him like a charm.  It brought back to him the
"memory of his mother, and her noble dignity.  The look in her eyes"
"recalled those things that he had learned at her knee, and those"
aspirations after true greatness of life which she had cherished and
"fostered. Suddenly his present life looked to him utterly sordid, mean,"
"and unworthy; and in a burst of confidence, for which he could have"
"given no reason, he told her all his tale, encouraged by the soft and"
"earnest glances of her beautiful eyes, although she scarcely spoke a"
word from beginning to end.
And now she looked at him with a great compassion in her face.
"""Oh, it is sad, it is sad!"" she said in her earnest musical tones.  ""I"
know a little how sad it is.  I see it too.  But you are a man.  You are
"strong, you are your own master.  Why do you let yourself be made the"
"sport and plaything of fate?  Oh, do not do it! Rise to your calling as"
"a man, as a gentleman, as a Christian!  You can—I know you can!  I read"
it in your face!  What is Lord Sandford to you? The acquaintance of a
few weeks.  What are his comrades to you?  You know that in your heart
you despise them.  Then will you make yourself as one of them?  Will you
"sink to their level?  Oh no, no, no!  Break the fetters; they cannot be"
"fast riveted yet.  Break them, and stand a free man, and then see what"
"the world has to offer you."""
"She was gazing at him now, not shyly, not as a maiden archly coquetting"
"with a handsome young swain, but as a woman yearning to reclaim one"
"whose footsteps had well-nigh slipped in the mire, and whose whole soul"
was stirred by the effort.
"Grey listened like a man who dreams; and yet his eyes were on fire, and"
"his heart was kindled to a great flame—shame at his own weakness,"
yearnings after vanished memories and half-forgotten aspirations
"your aeroplanes, a rising against us in the Marolles quarter--"" said"
"very plainly what she thought of Edith Cavell's execution. ""It makes"
me think of Talleyrand--was it not?--who said 'It is a blunder;
"worse than a crime' ... these terrible old generals, they know"
"nothing of the world outside Germany."" As to her cousin, Gottlieb"
"von Giesselin--""Really dear, if in this time of horrors one _dare_"
"laugh at anything, I feel--oh it is too funny, but also, too"
"'schokking,' as we suppose all English women say. Yet of course I am"
"sad about him, because he is a good, kind man, and I know his wife"
"will be very very unhappy when she hears--And it means he will die,"
"for certain. He must risk his life to--to--regain his position, and"
"he will be shot before Verdun in one of those dreadful assaults."""
"Then she told Vivie where she might find rooms, where at any rate"
"she could use her name as a reference. Also: ""Stay away at present"
"and look after your mother. When she is quite comfortably settled,"
come back and work with me--here--it is at any rate the only way in
"which you can see and help your countrymen."""
One day in November when their notice at the hotel was nearly
"expired, Vivie proposed an expedition to her mother. They would walk"
slowly--because Mrs. Warren now got easily out of breath--up to the
Jardin Bontanique; Vivie would leave her there in the Palm House. It
was warm; it was little frequented; there were seats and the
Belgians in charge knew Mrs. Warren of old time. Vivie would then go
on along the inner Boulevards by tram and look at some rooms
recommended by Minna von Stachelberg in the Quartier St. Gilles.
Mrs. Warren did as she was told. Vivie left her seated in one of the
"long series of glass houses overlooking Brussels from a terrace,"
"wherein are assembled many glories of the tropics: palms, dracaenas,"
"yuccas, aloes, tree-ferns, cycads, screw-pines, and bananas:"
promising to be back in an hour's time.
"nonchalantly. ""And--we're in lots of time."""
"Mr. Jobling looked cross. ""Five minutes more would have lost you the"
"train,"" he remarked somewhat sourly. ""And where would Captain Dove and I"
"have been then!"""
"As it was, however, they found Captain Dove in his berth, sound asleep,"
"although still fully dressed. And, as Slyne ushered Sallie into the"
"double compartment reserved for her and Ambrizette, ""Don't go to bed"
"just yet,"" he begged. ""I want to show you something by and by. You'll"
"have lots of time for a long sleep before we arrive."""
"""All right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""I'll wait up till you come for me."""
"When he at length knocked at her door again, Mr. Jobling was still with"
her. She came out between them into the narrow corridor. Slyne rubbed
clear one steamy window to let her see the wintry landscape through
which they were travelling at express speed. And Sallie looked out
"delighted, at the sleeping English countryside as its broad grass-lands"
"and bare brown acres, coverts and coppices, hedgerows and lanes, with"
"here and there a grange or a group of cottages, all still and silent,"
"flashed into sight and so disappeared; until, overlooking them all from"
"a knoll on the near bank of a broad, winding river, there loomed up a"
"most magnificent mansion, embedded, in lordly seclusion, among many"
"gnarled and age-old oaks, with gardens terrace on terrace about it, tall"
"fountains among their empty flower-beds, a moss-grown sun-dial at the"
"edge of a quiet, silver lake."
"The moon was shining full on its innumerable windows, so that it seemed"
"to be lighted up from within, although, in reality, all were shuttered"
"and dark. Aloof and very stately it stood on that windless night, an"
"empty palace which came and went in a few moments, wing after wing, with"
"dogs, 2 to 5 ms.; amyl nitrite is very seldom given internally;"
"hypodermically, one-half this dose. By inhalation, same as given"
internally. It should be fresh as it rapidly deteriorates.
"ACTIONS.--It stimulates the heart’s action, greatly dilates the"
arterioles by paralyzing their muscular coats; causes a sense of
"fullness in the brain with vertigo, fall of blood pressure due to"
"dilation of the arterioles, lowering of temperature; when the vapor is"
applied direct to muscular or nerve tissues it suspends or completely
arrests its functional activity; it depresses the nervous system and
unstriped muscular fiber. Overdoses cause death by respiratory failure.
USES.--Epileptic attacks may be warded off by its being inhaled;
"spasmodic asthma, used either internally, hypodermically or best by"
"inhalation; in strychnine poisoning, angina pectoris in tetanus, and as"
a heart stimulant. It is useful as an inhalation in bringing about
recovery from deep chloroform and anesthesia.
ANISUM--ANISE
"ORIGIN.--The anise plant is a native of Egypt and the Levant, but has"
been introduced in various parts of that continent. It is also
cultivated occasionally in the gardens of this country. The fruit is
"abundantly produced in Malta and Spain; in Romagna, in Italy, whence it"
"is largely exported through Leghorn, and in Central and Southern Russia."
"DESCRIPTION.--Ovoid, laterally compressed, 4 to 5 m. m. long; carpels"
usually cohering and attached to a slender pedicel; grayish or
"Isthmus, and even a request from the chief that the war vessel that"
brought the negotiator on his fruitless errand should leave was acceded
"to. It is quite unlikely, however, that the Indians will be able to"
maintain their isolation much longer. Already there are signs of its
breaking down. While I was in Panama they sent a request that a
"missionary, a woman it is true, who had been much among them, should"
come and live with them permanently. They also expressed a desire that
"she should bring her melodeon, thus giving new illustration to the"
"poetic adage, “Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast”. Perhaps"
the phonograph may in time prove the open sesame to many savage bosoms.
Among this people it is the women who cling most tenaciously to the
"primitive customs, as might be expected, since they have been so"
assiduously guarded against the wiles of the world. But Catholic
"missionaries have made some headway in the country, and at Narganá"
schools for girls have been opened under auspices of the church. It is
probably due to the feminine influence that the San Blas men return so
unfailingly to primitive customs after the voyages that have made them
familiar with civilization. If the women yield to the desire for novelty
the splendid isolation of the San Blas will not long endure. Perhaps
"that would be unfortunate, for all other primitive peoples who have"
surrendered to the wiles of the white men have suffered and disappeared.

persons at all hazards.
Verily the whole situation was remarkably complex.
The briefest look around convinced Rollo that it would be impossible for
so small a party to hold the long range of iron palisades which
"surrounded the palace. These were complete, indeed, but their extent was"
far too great to afford any hope of keeping out the gipsies without
"finding themselves taken in the rear. They must hold La Granja itself,"
"that was clear. There remained, therefore, only the problem of finding"
entrance.
Between the porter's lodge and the great gates near the _Colegiata_ they
discovered a ladder left somewhat carelessly against a wall where
"whitewashing had been going on during the day, some ardent royal"
"tradesman having ventured back, preferring the chance of the plague to"
the abandonment of his contract.
"This they at once appropriated, and Rollo and the Sergeant, being the"
"two most agile of the company, prepared to mount."
"If the time had been less critical, and a disinterested observer had"
"been available, it would at this moment have been interesting to observe"
the demeanour of Concha. Feeling that in a manner she was present on
"sufferance, she could not of course make any objection to the plan of"
"escalade, nor could she offer to accompany Rollo and the Sergeant, but"
"with clasped hands and tightly compressed lips she stood beneath,"
repeating under her breath quick-succeeding prayers for the safety of
one (or both) of the adventurers.
So patent and eager was her anxiety even in the gloom of the night that
"La Giralda, to whom her agitation was manifest, laid her hand on the"
other work which might help their country in its need.
And Bertie Adams?
When he realized that his beloved and revered Miss Warren was shut
"off from escape in Belgium, could not be heard of, could not be got"
"at and rescued, he went nearly off his nut.... He reviewed during a"
succession of sleepless nights what course he might best pursue. His
age was about thirty-two. He might of course enlist in the army. But
"though very patriotic, his allegiance lay first at the feet of Vivie"
"Warren. If he entered the army, he might be sent anywhere but to the"
Belgian frontier; and even if he got near Belgium he could not dart
off to rescue Vivie without becoming a deserter. So he came speedily
"to the conclusion that the most promising career he could adopt,"
"having regard to his position in life and lack of resources, was to"
"volunteer for foreign service under the Y.M.C.A., and express the"
strongest possible wish to be employed as near Belgium as was
"practicable. So that by the end of September, 1914, Bertie was"
"serving out cocoa and biscuits, writing paper and cigarettes, hot"
coffee and sausages and cups of bovril to exhausted or resting
"soldiers in the huts of the Y.M.C.A., near Ypres. Alternating with"
"these services, he was, like other Y.M.C.A. men in the same district"
"and at the same time, acting as stretcher bearer to bring in the"
"wounded, as amateur chaplain with the dying, as amateur surgeon with"
"the wounded, as secretary to some distraught officer in high command"
whose clerks had all been killed; and in any other capacity if
called upon. But always with the stedfast hope and purpose that he
might somehow reach and rescue Vivie Warren.
three lobes into which its shell is divided longitudinally. There
"are also three cross divisions,--the head shield, the tail shield,"
"and between the two the thorax, consisting of a number of distinct"
and unconsolidated segments. The head shield carries a pair of
"large, crescentic, compound eyes, like those of the insect. The"
"eye varies greatly in the number of its lenses, ranging from"
fourteen in some species to fifteen thousand in others. Figure
"268, C, is a restoration of the trilobite, and shows the"
"appendages, which are found preserved only in the rarest cases."
During the long ages of the Cambrian the trilobite varied greatly.
"Again and again new species and genera appeared, while the older"
types became extinct. For this reason and because of their
"abundance, trilobites are used in the classification of the"
Cambrian system. The Lower Cambrian is characterized by the
presence of a trilobitic fauna in which the genus Olenellus is
"predominant. This, the OLENELLUS ZONE, is one of the most"
"important platforms in the entire geological series; for, the"
"world over, it marks the beginning of Paleozoic time, while all"
underlying strata are classified as pre-Cambrian. The Middle
"Cambrian is marked by the genus Paradoxides, and the Upper"
Cambrian by the genus Olenus. Some of the Cambrian trilobites were
"giants, measuring as much as two feet long, while others were the"
"smallest of their kind, a fraction of an inch in length."
Another type of crustacean which lived in the Cambrian and whose
order is still living is illustrated in Figure 269.

SYRIA.
The religions of Syria never had the same solidarity in the Occident as
those from Egypt or Asia Minor. From the coasts of Phoenicia and the
"valleys of Lebanon, from the borders of the Euphrates and the oases of the"
"desert, they came at various periods, like the successive waves of the"
"incoming tide, and existed side by side in the Roman world without uniting,"
in spite of their similarities. The isolation in which they remained and
the persistent adherence of their believers to their particular rites were
"a consequence and reflection of the disunited condition of Syria herself,"
where the different tribes and districts remained more distinct than
"anywhere else, even after they had been brought together under the"
domination of Rome. They doggedly preserved their local gods and Semitic
dialects.
It would be impossible to outline each one of these religions in detail at
"this time and to reconstruct their history, because our meager information"
"would not permit it, but we can indicate, in a general way, how they"
"penetrated into the Occidental countries at various periods, and we can try"
to define their common characteristics by showing what new elements the
Syrian paganism brought to the Romans.
"The first Semitic divinity to enter Italy was {104} _Atargatis_, frequently"
"mistaken for the Phoenician Astarte, who had a famous temple at Bambyce or"
"Hierapolis, not far from the Euphrates, and was worshiped with her husband,"
"pocket. He knew that Captain Dove was merely trying to aggravate him,"
and it would not have been politic to stray from the matter in hand. He
lighted a cigarette at his leisure and waited for what should come next.
He had changed his mind as to taking the old man fully into his
confidence. He thought he could see his way to get all he wanted for a
very great deal less than that might have cost him.
"""Want a drink?"" Captain Dove demanded, no doubt with the idea that a"
"dose of spirit might serve to stir up his visitor's temper, and looked"
"surprised at Slyne's curt head-shake, still more surprised over his"
response.
"""I can't afford to drink at all hours of the day and night now,"" said"
"Slyne austerely. ""That sort of thing was all very well at sea, but--The"
business I have in hand isn't of the sort that can be carried out on raw
"brandy. And you'll have to taper off too, if you want to come in."""
"""Strike--me--sky-blue!"" exclaimed the old man, and Slyne held up a"
reproving hand.
"""I can do with a good deal less of your bad language into the bargain,"""
"he mentioned coldly, ""if you don't mind. In short, I want you to"
understand from the start that you've got to behave as if you were a
"reasonable human being and not a dangerous lunatic, or--I'll leave you"
"to rot, in the hole you've got yourself into."""
"Captain Dove, scarcely able to credit the evidence of his own ears but,"
"none the less, apparently, thinking hard, darted a very ugly glance at"
"him, and noticed the diamonds in his shirt-front. Under the strongest"
temptation to call in a couple of deck-hands and have him thrown off the
"ship, Captain Dove obviously paused to consider whether those could be"
"of any intrinsic value. He was, of course, satisfied that he knew"
"Francesco smote one brute through with his spear, as it was feeding in"
the gutter on the carcass of a child. In the market square the
Provencals had made such another massacre as they had perpetrated in
Alba. The horrible obscenity of the scene struck the duke's men dumb
"as the dead. The towns-folk had been stripped, bound face to face,"
left slain in many a hideous and ribald pose. The vultures' beaks had
emulated the sword. The stench from the place was as the breath of a
"charnel house, and the duke and his men turned back with grim faces"
from the brutal silence of that ghastly town.
"Near one of the gates a wild, tattered figure darted out from a"
"half-wrecked house, stood blinking at them in the sun, then sped away,"
"screaming and whimpering at the sight of the duke, as though possessed"
"with a demon. It was a woman, still retaining the traces of her former"
"great beauty, gone mad, yet the only live thing they found in the"
town.
"The duke had reined in his steed at the sight, gone white to the roots"
"of his hair. Then he covered his face with his hands, and Francesco"
heard him utter a heart-rending moan.
"When his hands fell, after a lapse of time, he seemed to have aged"
years in this brief space.
"""Forward, my men,"" he shouted with iron mouth. ""The Frangipani shall"
"not complain of our swords!"""
They passed out of Ninfa through the opposite gate. At dark they
"reached the moors, and soon the entire host swept silently into the"
"ebony gloom of the great forests, which seemed sealed up against the"
moon and stars.
and flung into the corner. Articles of wearing apparel were scattered
"about, while over everything were sifted scraps of white paper in"
seemingly endless quantity. It was these torn scraps that roused Bob’s
"indignation. He seemed to know intuitively, without the evidence of the"
"limp, empty book covers here and there, that the foreman had taken time"
to tear into shreds every record and paper connected with the drive
"which he possessed. Time books, scalers’ measurements--everything--had"
been destroyed practically beyond the possibility of reconstruction.
There would be no accurate way now by which the firm could figure their
profits or costs or labor charges. The very paying of the drive crew
would be a matter of guesswork.
“Jove!” exclaimed Bainbridge through his clenched teeth. “I didn’t know
a man could be so rotten!”
"He stared at the wreck for a minute longer, and then turned over with"
"his foot the square, wooden box which lay upset in the middle of the"
mess. Apparently it had served Schaeffer as a receptacle for these same
"records. It was quite empty, but underneath lay something which brought"
"a thoughtful, questioning expression into the searcher’s face, and made"
him stoop to pick it up.
"“Thirty-eight caliber,” he murmured, staring at the freshly opened"
pasteboard box which had contained fifty cartridges. “Hum!”
"Presently he let it drop again. He did not move for a space, but stood"
"staring at the ground with that same odd, thoughtful pucker in his"
forehead.
"There was nothing surprising in the fact of Schaeffer’s being armed,"
Neither was it strange for a man in the riverman’s position to carry off
his ammunition loose instead of in the box. That was not the point. It
"“She does n't want anything at all,” said the matron, and the girl's"
eyelids fluttered. “She's being spoiled too much as it is already.”
"John bent his heavy brows on the woman. She spoke not shrewishly, not"
"unkindly, merely with lack of love and understanding. He repressed the"
bitter retort that rose to his lips. But at the same time a picture rose
"before him of another sick-room, a dainty sea-chamber open to sun"
"and sky, where pillows of down were not forbidden, where flowers and"
"exquisite colours and shapes gladdened the eye, where Love, great and"
"warm and fulfilling, hovered over the bed. No gulls with round, yellow"
eyes came to the windows of this whitewashed prison with messages
"from the world of air and sea; no Exquisite Auntship, no Great High"
"Favourite, no Lord High Constable, executed their high appointed"
functions; no clock with chimes like a bell swung in a sea-cave told
the hours to this orphan child of misery. He realized in an odd way
"that Stellamaris, too, was an orphan. And he remembered, from the awful"
"evidence, that this child was just over fifteen--Stella's age."
Again rose the picture of the cherished one in her daintily ribboned
"dressing-jacket, as filmy and unsubstantial as if made of sea-foam,"
"with her pure, happy face, her mysterious, brown pools of eyes, her"
hair lovingly brushed to caressing softness; and he looked down on Unity
"Blake. Man though he was, the bit of clean sail-cloth that did duty as a"
nightgown moved his compassion.
He did his best to talk with her awhile; but it was a one-sided
"conversation, as the child could reply only in monosyllables. The matron"
"fidgeted impatiently, and he said good-bye. Her wistful glance followed"
him to the door. Outside he turned.
“There is just one thing I want to say to her.”
He dismounted and left his steed on the bridge. The postern beckoned
"to him. He went in like a man nerved for peril, with sword drawn and"
"shield in readiness. Again he blew his horn. No living being answered,"
no voice broke the silence.
"The refectory was open, the door standing half ajar. Francesco thrust"
it full open with the point of his sword and looked in. A gray light
filtered through the narrow windows. The nuns lay huddled on benches
"and on the floor. Some lay fallen across the settles, others sat with"
their heads fallen forward upon the table; a few had crawled towards
the door and had died in the attempt to escape. The shadow of death
was over the whole.
Francesco's face was as gray as the faces of the dead. There was
"something here, a horror, a mystery, that hurled back the warm courage"
of the heart.
"With frantic despair he rushed from one body to the other, turning the"
"dead faces to the light, fearing every one must be that of his own"
"Ilaria. But Ilaria was not among them; the mystery grew deeper, grew"
"more unfathomable. For a moment, Francesco stood among the dead nuns"
"as if every nerve in his body had been suddenly paralyzed, when his"
"eyes fell upon a crystal chalice, half overturned on the floor. It"
contained the remnants of a clear fluid. He picked it up and held it
to his nostrils. It fell from his nerveless fingers upon the stone and
"broke into a thousand fragments, a thin stream creeping over the"
granite towards the fallen dead. It was a preparation of hemlock and
"bitter almonds. He stared aghast, afraid to move, afraid to call. The"
nuns had poisoned themselves.
"Like a madman he rushed out into the adjoining corridor, hither and"
"thither, in the frantic endeavor to find a trace of Ilaria. Yet not a"
"""I want to see Mr. Jobling, at once,"" Slyne announced to him. And Mr."
"Jobling's ""managing clerk"" looked slowly round, with a snake-like and"
disconcerting effect due to a very long neck and a very low collar.
"""Show Mr. Slyne in immediately, Mullins,"" ordered a pompous voice from"
"within; and Mr. Jobling himself, a blackcoated, portly, important"
"personage there, came bustling out from his private office to welcome"
his visitors.
"""How d'ye do, how d'ye do, Lady Josceline!"" he exclaimed, and cocked an"
arch eyebrow at Sallie's most becoming costume; although the effect he
intended was somewhat impaired by the fact that he was still suffering
"from a black eye, painted over in haste--and by an incompetent artist."
"""I can see now what's been keeping _you_ in Paris!"" he added"
"facetiously, and, having shaken hands with Slyne, who seemed to think"
"that superfluous, turned to receive Captain Dove with the same"
politeness.
"""Phew!"" whistled Mr. Jobling and drew back and stared at the old man."
"""I'd _never_ have recognised you in that rig-out."""
"Captain Dove pulled off a pair of smoked glasses he had been wearing,"
"the better to look him, with offensive intent, in his injured eye. For"
Captain Dove was still enduring much mental as well as physical
discomfort in a disguise which he had only been induced to adopt a
"couple of days before, and after an embittered quarrel with Slyne. The"
stiff white collar round his corded neck was still threatening to choke
him and then cut his throat. He had been infinitely more at his ease in
"his scanty, short-tailed frock-coat and furry top-hat than he was in the"
"somewhat baggy if more becoming black garb he had donned in its place,"
with a soft wide-awake always flapping about his ears.
one another during subsequent peace and quiet.
"Above all, he did not want Alice to emerge from this moment of personal"
danger morally bound to some unsuitable mate because of a child
conceived under the shadow of the sword!
"Hourly, after the coded signals came in, Ted Wilson took the microphone"
himself and called out into space in the infrawave. He called messages
"of hope, and explained how many spacecraft were scouring the deep black"
"void. He could only pray that he would be heard, that his voice would"
give Alice some firm foundation for hope.
He could not be sure the passengers from the wrecked spaceship even had
"their receivers turned on, because infrawave receivers drink up a lot"
of power and lifeships are not equipped with any vast reserve. There
just was not the room in a lifeship for anything more than the bare
necessities of living.
"The search grid was a truncated cone, and the whitened areas of"
finished search had finally filled the smaller end of the cone. There
"was the flared skirt of the cone yet to be combed, and this provided"
more volume than the cylinder taken out of the middle. It also provided
"a shorter search path as the searching spacecraft built out the volume,"
ring after ring around the first pass along the line of flight.
"Far, far to one side a detector registered, and brought every man"
in the fleet to the alert. Then they relaxed unhappily again as the
scooter returned with another report of a small gas cloud. Wilson

"clouds, and unawakened comets to make up a small sun."

Probably I enjoy the hayfield as much as you do; but I enjoy quite
"other scents and sensations as well, and I take the former for granted,"
"and write my poem, for a change, about the latter. There is no"
necessary difference in artistic value between a good poem about a
flower in the hedge and a good poem about the scent in a sachet. I am
always charmed to read beautiful poems about nature in the country.
"Only, personally, I prefer town to country; and in the town we have to"

"most factitious town landscape, I can only pity him, and go on my own"

THE SILURIAN
The narrowing of the seas and the emergence of the lands which
characterized the closing epoch of the Ordovician in eastern North
America continue into the succeeding period of the Silurian. New
species appear and many old species now become extinct.
THE APPALACHIAN REGION. Where the Silurian system is most fully
"developed, from New York southward along the Appalachian"
"Mountains, it comprises four series:"
"4 Salina  . . . shales, impure limestones, gypsum, salt"
3 Niagara . . . chiefly limestones
"2 Clinton . . . sandstones, shales, with some limestones"
"1 Medina  . . . conglomerates, sandstones"
The rocks of these series are shallow-water deposits and reach the
total thickness of some five thousand feet. Evidently they were
"laid over an area which was on the whole gradually subsiding,"
although with various gentle oscillations which are recorded in
the different formations. The coarse sands of the heavy Medina
"formations record a period of uplift of the oldland of Appalachia,"
when erosion went on rapidly and coarse waste in abundance was
brought down from the hills by swift streams and spread by the
"waves in wide, sandy flats. As the lands were worn lower the waste"
"became finer, and during an epoch of transition--the Clinton--"
"there were deposited various formations of sandstones, shales, and"
limestones. The Niagara limestones testify to a long epoch of
"repose, when low-lying lands sent little waste down to the sea."
pretending that there is none within the palace. As if a Queen of Spain
"could not have all the milk she wanted! Ridiculous!"""
By this time the little girl had mounted the parapet and was clinging
"with all her might to the iron railings, while a fat motherly person had"
"waddled out of the underbrush in search of her, and with many"
exclamations of pretended anger and indignation was endeavouring to
entice her away.
"But the more the nurse scolded and pulled, the more firmly did the"
"little maid cling to the golden bars. At last the elderly woman, quite"
"out of breath, sat down on the stone ledge and addressed to her charge"
the argument which in such cases betokens unconditional surrender.
"""My lady Isabel, what would your noble and royal mother say,"" she"
"gasped, ""thus to forget all the counsels and commands of those put in"
authority over you and run to the railings to chatter with a gipsy wife?
"Go away, goatherdess, or I will call the attendants and have you put in"
"prison!"""
"La Giralda had stopped her flock, obedient to the wishes of the little"
"maid, but now, with a low curtsey to both, she gathered them together"
"with her peculiar whistling cry, and prepared to continue her way down"
into the village.
But this the little girl would in nowise permit. She let go the iron
"rail, and with both hands clenched fell upon her attendant with"
concentrated fury.
"""Bad, wicked Susana,"" she cried, ""I will have you whipped and sent about"
"your business. Nay, I myself will beat you. I will kill you, do you"
hear? I have had nothing to eat and no one to play with for a week--not
"sullen. He looked frowningly at me, and I watched him equally"
"frowningly, and took him for a thinker, an Ibsenite whose imagination"
was lost among the ice of his own country. Now and then I would see
"him walking up and down the corridor, rubbing his hands together so"
continuously and so frantically that they made a noise like bones.
"“Suddenly, this gentleman is transformed as if by magic; he begins to"
"joke with the servants, he seizes a chair and dances with it, and the"
other day I saw him alone in the salon marching around with a paper hat
"on his head, like children playing soldiers, and blowing on a cornet,"
"also made of paper.” I stared at him in amazement, he smiled like a"
"child, and asked if he was disturbing me."
"“‘No, no, not in the least,’ I told him."
"“I have asked in the hotel if this man is crazy, and they have told me"
"that he is not, but is a professor, a man of science, who is known to"
have these strange fits of gaiety.
"“Another of the Norwegian’s doings has been to compose a serenade, with"
"a vulgar melody that would disgust you, and which he has dedicated ‘_A"
"la bella Italia_.’ He wrote the Italian words himself, but as he knows"
"no music, he had a pianist come here and write out his serenade. What"
he especially wants is that it should be full of sentiment; and so the
"pianist arranged it with directions and many pauses, which satisfied"
the Norwegian. Almost every night the serenade ‘_A la bella Italia_’
"is sung. Somebody who wants to amuse himself goes to the piano, the"
Norwegian strikes a languid attitude and chants his serenade. Sometimes
"he goes in front of the piano, sometimes behind, but invariably he hears"
"the storm of applause when it ends, and he bows with great gusto."
"“I don’t know whether it’s the other people who are laughing at him, or"
"the foliage, still flashes and dominates the landscape. Ha-ha! proud"
"mankind! There you ride! But alas, most of the men are still"
"khaki-muffled, rabbit-indistinguishable, ignominious. The Italians look"
curiously rabbity in the grey-green uniform: just as our sand-colored
"khaki men look doggy. They seem to scuffle rather abased, ignominious"
"on the earth. Give us back the scarlet and gold, and devil take the"
hindmost.
*       *       *       *       *
The landscape really begins to change. The hillsides tilt sharper and
"sharper. A man is ploughing with two small red cattle on a craggy,"
tree-hanging slope as sharp as a roof-side. He stoops at the small
"wooden plough, and jerks the ploughlines. The oxen lift their noses to"
"heaven, with a strange and beseeching snake-like movement, and taking"
"tiny little steps with their frail feet, move slantingly across the"
"slope-face, between rocks and tree-roots. Little, frail, jerky steps the"
"bullocks take, and again they put their horns back and lift their"
"muzzles snakily to heaven, as the man pulls the line. And he skids his"
wooden plough round another scoop of earth. It is marvellous how they
"hang upon that steep, craggy slope. An English labourer's eyes would"
bolt out of his head at the sight.
There is a stream: actually a long tress of a water-fall pouring into a
"little gorge, and a stream-bed that opens a little, and shows a"
marvellous cluster of naked poplars away below. They are like ghosts.
"They have a ghostly, almost phosphorescent luminousness in the shadow of"
"the valley, by the stream of water. If not phosphorescent, then"
"incandescent: a grey, goldish-pale incandescence of naked limbs and"
"myriad cold-glowing twigs, gleaming strangely. If I were a painter I"
"would paint them: for they seem to have living, sentient flesh. And the"
shadow envelopes them.
CHAPTER I
PARENTAGE AND EARLY YEARS
"""I was born when my country was perishing. Thirty thousand French"
"vomited upon our coasts, drowning the throne of Liberty in waves of"
"blood, such was the sight which struck my eyes."" This passionate"
"utterance, penned by Napoleon Buonaparte at the beginning of the"
"French Revolution, describes the state of Corsica in his natal year."
The words are instinct with the vehemence of the youth and the
extravagant sentiment of the age: they strike the keynote of his
career. His life was one of strain and stress from his cradle to his
grave.
In his temperament as in the circumstances of his time the young
Buonaparte was destined for an extraordinary career. Into a tottering
civilization he burst with all the masterful force of an Alaric. But
"he was an Alaric of the south, uniting the untamed strength of his"
island kindred with the mental powers of his Italian ancestry. In his
"personality there is a complex blending of force and grace, of animal"
"passion and mental clearness, of northern common sense with the"
promptings of an oriental imagination; and this union in his nature of
seeming opposites explains many of the mysteries of his life.
"Fortunately for lovers of romance, genius cannot be wholly analyzed,"
even by the most adroit historical philosophizer or the most exacting

"can be measured, they may be traced to the unexampled needs of mankind"
entertained it.  It was decided that the rubbish left after some
repairs had been done to the barracks should be used for mending and
"filling up the ditches in their street, and for the transport of this"
"five horses were given by the fire brigade.  Still more, they even saw"
the necessity of laying a drain-pipe through the street.  This and many
other things vastly increased the popularity of the teacher.  He wrote
petitions for them and published various remarks in the newspapers.
"For instance, on one occasion Vaviloff's customers noticed that the"
herrings and other provisions of the eating-house were not what they
"should be, and after a day or two they saw Vaviloff standing at the bar"
with the newspaper in his hand making a public apology.
"""It is true, I must acknowledge, that I bought old and not very good"
"herrings, and the cabbage ... also ... was old.  It is only too well"
known that anyone can put many a five-kopeck piece in his pocket in
this way.  And what is the result?  It has not been a success; I was
"greedy, I own, but the cleverer man has exposed me, so we are quits ..."""
"This confession made a very good impression on the people, and it also"
gave Vaviloff the opportunity of still feeding them with herrings and
"cabbages which were not good, though they failed to notice it, so much"
were they impressed.
"This incident was very significant, because it increased not only the"
"teacher's popularity, but also the effect of press opinion."
"It often happened, too, that the teacher read lectures on practical"
morality in the eating-house.

advantage of the fact that the attention of the British seaplanes and
"destroyers was centred on the fugitive Taubes, these giant airships,"
"by reason of their altitude, were able to manoeuvre immediately above"
the flotilla.
"It was an opportunity too good to be missed, for although the"
objective of the Zeppelins was a raid on London--they having decided
upon a circuitous course over Kent and Sussex borders in order to
avoid the air-stations at the Isle of Grain--the chance of raining a
shower of bombs upon the British cruiser and her attendant destroyers
was too tempting.
"For once, at least, the German Admiralty had not been kept well"
"posted as to the details of armament of the cruisers of the ""Town"
"Class,"" for the ""Sunderland"" and her consorts had recently been"
equipped with a couple of 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns. These
weapons fired a shell of unique character. Somewhat resembling a
"shrapnel, the missile was packed with short lengths of chain and"
charged with a high explosive.
Almost as soon as the Zeppelins were discovered both guns barked
venomously. From the point of view of the observers on the
"""Sunderland's"" bridge the shells appeared to burst close to the frail"
"targets. Both airships were observed to pitch violently, while one,"
"with her nose tilted downwards, began to descend."
"""She's done for!"" exclaimed Terence."
A round of cheering burst from the throats of the crew. It seemed as
if nothing could arrest the seaward plunge of one of the Kaiser's
gas-bags. Not only had her bow compartments been holed but the
nacelle containing the propelling machinery was completely wrecked.
will trade them with the Sinaketans. Thus the hosts from the Kula
community act as intermediaries in any trading relations between the
Sinaketans and the inhabitants of more remote districts.
"To sum up the sociology of these transactions, we may say that"
the visitor enters into a threefold relation with the Dobuan
"natives. First, there is his partner, with whom he exchanges general"
"gifts on the basis of free give and take, a type of transaction,"
running side by side with the Kula proper. Then there is the local
"resident, not his personal Kula partner, with whom he carries on"
gimwali. Finally there is the stranger with whom an indirect exchange
is carried on through the intermediation of the local men. With
"all this, it must not be imagined that the commercial aspect of"
the gathering is at all conspicuous. The concourse of the natives
"is great, mainly owing to their curiosity, to see the ceremonial"
reception of the uvalaku party. But if I say that every visitor from
"Boyowa, brings and carries away about half-a-dozen articles, I do"
not under-state the case. Some of these articles the Sinaketan has
acquired in the industrial districts of Boyowa during his preliminary
"trading expedition (see Chapter VI, Division III). On these he scores"
a definite gain. A few samples of the prices paid in Boyowa and those
received in Dobu will indicate the amount of this gain.

"about eleven.  With the instinct to take all the respite she could, and"
"knowing no more than before how she would receive his return, she went"
out in the forenoon and wandered about all day shopping and trying not to
"think.  Returning at tea-time, she went straight up to her baby, and"
"there heard from Betty that he had come, and gone out with his violin to"
the music-room.
"Bent over the child, Gyp needed all her self-control--but her"
"self-control was becoming great.  Soon, the girl would come fluttering"
"down that dark, narrow lane; perhaps at this very minute her fingers were"
"tapping at the door, and he was opening it to murmur, ""No; she's back!"""
"Ah, then the girl would shrink!  The rapid whispering--some other"
"meeting-place!  Lips to lips, and that look on the girl's face; till she"
"hurried away from the shut door, in the darkness, disappointed!  And he,"
"on that silver-and-gold divan, gnawing his moustache, his"
"eyes--catlike---staring at the fire! And then, perhaps, from his violin"
"would come one of those swaying bursts of sound, with tears in them, and"
"the wind in them, that had of old bewitched her!  She said:"
"""Open the window just a little, Betty dear--it's hot."""
"There it was, rising, falling!  Music!  Why did it so move one even when,"
"as now, it was the voice of insult!  And suddenly she thought: ""He will"
"expect me to go out there again and play for him. But I will not, never!"""
"She put her baby down, went into her bedroom, and changed hastily into a"
"teagown for the evening, ready to go downstairs.  A little shepherdess in"
"china on the mantel-shelf attracted her attention, and she took it in her"
"hand.  She had bought it three and more years ago, when she first came to"
"London, at the beginning of that time of girl-gaiety when all life seemed"
"a long cotillion, and she its leader.  Its cool daintiness made it seem"
"the symbol of another world, a world without depths or shadows, a world"
Monsieur Edouard Harmost inhabited the ground floor of a house in the
Marylebone Road.  He received his pupils in a large back room overlooking
"a little sooty garden.  A Walloon by extraction, and of great vitality,"
"he grew old with difficulty, having a soft corner in his heart for women,"
"and a passion for novelty, even for new music, that was unappeasable."
Any fresh discovery would bring a tear rolling down his mahogany cheeks
"into his clipped grey beard, the while he played, singing wheezily to"
"elucidate the wondrous novelty; or moved his head up and down, as if"
pumping.
"When Gyp was shown into this well-remembered room he was seated, his"
"yellow fingers buried in his stiff grey hair, grieving over a pupil who"
"had just gone out.  He did not immediately rise, but stared hard at Gyp."
"""Ah,"" he said, at last, ""my little old friend!  She has come back! Now"
"that is good!""  And, patting her hand he looked into her face, which had"
"a warmth and brilliance rare to her in these days.  Then, making for the"
"mantelpiece, he took therefrom a bunch of Parma violets, evidently"
"brought by his last pupil, and thrust them under her nose.  ""Take them,"
take them--they were meant for me.  Now--how much have you forgotten?
"Come!""  And, seizing her by the elbow, he almost forced her to the piano."
"""Take off your furs.  Sit down!"""
"And while Gyp was taking off her coat, he fixed on her his prominent"
"brown eyes that rolled easily in their slightly blood-shot whites, under"
squared eyelids and cliffs of brow.  She had on what Fiorsen called her
"""humming-bird"" blouse--dark blue, shot with peacock and old rose, and"
looked very warm and soft under her fur cap.  Monsieur Harmost's stare
"seemed to drink her in; yet that stare was not unpleasant, having in it"
only the rather sad yearning of old men who love beauty and know that
their time for seeing it is getting short.
the signal.
But in the increasing noise of the battle his voice already sounded less
"powerfully than before. A letter to Cardinal Albert of Mayence, 19"
"October 1519, of about the same content as that of Frederick of Saxony"
"written in the preceding spring, was at once circulated by Luther's"
"friends; and by the advocates of conservatism, in spite of the usual"
"protestation, 'I do not know Luther', it was made to serve against"
Erasmus.
It became more and more clear that the mediating and conciliatory
position which Erasmus wished to take up would soon be altogether
"untenable. The inquisitor Jacob Hoogstraten had come from Cologne, where"
"he was a member of the University, to Louvain, to work against Luther"
"there, as he had worked against Reuchlin. On 7 November 1519 the Louvain"
"faculty, following the example of that of Cologne, proceeded to take the"
decisive step: the solemn condemnation of a number of Luther's opinions.
"In future no place could be less suitable to Erasmus than Louvain, the"
citadel of action against reformers. It is surprising that he remained
there another two years.
The expectation that he would be able to speak the conciliating word was
paling. For the rest he failed to see the true proportions. During the
first months of 1520 his attention was almost entirely taken up by his
"own polemics with Lee, a paltry incident in the great revolution. The"
desire to keep aloof got more and more the upper hand of him. In June he
writes to Melanchthon: 'I see that matters begin to look like sedition.
"It is perhaps necessary that scandals occur, but I should prefer not to"
"be the author.' He has, he thinks, by his influence with Wolsey,"
"prevented the burning of Luther's writings in England, which had been"
"ordered. But he was mistaken. The burning had taken place in London, as"
early as 12 May.
"throat. After all, he was going to win! Out of the shimmering distance"
"of his desire, the lady of his dreams drew closer to him; and ere long"
"he could lay at her feet the burden of his travail, and then--."
"Oblivious to the turmoil all about, he wrote rapidly, almost"
"incoherently, to Mildred, transcribing the mood of mingled tenderness"
and exultation which possessed him.
"""Outside the building,"" he concluded, ""there is a raging mob. They"
"would ruin me if they could, but they can't do it, they can't do it. We"
"have beaten them all, my lady. We have won!"""
"He was sealing his letter, when, without warning, ""Fingerless"" Fraser"
"appeared at his side, his fishlike eyes agleam, his colorless face"
drawn with anxiety.
"""They've come to grab you for killing that striker,"" he began,"
"breathlessly; ""there's a couple of 'square-toes' on the dock now."
"Better take it on the 'lam'--quick!"""
"""God!"" So Marsh had withheld this stroke until the last moment, when"
the least delay would be fatal. Boyd knew that if he were brought into
court he would have hard shift to clear himself against the mass of
perjured testimony that his rival had doubtless gathered; but even this
seemed as nothing in comparison with the main issue. For one wild
instant he considered sending George Balt on with the ship. That would
"be folly, no doubt; yet plainly he could not hold _The Bedford Castle_"
and keep together that raging army of fishermen while he fought his way
through the tedious vexations of a trial. He saw that he had
"under-estimated his enemy's cunning, and he realized that, if Marsh had"
"planned this move, he would press his advantage to the full."
"""There's two plain-clothes men,"" he heard Fraser running on. ""I 'made'"
"""There are some of them upstairs now,"" she replied, ""but, alas, none who"
will ever reclaim them from us! The excuse is the best that can be
"devised to introduce us into San Ildefonso, and, perhaps, if we have"
"luck, inside the palisades of La Granja also."""
"So without further parley the Sergeant proceeded, in the most"
"matter-of-fact way possible, to load the ass with huge fagots of"
kindling wood till the animal showed only four feet paddling along under
"its burden, and a pair of patient orbs, black and beady like those of"
"the Sergeant himself, peering out of a hay-coloured matting of hair."
"This done, the Sergeant turned his sharp eyes every way about the dim"
"smoky horizon. He could note, as easily as on a map, the precise notch"
in the many purple-tinted gorges where they had left their party. It was
exactly like all the others which slit and dimple the slopes of the
"Guadarrama, but in this matter it was as impossible for the Sergeant to"
make a mistake as for a town-dweller to err as to the street in which he
has lived for years.
"But no one was watching them. No clump of juniper held a spy, and the"
Sergeant was at liberty to develop his plans. He turned quickly upon the
old gipsy woman.
"""La Giralda,"" he said, ""there is small use in discovering the"
"disposition of the courtiers in San Ildefonso--ay, or even the defences"
"of the palace, if we know nothing of the Romany who are to march"
"to-night upon the place."""
"La Giralda, who had been drawing a little milk from the udders of each"
"she-goat, to ease them for their travel, suddenly sprang erect."
"called to their action stations when a faint buzzing, immediately"
"becoming louder and louder, announced that the raiders were"
approaching the town and harbour of Dover.
"Searchlights flashed skywards, while from beneath the old castle on"
the lofty chalk cliffs half a dozen intrepid British airmen ascended
to meet the foe. Already the anti-aerial guns were stabbing the
"darkness with lurid spurts of flame, while their shells, bursting"
"perilously close to the hostile aeroplanes, caused the calculating"
Teutons to think better of the attempt.
It was an easy matter to steal over an unfortified town or village
and drop explosives; but for once the Germans were to learn the
"wisdom of discrimination. Higher and higher they banked, until"
catching a glimpse of the British seaplanes as they passed through
the path of one of the searchlights they precipitately turned tail.
"""'Sunderland' and destroyer flotilla to proceed in support of"
"seaplanes,"" came the signal."
Hastily the pins of the mooring shackle were knocked out. Steam was
"already raised, and in a very few minutes the light cruiser and her"
attendant destroyers were slipping between the heads of the detached
breakwater and the Admiralty Pier.
But swift as were the light cruisers the seaplanes were quicker.
"Already they were five or six miles out to sea, their position being"
revealed by the flashes of the light guns as they exchanged shots
with the fugitive Taubes.
Suddenly with a dazzling flash a bomb exploded hardly twenty feet
"from the ""Sunderland's"" starboard quarter. Five seconds later another"
"no way out and therefore preferred to make himself blind, which gave him"
an excuse for not seeing. Seven of our permanent guests now left together:
"the telephone operators, Tradesman Batt, Schoolmistresses Johnsen and"
"Palm, and two men who were in some sort of business, I don't quite know"
what. This whole party went across the fjeld to Stordalen to be driven
about in cars.
Cases of various kinds of foodstuffs arrived for Paul; they were carried
up one evening by a man from the village. He had to make several journeys
"with the side of his cart let down, and bring the cases over the roughest"
spots one by one. That was the kind of road it was. Josephine received the
"consignment, and noticed that one of the cases gave forth the sound of a"
"liquid splashing inside. That had come to the wrong place, she said, and"
"writing another address on it, she told the man to take it back. It was"
"sirup that had come too late, she said; she had got sirup elsewhere in the"
meantime.
Later in the evening we heard them discussing it in the kitchen; the sirup
"had not come too late, Paul said angrily."
"""And I've told you to clear these newspapers away!"" he cried. We heard the"
sound of paper and glass being swept to the floor.
"Well, things were not too easy for Paul; the days went by dull and empty,"
nor had he any children to give him pleasant thoughts at times. Though he
"wanted to build still more houses, he could not use half those he had"
already. There was Mrs. Brede living alone with her children in one of
"them, and since seven of the guests had left, Miss Torsen was also alone"
in the south wing. Paul wanted at all costs to build roads and share in
the development of the tourist traffic; he even wanted to run a fleet of
motor cars. But since he had not the power to do this alone and could get
"no assistance, nothing was left him but to resign himself. And now to make"
"all thought, and think still, that I was a messenger from the"
"_Malplaquet_, which, by the way, is well down the river safe and"
"sound. Just wait a minute."" He walked into a corner of the room, moved"
"his hands quickly between his side pockets and his face, and then"
"returned. Except for the dark hair and moustache and the brown skin,"
"he had become the Dawson of the Thursday afternoon. ""It is as simple"
"for me to change,"" said the artist, with a nasty look in my direction,"
"""as it seems to be for Mr. Copplestone here to spot me. It will take a"
day or two to get the dye out of my hair and the tan off my skin. I am
"going to have a sharp touch of influenza, which is a useful disease"
"when one wants to lie in. Since Sunday I have only been twice to bed."""
We filled him up with coffee and flattery--as one fills a motor car
with petrol and oil--but asked him no questions until we were safely
in Cary's study and Mrs. Cary had gone about her household duties.
"""Your good lady,"" remarked Dawson to Cary, ""is as little curious as"
"any woman I have met, and we will leave her at that if you don't mind."
The best thing about our women is that they don't care tuppence about
"naval and military details. If they did, and once started prying with"
"that keen scent and indomitable persistence of theirs, we might as"
well chuck up. Even my own bright team of charmers never know and
never ask the meaning of the information that they ferret out for me.
"Their curiosity is all personal--about men and women, never about"
"things. Women--"""
I cut Dawson short. He tended to become tedious.
"""Quite so,"" I observed politely. ""And to revert to one big female"
"creature, let us hear something of the _Malplaquet_."""
"""You at any rate are curious enough for a dozen. It would serve you"
right to keep you hopping a bit longer. But I have a kindly eye for

"had only been in the room a minute or two, when the brown woman tapped:"
"and if you please, the black-cap had sent us one of his little white"

almost disappeared from the world.
"It was a queer little bread--three-cornered, and almost as hard as ships"
"biscuit, made of starch flour. Not strictly bread at all."

"The night was cold, the blankets flat and heavy, but one slept quite"
"well till dawn. At seven o'clock it was a clear, cold morning, the sun"
"not yet up. Standing at the bedroom window looking out, I could hardly"
"believe my eyes it was so like England, like Cornwall in the bleak"
"parts, or Derbyshire uplands. There was a little paddock-garden at the"
"back of the Station, rather tumble-down, with two sheep in it. There"
"were several forlorn-looking out-buildings, very like Cornwall. And then"
"the wide, forlorn country road stretched away between borders of grass"
"and low, drystone walls, towards a grey stone farm with a tuft of trees,"
"and a naked stone village in the distance. The sun came up yellow, the"
"bleak country glimmered bluish and reluctant. The low, green hill-slopes"
"were divided into fields, with low drystone walls and ditches. Here and"
"there a stone barn rose alone, or with a few bare, windy trees attached."
"Two rough-coated winter horses pastured on the rough grass, a boy came"
"along the naked, wide, grass-bordered high-road with a couple of milk"
"cans, drifting in from nowhere: and it was all so like Cornwall, or a"
"part of Ireland, that the old nostalgia for the Celtic regions began to"
"spring up in me. Ah, those old, drystone walls dividing the fields--pale"
"and granite-blenched! Ah, the dark, sombre grass, the naked sky! the"
"forlorn horses in the wintry morning! Strange is a Celtic landscape, far"
"more moving, disturbing than the lovely glamor of Italy and Greece."
saluted and stood at attention. There was a moment's silence in the
"room, but before Rollo had time to speak the Queen-Regent recovered her"
self-possession. The daughter of the Bourbons stood erect. Her long hair
streamed in dark glossy waves over her shoulders. Her bosom heaved
visibly under the thin pink wrapper. Anger struggled with fear in her
eyes. Verily Maria Cristina of Naples had plenty of courage.
"""Who are you,"" she cried, ""that dare thus to break in upon the privacy"
"of the Regent Queen of Spain? Duke, call the guard!"""
But her husband only shrugged his shoulders and continued to gaze upon
the pair of intruders with a calm exterior.
"""Your Majesty,"" said Rollo, courteously, naturally resuming the"
leadership when anything requiring contact with gentlefolk came in the
"way, ""I am here to inform you that you are in great danger--greater than"
"I can for the moment make clear to you. The palace is, as I understand,"
absolutely without defence--the town is in the same position. It is
within our knowledge that a band of two hundred gipsies are on the march
"to attack you this night in order to plunder the château, and put to"
"death every soul within its walls. We have come, therefore, together"
"with our companions outside, to offer our best services in your"
"Majesty's defence!"""
"""But,"" cried the Queen-Regent, ""all this may very well be, but you have"
"not yet told me who you are and what you are doing here!"""
"""For myself,"" answered Rollo, ""I am a Scottish gentleman, trained from"
my youth to the profession of arms. Those who wait without are for the
"present comrades and companions, whom, with your Majesty's permission, I"
"shall bid to enter. For to be plain, every moment is of the utmost"
"importance, that we may lose no time in putting the château into such a"
"1915; H. Wildon Carr, _The Philosophy of B. Croce_, London, 1917. The"
"first is an able, but very cursory sketch; the second examines Croce's"
philosophy from the standpoint of neoscholasticism; the third is an
ample summary written by a distinguished writer well acquainted with
the various currents of modern thought. Each of them ought to be read
with a critical and discriminating eye.
"In the English-speaking world, Croce's fame rests emphatically on his"
"Ã¦sthetics, and its applications to literary criticism. His influence"
on English and American critical thought has already gone much deeper
than a mere list of writings on his theories would show; especially in
"England, his ideas are, so to speak, in the air, and appear in many"
writers who have no direct knowledge of his work. The best exposition
of this phase of his philosophy is to be found in E. F. Carritt's
"book, _The Theory of Beauty_, 1914, chap. XIV. The writings of A. B."
"Walkley, and of J. E. Spingam, contain the most vigorous prosecution"
"of his thought as applied, respectively, to English and to American"
scholarship and criticism.
"For the general history of Italian thought, to which many a reference"
"is made in the course of this book, the best helps, besides Croce's"
"essay on Vico, and B. Spaventa, _La filosofia italiana_, recently"
"reprinted, Bari, 1909, are the historical works of Giovanni Gentile,"
"and especially his _Storia della filosofia italiana_, Milano, n."
d. Gentile is one of the most profound and earnest modern European
"thinkers, and it is desirable that his theoretical works, similar in"
"tendency to, but widely divergent in temper from those of Croce, should"
"become better known to the Anglo-Saxon world. Two of his books, _La"
"Riforma dell' Educazione_ and _Teoria generale dello Spirito_, are soon"
to appear in English. Croce's judgment on Gentile's Actual Idealism is
"expressed in _Una discussione tra filosofi amici_, in _Conversazioni"
"Critiche_, II, pp. 67-95. But a complete understanding of the vital"
"temperature normal, pulse 72, respirations 24, tongue moist,"
bowels confined. Rigidity of abdominal wall and deficient
"mobility of nearly whole right half of belly, the whole lower"
half of which moves little with respiration. No track palpable
"in abdominal parietes. No dulness, no distension. The"
temperature rose to 99.5° at night. On the fourth day the
"bowels acted freely, the pulse fell to 60, the respirations"
"were 24, and the temperature normal."
Tenderness and rigidity persisted in the right flank to the end
"of a week, after which time no further signs persisted."
(175*) Wounded at Modder River while lying on right side. Range
"500 yards. Walked 400 yards after injury. _Entry_ (Mauser), at"
the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the right
"iliac crest; _exit_, 3 inches to right of and 1/2 inch below"
the level of the umbilicus. The injury was followed by no signs
of intra-abdominal lesion; on the third day the temperature was
"normal, pulse 80, and the tongue clean and moist. Some soreness"
"at times and tenderness on pressure were complained of, but the"
man was discharged well at the end of one month.
(176*) Wounded while doubling in retirement at Modder River.
"_Entry_ (Mauser), immediately above the junction of the"
"posterior and middle thirds of the left iliac crest; _exit_, 1"
"inch below costal margin (eighth rib), 3 inches to the right of"
"the median line. The bullet was lying in the anterior wound,"
whence it was removed by the orderly who applied the first
dressing on the field. The patient remained on the field seven
"and a half hours, and when brought into hospital at once"
"commenced to vomit. The ejected matter, at first green in"
"colour, during the next forty-eight hours changed to a dirty"
"all the debate was important, and the hour of the division drew near;"
"and when the question was put and the bell rang, nearly half the House"
"trooped out with virtuous air to join the other half, persistently"
"gossiping in the lobby, and, with them, decide the fateful question."
One more strange thing was to happen at that sitting.
"It was not strange that the Government were beaten by three votes, that"
"only one of those wavering men voted with his old party at last, but it"
"was strange that when this result was announced, and Medland's followers"
settled sturdily in their seats to endure the celebration of the
"triumph, the celebration did not come. There was hardly a cheer, and"
"Medland himself, whom the result seemed hardly to have roused, woke with"
a start to the unwonted silence. It struck to his heart: it seemed like
a tribute of respect to a dead enemy. But he rose and briefly said that
on the next day an announcement of the Government's intentions would be
made by himself--he paused here a moment--or one of his colleagues. He
"sat down again. The sitting was at an end, and the House adjourned."
"Members began to go out, but, as the Premier rose, they drew back and"
"left a path for him down the middle of the House. As he went, one or two"
"thrust out their hands to him, and one honest fellow shouted in his"
"rough voice--he was a labouring-man member--""You're not done yet,"
"Jimmy!"""
"The shout touched him, he lifted his head, looked round with a smile,"
"and, just raising again the hat he had put on as he neared the door,"
took Norburn's arm and passed out of the House.
"When Sir Robert followed, he found the Chief Justice waiting for him,"
"and they walked off together. For a long while neither spoke, but at"
"last Sir Robert said peevishly,"
"there was no hæmoptysis, but for the succeeding nine days small"
brightish red clots were expectorated. There was some
tenderness over the ribs from the fifth to the ninth in the
"axillary line, and on the ninth day some gravitation ecchymosis"
appeared over the same region. Cough was an early troublesome
"symptom in this case, and when admitted to the Base hospital,"
"about the seventh day, there was evidence of fluid extending"
about a third of the way up the back.
On the tenth day after admission a pleural rub was detected at
"the upper margin of the dulness, and the latter shortly"
extended upwards over a little more than half the back.
"Meanwhile, there was no further hæmoptysis, respiration was"
"fairly easy, 24 per minute, but accompanied by slight"
"dilatation of the alæ nasi, and the temperature, which had been"
"ranging from 99° to 100°, began to rise steadily, on the"
fifteenth day reaching 102.5°. The patient refused even an
"exploratory puncture, and was treated on the expectant plan."
"The temperature slowly subsided, with a steady improvement in"
"the physical signs, and at the end of about ten weeks he left"
for home with only slight dulness and incapacity for active
exertion remaining. (Now again on active service.)

If you do not know Bogle’s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your
loss. For if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you
should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions.
And if you belong to the half to whom waiters’ checks are things of
"moment, you should know Bogle’s, for there you get your money’s"
"worth—in quantity, at least."
"Bogle’s is situated in that highway of _bourgeoisie_, that boulevard of"
"Brown-Jones-and-Robinson, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables"
"in the room, six in each row. On each table is a caster-stand,"
containing cruets of condiments and seasons. From the pepper cruet you
"may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy, like volcanic"
dust. From the salt cruet you may expect nothing. Though a man should
"extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip, yet will his"
prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from Bogle’s cruets. Also
upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made “from
the recipe of a nobleman in India.”
"At the cashier’s desk sits Bogle, cold, sordid, slow, smouldering, and"
"takes your money. Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change,"
"files your check, and ejects at you, like a toad, a word about the"
weather. Beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you
"would better not venture. You are not Bogle’s friend; you are a fed,"
"transient customer, and you and he may not meet again until the blowing"
of Gabriel’s dinner horn. So take your change and go—to the devil if
you like. There you have Bogle’s sentiments.
The needs of Bogle’s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a
"Voice. One of the waitresses was named Aileen. She was tall, beautiful,"
"lively, gracious and learned in persiflage. Her other name? There was"
no more necessity for another name at Bogle’s than there was for
"goats, hastily deposited the babe within, and upon the white linen the"
"red earth fell first like thin rain, and afterwards, when the sheet was"
"covered, in lumps and mattock-clods. For La Giralda desired to be gone,"
suddenly becoming mindful of the precepts of the Sergeant.
"""No priest has blessed the grave,"" she said; ""I can say no prayers over"
her! Who is La Giralda that she should mutter the simplest prayer? But
"when the Master of Life awakes the little one, and when He sees the look"
"she will cast on her poor puppet of wood, He will take her to His bosom"
"even as La Giralda, the mother of many, would have taken her! God, the"
"Good One, cannot be more cruel than a woman of the heathen!"""
"And so with the broken pottery for a monument, and the clasp of infant"
"hands about the wooden doll for a prayer to God, the dead babe was left"
"alone, unblessed and unconfessed--but safe."
*       *       *       *       *
Meanwhile we must go over the hill with Sergeant Cardono. Whatever his
"thoughts may have been as he trudged up the barren glens, seamed and"
"torn with the winter rains, no sign of them appeared upon his sunburnt"
"weather-beaten face. Steadily and swiftly, yet without haste, he held"
"his way, his eyes fixed on the ground, as though perfectly sure of his"
"road, like a man on a well-beaten track which he has trod a thousand"
times.
"For more than an hour he went on, up and ever up, till his feet crisped"
"upon the first snows of Peñalara, and the hill ramparts closed in. But"
"when he had reached the narrows of a certain gorge, he looked keenly to"
"either side, marking the entrance. A pile of stones roughly heaped one"
upon the other fixed his attention. He went up to them and attentively
"perused their structure and arrangement, though they appeared to have"
We drilled every morning from six o'clock until eight in the fields
outside the New Gate; the others went again at sunset to practise
"their weapons, but I was exempt from this drill, that the women might"
not be left alone. At all times we had our appointed rendezvous in
case of alarm or assault. The Swedish veterans strolled out of the
camp and stood to laugh at our clumsiness. But the excellent order
"which prevailed among them made them favourites, and we let them"
"laugh, and laughed again."
"The Waldgrave, who had long had Duke Bernard's promise, received a"
"regiment of horse, so that he lay in the camp and should have been a"
"contented man, since his strength had come back to him. But to my"
surprise he showed signs of lukewarmness. He seemed little interested
"in the service, and was often at my lady's house in the Ritter"
"Strasse, when he would have been better at his post. At first I set"
"this down to his passion for my lady, and it seemed excusable; but"
within a week I stood convinced that this no longer troubled him. He
"paid scant attention to her, but would sit for hours looking moodily"
into the street. And I--and not I alone--began to watch him closely.
I soon found that Count Hugo was right. The once gallant and splendid
young fellow was a changed man. He was still comely and a brave
"figure, but the spirit in him was quenched. He was nervous, absent,"
irritable. His eyes had a wild look; on strangers he made an
"unfavourable impression. Doubtless, though his wounds had healed,"
there remained some subtle injury that spoiled the man; and often I
"caught my lady looking at him sadly, and knew that I was not the only"
one with cause for mourning.
"But how strange he was we did not know until a certain day, when my"
"lady and I were engaged together over some accounts. It was evening,"
and the three men were away drilling. The house was very quiet.
"But a moment later his superiority turned to consternation, and he"
was burying his head in the bowels of the car.
After a moment's inspection he showed a face of such utter dismay
that it would have been comical had not the situation been so serious.
"""Great Scott, sir! I must have left the petrol tap turned on, and the"
"tank is nearly empty."""
"Here, I'm afraid, my language was violent, and it was some minutes"
before Allan was able to ascertain exactly how much petrol we had
left. His calculations established the fact that we had lost some
fourteen gallons. This meant that we should have to walk the greater
part of the last two hundred miles of our journey. A pleasant
"prospect in that forbidding country. But orders were to go on, and go"
on we did.
"That day we made good time, and before evening had done the ninety"
"miles set as a day's march. But, as we had lost so much ground the"
"previous day, I determined to go on as long as Allan could stick at"
"the driving wheel, and we went on--to a post called Yadgar."
"I should explain that in this barren, townless, roadless district"
"there are occasional small rest-houses, very modest types of Dâk"
"bungalows, established by the Indian Government for the benefit of"
"travellers, or soldiers on their way to frontier duty. They are quite"
"bare except for a camp bed or two, a tub, a table, a few chairs and a"
"wash-hand basin, with a _chokidar_, or keeper, in charge."
"Such a rest-house we found at Yadgar, and being not only very tired"
"and dusty, but filthily dirty, as the result of our struggles with"
"the car, we pulled up to try and get a superficial wash."
mother had better pursue: leave Tervueren and seek a lodging in
Brussels; or retreat as far as Ghent or Bruges or even Holland? The
clerk reassured her. The Germans had certainly occupied the
"south-east of Belgium, but dared not push as far to the west and"
north as Brussels. They risked otherwise being nipped between the
Belgian army of Antwerp and the British force marching on Mons....
He directed her attention to the last _communiqué_ of the Ministry
"of War: ""La situation n'a jamais été meilleure. Bruxelles, à l'abri"
"d'un coup de main, est défendue par vingt mille gardes civiques"
"armés d'un excellent fusil,"" etc."
Vivie returned therefore a trifle reassured. At the same time she
and her mother spent some hours in packing up and posting valuable
"securities to London, via Ostende, in packing for deposit in the"
strong rooms of a Brussels bank Mrs. Warren's jewellery and plate.
The tram service from Tervueren had ceased to run. So they induced a
neighbour to drive them into Brussels in a chaise: a slow and
wearisome journey under a broiling sun. Arrived in Brussels they
found the town in consternation. Placarded on the walls was a notice
signed by the Burgomaster--the celebrated Adolphe Max--informing the
Bruxellois that in spite of the resistances of the Belgian army it
was to be feared the enemy might soon be in occupation of Brussels.
"In such an event he adjured the citizens to avoid all panic, to give"
"no legitimate cause of offence to the Germans, to renounce any idea"
of resorting to arms! The Germans on their part were bound
"by the laws of war to respect private property, the lives of"
"non-combatants, the honour of women, and the exercise of religion."
Vivie and her mother found the banks closed and likewise the railway
station. They now had but one thought: to get back as quickly as
"possible to Villa Beau-séjour, and fortunately for their dry-mouthed"
impatience their farmer friend was of the same mind. Along the
and small fishes miraculously multiplied to feed the five thousand;
the linen cloth with which he dried the feet of his apostles; also
"Aaron's rod, the rod with which Moses smote the Red Sea,"" etc., etc."
"(_Cook's Southern Italy_, p. 114.) We did not see these, but in the"
cloister behind this church we were shown a marble slab on pillars
"which was once an altar, ""at which the officiating priest doubted of"
"the Real Presence, when the wafer fell from his hand through the stone,"
"leaving a round hole, which still remains."" Here, too, we were shown"
"a larger slab resting on pillars, more than six feet from the ground,"
"which marks the height of our Saviour; also a porphyry slab, upon which"
the soldiers cast lots for his seamless robe; and some columns from
"Pilate's house in Jerusalem, which were rent by the earthquake of the"
crucifixion.
"[Illustration: THE SCALA SANTA, ROME.]"
[Sidenote: The Holy Stairs from Pilate's Palace.]
"But the great relic of Pilate's House, and one of the most interesting"
"of all the relics in Rome, is across the street from St. John Lateran,"
"viz., the world-renowned _Scala Santa_, or Holy Stairway, a flight of"
"twenty-eight marble steps, once ascended by our Saviour in the palace"
"of Pilate, and brought from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by the Empress"
"Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. They are covered with a wooden"
"casing, but holes have been left through which the marble steps can be"
seen. Two of them are stained with the Saviour's blood. These spots
"are covered with glass. The light was rather dim, and as we entered a"
gentleman struck a match and held it over one of these glass-covered
"stains to show it to his little girl, so that, passing just at that"
"moment, we also had a good view."
[Sidenote: The Man who Crawled Up and Walked Down.]
rotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a
"muted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until"
he could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.
*       *       *       *       *
"Remembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he"
instantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate
level from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as
"quaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have"
had enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered
if he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth
"their relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would"
"send her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,"
that special power of his over her was reserved for far more important
purposes.
Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence
"into his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed."
No covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them
"unnecessary. He stepped into his clothing--the severe tunic, tights and"
sockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message
"tape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme"
"tablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly"
"planted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face"
broke into a smile.
"It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making"
"up his life--and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of"
"his best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving"
"technique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as"
somno-learning.
"The Syrians' love of lucre was proverbial. Active, compliant and able,"
"frequently little scrupulous, they knew how to conclude first small deals,"
"then larger ones, everywhere. Using the special talents of their race to"
"advantage, they succeeded in establishing themselves on all coasts of the"
"Mediterranean, even in {108} Spain.[12] At Malaga an inscription mentions a"
corporation formed by them. The Italian ports where business was especially
"active, Pozzuoli, Ostia, later Naples, attracted them in great numbers. But"
they did not confine themselves to the seashore; they penetrated far into
"the interior of the countries, wherever they hoped to find profitable"
trade. They followed the commercial highways and traveled up the big
"rivers. By way of the Danube they went as far as Pannonia, by way of the"
Rhone they reached Lyons. In Gaul they were especially numerous. In this
new country that had just been opened to commerce fortunes could be made
rapidly. A rescript discovered on the range of the Lebanon is addressed to
"sailors from Arles, who had charge of the transportation of grain, and in"
of his relinquished hopes—and cried aloud profane words of holy
rapture.
"From the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving, snowy,"
"fluttering, wonderful, divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy."
"By came a citizen, rotund, comfortable, home-hurrying, unknowing of the"
delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly-lit parks.
"“Will you oblige me with the time, sir?” asked the young man; and the"
"citizen, shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe, dragged it out and"
announced:
"“Twenty-nine and a half minutes past eight, sir.”"
"And then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made"
"""IPV _Arcturus_, Breckenridge,"" from the chief pilot."
"""You have been on my ray almost a minute. Why are you not correcting"
"course and acceleration?"""
"""Doctor Stevens is computing us and has full control of course and"
"acceleration,"" replied Breckenridge. ""He will answer you."""
"""I am changing neither course nor acceleration because you are not"
"in position,"" declared Stevens, crisply, ""Please give me your present"
"supposed location, and your latest precision goniometer bearings on the"
"sun, the moon, Mars, Venus, and your Tellurian reference limb, with"
"exact time of observations, gyroscope zero-planes, and goniometer"
"factors!"""
"""Correct at once or I shall report you to the Observatory,"" E2 answered"
"loftily, paying no attention to the demand for proof of position."
"""Be sure you do that, guy--and while you're at it report that your"
station hasn't taken a precision bearing in a month. Report that you've
"been muddling along on radio loop bearings, and that you don't know"
"where you are, within seven thousand kilometers. And speaking of"
reporting--I know already that a lot of you astronomical guessers
"have only the faintest possible idea of where you really are, _plus_,"
"_minus_, or lateral; and if you don't get yourselves straightened out"
"before we get to W41, I'm going to make a report on my own account that"
"will jar some of you birds loose from your upper teeth!"" He unplugged"
"with a vicious jerk, and turned to the pilot with a grin."
"""Guess that'll hold him for a while, won't it?"""
"""He'll report us, sure,"" remonstrated Breckenridge. The older man was"
"tenth 103°. The man was very ill, and an exploring needle was"
"inserted, by which about an ounce of blood was evacuated. The"
signs of fluid in the left pleura were accompanied by those of
"consolidation over the lower fourth of the right lung, and the"
sputa were rusty. Evidence of perforation of the left axillary
artery existed in feebleness of the radial pulse; and there was
musculo-spiral paralysis.
"After the preliminary puncture, the man refused any further"
"operative treatment, although a second rise of temperature"
"commenced on the fifteenth day, culminating in a temperature of"
103.2° on the eighteenth. The further treatment of the patient
consisted in the ensurance of rest and the alleviation of pain.
A steady fall in the temperature extended over another three
"weeks, together with diminution in the signs of fluid in the"
"pleura. At the end of seventy-four days the man was sent home,"
"some slight dulness at the left base, and contraction of the"
chest sufficient to influence the spine in the way of lateral
"curvature, being the only remaining signs."
[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 4.--Primary Hæmothorax. Secondary rise
"of temperature, with increase in the effusion. Spontaneous recovery."
Case No. 155]
(155) _Severe hæmothorax. Secondary effusion. Spontaneous
"recovery._--Wounded at Koodoosberg Drift, at a distance of 200"
"yards. _Entry_, at angle of the right scapula; _exit_, at the"
junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the
chest-wall. No signs of spinal cord injury. The patient was
brought in from the field twelve miles by an ambulance wagon on
"the second day, and in crossing the Modder River he was"
accidentally upset into the stream. For the first four days
"and the little Queen of Spain!"""
"She subsided on a stone, dropped her head into her hands, and took no"
"further notice of the Sergeant, who stood awhile with his hand resting"
"on her shoulder in deep meditation. There was, he thought, no more to be"
said or done. He knew all there was to know. The men had not asked him
"to join them, so he would venture no further questions as to the time"
and the manner of attack. They were still jealous of him with that
easily aroused jealousy of south and north which in Spain divides even
the clannish gipsy.
Nevertheless he went the round of the men. They were mostly busy with
"their games, and some of them even snatched the stakes in to them, lest"
he should demand a percentage of the winnings after the manner of
Sevilla. The Sergeant smiled at the reputation which distance and many
"tongues had given him. Then, with a few words of good fellowship and"
"the expression of a wish for success and abundant plunder, he bade them"
farewell. It was a great deed which they designed and one worthy of his
"best days. He was now old, he said, and must needs choose easier"
courses. He did not desire twice to feel the grip of the collar of iron.
"But young blood--oh, it would have its way and run its risks!"
Here the Sergeant smiled and raised his Montera cap. The men as
"courteously bade him good-day, preserving, however, a certain respectful"
"distance, and adding nothing to the information he had already obtained."
"But Chica, seated on her stone, with her scarlet-bound head on her hand,"
neither looked up nor gave him any greeting as his feet went slowly down
the rocky glen and crunched over the begrimed patches of last year's
"snow, now wide-pored and heavy with the heat of noonday."
"Provincial Service, and they obtained fairly good men. It would not be"
right for a great Government to grant a minimum pay to Indian Professors
"and an extravagantly high pay to their European colleagues, for doing"
the same kind of work.
"83,669. At the Presidency College the facilities for scientific work"
were now greater than in many institutions in England. India was now
"becoming a great country for Biological research. Again, the Physical"
and Chemical Laboratories at the Presidency College were finer than many
in England. If young men of science in England thought they obtained
better opportunities in pursuing their subjects in New Zealand and
"Toronto than in India, the India office ought to remove that impression"
at once.
"83,670. (Lord Ronaldshay). When an Indian graduate under the witnesses'"
scheme was appointed direct to the higher service in India he would not
compel him to go to England for a period of training. The person who
would be appointed in India directly from the Indian Universities would
have to have previously served with distinction in subordinate
positions; a visit to Europe would be an advantage but not absolutely
necessary.
"83,671. (Mr. Biss). The cost of living in Calcutta to an Indian"
Professor or Lecturer would all depend as the style in which he lived.
In each service there is always a standard of living to which every
member is expected to conform. An Indian Professor had to go to Europe
from time to time to keep himself in touch with the developments of his
subject. An Indian officer had to support a large number of relations.
The question of a man's private expenses should not be raised in fixing
his pay. One might as well inquire whether the candidate for admission
"to the service was a bachelor or married, or as to how many children he"
"had. He had known Europeans who had led a simple life, and had been all"
"Summer tourists were still there; the Casino was full of people, the"
shops were doing an active trade; the restaurants were crowded with
"English, Americans, Belgians taking tea, chocolate, or liqueurs at"
little tables and creating a babel of talk. Newspapers were being
sold everywhere by ragamuffin boys who shouted their head-lines in
"French, Flemish, and quite understandable English. A fort or two at"
"Liége had fallen, but it was of no consequence. General Léman could"
"hold out indefinitely, and the mere fact that German soldiers had"
entered the town of Liége counted for nothing. Belgium had virtually
won the war by holding up the immense German army. France was
"overrunning Alsace, Russia was invading East Prussia and also"
"sending uncountable thousands of soldiers, via Archangel, to"
"England, whence they were being despatched to Calais for the relief"
of Belgium.
"""It looks,"" thought Vivie, after glancing at the _Indépendance"
"Belge_, ""As though Belgium were going to be extremely interesting"
during the next few weeks; I may be privileged to witness--from a
"safe distance--another Waterloo."""
Then she returned to the train which in her absence had been so
crowded with soldiers and civilian passengers that she had great
difficulty in finding her place and seating herself. The young man
whom she had seen pacing the deck of the steamer approached her and
"said: ""There is more room in my compartment; in fact I have"
"selfishly got one all to myself. Won't you share it?"""
She thanked him and moved in there with her suit case and rugs.
When the train had started and she had parried one or two polite
"enquiries as to place and ventilation, she said: ""I think I ought to"
"tell you who I am, in case you would not like to be seen speaking to"
"sympathetic listener, whose bright eyes stimulated all his capacities as"
"narrator, and whose bright smile welcomed every hairbreadth escape with"
a joy which Rollo could not but feel must somehow be heartfelt and
"personal. Besides, adventures sound so well when told in Spanish and to"
a Spanish girl.
"Yet, strange as it may seem, the young man missed several opportunities"
of arousing the compassion of his companion.
"He said not a word about Peggy Ramsay, nor did he mention the broken"
"heart which he had come so far afield to curé. And as for Concha,"
nothing could have been more nunlike and conventual than the expression
with which she listened. It was as if one of the Lady Superior's
"""Holiest Innocents"" had flown over the nunnery wall and settled down to"
listen to Rollo's tale in that wild gorge among the mountains of
Guadarrama.
*       *       *       *       *
Meantime the Sergeant and his gipsy companion pursued their way with
little regard to the occupations or sentiments of those they had left
"behind them. Cardono's keen black eyes, twinkling hither and thither, a"
myriad crows' feet reticulating out from their corners like spiders'
"webs, took in the landscape, and every object in it."
"The morning was well advanced when, right across their path, a"
"well-to-do farmhouse lay before them, white on the hillside, its walls"
"long-drawn like fortifications, and the small slit-like windows"
counterfeiting loopholes for musketry. But instead of the hum of work
"and friendly gossip, the crying of ox-drivers yoking their teams, or"
"adjusting the long blue wool over the patient eyes of their beasts,"
"there reigned about the place, both dwelling and office-houses, a"
"manners, tasteful in dress, speaking English marvellously well,"
"highly accomplished in music or with some other art, advocates of"
the enfranchisement of women. The War came just too soon. Had Heaven
"struck down that epilept Emperor and a few of his ministers, had"
time been given for the New German Woman to assert herself in
"politics, there would have been no invasion of Belgium, no"
maltreatment of Servia. Germany would have ranged herself with the
Western powers and Western culture.
Minna von Stachelberg read her cousin's note and received the worn
"and anxious-looking Vivie like a sister ... like a comrade, she"
"said, in the War for the Vote ... ""which we will resume, my dear, as"
"soon as this dreadful Man's war is over, only we won't fight with"
"the same weapons."""
"But though kind, she was not gushing and she soon told Vivie that in"
nursing she was a novice and had much to learn. She introduced her
"to the German and Belgian surgeons, and then put her to a series of"
entirely menial tasks from which she was to work her way up by
"degrees. But if any English soldier were there and wanted sympathy,"
she should be called in to his ward ... From that interview Vivie
returned almost happy.
In the hot summer months she would sometimes be allowed to accompany
"Red Cross surgeons and nurses to the station, when convoys of"
"wounded were expected, if there was likelihood that British soldiers"
would be amongst them. These would cheer up at the sound of her
pleasant voice speaking their tongue. Yet she would witness on such
occasions incongruous incidents of German brutality. Once there came
"out of the train an English and a French soldier, great friends"
evidently. They were only slightly wounded and the English soldier
stretched his limbs cautiously to relieve himself of cramp. At that
The wind blustered outside. The cold draught whistled through the room.
"Joyce rose to his feet with a shiver, went to a corner for a couple of"
"sacks, which he threw over the sleeping man, and, after having wistfully"
"read Yvonne’s letter once more, ascended the ladder to the loft, where"
the shapeless mattress of dried grass and sacking awaited him.
CHAPTER XII--HISTOIRE DE REVENANT
Ostend is a magnificent white Kursaal on the Belgian coast. Certain
requisites are attached to it in the way of great hotels and villas
"along a tiled _digue_, and innumerable bathing-machines on the sands"
"below. There is an old town, it is true, somewhere behind it, with"
"quaint narrow streets, a Place d’Armes dotted round with cafés, and"
a thronged market-square; there is also a bustling port and a fishing
population. But the Ostend of practical life begins and ends at the
"Kursaal. Were it to perish during a night, the following day would see"
the exodus of twenty thousand visitors. The vast glass rotunda can hold
thousands. Within its precincts you can do anything in reason and out of
"reason. You can knit all day long like Penelope, or you can go among"
the Sirens with or without the precautions of Ulysses. You can consume
anything from a biscuit to a ten-course dinner. You can play dominoes at
centime points or roulette with a forty-franc minimum. You can listen to
"music, you can dance, you can go to sleep. You can write letters, send"
"telegrams, and open a savings-bank account. By moving to one side or the"
other of a glass screen you can sit in the warm sunshine or in the keen
sea wind. You can study the fashions of Europe from St. Petersburg to
"Dublin, and if you are a woman, you can wear the most sumptuous garments"
"Providence has deigned to bestow on you. And lastly, if you are looking"
"the author's attitude, and thus lessen the value of his work. It is"
"most desirable, in order to prevent this, that the author carefully"
inspect the index while in manuscript. He can thus detect possible
departures in the indexer's condensed expression of his own thought.
The following rules and suggestions are given with a twofold object
"in mind: _first_, to prevent those authors who possess the necessary"
qualifications from avoiding the preparation of their own indexes
"because of unfamiliarity with the technical details; _second_, to"
enable authors intelligently to criticize the form as well as the
matter of those indexes which are prepared for their volumes by other
hands.
WHAT TO INDEX
The closeness with which a book is to be indexed depends partly upon
the nature of its contents and partly upon the ideas of the author
or publisher. Some indexes contain only the page references; some
are so analytical that a reader can gain an excellent idea of the
"subject-matter itself. These, however, represent the two extremes. The"
ordinary index aims to give every reference necessary to enable the
"reader to locate easily the subject-matter for which he searches, but"
"not a synopsis of that subject-matter. The entries should cover, then,"
"with more or less minuteness, as desired, the following:"
"(_a_) Proper names, whether of persons, places, religious or political"
"bodies, etc."
(_b_) Events and periods.
(_c_) Titles of books to which reference is made.
(_d_) Specific topics or subjects.
(_e_) Definitions.
"distinguished for a particular line of study, should be given the"
preference. I think the prospects of the Indian Educational Service are
sufficiently high to attract the very best material. In colonial
Universities they manage to get very distinguished men without any
extravagantly high pay. Possibly the present departmental method of

"and training, Educational officers should first win a reputation as good"
teachers before the appointment is confirmed as they are transferred to
important colleges.

"the pay should be moderately high, but not extravagant, and settled once"

The difference between the pay of the higher and lower services should
be minimised.

pensioner elects to retire in England.

non-Europeans._--Passing on to the question of limitations that exist in
"the employment of Indians in the higher service, I should like to give"

that Indian graduates of European Universities who have distinguished
themselves in a remarkable manner do not for one reason or other find
facilities for entering the higher Educational Service.
"written against Luther. He will read him, he will soon take up something"
"to quiet the tumult. He succeeds in getting Aleander, who arrived at"
"Louvain in June, to prohibit preaching against him. The Pope still hopes"
"that Aleander will succeed in bringing back Erasmus, with whom he is"
"again on friendly terms, to the right track."
But Erasmus began to consider the only exit which was now left to him:
to leave Louvain and the Netherlands to regain his menaced independence.
The occasion to depart had long ago presented itself: the third edition
of his New Testament called him to Basle once more. It would not be a
"permanent departure, and he purposed to return to Louvain. On 28 October"
(his birthday) he left the town where he had spent four difficult years.
His chambers in the College of the Lily were reserved for him and he
left his books behind. On 15 November he reached Basle.
Soon the rumour spread that out of fear of Aleander he had saved himself
"by flight. But the idea, revived again in our days in spite of Erasmus's"
"own painstaking denial, that Aleander should have cunningly and"
"expressly driven him from the Netherlands, is inherently improbable. So"
"far as the Church was concerned, Erasmus would at almost any point be"
"more dangerous than at Louvain, in the headquarters of conservatism,"
"under immediate control of the strict Burgundian government, where, it"
"seemed, he could sooner or later be pressed into the service of the"
anti-Lutheran policy.
"It was this contingency, as Dr. Allen has correctly pointed out, which"
he feared and evaded. Not for his bodily safety did he emigrate; Erasmus
would not have been touched--he was far too valuable an asset for such
"measures. It was his mental independence, so dear to him above all else,"
"that he felt to be threatened; and, to safeguard that, he did not return"
to Louvain.
hour even to approach the receiving counter--Vivie walked across to
the _Palace Hotel_ and asked the night porter to get her a room. But
"every room was occupied, they said--Americans, British, wealthy war"
"refugees from southern Belgium, military officers of the Allies. The"
only concession made to her--for the porter could hold out little
hope of any neighbouring hotel having an empty room--was to allow
her to sit and sleep in one of the comfortable basket chairs in the
long atrium. At six o'clock a compassionate waiter who knew the name
of Mrs. Warren gave her daughter some coffee and milk and a
_brioche_. At seven she managed to get her luggage taken to one of
the trams at the corner of the Boulevard du Jardin Botanique. The
train service to Tervueren was suspended--and at the Porte de Namur
she would be transferred to the No. 45 tram which would take her out
to Tervueren.
Even at an early hour Brussels seemed crowded and as the tram passed
along the handsome boulevards the shops were being opened and
tourists were on their way to Waterloo in brakes. Every one seemed
"to think in mid-August, 1914, that Germany was destined to receive"
her _coup-de-grâce_ on the field of Waterloo. It would be so
appropriate. And no one--at any rate of those who spoke their
thoughts aloud--seemed to consider that Brussels was menaced.
"Leaving her luggage at the tram terminus, Vivie sped on foot through"
"forest roads, where the dew still glistened, to the Villa"
"Beau-séjour. Mrs. Warren was not yet dressed, but was rapturous in"
"her greeting. Her chauffeur had been called up, so the auto could"
"not go out, but a farm cart would be sent for the luggage."

"Vivie as she sat in the verandah in the morning sunshine, making a"

resembling a periscope.
"Being the first day of the month the ship's company was to be paid,"
and soon after six bells final preparations for the solemn rite were
in progress.
"At a quarter to one two ""G's""--the officers' call--sounded, and the"
"first hundred men, mustering by open list, assembled in the Port"
"Battery. On the quarter-deck tables were placed in position, on each"
of which were teak trays divided into small compartments by brass
strips. In each of these divisions a man's monthly pay and allowance
money had already been placed and checked by the paymaster and his
staff.
"Owing to the conditions of war-time the captain was not present, his"
duty of superintending the payment being taken by the commander. At
"the tables stood the staff-paymaster, the R.N.R. assistant-paymaster,"
and the chief writer.
"The staff-paymaster glanced at the commander, indicating that all was"
"in readiness. The commander gave the word to carry on, and the"
disbursing of coin began.
The assistant-paymaster called the men's names from a book. Each
"seaman stepped briskly forward to the chalk line, removed his cap,"
now churned to milky foam by the ever-growing throng of prisoners; and
"all the time the big plants gulped the sea harvest, faster and faster,"
"clanking and gnashing their metal jaws, while the mounds of salmon lay"
hip-deep to the crews that fed the butchering machines.
The time had come for man to take his toll.
Now dawned a period of feverish activity wherein no one might rest
"short of actual exhaustion. Haste became the cry, and comfort fled."
"At Emerson's cannery there fell a sudden panic, for fifty fishermen"
"quit. Returning from the banks on the night before the run started,"
they stacked their gear and notified Boyd Emerson of their
"determination. Then, despite his utmost efforts to dissuade them, they"
took their packs upon their shoulders and marched up the beach to
"Willis Marsh's plant. Larsen, the day-foreman, acted as their"
So the real size and bounds of the Republic must be set down as somewhat
indeterminate.
The circumstances under which Panama became an independent nation have
been set forth in an earlier chapter. It is safe to say that with the
"heavy investment made by the United States in the Canal Zone, on the"
"strength of a treaty with the infant republic, the sovereignty of Panama"
will be forever maintained against all comers--except the United States
itself. There are political philosophers who think that the Isthmus
state may yet be the southern boundary of the Great Republic of the
North. For the present however Uncle Sam is quite content with the Canal
Zone and a certain amount of diplomatic influence over the government of
Panama.

"A faint cold tremor crept through his veins,--his heart beat"
"violently,--again he vainly strove to open the great door. Was there a"
choir practising inside at this hour of the night? Surely not!
"Then,--from whence had this music its origin? Stooping, he bent his ear"
"to the crevice of the closed portal,--but, as suddenly as they had"
"begun, the harmonies ceased; and all was once more profoundly still."
"Drawing a long, deep breath, he stood for a moment amazed and lost in"
"thought--these sounds, he felt sure, were not of earth but of heaven!"
they had the same ringing sweetness as those he had heard on the Field
"of Ardath! What might they mean to him, here and now? Quick as a flash"
the answer came--DEATH! God had taken pity upon his solitary earth
"wanderings,--and the prayers of Edris had shortened his world-exile and"
"probation! He was to die! and that solemn singing was the warning,--or"
"the promise,--of his approaching end!"
"Yes! it must be so, he decided, as, with a strange, half-sad peace at"
"his heart, he quietly descended the steps of the Dom,-he would perhaps"
"be permitted to finish the work he was at present doing,--and"
"then,--then, the poet-pen would be laid aside forever, chains would be"
"undone, and he would be set at liberty! Such was his fixed idea. Was he"
"glad of the prospect, he asked himself? Yes, and No! For himself he was"
glad; but in these latter days he had come to understand the thousand
"wordless wants and aspirations of mankind,--wants and aspirations to"
which only the Poet can give fitting speech; he had begun to see how
much can be done to cheer and raise and ennoble the world by even ONE
"true, brave, earnest, and unselfish worker,--and he had attained to"
such a height in sympathetic comprehension of the difficulties and
"drawbacks of others, that he had ceased to consider himself at all in"
"the question, either with regard to the Present or the immortal"
"Usually, however, the peasants of the South have left off the costume."
"Usually it is the invisible soldiers' grey-green cloth, the Italian"
"khaki. Wherever you go, wherever you be, you see this khaki, this"
"grey-green war-clothing. How many millions of yards of the thick,"
"excellent, but hateful material the Italian government must have"
"provided I don't know: but enough to cover Italy with a felt carpet, I"
should think. It is everywhere. It cases the tiny children in stiff and
"neutral frocks and coats, it covers their extinguished fathers, and"
sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth. It is symbolic of
"the universal grey mist that has come over men, the extinguishing of all"
"bright individuality, the blotting out of all wild singleness. Oh"
democracy! Oh khaki democracy!

This is very different from Italian landscape. Italy is almost always
"dramatic, and perhaps invariably romantic. There is drama in the plains"
"of Lombardy, and romance in the Venetian lagoons, and sheer scenic"
excitement in nearly all the hilly parts of the peninsula. Perhaps it is
the natural floridity of lime-stone formations. But Italian landscape is
"really eighteenth-century landscape, to be represented in that"
romantic-classic manner which makes everything rather marvelous and very
"topical: aqueducts, and ruins upon sugar-loaf mountains, and craggy"
ravines and Wilhelm Meister water-falls: all up and down.
"Sardinia is another thing. Much wider, much more ordinary, not"
"up-and-down at all, but running away into the distance. Unremarkable"
"ridges of moor-like hills running away, perhaps to a bunch of dramatic"
"peaks on the southwest. This gives a sense of space, which is so lacking"
"in Italy. Lovely space about one, and traveling distances--nothing"
"finished, nothing final. It is like liberty itself, after the peaky"
"A figure went to and fro by the water's brim, a figure pale in the"
"moonlight, as the form of the restless dead. The man kneeling in the"
bracken pressed his hands over his breast; his face seemed to start
"out of the gloom as the face of one who struggles in the sea,"
"submerged, yet desperate."
"Francesco saw the woman halt beside the mere. He saw her bend, take"
"water in her palms and dash it in her face. Standing in the moonlight,"
"she smoothed her hair between her fingers, her hands shining white as"
ivory against the dark bosom of her dress. She seemed to murmur to
"herself the while, words wistful and full of woe. Once she thrust her"
"hands to the sky and cried: ""Francesco! Francesco!"" The man kneeling"
in the shadows quivered like a wind-shaken reed.
The moon climbed higher and the woman by the mere spread her cloak
upon a patch of heather and laid herself thereon. Not a sound broke
"the silence; the woods were mute, the air lifeless as the steely"
water. An hour passed. The figure on the heather lay still as an
"effigy on a tomb. The man in the bracken cast one look at the stars,"
then crossed himself and crept out into the moonlight.
"Holding the scabbard of his sword, he skirted the mere with shimmering"
"armor, went down upon his knees and crawled slowly over the grass."
Hours seemed to elapse before the black patch of heather spread crisp
"and dry beneath his hands. Breathing through dilated nostrils, he"
trembled like one who creeps to stab a sleeping friend. The moonlight
"seemed to shower sparks upon him, as with supernatural glory. Tense"
anguish seemed to fill the night with sound.
Two more paces and he was close at the woman's side. The heather
"crackled beneath his knees. He held his breath, crept nearer, and"
knelt so near that he could have kissed Ilaria's face. Her head lay

All the stations so far had had wire netting over the windows. This
means malaria-mosquitoes. The malaria climbs very high in Sardinia. The
"shallow upland valleys, moorland with their intense summer sun and the"
"riverless, boggy behaviour of the water breed the pest inevitably. But"
"not very terribly, as far as one can make out: August and September"
being the danger months. The natives don't like to admit there is any
"malaria: a tiny bit, they say, a tiny bit. As soon as you come to the"
_trees_ there is no more. So they say. For many miles the landscape is
"moorland and down-like, with no trees. But wait for the trees. Ah, the"
woods and forests of Gennargentu: the woods and forests higher up: no
malaria there!
"The little engine whisks up and up, around its loopy curves as if it"
were going to bite its own tail: we being the tail: then suddenly dives
over the sky-line out of sight. And the landscape changes. The famous
"woods begin to appear. At first it is only hazel-thickets, miles of"
"hazel-thickets, all wild, with a few black cattle trying to peep at us"
out of the green myrtle and arbutus scrub which forms the undergrowth;
"and a couple of rare, wild peasants peering at the train. They wear the"
"black sheepskin tunic, with the wool outside, and the long stocking"
caps. Like cattle they too peer out from between deep bushes. The myrtle
"scrub here rises man-high, and cattle and men are smothered in it. The"
big hazels rise bare above. It must be difficult getting about in these
parts.
"Sometimes, in the distance one sees a black-and-white peasant riding"
"lonely across a more open place, a tiny vivid figure. I like so much the"
proud instinct which makes a living creature distinguish itself from its
background. I hate the rabbity khaki protection-colouration. A
"black-and-white peasant on his pony, only a dot in the distance beyond"
"ravelled round everything. Here men don't idealise women, by the looks"
"of things. Here they don't make these great leering eyes, the inevitable"
yours-to-command look of Italian males. When the men from the country
"look at these women, then it is Mind-yourself, my lady. I should think"
the grovelling Madonna-worship is not much of a Sardinian feature. These
"women have to look out for themselves, keep their own back-bone stiff"
and their knuckles hard. Man is going to be male Lord if he can. And
"woman isn't going to give him too much of his own way, either. So there"
"you have it, the fine old martial split between the sexes. It is tonic"
"and splendid, really, after so much sticky intermingling and"
"backboneless Madonna-worship. The Sardinian isn't looking for the ""noble"
"woman nobly planned."" No, thank you. He wants that young madam over"
"there, a young stiff-necked generation that she is. Far better sport"
than with the nobly-planned sort: hollow frauds that they are. Better
"sport too than with a Carmen, who gives herself away too much, In these"
"women there is something shy and defiant and un-get-atable. The defiant,"
"splendid split between the sexes, each absolutely determined to defend"
"his side, her side, from assault. So the meeting has a certain wild,"
"salty savour, each the deadly unknown to the other. And at the same"
"time, each his own, her own native pride and courage, taking the"
dangerous leap and scrambling back.
"Give me the old, salty way of love. How I am nauseated with sentiment"
"and nobility, the macaroni slithery-slobbery mess of modern adorations."

One sees a few fascinating faces in Cagliari: those great dark unlighted
"eyes. There are fascinating dark eyes in Sicily, bright, big, with an"
"impudent point of light, and a curious roll, and long lashes: the eyes"
"of old Greece, surely. But here one sees eyes of soft, blank darkness,"
"all velvet, with no imp looking out of them. And they strike a stranger,"
"passed in front and back of the body over a string tied around the hips,"
the forward extremity being left longer and flowing like an apron. On
feast days the string is replaced by a broad band of white beads. Around
the neck and chest they wear thick cords of the same beads and on their
wrists broad silver cuffs. Hats are not used; the hair is usually tied
with a red ribbon and often adorned with the bright flowers of the
forest.
"“The female outfit is not less simple, consisting of a piece of calico"
"less than three feet wide and about nine feet long, wrapped around the"
lower part of the body and reaching a little below the knees. This is
"all, except that the neck is more or less loaded with beads or silver"
"coins. But for this the women display less coquetry than the men, which"
may be because they feel sufficiently adorned with their mere natural
"charms. Fondness for cheap rings is, however, common to both sexes, and"
little children often wear earrings or pendants.

“The scantiness of the clothing is remedied very effectually by face and
"body painting, in which black and red colors are used, the first"
exclusively for daily wear. At times men and women are painted black
from the waist down; at other times it is the whole body or only the
"hands and feet, etc., all according to the day’s fashion, as was"
explained by one of our guides. For feast days the paintings are an
"elaborate and artistic affair, consisting of elegantly drawn lines and"
patterns--red and black or simply black--which clothe the body as
effectually as any costly dress.
"foundling hospitals, apparently), in 1890 the total Swedish rate was"
"slightly below 1 to 10, while in Norway it was 1 to 14. The modern"
facilities for emigration have further affected conjugal habits.
"Latterly, however, there are evidences of a new growth of intelligent"
control.
In recent years the statistics of emigration and population tell a
fairly plain story. In Norway and Sweden alike the excess of births over
"deaths reached nearly its highest in 1887, the figures being 63,942 for"
"Sweden and 29,233 for Norway. In 1887, however, emigration was about its"
"maximum in both countries, 50,786 leaving Sweden and 20,706 leaving"
"Norway. Thereafter the birth-rate rapidly fell, and the emigration,"
"though fluctuating, has never again risen in Sweden to the volume of"
"1887-88, though it has in Norway. But when, after falling to 43,728 in"
"1892, the excess of Swedish births over deaths rises to 60,231 in 1895,"
"while the emigration falls from 45,000 in 1892 to 13,000 in 1894, it is"
clear that the lesson of regulation is still very imperfectly learned.
"Norway shows the same fluctuations, the excess of births rising from"
"23,600 in 1892 to nearly 32,000 in 1896, and again from 27,685 in 1908"
"to 29,804 in 1909, doubtless because of ups and downs in the harvests,"
"as shown in the increase of marriages from 12,742 in 1892 to 13,962 in"
1896.
In Denmark the progression has been similar. There the excess of births
"over deaths was so far at its maximum in 1886, the figures being 29,986"
"in a population of a little over 2,000,000; whereafter they slowly"
"decreased, till in 1893 the excess was only 26,235. All the while"
"emigration was active, gradually rising from 4,346 in 1885 to 10,382 in"
"1891; then again falling to 2,876 in 1896, when the surplus of births"
"over deaths was 34,181--a development sure to force more emigration. In"
"1911 the population was 2,775,076--a rapid rise; and in 1910 the surplus"
"of births over deaths was 40,110. The Scandinavians are thus still in"
This was written by Erasmus to a member of the University of Leipzig in
December 1520. This one-sided and academic conception of the great
"events, a conception which arose in the study of a recluse bending over"
"his books, did more than anything else to prevent Erasmus from"
understanding the true nature and purport of the Reformation.
CHAPTER XVI
FIRST YEARS OF THE REFORMATION
Beginning of the relations between Erasmus and Luther--
"Archbishop Albert of Mayence, 1517--Progress of the"
Reformation--Luther tries to bring about a _rapprochement_ with
"Erasmus, March 1519--Erasmus keeps aloof; fancies he may yet act"
as a conciliator--His attitude becomes ambiguous--He denies ever
more emphatically all relations with Luther and resolves to
remain a spectator--He is pressed by either camp to take
"sides--Aleander in the Netherlands--The Diet of Worms,"
"1521--Erasmus leaves Louvain to safeguard his freedom, October"
1521
"About the close of 1516, Erasmus received a letter from the librarian"
"and secretary of Frederick, elector of Saxony, George Spalatinus,"
written in the respectful and reverential tone in which the great man
was now approached. 'We all esteem you here most highly; the elector has
all your books in his library and intends to buy everything you may
publish in future.' But the object of Spalatinus's letter was the
"execution of a friend's commission. An Augustinian ecclesiastic, a great"
"acquire no intelligence sitting down in Robat, whereas, if he came"
"with me, he would get all he wanted at first hand!"
I set myself to pick up all the information I could about the
"conditions of British ""influence"" in this part of Persia, and on"
the borders of Afghanistan. To make it in any way clear why we had
any influence here at all we must revert to the old fear of the
"threatened advance of Russia on India, in the days before Russia"
became our ally in the Great War.
Slowly and gradually Russia had been extending her influence in the
Pamirs until her outposts on the Oxus River were only eight marches
"from Chitral. Evidently, as a wide counter, strategic move, the"
Indian Government had sought to increase its own influence with
Persia and Afghanistan by pushing forward her outposts to Robat and
Nasaratabad.
"Consequently, at the time of which I am writing, Robat, Nasaratabad"
and Birjand were held lightly by chains of small posts composed
entirely of Indian troops and some local levies commanded by British
"officers. Our lines of communication running from Birjand to Nushki,"
"a distance of about six hundred miles, were held, in widely scattered"
"posts, by only one battalion of Indian Infantry and one regiment of"
Indian Cavalry and four mountain guns. Thus it will be seen that it
was very difficult to obtain any troops for a movable column.
"A British Consulate had also been established at Nasaratabad, which"
is on the borders of Afghanistan and Persia. During the War the
"importance and influence of the Consul increased considerably, as he"
was in a position to gather information which was of great value to
"the military commanders, who constantly sought his advice."
In this brief sketch it is quite impossible to relate the many
changes of species and genera during the Silurian.
CORALS. Some of the more common types are familiarly known as cup
"corals, honeycomb corals, and chain corals. In the CUP CORALS the"
most important feature is the development of radiating vertical
"partitions, or SEPTA, in the cell of the polyp. Some of the cup"
"corals grew in hemispherical colonies (Fig. 288), while many were"
"separate individuals (Fig. 289), building a single conical, or"
"horn-shaped cell, which sometimes reached the extreme size of a"
foot in length and two or three inches in diameter.
"HONEYCOMB CORALS consist of masses of small, close-set prismatic"
"cells, each crossed by horizontal partitions, or TABULAE, while"
"the septa are rudimentary, being represented by faintly projecting"
ridges or rows of spines.
CHAIN CORALS are also marked by tabulae. Their cells form
"elliptical tubes, touching each other at the edges, and appearing"
in cross section like the links of a chain. They became extinct at
the end of the Silurian.
The corals of the SYRINGOPORA family are similar in structure to
"chain corals, but the tubular columns are connected only in"
places.
To the echinoderms there is now added the BLASTOID (bud-shaped).
"The blastoid is stemmed and armless, and its globular ""head"" or"
"""calyx,"" with its five petal-like divisions, resembles a flower"
"bud. The blastoids became more abundant in the Devonian,"
"culminated in the Carboniferous, and disappeared at the end of the"
Paleozoic.
"discovered embrace all the leading types of invertebrate life, and"
are so varied that we must believe that their lines of descent
stretch far back into the pre-Cambrian past.
"PLANTS. No remains of plants have been found in Cambrian strata,"
"except some doubtful markings, as of seaweed."
"SPONGES. The sponges, the lowest of the multicellular animals,"
were represented by several orders. Their fossils are recognized
"by the siliceous spicules, which, as in modern sponges, either"
were scattered through a mass of horny fibers or were connected in
a flinty framework.
COELENTERATES. This subkingdom includes two classes of interest to
"the geologist,--the HYDROZOA, such as the fresh-water hydra and"
"the jellyfish, and the CORALS. Both classes existed in the"
Cambrian.
The Hydrozoa were represented not only by jellyfish but also by
"the GRAPTOLITE, which takes its name from a fancied resemblance of"
some of its forms to a quill pen. It was a composite animal with a
"horny framework, the individuals of the colony living in cells"
"strung on one or both sides along a hollow stem, and communicating"
by means of a common flesh in this central tube. Some graptolites
"were straight, and some curved or spiral; some were single"
"stemmed, and others consisted of several radial stems united."
Graptolites occur but rarely in the Upper Cambrian. In the
"Ordovician and Silurian they are very plentiful, and at the close"
"of the Silurian they pass out of existence, never to return."
"CORALS are very rarely found in the Cambrian, and the description"
of their primitive types is postponed to later chapters treating
she was to wait by the seashore. So at last the Master Girl had to give
in.
"""But when you get there, you must not take time to greet a single"
"person. You must at once go to the stable, harness the horses, and drive"
"back as swiftly as you can. They will all come to meet you, but you"
"must act as though you did not see them, and must not take a single bite"
"to eat. If you do not do that, you will make both of us unhappy,"" said"
she. And he promised to do as she had said.
"But when he got home to the castle, one of his brothers was just getting"
"married, and the bride and all the guests were already there. They all"
"crowded around him and asked him this, and asked him that, and wanted to"
"lead him in. But he acted as though he saw none of them, led out the"
"horses, and began to put them to the coach. And since they could by no"
"manner of means induce him to come into the castle, they came out with"
again. What th' deuce d'ye mean by shouting at me as if I were a drunken
deck-hand! Speak to me above a whisper now--and you'll see what'll
"happen to you. That's the police-boat pulling past."""
The opportune plash of oars had suggested to him that plausible threat.
"Captain Dove, listening intently, crouched back against the bulkhead,"
"his blinking, hot, suspicious eyes on Slyne's. The boat passed on. But"
"he had found time to observe that Slyne was in evening dress, with an"
expensive fur coat to keep the cold out. And Slyne's cool contempt for
his ill-temper would seem to have impressed him no less than Slyne's air
of solid prosperity.
"He himself, it appeared, had had care and adversity for his companions"
ever since parting with his former friend. His chief aim in calling at
"Genoa had been cheap coal and cheaper repairs, and he thought that he"
was less likely to be recognised there than elsewhere in the
"They indicate whether in any region the climate was tropical,"
"temperate, or arctic. Since species spread slowly from some center"
of dispersion where they originate until some barrier limits their
"migration farther, the occurrence of the same species in rocks of"
the same system in different countries implies the absence of such
barriers at the period. Thus in the collection of antarctic
fossils referred to on page 294 there were shallow-water marine
shells identical in species with Mesozoic shells found in India
and in the southern extremity of South America. Since such
organisms are not distributed by the currents of the deep sea and
"cannot migrate along its bottom, we infer a shallow-water"
"connection in Mesozoic times between India, South America, and the"
antarctic region. Such a shallow-water connection would be offered
along the marginal shelf of a continent uniting these now widely
separated countries.
CHAPTER XV
THE PRE-CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS
THE EARTH'S BEGINNINGS. The geological record does not tell us of
"the beginnings of the earth. The history of the planet, as we have"
"every reason to believe, stretches far back beyond the period of"
"the oldest stratified rocks, and is involved in the history of the"
"solar system and of the nebula,--the cloud of glowing gases or of"
"cosmic dust,--from which the sun and planets are believed to have"
been derived.
"brown. Meanwhile, the abdomen was somewhat painful. When seen"
on the third day he had ceased to vomit for three hours. The
"face was slightly anxious, and the patient lay on the ground"
"with the lower extremities extended. Temperature 99°, pulse 72,"
"fair strength. Respirations 32, shallow. Tongue moist, lightly"
"furred, bowels not open for four days. He slept fairly last"
"night. Abdomen soft, moving well with respiration, no"
"distension, slight tenderness below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus, and local dulness in right flank."
"The next day the pulse fell to 60 and the bowels acted, but"
there was no change in the local condition. The man looked
"somewhat ill until the end of a week, but was then sent to the"
"Base, and at the expiration of a month was sent home well."
(177*) Wounded at Modder River. Two apertures of _entry_
(Mauser); (_a_) below cartilage of eighth rib in left nipple
line; (_b_) 2 inches below and 4-1/2 inches to the left of the
"median line. No exit wound discovered, and no track could be"
"palpated between the two openings, which were both circular and"
depressed. When seen on fourth day there was tenderness in the
"lower half of the abdomen, and the left thigh was held in a"
"flexed position. Respirations 20, respiratory movement confined"
"to upper half of abdominal wall. Pulse 70, temperature 99°."
"Tongue moist, covered with white fur; bowels confined since the"
accident; no sickness. The patient remained under observation
"thirteen days, during which time pain and difficulty in"
"movement of the left thigh persisted, also slight tenderness in"
the lower part of the abdomen; but at the end of a month he was
"sent to England well, but unfit to take further part in the"
"campaign. I thought the bullet might be in the left psoas, but"
it was not localised.
"the train. In vain. The train inexorably pursues its course. Prancing,"
she reaches one end of the platform as we leave the other end. Then she
"realizes it is not going to stop for her. And then, oh horror, her long"
arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train: then
flung aloft to God: then brought down in absolute despair on her head.
"And this is the last sight we have of her, clutching her poor head in"
agony and doubling forward. She is left--she is abandoned.
The poor fat husband has been all the time on the little outside
"platform at the end of the carriage, holding out his hand to her and"
shouting frenzied scolding to her and frenzied yells for the train to
stop. And the train has not stopped. And she is left--left on that
God-forsaken station in the waning light.
"So, his face all bright, his eyes round and bright as two stars,"
"absolutely transfigured by dismay, chagrin, anger and distress, he comes"
"and sits in his seat, ablaze, stiff, speechless. His face is almost"
beautiful in its blaze of conflicting emotions. For some time he is as
if unconscious in the midst of his feelings. Then anger and resentment
"crop out of his consternation. He turns with a flash to the long-nosed,"
"insidious, Phoenician-looking guard. Why couldn't they stop the train"
"for her! And immediately, as if someone had set fire to him, off flares"
the guard. Heh!--the train can't stop for every person's convenience!
The train is a train--the time-table is a time-table. What did the old
woman want to take her trips down the line for? Heh! She pays the
penalty for her own inconsiderateness. Had _she_ paid for the
train--heh? And the fat man all the time firing off his unheeding and
"unheeded answers. One minute--only one minute--if he, the conductor had"
"told the driver! if he, the conductor, had shouted! A poor woman! Not"
another train! What was she going to do! Her ticket? And no money. A
poor woman--
The gypsum and salt deposits of the Salina show that toward the
close of the Silurian period a slight oscillation brought the sea
"floor nearer to the surface, and at the north cut off extensive"
"tracts from the interior sea. In these wide lagoons, which now and"
then regained access to the open sea and obtained new supplies of
"salt water, beds of salt and gypsum were deposited as the briny"
waters became concentrated by evaporation under a desert climate.
Along with these beds there were also laid shales and impure
limestones.
"In New York the ""salt pans"" of the Salina extended over an area"
one hundred and fifty miles long from east to west and sixty miles
"wide, and similar salt marshes occurred as far west as Cleveland,"
"Ohio, and Goderich on Lake Huron. At Ithaca, New York, the series"
"is fifteen hundred feet thick, and is buried beneath an equal"
thickness of later strata. It includes two hundred and fifty feet
"of solid salt, in several distinct beds, each sealed within the"
shales of the series.
Would you expect to find ancient beds of rock salt inclosed in
beds of pervious sandstone?
The salt beds of the Salina are of great value. They are reached
"by well borings, and their brines are evaporated by solar heat and"
by boiling. The rock salt is also mined from deep shafts.
"Similar deposits of salt, formed under like conditions, occur in"
the rocks of later systems down to the present. The salt beds of
"Texas are Permian, those of Kansas are Permian, and those of"
Louisiana are Tertiary.
"to form a much better ""idea of the greatness of the religion of their"
"fathers""? Does it not seem strange that so many hundreds of these"
relics should be kept in those enlightened and happy countries like
"Italy, where ""the achievements of Catholic life"" are so well known,"
"and where Mother Church has for centuries had full sway, and that none"
"of them should be brought to these benighted Protestant regions, where"
they could effect such a salutary change in the faith of the people?
"But, seriously, as I added to my friend in the conversation referred"
"to, I have a better opinion of the intelligence of our good Roman"
Catholic people in America than to believe that they put the slightest
credence in these childish superstitions. Whatever the bishop above
"quoted may believe, I am confident that the intelligent Roman Catholic"
people of our country have no more faith in many of these alleged
relics than we have.

"[8] In July of this year, 1903, while the Roman Catholic world was"
"greatly exercised over the grave illness of the late Pope, Leo XIII.,"
the Associated Press dispatches from Naples reported that the blood of
St. Januarius had miraculously liquefied at that unusual time in token
that the prayers offered for the Pope's recovery had been answered.
The Archbishop of Naples has up to the present time vouchsafed
"no explanation of the fact that the Pope died a few days later,"
notwithstanding this miraculous assurance that he would recover.
"drift into Self and Wrong, than to strike out brave arms, and swim,"
"despite all difficulty, toward God and Right, yet if we once take the"
"latter course, we shall find it the most natural and the least"
fatiguing. And with every separate stroke of high endeavor we carry
"others with us,--we raise our race,--we bear it onward,--upward! And"
"the true reward, or best result of fame, is, that having succeeded in"
"winning brief attention from the multitude, a man may be able to"
pronounce one of God's lightning messages of inspired Truth plainly to
"them, while they are yet willing to stand and listen. This momentary"
"hearing from the people is, as I take it, the sole reward any writer"
"can dare to hope for,--and when he obtains it, he should remember that"
"his audience remains with him but a very short while,--so that it is"
"his duty to see that he employ his chance WELL, not to win applause for"
"himself, but to cheer and lift others to noble thought, and still more"
"noble fulfilment."""
Villiers regarded him wistfully.
"""Alwyn, my dear fellow, do you want to be the Sisyphus of this"
"era?--You will find the stone of Evil heavy to roll upward,--moreover,"
it will exhibit the usually painful tendency to slip back and crush
"you!"""
"""How can it crush me?"" asked his friend with a serene smile. ""My heart"
"cannot be broken, or my spirit dismayed, and as for my body, it can but"
"die,--and death comes to every man! I would rather try to roll up the"
"stone, however fruitless the task, than sit idly looking at it, and"
"doing nothing!"""
"""Your heart cannot be broken? Ah! how do you know"" ... and Villiers"
"shook his head dubiously--""What man can be certain of his own destiny?"""
No foot is allowed to touch the _Scala Santa_; it must be ascended
on the knees. A number of people were going up in this way when
"we entered, pausing on each step to repeat a prayer, for which"
indulgences are granted by the Pope. There are stairways on each
"side, by which those who have thus crawled up may walk down. The"
"only man I know of that ever walked down the Holy Stairs themselves,"
"and the most illustrious man that ever crawled up them on his knees,"
"was Martin Luther. When he had mounted slowly half way up, step by"
"step on his knees, he seemed to hear a voice saying, ""The just shall"
"live by faith."" Martin Luther rose from his knees, walked down the"
"staircase, and left the place a free man so far as this superstition"
"was concerned, and shortly afterwards became the most formidable foe"
that ever assailed the falsehood and corruption of the Romish Church.
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Portrait and the Shoes of Christ.]
At the top of the Scala Santa we saw through a grating the beautiful
silver tabernacle containing the great relic which has given to this
"chapel the name of _Sancta Sanctorum_, viz.: the portrait of Christ,"
"held by the Romish Church to be authentic, having been drawn in outline"
"by St. Luke and finished by an angel, whence its name ""Acheiropoëton,"""
"_i. e._, the picture made without hands. The relic chamber here"
"contains fragments of the true cross, the sandals of Christ, and ""the"
iron bar of Hades which he brought away with him from that doleful
"region,""[10] but we did not see these."
"[Sidenote: The Inscription on the Cross, and the Finger of Thomas.]"
A short walk beyond the Scala Santa and the Lateran brings us to the
"Church of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, which is specially rich in relics."
Here our party was shown a piece of the true cross of Christ and the
that this was the man he hated. He simply felt an overwhelming
"thankfulness that some one had come at last, and obeyed orders"
mechanically and without question.
"But as his peavey gripped the end of that troublesome log, there"
suddenly flamed into Curly’s mind--temptation. Bainbridge stood below
"him, perched perilously on the very face of the jam. A little"
thrust--the tiniest movement of the riverman’s arm--would send him
"plunging into the stream, while another movement would suffice to drop"
one of the looser logs upon him. There were no witnesses; the whole
"affair would pass as an unfortunate accident. A chance like this, so"
"easy, so absolutely safe, would never come again."
"“Now!” broke in the crisp voice of the lumberman. “Hard over, boy."
Toward me--all you know how!”
Curly’s muscles strained as he threw every ounce of strength into the
pull. The key log creaked and groaned as if agony but was thrust
"gradually forward. Curly felt it moving faster and faster, and"
instinctively he prepared for that backward leap which would carry him
out of reach of the treacherous avalanche of falling logs.
A second later his peavey was torn from his hands by the sudden collapse
of half the face of the jam. The logs at his side vanished in the
"unexpected rush, but that on which he stood remained firm for a precious"
moment. Below him he saw Bainbridge whirl like a cat and grasp for
"something solid. Instantly he bent over, reaching out both callous,"
"muscular hands, and as swiftly Bob gripped them. There was a heave, an"
"upward scramble, another crash as the remainder of the jam disappeared"
"into the foaming water. But the two men had leaped in time, and a moment"
later they were standing together on the bank.
"her, too! I only wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!"""
"said he. ""Well, just wait until to-morrow,"" said the giant, ""and then I"
"will lead you to her myself,"" he said. ""A thousand thanks, master,"" said"
"the king's son, ""but I think you are only joking!"" The following day the"
giant took him to the Master Girl.
"""Now you must slaughter him, and cook him in the big kettle, you know"
"which one I mean. And when the soup is ready, you can call me,"" said the"
"giant, and he lay down on the bench to sleep, and at once began to snore"
"so that the hills shook. Then the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the"
"youth's little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the bench."
"Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes and other rubbish she"
"could find, and threw them all into the kettle. And then she took a"
"chest of gold-dust, and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that hung"
"over the door, and a golden apple, and two golden hens, and left the"
giant's castle together with the king's son as quickly as possible.
"After a time they came to the sea, and they sailed across; though where"
they got the ship I do not exactly know.
"Now when the giant had been sleeping quite a while, he began to stretch"
"himself on his bench. ""Is dinner ready yet?"" he asked. ""Just begun!"""
said the first drop of blood on the bench. Then the giant turned
"around, went to sleep again, and went on sleeping for quite some time."
"Then he again turned around a little. ""Is dinner not ready yet?"" he"
"said, but did not open his eyes--nor had he done so the first time--for"
"he was still half asleep. ""It is half ready!"" called out the second drop"
"of blood, and then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. He turned"
around on the bench and took another nap. After he had slept a couple of
"hours longer, he once more began to move about and stretch: ""Is dinner"
"still not ready?"" said he. ""Ready!"" answered the third drop of blood."
The giant sat up and rubbed his eyes. But he could not see who had
"called him, and so he called out to the Master Girl. But no one answered"

"The tapster vanished quickly to do the bidding of the guests, and Grey"
"turned a wondering glance upon the Old Lion, whose face, framed in its"
"shaggy gray hair, looked more leonine than ever, the bright eyes shining"
"out of deep caverns from under bushy brows, the rugged features full of"
"power, not unmixed with a curious underlying ferocity.  But the glance"
bent upon Grey was kindly enough.

"Tell me your name.  Tell me of yourself, for you were not born to the"

"""My name is Grey,"" was the ready answer.  Grey had dropped his title and"
"patronymic with his fallen fortunes, and used his mother’s name alone."
"""My father was a country gentleman.  I was gently reared, and was at one"
"time a scholar at Oxford, where I dreamed many dreams.  Afterwards I"
"travelled abroad, returning to find my father dead and my home in the"

fortune I received I squandered foolishly in a few weeks of gay living
with young bloods of the town.  I wakened from my dream to find myself
"well-nigh penniless, disgusted alike with myself and those I had called"
my friends. I have ever been something ambitious.  I misdoubt me I am a
fool; but I did think that I might win laurels upon the field of
"literature.  I have never lost the trick of rhyming, and jotting down"
"such things as pleased my fancy, whether in prose or in verse. Do I"
"weary you with my tale?"""
"the probability of an adventure with tolerant amusement, such was his"
inherent love of it and so developed was his capacity for
"""playing-true,"" that he sometimes made me think almost anything might"
"turn up. I was quite unaware that my mother had written him, or that he,"
"in return, had promised to keep her fully advised of my improvement--a"
state which was already beginning.
"""I carn't see how you help talking of it, sir--all that gas, and liquid"
"fire, and bursting shells,"" Gates stared at him in perplexity."
"""It's an effort, but I refuse to turn phonograph like some of the old"
"timers--not that I love 'em any less for it, Lord knows!"" Then he began"
"to laugh, and turned to me, adding: ""One of the first things I did after"
getting home was to drop in on a very dear gentleman who's been a friend
"of our family since the Ark. He came at me with open arms, crying:"
"'Well, Thomas, sit right down and tell me about your experiences!' I"
side-tracked that--for I hate the word. We didn't go over for
"_experiences_! But he wouldn't be denied. 'Try to think,' he commanded."
"'Why, Thomas, old as I am, I remember when Stonewall Jackson struck that"
"brilliant blow----' and you can shoot me for a spy, Jack, if he didn't"
keep me there five hours while he fought the entire Civil War! No

"But Tommy's talk, to which the crew listened in rapt attention, consumed"
"nearer six than two, or even five hours. These men were hungry for"
authentic first-hand information--being too old to have sought it for
themselves.
It must not be inferred that the _Whim's_ crew consisted of the ancient
and decrepit. More than once my father had said that if ever he should
get in a tight place there was no band of six he would rather have at
"his back than this one headed by Gates; nor did he except Pete, the"
"""Ah!"" cried the girl, laying her hand again on his cuff, ""that is"
because they do not wish you to share their plunder. But tell them that
you care nothing for that and they will welcome you readily enough. The
"place is plague-stricken, I tell you. The palace lies open. Little"
crook-backed Chepe brought me word. He says he adores me. He is of the
"village of Frias, back there behind the hills. I do not love him, even"
"though he has a bitter heart and can hate well. Therefore I suffer him."""
The Sergeant rose to his feet and looked compassionately down at the
"vivid little figure before him. The hair, dense and black, the blue"
"eyes, the red-knotted handkerchief, the white teeth that showed between"
the parted lips clean and sharp as those of a wild animal. Cardono had
"seen many things on his travels, but never anything like this. His soul"
"was moved within him. In the deeps of his heart, the heart of a Spanish"
"gipsy, there was an infinite sympathy for any one who takes up the blood"
"feud, who, in the face of all difficulties, swears the _vendetta_. But"
"the slim arms, the spare willowy body, the little white sandalled feet"
of the little girl--these overcame him with a pitifully amused sense of
the disproportion of means to end.
"""Have you no brother, Señorita?"" he said, using by instinct the title of"
respect which the little girl loved the most. She saw his point in a
moment.
"""A brother--yes, Don José! But my brother is a cur, a dog that eats"
offal. Pah! I spit upon him. He hath taken favours from the woman. He
hath handled her money. He would clean the shoes they twain leave at
their chamber door. A brother--yes; the back of my hand to such
brothers! But after to-night he shall have no offal to eat--no bones
thrown under the table to pick. For in one slaying I will kill the

the foisted changeling brat whom they miscall the daughter of Fernando

"To Marsh, already furious at the trick the ice had played him, this"
forced proximity to his rival brought home with added irony the fact
"that he had been forestalled, while it emphasized his knowledge that"
henceforth the conflict would be carried on at closer quarters. It
"would be a contest between two men, both determined to win by fair"
means or foul.
"Emerson was a dream-dazzled youth, striving like a knight-errant for"
"the love of a lady and the glory of conquest, but he was also a born"
"fighter, and in every emergency he had shown himself as able as his"
experienced opponent.
As Marsh looked about and saw how much Boyd's well-directed energy was
"accomplishing, he was conscious of a slight disheartenment. Still, he"
"was on his own ground, he had the advantage of superior force, and"
though he was humiliated by his failure to throttle the hostile
"enterprise in its beginning, he was by no means at the end of his"
"expedients. He was curious to see his rival in action, and he decided"
to visit him and test his temper.
"It was on the afternoon following his arrival that Marsh, after a tour"
"of inspection, landed from his launch and strolled up to where Boyd"
"Emerson was at work. He was greeted courteously, if a bit coolly, and"
"found, as on their last meeting, that his own bearing was reflected"
"exactly in that of Boyd. Both men, beneath the scant politeness of"
"their outward manner, were aware that the time for ceremony had passed."
Here in the Northland they faced each other at last as man to man.

his feet during the past two days; I don't know what he has
discovered; but if he does not get to the bottom of the business in
"double-quick time we shall have the whole Board of Admiralty, Scotland"
"Yard, and possibly the War Cabinet down upon us. Think, too, of the"
"disgrace to this shipbuilding city of which we are all so proud."""
"""We shall know something soon,"" I said, ""for, if I mistake not, here"
"comes Dawson."" The electric bell at the front door had buzzed, and"
"Cary, slipping from the room, presently returned with a man who to me,"
"at the first glance, was a complete stranger. I sprang up, moved round"
"to a position whence I could see clearly the visitor's ears, and"
"gasped. It was Dawson beyond a doubt, but it was not the Dawson whom I"
had known in the north. So what I had vaguely surmised was
true--Cary's Dawson and Copplestone's Dawson were utterly unlike.
"Dawson winked at me, glanced towards Cary, and shook his head; from"
which I gathered that he did not desire his appearance to be the
"subject of comment. I therefore greeted him without remark, and, as he"
"sat down under the electric lights, examined him in detail. This"
Dawson was ten years older than the man whom I had known and fenced
"with. The hair of this one was lank and grey, while that of mine was"
"brown and curly; the face of this one was white and thin, while the"
face of mine was rather full and ruddy. The teeth were different--I
"found out afterwards that Dawson, who had few teeth of his own,"
possessed several artificial sets of varied patterns--the shape of the
"mouth was different, the nose was different. I could never have"
recognised the man before me had I not possessed that clue to identity
furnished by his unchanging ears.
"""So, Dawson,"" said I slowly, ""we meet again. Permit me to say that I"
"congratulate you. It is very well done."""
"He grinned and glanced at the unconscious Cary. ""You are learning."
every possible cutter of the wires on the mat before the Captain and
"me. We have looked into all their records, had their homes visited and"
"their people questioned, inquired of their habits--Mr. Copplestone,"
"here, knows what comes of drink--and found out how they spend their"
wages. Yet we have discovered nothing. It is the worst puzzle that
"I've struck. When and how the gun cable was cut I can't tell you, but"
whoever did it is much too clever to be about. He must have been
"exactly informed of the lie and use of the cables, had with him the"
"proper tools, and used them in some fraction of a minute when he"
wasn't under the eye of my own man whose business it was to watch
everybody and suspect everybody. I thought that I had schemed out a
pretty thorough system; up to now it has worked fine. Whenever we have
"had the slightest reason to suspect any man, we have had him kept off"
"the ship and watched. We have run down a lot of footling spies, too"
"stupid to give us a minute's anxiety, but this man who cut the"
"_Antinous_'s wires is of a different calibre altogether. He is AI, and"
"when I catch him, as I certainly shall, I will take off my hat to"
"him."""
"""You say that the _Antinous_ is all right now?"" I observed."
"""Yes. I saw her towed out of the repair basin an hour ago, and she"
must be away down the river by this time. It is not of her that I'm
"thinking, but of the other ships which are constantly in and out for"
"repairs. There are always a dozen here of various craft, usually small"
stuff. While the man who cut those wires is unknown I shall be in a
"perfect fever, and so will the Admiral-Superintendent. We'll get the"
"beauty sooner or later, but if it is later, there may be had mischief"
"done. If he can cut wires in one ship, he may do much worse things in"
"some other. The responsibility rests on me, and it is rather"
"crushing."""
for ever. But I _wouldn't_ think about it. I _would_ enjoy the present.
But the calm waters of happiness had been ruffled and it was beyond my
"power to restore their tranquillity. I began to think of many things, of"
"the war itself, of the possible offensive, and soon the fretful"
"rebellious discontent, that obsessed all those of us who had not lost"
"their souls, began to reassert itself."
But why not desert? Why not escape to the south of France? Why not enjoy
"a week, a fortnight, a month of freedom? I would be caught in the end--I"
"would be punished. I would receive Number 1 Field Punishment, and I"
"would be tied to a wheel or post, but nevertheless it would be worth"
it! I imagined myself slipping out of camp at night and walking until
"dawn. Then I would sleep in some wood or copse and then walk on again,"
calling at remote farms to buy bread and eggs and milk. I would reach
"the little village, the main street winding between white houses and"
flooded with brilliant moonlight. I would climb the wall and drop into
the familiar garden and await the morning. Then I would knock at the
"door and I would be welcomed by an old peasant woman, and she would ask:"
"""Tu viens en perme?"" How could I answer that question? It worried me, I"
felt it was spoiling my dream. But I dreamt on and at the same time
battled against increasing depression. Even a few days of freedom would
"be a break, a change from routine. And would the little village be the"
"same as when I saw it last? No, it would be different, it would be at"
"war. I might escape from the army, but I could never escape from the"
war. My dream had vanished.
But I _would_ make the best of things. I _would_ enjoy the immediate
present--was I not losing hours of sheer pleasure by harbouring these
thoughts and ignoring the beauty of the day?
Some distance ahead was a farm of the usual Flemish type--a thatched
"roof, whitewashed walls, and green shutters. Near by was a little pond"
a nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot
"that was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things"
"as eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked"
the white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the
Institute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially
across the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and
"the ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room."
And in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'
"Foundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr."
It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America
of juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America
of the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the
off-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War
and the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly
rocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the
"Institute. ""Knock on titanium,"" ""Whadya do for black-outs,"" ""Please,"
"lover, don't think when I'm around,"" America, as combat-shocked and"
crippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.
"Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,"
polarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's
"Foundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,"
or almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the
"phrase, ""... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,"" he took a"
"deep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and"
"his knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with"
"impartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning."
"Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory"
"chains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep."
"These chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which"
"have gained admission by some secret passage!"""
With Rollo Blair to think was to act. So in another moment he had
"slipped off his shoes, and treading noiselessly on his stocking soles"
and with a naked sword in his hand he made his way swiftly and carefully
down towards the place whence he had heard the noise.
Descending by the grand _escalier_ he found himself in one of the narrow
corridors which communicated by private staircases with the left wing of
the palace. Rollo stood still in the deepest shadow. He was sure that he
"could hear persons moving near him, and once he thought that he could"
distinguish the sound of a muttered word.
The Egyptian darkness about him grew more and more instinct with noises.
"There was a scuffling rustle, as of birds in a chimney, all over the"
basement of the house. A door creaked as if a slight wind had blown it.
"Then a latch clicked, and the wind, unaided, does not click latches."
Rollo withdrew himself deeper into a niche at the foot of the narrow
winding-stair which girdled a tower in the thickness of the wall.
"The young man had almost resolved to summon his whole force from above,"
so convinced was he that the enemy had gained a footing within the tower
"and were creeping up to take them in the rear, when a sound altered his"
intention. There is nothing more unmistakable to the ear than the
rebellious whimper of an angry child compelled to do something against
its will.
Rollo instantly comprehended the whole chain of circumstances. The
treachery touched him more nearly than he had imagined possible. Those
for whom he and his party were imperilling their lives were in fact to
leave them to perish as best they might in the empty shell of the
palace. The royal birds were on the point of flying.
"Louvain objected, 'if you do not really approve of any of them?' And"
"Erasmus answers with Horace's word: 'In the first place, because I"
cannot sleep'.
"A sleepless energy, it was that indeed. He cannot rest. Still half"
"seasick and occupied with his trunks, he is already thinking about an"
"answer to Dorp's letter, just received, censuring the _Moria_. We should"
"fully realize what it means that time after time Erasmus, who, by"
"nature, loved quiet and was fearful, and fond of comfort, cleanliness"
"and good fare, undertakes troublesome and dangerous journeys, even"
"voyages, which he detests, for the sake of his work and of that alone."
"He is not only restless, but also precipitate. Helped by an incomparably"
retentive and capacious memory he writes at haphazard. He never becomes
anacoluthic; his talent is too refined and sure for that; but he does
repeat himself and is unnecessarily circumstantial. 'I rather pour out
"than write everything,' he says. He compares his publications to"
"parturitions, nay, to abortions. He does not select his subjects, he"
"tumbles into them, and having once taken up a subject he finishes"
"without intermission. For years he has read only _tumultuarie_, up and"
down all literature; he no longer finds time really to refresh his mind
"by reading, and to work so as to please himself. On that account he"
envied Budaeus.
"'Do not publish too hastily,' More warns him: 'you are watched to be"
"caught in inexactitudes.' Erasmus knows it: he will correct all later,"
he will ever have to revise and to polish everything. He hates the
"labour of revising and correcting, but he submits to it, and works"
"passionately, 'in the treadmill of Basle', and, he says, finishes the"
work of six years in eight months.
In that recklessness and precipitation with which Erasmus labours there
"juste_. If you would kindly lock me up, say, for three years or the"
duration of the war I should be your debtor. I have often thought that
"a prison, provided that one were allowed unlimited paper and the use"
"of a typewriter, would be the most charming of holidays--a perfect"
rest cure. There are three books in my head which I should like to
"write. Arrest me, Dawson, I implore you! Put on the handcuffs--I have"
"never been handcuffed--ring up a taxi, and let us be off to jail. You"
"will, I hope, do me the honour of lunching with me first and meeting"
my wife. She will be immensely gratified to be quit of me. It cannot
"often have happened in your lurid career, Dawson, to be welcomed with"
"genuine enthusiasm."""
"""Why did that man say that he prepared the description of the ship for"
"you?"""
"""That is what we are going to find out, and I will help you all I can."
"My reputation is like the bloom upon the peach--touch it, and it is"
gone for ever. There is a faint glimmer of the truth at the back of my
mind which may become a clear light. Did he say that he had given it
"to me personally, into my own hand?"""
"""No. He said that he was approached by a man whom he had known off and"
"on for years, a man who was employed by you in connection with"
shipyard inquiries. He was informed that this man was still employed
"by you for the same purpose now as in the past."""
"""Your case against me is thinning out, Dawson. At its best it is"
"second-hand; at its worst, the mere conjecture of a rather careless"
draughtsman. I have two things to do: first to find out the real
"seducer, who is probably also the despatcher of the parcels to the"
"late lieutenant of Northumberland Fusiliers, and second, to save if I"
can this poor fool of a shipyard draughtsman from punishment for his
I need this money.
It's too exile!
But who is he?
"Ah yes, almost forgot, a surprise, the corset of your mother sold."
"The hospital, the ambulance, 4 nurses 2 midwives, 4.300 kilos at birth, incognito for 7 months, a triumph!"
"The fault is yours, the lady my age."
To each according to his misery.
To each according to his needs.
My poor little ...
It is the love?
My wolf ...
Love ...
I will show you.
Mamma ...
"The smell, this is proof."
Do not leave a wounded friend on the face of old age.
Especially if it is incompetent.
"Behold here, man."
"Come on, come down, idiot."
"Come on, jump!"
You want you pull down to the hilt?
"Su, strength, inside!"
And do not move.
Remember?
You tell me ... that if I did all this was for Marie.
"Yes, you were right."
You know that what a girl lost in France?
I do not know anyone.
It is a woman running until the day that crack.
You can not make anything for you.
Anything.
"You can try to kill themselves, is all."
I can't help.
You sent me to study law in Britain.
"Maybe, perhaps, I think I can give him a..."
little help.
I can hear fear from your voice.
I am no match for you.
"I think, I have to help you!"
Master...
It's meal time.
"Where can I get my food, mister?"
Are you new?
Right...
Time for Playing games.
Don't bully me!
My master is really something.
"About the case of Ho Foon, the British and Chinese governments have reached an agreement."
The case will be judged in the British court.
No appeal.
"And, Chan Mon-gut will be the defence counsel for Ho Foon."
I've been informed already.
"And, His Excellency Li Hung-chang said, if you can free Ho Foon from charges, you'll become a hero."
Money and fame will come sooner or later.
Congratulations.
"If I lose, I don't think I will have any lose."
It's an insult to the country.
"You will be punished, maybe capital punishment for your tribes."
You are throwing me to the sharks!
"Come on, don't get mad."
"The chairs are not enough for all of us, you know?"
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong?
Where did you cut it?
Last I heard.
True story.
"- Oh, this was so cold."
- Yeah.
- It was raining too.
- Look at those boys.
How can you just not love them and wanna hang out?
Jonny's beatboxing was really funny.
"This was when the ""let me show you my balls"" thing happened."
"- Yeah, that was that night."
- Right there.
A guy wanted to show us his balls.
Didn't get to.
So a guy on our movie or some other dude?
- A drunk guy that was stumbling...
- A guy tried to show us his balls.
- Christo handled it perfectly.
- Christo and Self handled it.
- What did Christo do?
- Christo handled his balls.
"Christo is our first AD, who is..."
- Handsome.
- Handsome.
- Hand me some of that.
- And so sweet.
Gorgeous.
Ari.
"By the way, this pregnant lady actually threw up like in the left over where the chairs were, before we started shooting."
Threw up everywhere in between her legs and then just proceeded to sit there for 20 minutes with her and her boyfriend and nobody cleaned it up.
I feel like that was a good omen.
- This is the greatest...
- Ari.
"Enjoy your meal, everyone."
Enjoy your meal.
Calm down.
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included nonviolence?
I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Well, be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
(SCOFFS)
You don't understand us at all.
TRIS:
"No, I do understand you."
I understand that you think you can stay out of this.
But you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
FOUR:
"Tris, Tris... (INHALES DEEPLY)"
FOUR:
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.
Then we can leave.
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
I will not be a party to violence.
FOUR:
And no one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
One what?
- Huh?
You about ready to take the wheel up here?
- Learn the how-tos of driving?
- Huh?
"I mean, you had your learner's permit about seven years, bud."
I'll just do that later.
"Hey, come on."
Changing subjects.
Who wants some waffles and ice cream?
"Oh, I know I do."
"But I'll take my ice cream first, because real men eat dessert first."
Dessert first!
All:
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Did you quit work?
Why would I quit?
You're not going to work?
I don't work on Sundays.
"It's Monday, not Sunday."
Do you have two Sundays on your calendar?
"Yesterday was the last day of your break, Sunday!"
What's wrong with you?
Is it a side effect from your painkillers?
Stop taking them.
Stop taking them and go to the hospital.
Isn't it Sunday?
You were complaining about how your break was ending.
You were so fixated on that that you didn't even know the day had passed.
"It's way past seven, you're already late."
"If it was me, I'd fire any employee who was late on the first day after their break."
"- you, like Alex, would fall in love with me."
- Rose...
Rose... no...
"I know, I know, I know, I was wrong, it was unfair of me to think you'd change."
- Rose...
Rose... but I think...
"- I know what you think, Greg, and just let me finish"
- what I was going...
"- Rose, Rose, I feel..."
"You feel very strongly about your beliefs, I appreciate that, but..."
"I'm sorry that I broke our agreement, it was just that I fell in love with you... stupid, right?"
Rose...
Rose...
I feel... that...
I don't want you to feel bad.
Because I'm not in love with you anymore.
What?
"Which ironically makes me perfect for this marriage, except now I don't want it."
"Suddenly... dinner doesn't seem like such a good idea, does it?"
I should...
I should go.
- Whe... whe... where are you going?
Your mother's?
- Just until I find my own place.
I...
"I hope at some point we can pick up where we left off, as friends."
Friends?
"I really do thank you, Greg, you're the first man who wanted to marry me... for any reason."
Can I call you tomorrow?
What for?
"You all have copies of the syllabus, right?"
Yes
You tried not to waste my time?
You think I'll be happy?
And that's being nice to me?
"You know, you wasted 3 good years."
We may not be together forever.
But we'll have happy memories.
We don't even have that now.
Look at me!
"No matter how many days you've left and the chance for the operation,"
I'll arrange for you.
Because I'll be here with you.
You're mine this time.
"Voice message to dad, press 1."
"Ask for money, press 2"
"Make an appointment, press 0"
Is Mr. Mak in?
Now!
"previously on ""jericho"""
Heather.
"Oh, my God."
We grew up together over in New Bern.
You just going to leave?
It won't be for very long.
"Johnston, you SOB."
How the hell did you lose an election?
No.
"The question is, how did you get to be in charge in New Bern?"
They get tired of you being the sheriff?
Can we buy some more of these things?
"Ten wind turbines for,let's say, ten percent of your spring crop."
"Okay, we'll give you the food."
Where does it go?
When it leaves?
In the inverter.
Then turn on the inverter.
This is a joke for you!
"We are also someone's child, we lose our memory."
"You made these bombs, Right?"
Yes Papa I made it.
I have a diploma for making bombs.
Now you'll die with this bomb.
"Tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Bomb is here..."
And you're using the remote from there.
Come inside the range.
Should I press it while standing on the bomb.
What kind bomb is this?
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Don't hit me."
"Don't doubt my talent, Bomb is fine."
I have a diploma.
Let me see the remote.
Here.
Battery is fitted wrong.
Now see how it blows...
"Now tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Chandi look at this diamond.
Our luck will also shine like this.
"After today, won't have to do this sales job."
We won't have to live in this car show room's wash room.
Won't have to listen to Laila Madam.
Let's runaway.
So did every other developer in town.
"Notwithstanding that, Mr. Deputy Mayor..."
... ifyoudon'ttransport their employees...
... BankExchangewill dump this deal...
... andforgetaboutNew York...
... andputup their60-storybuilding in New Jersey instead.
So be it.
The mayor loves BankExchange but can't afford infrastructure.
You're flying in the face of real politics.
Subways get people to jobs.
Jobs mean votes.
I thought John Pappas liked votes.
"He loves votes, Frank."
But no infrastructure.
Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp...
... itcan'tpayfor them.
-Where are you going?
-l have an appointment in Manhattan.
This meeting's over?
I heard you say no.
Can I offer you a ride?
"No, thanks."
I make it quicker on the train.
Here he comes.
Judge Stern!
"Why did you give Tino Zapatti probation, Your Honor?"
Why did you go soft on the drug charge?
is probation a sentence in this town?
They're burying little James Bone.
Are you going to the funeral?
Get me the file on Tino Zapatti.
Mr. Deputy Mayor...
Yes.
"Now, I must warn you, the retrovirus is still experimental."
"In fact, it's only been tested on cell cultures in a laboratory, and so far, without much success."
I'm hoping that what we can learn from your daughter will help me perfect it.
We've got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
"Yeah, well, I could've, but... this way."
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
"The villagers are on the move, and it doesn't look like they're going to a picnic."
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
All right.
Get back there and sit tight.
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord.
What?
She took the retrovirus.
You said it wasn't ready.
"It's not, not by a long shot."
What'll it do to her?
To be honest I have no idea
colonel Sheppard come in.
Go ahead.
We've got another problem.
"Ellia's gone, and she's injected herself with the retrovirus."
Why would she do that?
I'm not sure who I should be asking for.
"Dr Penzler, just make the call."
"All right, all right."
"FBI, please."
What are you gonna do once you get to somebody in charge?
I'm gonna make my demands.
"You're gonna call the federal government and say,"
"""Let me speak to the man in charge of your super-secret operation because, if I don't, I'll shoot a few people"
That's pathetic is what that is.
"Well, no one ever said that Ray wasn't pathetic."
CYNTHIA:
I knew I never should've joined this damn group.
This is like White people land.
Do you know how many Asian people have been abducted since 1947 ?
Will you please shut up?
"Maybe seven, and you're looking at one of them."
"So I decide to be open and honest about it, and this is what I get--"
I'm abducted by Homer Simpson.
White people land.
Hello.
Hello.
Is this the--the FBI?
- You got 'em on the phone?
"- Um, yes."
Uh-huh.
See?
"This is, um, Dr Harriet Penzler."
I'm hoping you can help me.
I have a bit of a problem here.
DR PENZLER:
Yes.
"Um, I have a group of people here, and one of them's been shot."
All right.
- Doc Swain.
- Hi.
"Evening, Selena."
Be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
Watch your feet.
Are you gonna tell them about me?
"- I'll have to, Selena."
- Nobody in town must ever know.
"- But if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
- I know that.
"- Well, then why?"
- Because of Ted.
"What are you afraid of, what he'll think?"
He loves you.
"It would ruin his life, married to a girl who... ."
Not a respectable person in town would accept him.
"""Respectable. "" What kind of respectability are you talking about?"
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
"Look, don't you understand?"
We're talking about your whole life.
Prison can be a kind of dying.
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"- Besides, you mustn't get involved."
- Never mind about me.
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
You don't seem to realize you face a possible life sentence.
That's right.
She's Supermac 88.
"Salute her, 99!"
How come everybody's more senior to me?
"Dumplings, you're..."
"Dad, where's your sense of history?"
Many heros place righteousness above family.
I shouldn't have give birth to you!
Tell them to drop their arms!
Don't mind me.
"For the Emperor, get the 'Beast'!"
If all Chinese were like you.
Where would we be today?
How can we fight one another?
When we're faced with a common enemy?
"If you can kill your own people, go right ahead."
What's the matter?
We want to become women!
We could easily run out of men!
Why don't you give me a chance to become woman too?
Father!
This story is getting too female chauvinistic!
Can I have the Formula now?
Get rid of them!
I'll give this to the American for you.
"My mission is completed, I'll go wherever you go."
"Yoyo, you can't come with me!"
Why not?
Because I've promised him.
Him?
I feel sorry for you too!
"Robin, thanks for coming to see me off!"
It's the closest any of us actually ever came.
Yeah.
"Jamie wasn't really spawned by Satan, was he?"
No.
"If he was, we'd have a way better house."
"You're the one, Jamie."
Show me the way!
There's a lot of things I can handle.
A lot of things I've managed to survive.
I'd even say I've thrived where others would have just thrown in the towel.
"Yes, honey, you certainly have."
"Now relax, and let the bubbles do their work."
Soothing.
- Sooth...
"- Dad, we finish..."
I told you to stay the hell away from this bathroom until I said so!
This is a child-free zone until further notice!
Soothing... soothing...
"You know what, Hal?"
I'm done.
I give up.
What are you talking about?
Jamie wins.
He beat me.
"All those years, all those terrible things those kids have done."
"It doesn't make me stronger, it's just worn me down."
"Like termites eating away at a house, until all that's holding up is paint."
"I'm just paint, Hal."
Jamie knows it.
You'll do a better job than I can.
I trust you.
"No, no, no."
Yeah.
He's an animal.
And I sorta get the feeling that he's just getting warmed up.
Ouch.
Yeah.
"So, how do I fix it?"
You get a new partner.
"Yeah, I'd like that, but I don't think that's gonna happen."
Well...
I'm seeing a slight tear on the ACL.
"So, you're going to have to stay off that knee for a couple of weeks, physical therapy, and I'll put you on some anti-inflammatories."
"Can I get those, uh, to go?"
Please?
I'll be back.
"Hey, stay."
I'm not a dog.
Stay.
What happened to you?
Oh.
"Uh, I blame you."
"I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks, all the fun we've been having together."
All right.
"Well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo, I'd love to know what's going on here."
"We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards."
"Department of Public Safety's trying to figure out what the hell happened,"
Where's Chin and Kono?
"Inside, getting background."
Is that your sister in the car?
"Yeah, I just came straight from the airport."
"You realize if she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her in the car like that?"
"Can we focus, please?"
Yeah.
-No longer with us.
Is a better place next to the ...
Carmen.
"Carmen, wait!"
"I do not want to dip your feet, my love."
I'm not your love.
"See, what I said Carmen it will leave only one stick."
"Get out, I'm just Carmen."
"Ramon, it's unbelievable, everyone came."
"Least the guy who stayed behind, it was cold."
He is not here.
You're a great friend.
"Thank you, friend."
"Do not look at me, had nothing to do."
"So, it was love, thank you."
He thanked the penguin wrong.
"Hello, how are you?"
-I knew.
Small-Erik health.
"Well, all friends present and assembled we will not rest until they are all fat."
That's right.
The funniest sound I've heard
I could not understand a single word  isnowspreading throughout the land
I still can not understand
Isaidandthenpartner what is the name  notdareto tellme the same thing
yourownmusic I can not understand
But has a sound that makes me dance like crazy
"I bring a lot of fish, my courtesy."
"Shows how to do it, brother."
Who is that guy?
"Call him the insect, he's fantastic."
Let me repeat I told you before ...
We'll trap him.
- I'm going down there.
- I'll go with you.
"Garcia, have Detroit PD set up roadblocks."
[Garcia] Got it.
Chris Edwards is a husband.
He's a father.
He's a general contractor.
[Morgan] Check any subcontractors who've worked with him.
"Okay, that is a humungous list."
What do you want me to do with it?
Anything that requires flames...
"plumbers, electricians, welders."
Did he fire a welder recently?
Okay.
"Uh, he's been using Vinnie's Welding and Fence, but he hasn't hired them back in months."
List of employees coming up.
- It's still a lofty handful.
- [Prentiss] Okay.
We think he's been following the investigation.
Look at volunteers with Detroit's Finest.
"Okay, I'm crossing employees with volunteers."
- Nothing.
"- Come on, baby girl, keep checking."
- There's gotta be a connection here.
"- Okay, I'm gonna long-shot it, and I'm gonna cross the Michigan business directory with the payroll company and see if I still got what it takes to find stuff."
And I do.
His name's Kaman Scott.
- [Morgan] You got an address?
- I'm working on that.
Kaman...
"Kaman, come on, man."
Compared to you and Charlotte anything's quick.
"- Softly softly, catchee monkee."
- I didn't know you spoke Spanish.
See!
I told you this was a great place to get your fingers stinky.
"Oh, my god, she's going for his cock."
"Oh, what you doing?"
Shall we go somewhere more private?
- I want you.
- Right.
"Careful, no-one's touched that before, it might go off."
Good!
"Crikey, careful."
Are they allowed to do that in here?
- Crikey!
"- Fuck me, she's gonna wank him off!"
The jammy git's pulled an experienced cock handler.
"Or, someone so inexperienced she thinks it's the best way to pull an older boy."
- Either way it's a win-win situation.
"- It's not really, though, no?"
"Thanks to me, we're now watching Simon get wanked off."
Thank you so much!
- Getting a bit weird now.
- I hate it when he makes eye contact.
"None of us do, Neil."
Call me a short arse now!
"Come on then, you fucking coward!"
"- Oh, please, not his face!"
- I'm gonna do you!
"Northwood are in the house, you're fucking dead!"
How embarrassing.
- That was brilliant!
Damone?
"Yeesh, I'm really kind of busy."
"Come on, just do me this one favor."
"All right, but you owe me for this one."
"Oh, thanks, Damone."
And that was the last we ever saw of him.
"Well, well, well."
Who do we have here?
"It's me, Chris, you know me."
Why are you talking like a bad guy?
"Listen, I saw you steal money from Mom's purse."
Oh...
"Well, I was just trying to get new sneakers."
"You're not going to tell on me, are you?"
"Well, that depends."
On what?
"How about, I won't tell Mom and Dad about the money if you promise to do whatever I say."
"Meg, this is how a lot of porn starts."
"I mean it, Chris."
I'll tell them.
"Mom, Chris took money out of the..."
"Okay, okay, okay."
I'll do whatever you want.
I thought you'd see it that way.
Here's a list of stuff I need you to do for me.
"Shouldn't have taken that money, Chris."
"Eh, she's right."
I'm a horrible person.
I'm only one step above those people who really like dive bars and really need you to know it.
I love this place.
I love dive bars.
Dive bars are my favorite.
what did he say?
which we are told to say
its opened
you should never leave the door open
who knows who will come in
sit..
we need to talk talk about what?
want to tell you the truth may be you'll feel good.
really?
shall we start?
from bankok ..o.p ramsai guilty..
and vikram kapoor.?
I've linked him with police.
"Infact, i wasn't with him when he commited suicide."
So how come you know he's dead.
the police department knows this.
you might have phone.
are you a police officer?
So what do I call you?
nil or arjun?
there's no need to mess up this case more
so you do think too that the kabir got killed.
Human has some strange habits as .
when the drink wine while smoking..
So their glass would must be in their left hand.
Like a kabir malhotra..
I'm also left handed.
If he's left handed...
so why he driggered gun from right hand.
but who?
there's a tale in a latin language
who's benificiry?
What are you talking about?
Please!
"Wait, give me a second"
What is this?
What the fuck?
We broke up
So she doesn't live here anymore
Where does she live now?
She lives in Tokyo I think
"Well no, for sure"
What do you mean?
"Officer, it's not like I was holding her in custody"
"She was over 20 too, so we were just living together"
Ok...
"Plus, I am a victim too"
A missing person's report was it from her parents?
Or was it these two?
Is it normal to be investigating together?
Not that it matters
This really doesn't concern me anymore
So it's a little annoying
You need to be more responsible
Hey...
What about me is irresponsible?
I'm mentally fucked up cause of her
She is the one who is irresponsible
How is she irresponsible?
Miyu was texting me about the violence she was tolerating
Miyu is the victim
What?
She was betraying me the whole time
What?
Yes.
He hung up.
"Apart from Sonia Danidoff, do you remember any other names in the list?"
"Yes, maybe Tom... something."
"Or ""Thomas""."
This tells you something?
"Without the name, it will not."
There were also initials.
Unfinished words.
I think this list is the calendar for Fantomas futur attacks.
"I'm afraid, Fandor."
These phone calls.
Someone wants to kill me.
We will survive.
I promise you.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"The convocation is at 4 pm, isn't it?"
"Yes, yes."
"Thank you for your call, last night."
It touched me.
I have not called.
"I beg you, Fandor."
Don't kid me.
"Despite the buzz, I recognized your voice."
What am I supposed to have said to you?
"Very nice things, very delicate."
And you asked me questions about the list again.
Someone imitated my voice.
Someone wanted to know what you exactly saw on that list.
You will not return to the hotel.
It's too dangerous.
But what am I going to do?
How many ships did you lose?
Hmm.
About half the group.
Flying out of England?
Yes.
Waddington.
92nd bomber group.
"Hey, lieutenant, how'd you blow up that train with 50 guards around?"
"Well, I, heh..."
"Just lucky, I guess."
Don't let him kid you.
Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.
Here's what happened.
We're waiting at the depot at Frankfurt.
Understand?
When an ammunition train comes through the longest ammunition train you ever saw.
Understand?
"Oh, he's just giving it a big buildup."
"Actually, it was simple enough."
"I just drifted into the men's room, fixed myself up a little time bomb, broke open the window and when the train started pulling out, I just tossed the thing into an open car."
I guess there must have been some straw in there.
Yeah.
And about three minutes later you can hear it.
Boom!
Understand?
Broke every window in Frankfurt.
Understand?
It was gorgeous.
Wait a second.
I'm not through.
Understand?
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
"Sir, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no."
Don't be sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.
"No, I aroused you."
You should be proud.
This hasn't happened to me in a long time.
"Are you attempting to have a manual stimulation from me, sir?"
Am I...
I am here on a couples retreat with my wife in the other room.
My husband Scott is just like a cat.
Scott?
My husband.
I'm trying to save my marriage here.
Look what you did to me.
"Well, that wasn't my intention, sir."
"It wasn't mine, either, and now I'm humiliated."
"Well, I'm sorry."
You told me not to think.
"Well, when I don't think, this is what happens."
You can't leave me all backed up like this.
"What do you want me to do, sir?"
I don't know.
We got to figure out a solution.
"You know, let's not take anything off the table."
Let's start brainstorming.
"We""re both in a maze together, okay?"
How do we get the cheese?
"I'm sorry, sir, but that is not gonna have a happy ending."
Give me the oil.
Go grab a smoke.
"Daddy, this is awesome!"
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you for having me.
Are you ready to get out there and turn some laps?
I'm ready as I'll ever be.
Is that fair?
'Cause I know you like to drive fast on your own.
Yeah.
"I mean, in my own car, in the safety and dangerousness of real traffic."
We will see you in the hangar when you're done.
Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Lake Bell!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Let's get some air going here.
Wood:
"Now, the fastest lap time is 139.3, set by Stephen Moyer."
[ Engine revving ] Let's see how Lake can do.
And now to shift gears.
Looking good so far.
Little tap on the brakes.
Keep it serious.
Keep it really serious!
Good focus.
"Car looks composed so far, heading down in towards the teardrop."
[Bleep]
"Looking good, not super-fast through there."
And there's a thousand people there.
I hope I don't.
"Oh, my God."
That's a lot of people to be looking right at me as I...
don't shift.
But this is where people make up a lot of time.
"Office...""Future  Wellness""."
Apartment... 12.
Don't fret.
It won't be bleeding for long.
Now it's a habit!
"Well, kick it!"
"""Future  Wellness""."
"With what they'll get from us, they'll qualify for a new plaque: ""Past  Flabby Cankers""!"
Hit it.
Big time.
"My half brother, Léo, Mickey."
Edgard Venom.
"What does he poison, this Venom?"
He's the fat pussy with a small...
I can't see his full livery.
He heads the Office of Buildings and Investments.
He's investing in me.
He's pumping shit into your veins.
They all screw you 'cause you believe in the system.
All that's in vain 'cause you don't have taste.
Do you get off on family affairs?
You unhealthy paranoid.
I want the recipe!
It's too complex.
You wouldn't get your head round it.
Around what?
That you and your Venom brothers swap guided missiles for Afghan dope?
Dope which you blow up in the street?
Laundering fallout through Buildings and Investments to get clean books?
"As for official stamps, we've got Mr André at the Ministry."
And where is Simon Venom in all of this?
Simon's untouchable.
"Okay, Sara may still be in that tunnel."
"McNamara, let's get blueprints."
"Mei, Tac Team on standby."
Let's go.
Five Lincoln want a team leader.
The tunnel is secured.
This is team leader.
Good to go.
Valera stopped somewhere in here in the northbound bore.
"North and south tunnels are linked by three cross passages-- here, here, and here."
They're used for ventilation and maintenance.
Access shafts run off each cross passage.
So what about these?
Relief ducts.
They leed right into the drainage system
It's like a maze.
Perfect place to hide a body.
Live or otherwise.
"Okay, listen up!"
Sara Collins may still be alive in this tunnel structure.
Weapons down.
Eyes up.
Let's move.
You gonna be able to pick anything up through these walls?
It's a crap shoot.
"Kelton, we've got something."
It's definitely blood-- fresh.
that's a fingerprint.
Nice and clean.
Almost like someone made it on purpose.
Run it!
Plenty of room for Valera to pull over.
I'm worried.
You're never there when I send someone.
I don't know what to do.
You could phone.
That would make things easier.
True.
I hadn't thought of that.
Did you get my check?
Yes.
It was for my cotton business.
I'm worried about that too.
Coming.
Balla has been on the job for three months... and he's been well received by the workers.
His salary has risen and his work rate has improved.
"Therefore, management has decided... to take special measures, though not for the first time."
The police have opened an investigation.
Nothing new!
We've heard this story before... with all its mysteries.
The crowd you see over there is here because of your brother.
All will be known today.
How many times have we taken the blow?
Enough!
"Balla, you'll see us do it."
- Hello!
"- Hello, Touré!"
"The house is quiet, where are the servants?"
Madame has...
Sent them all away?
After I left?
"Naré, what an embarrassment!"
Sissoko is at the door.
How will I explain?
They love playing  tricks on us.
Back to the dressing room.
Some people might look at it and say  this is not very professional with all the clown acting and jumping and fighting and all that kind of stuff but that's just part and parcel of what One Direction is.
I don't even have a Iicence!
"Sorry, I can't hear you!"
Put me down!
Guys!
Guys!
Stop.
"-Sorry, mate!"
"-Hey, guys!"
Six minutes till the biggest show of the whole tour and here they are taking bloody golf buggies.
"Hey, guys!"
"Guys, come on, we gotta go!"
We just try and contain them.
got the key!
Get to work!

Orange face paint.
Orange clothes.
Orange and only orange.
Let's do it.
So Harry are you going to wear orange then
"Can't tell you, it's a surprise."
've seen a few fans outside with orange on.
I don't know if there's gonna be loads but I'm hoping there will be.
"Good evening, Amsterdam!"
"Ready, steady clap."
Everybody clap your hands.
"It sounds like they're shouting "" pizza."" Are they?"
European fans lik e they're just crazy.
They don't come out in the tens and hundreds.
They come out in thousands.
just wish that could just go along each person and just lik e  chat to them. ith how busy the schedule is it's really frustrating that you can't stop and talk to them and tell them what they've done for us.
"Five minutes, we're on stage!"
One Direction!
One Direction!
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"milan, make some noise!"
Thank you so much for having us!
We've been One Direction!
This one's for you.
Thank you.
still get a buzz every time go out on stage.
still come off with  the biggest adrenaline rush.
hen get to  come on the bus and stay up with my mates and laugh about things that we did on stage.
Do you know when I taped you up in the middle of the show with the black tape?
Is that what you did?
"I know, it failed miserably."
You should have just gone with it.
"Thanks for your help, mate."
One girI-
- That is...
-...awful.
-Putrid.
It is absolutely putrid.
Own up.
Own up.
"-Oh, my God."
-Who's farted?
I think he's going to quit his job.
"I'm sorry, Maggie."
I gotta go stop him.
(INAUDIBLE)
"Ted, I had to leave the bar, but it's okay."
I left Maggie with Robin.
You left Maggie with Robin?
Relax.
I've got things under control.
You don't understand the situation.
This girl is like a super-powered man magnet.
"Oh, Teddy."
I know a little something about man magnets.
"You see, your friend may be one of those magnets that can hold up a picture of your kids on the fridge, but I'm one of those magnets that can pick up cars in a junkyard."
- Who's this?
"- Robin, this is Jim, a good friend of mine from work."
"Oh, well, hello there. (GIGGLES)"
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, boy."
"What does being ""ready"" even mean?"
"I mean, I thought I was ""ready"" last year."
I wound up getting left at the altar.
"I'll be honest, guys."
I'm a little scared.
"Okay, Louis, then Betty."
"We're all scared, Professor Mosby."
Doesn't being scared let you know you're on to something important?
Yeah.
"I mean, if you're not scared, you're not taking a chance."
"And if you're not taking a chance, then what the hell are you doing?"
Right?
"I think you're ready, bro."
Need your vote now.
"Oh, my God, that was so fun."
"Thought you said no one says ""blog"" anymore, huh?"
"Bye, Fred."
"Goodbye, Mrs. Finnerty."
Oil painting by Tom Freeman to commemorate the burning of the White House by the British in 1814.
"- Wait, the White House burned down?"
"- Yeah, yeah, in the War of 1812."
Practically had to be rebuilt from the ground up.
"When I look at this painting, I get very emotional."
John.
I think I need to avail myself of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.
There's a ladies' room downstairs.
- Where?
I'll take her.
"- I can go by myself, John."
I'm not a child.
"Hey, just don't touch anything or wander off or talk to anybody that you shouldn't be talking to."
I make no promises.
He's seven minutes behind.
"Sorry, he got hung up on the State Floor."
"- Good morning, Margaret."
"- Morning, Mr. President."
Could you get the speaker on the phone?
"Right away, sir."
Have you and the missus zeroed in on a dining establishment?
When have you known the missus to zero in on anything?
"Fair point, sir."
"Martin, I wanna shake your hand."
- We're all sorry to see you go.
"- Thank you, Mr. President."
"And I know that you and Muriel have had a tough go of it since Kevin passed, and..."
Like someone not pickin' up after walking' their dog?
"Well, I guess so."
Like someone not eatin' everything on their plate?
"Well, I guess so."
Like someone peeing' in a hot spring?
That's right.
"When he wakes up, he just keeps destroying... tons until he gets sleepy again."
I get it.
Then he's a bad guy.
That's not so.
Beerus-sama is a god.
"For there to be balance in this plane of existence, if there are gods that create, there must also be gods that destroy."
"Then he's strong, right?"
"He's on a level far beyond ""strong""."
He's capable of destroying absolutely everything there is.
Nobody stands a chance against him.
I can't wait to meet him.
Goku.
"I'm begging you, please try your hardest not to do anything stupid."
Okay?
You understand?
Got it.
"As long as he doesn't do anythin' bad, I'll keep away."
Oww...
What was that for?
.
Honestly...
What is it?
Beerus-sama...
"So that's this ""God of Destruction""..."
I see little kids hurrying off colourful na ransel
Colourful backpacks on their backs shou kodomo-tachi kaketeyuku
"When you run out of the truth, what are you gonna say then?"
"Nothing, nothing at all."
"You just keep repeating that, Mrs. Slocum."
It could mean a whole lot to your future.
[door opens] [door closes]
~~[scatting]
[sighs]
[clucking tongue]
"Thanks, honey, I don't mind if I do."
"Say, where's your mother anyway, it's almost dinner time."
"Well, she can't be out much longer."
"As soon as the stores close, she's got to come home."
What a good girl you are.
Always waiting for your mother.
"Like the other night, for instance."
It was real nice of you to wait till she got home.
"What time was it, anyway?"
She got in around 2:00 a.m.
You're sure 'cause you were up?
"No, I'm not sure."
Then how can you be sure?
I'm not.
It's just that she said she got in then.
Then you wouldn't know if she went out again.
"Really, Mrs. Armstedder."
Why don't you stick to solitaire?
"Janie, what do you think?"
A lady at the hairdresser's asked me for my autograph... and the man at the corner said I ought to sell my story to the Chronicle.
"Are you still here, Blanche?"
"Well, Jane asked me to dinner."
"Say, you've got a new hairdo."
"Well, looks pretty nice."
- Oh!
Um...
"Oh, I..."
"- Thruppence, please."
Please.
There.
"Well, as long as you receive an adequate coaching fee,"
I see no objection to your continuing to instruct him.
- Fee?
- Yes.
Certainly a fee.
I shall be raising the matter with Mr. Baker today.
Is there anything else you wish me to discuss with him?
Your dressing room is adequate?
Uh...
"Oh, your intimate needs are being catered for?"
Mmm?
Sammy once mentioned you do not like to share studio facilities with crew.
Electricians in particular?
Yes.
"Well, one mustn't complain."
They do their best to make one comfortable.
"And as for the work, uh, people..."
People seem to be responding rather well to Uncle Frank.
I look-
- I look forward to your opinion.
Thank you.
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.
Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
It smelt of you for the longest time.
"And then one day, I went in there and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
"Well, I don't see how any man could say no to you in that dress."
"Hey, word is Paul Logan's in town."
Paul Logan?
Paul Logan?
Number one host in Macao.
"Yeah, Macao, Monte Carlo."
But not Vegas.
"No, not Vegas."
"Mr. Taylor, if you're missing personal property, we can call security, but..."
"I'm telling you, I ain't payin' for this room, not after what happened to me in there."
Excuse me.
What's going on around here?
There's a ghost in my room.
And she's a thief.
I'm sorry.
There's a what?
She took my money clip right off the nightstand.
"It was silver, with my initials..."
R.P.T.
And there was 400 bucks in there.
You're saying that someone stole your money...
"Not someone, something."
"I get back to my room, and I see this dark-haired woman sorta hovering on my bed."
- Hovering?
"- Yes, hovering."
"Next thing I know, she's gone and so is my money clip."
You oughta comp my stay and reimburse me what she stole.
That's him.
That's the guy who walked out on his check at Mystique.
"All right, you owe her 86 bucks, pal."
Let's go.
Did you intend to pay for any part of your stay here?
You have no choice.
I'll just go tell Mom and Dad about the money and they'll ground your ass for a year.
"I don't care, tell them."
'Cause I'm not even going to be here.
I'm going to run away and no one will ever see me again.
"Good, go."
And who's even going to miss you?
You're just a little thief.
"Where you going, Chris?"
Who are you going to turn to?
You don't even have any friends.
(doorbell rings)
Hi.
I ran away from home.
Do you mind if I live with you?
Live with me?
"My goodness, I feel like"
I want to pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming.
"Hot dog, it's real."
"Mr. Herbert, it's 6:00, I'm-I'm not really tired yet."
"Well, you had those three cups of Nyquil."
You'll be down soon enough.
"Okay, good night, Mr. Herbert."
"Sweet dreams, Chris."
"Mr. Herbert, what's life really all about?"
"Well, I suppose it's about trying new things;"
sampling the sweet and the savory;
not being afraid to take everything life wants to throw up on into ya.
Wow.
I never looked at it like that before.
"Thanks, Mr. Herbert."
But don't you think it's scary to try new things?
"- l'm on your side, I swear."
I'm gonna tell you as soon as I can.
It's in the best interest of your case if we can cooperate.
I need to know what you're trying to do.
We're trying to do what we always try to do... put bad guys in jail.
including my ex-husband?
"I have no idea, and that's the truth."
And if I don't cooperate?
"Well, I'll get anxious and depressed, start offering you jobs down here or something or vacation property."
Just kidding.
"To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'd do if you don't cooperate."
[knock on door]
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
I'll be back down in a second.
She... she ate.
Good.
How much?
Enough.
So how's it going?
You're asking me that?
Sorry.
What?
- What what?
- l'm asking you.
"Well, I don't understand."
You're... you're asking me what?
I don't know what I'm asking you.
"Rick, we really can't talk about this."
"Karen, Karen, I know something's happening."
"If you know what it is, I think you have a responsibility to tell me."
Excuse me.
You're welcome.
You don't know how I've been waiting for this.
"Listen, you see Robin before I do, tell her I really appreciate it."
"- Are you listening to me, Stan?"
- Yeah.
Because you need to be very clear about something.
Go ahead.
This is not the beginning of anything.
This is the end.
Got no argument here.
"Look, I don't know what Robin told you about this but I made a couple mistakes, reference to some gambling."
"Believe me, I learned my lesson."
"I swear, Stan Heywood gambles no more."
"I swear to you, I really appreciate Robin helping me out like this."
You finished?
- Yeah.
"- I'm a cop, Stan."
"- Oh, God."
- The only reason I don't bust you--
- I made a couple mistakes--
- I understand.
Things happen.
"I won't pop you, because I haven't looked inside that envelope."
"If I were to find money in there, I'd pop you."
So forget whatever you're thinking.
You've committed a crime.
"If you ever approach Robin again, I will put you in jail."
You understand me?
Straight to Rikers.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
MARTINEZ:
I thought I'd cover all the major food groups.
"So sorry about this, Rambo."
"It's cool, man, it's Dad's money."
He won't even notice.
You ever had mice?
"We have, but more as an infestation than a delicacy."
So is Daddy properly loaded?
"Er...yeah, I guess so."
"He owns, like, a shipping company and a sawmill thing and a marble..."
whatever it's called - hole?
Quarry?
Yeah!
And the grain company.
The grain company that we work for?
He owns that?
Yeah.
"Well, I actually own it now."
He kind of gave it to me.
Boom!
"Well done, Rambo."
"Well, sort of."
"I'd much rather be working at the shipping place, to be honest."
But I sort of burnt my boats there after the er...fire.
"So Dad moved me to grain, which is obviously super lame!"
But at least I met you guys.
Nice mice.
The spoilt brat has the whole company.
"When I was his age, I didn't even have pubes."
Really?
You said he was 16?
"Yeah, I was a late starter."
"The point is, this kid can force Flavia to get me a new chair."
"I'm a kind fairy, come to help you."
"Ooops, isn't this fun!"
We don't need any help.
As you like.
But I know what bothers you.
Maybe I know how to make Elisa more respectful.
"Don't be scared, silly, am I a spook or what?"
!
"Definitely not, dear lady."
You can look me up in the caves under the old castle.
But come alone!
Leave this type at home.
- Can I have another slide?
-No.
- What a bold-faced hussy.
-A witch!
"Wait here, I'm going on alone."
"And leave me here, in the wilderness?"
I'll die of terror!
"If I don't return, carve on my gravestone -"
For his passionate love hath he died a dreadful death.
"Goodbye, good servant."
The wine.
"Oh, horrors!"
"High time, your Grace."
"So Elisa doesn't want you, and you a Duke?"
She might want you if you looked like Henry.
A young helper come to serve at the mill?
"Young, you said?"
I'll give you the likeness of your choice.
- How can I repay you?
"- I don't want anything, but if you don't win Elisa within three full moons, the magic'll wane."
Is that what we're doing?
"Grace, at this point,"
I don't have an answer to that question.
How does it even work?
Would we always pick each other's partners?
"Well, it's our marriage."
It'd be whatever we decide.
"And on that note,"
His name is Jeremy.
He seems like a decent guy.
And his only wish is to satisfy your every sexual desire.
You're really okay with this?
"Me sleeping with someone, and you knowing about it?"
Better than not knowing.
I think.
This is Denise.
"44, software consultant."
"Most important, not looking to fall in love."
She just wants sex.
"You can do that, right?"
All the equipment's in working order.
I feel a bit like we're stepping off a cliff.
Here's hoping there's a trampoline at the bottom.
Donnie?
Simon.
"Look, avoiding my calls isn't going to work."
I need to talk to you about my father.
Don't make me hunt you down.
Oh.
Hi.
Sorry.
I-I was just about to knock.

"That's why I get mad when people talk about bullying, like it's such a bad thing."
"You hear the, ""Stop the bullying!"""
Shut your dumb ass up!
"If I wouldn't have got bullied the way I got bullied,"
I wouldn't be on national television right now.
So all the time it's not a bad thing.
All right?

They are punk asses.

"""Well, bully him."""
"""Ehh!"

"""Talk about his ass."""
"""Ehh!"
"He hit me with a car."""
"""Then, bitch, shoot him."
How 'bout that?
"You know what I'm saying?"" Okay, all right."
I know.
I shouldn't talk about guns.
We've had terrible things happen.
"To the people in the Boston bombing, my heart goes out to them."
I have some questions to ask him.
That's none of my business.
Ifthe guy you're talking about is my friend... he sure doesn't need your help.
"Starting now, you're offthe Weng case."
Inspector Chan will take over.
You're getting another case.
- What's the reason?
- I don't trust you.
Siding with the suspect is not the way to catch him.
"Sir, you don't understand how I work."
You said it!
That's why you're offthe case.
I won't give up the investigation.
Bullshit!
"Chang, you'll be Chan's assistant."
"Yes, sir."
Release the man you just arrested.
Give him 24-hour surveillance.
He'll lead us to Weng's assassin.
- Have you got that?
"- Yes, sir."
Will you kill again?
I thought the people I killed deserved to die.
Now I believe everybody has the right to live.
"No, I won't kill again."
I hope I can keep my promise.
I've been followed.
"Weng's men, and the cops too."
"Don't worry, I lost them."
Weng hired Paul Yau to waste you.
"Don't worry, you can use my guns and ammo."
- Where are you going?
"Sir, you are watching, arent you?"
I know that you might be very happy.
But you might be thinking why..
..your Krishna didnt come back.
Just few more days.
We are destined to stay away forjust few more days.
III definitely fulfill the promise that..
"..I made to sister-in-Iaw, sir."
III definitely come back.
III definitely..
"III definitely come back, sir."
You dont know what this acting can do to me?
Otherwise the day will arrive when all the..

"Why did you give Tino Zapatti probation, your honor?"
Why did you go soft on the drug charge?
Is probation a sentence in this town?
They're burying little James Bone.
Are you going to the funeral?
Get me the file on Tino Zapatti.
Mr. Deputy Mayor I'm Marybeth Cogan.
"""Detectives Endowment Association, Legal Affairs, Co-Counsel."""
Very nice card.
"I represent Santos, and you're muddying my client's name."
- Take it up with Corporation Council.
- And get it buried?
You should tell the mayor someone's taking him up the wrong street.
Maybe we could explore this in more detail.
Maybe over coffee.
I'm talking about a hero detective and his widow's pension.
Why don't you wait in my office?
"No, I don't think so."
I'll expect to hear from you in the morning.
"No, no, that's wrong."
It won't go away unless you do something about it.
This is a crisis that could derail us.
The way Willie Horton sunk Dukakis Tino Zapatti can sink us.
Good afternoon.
Where you been?
My Brooklyn meeting.
How'd it go?
I think I just pissed up Frank Anselmo's leg.
And?
Felt good.
"Okay, Leslie."
"Tomorrow's Times, Post and News are all keeping the shooting on the front page."
I came about Isabel.
- Is something the matter?
- Yes.
I fear she's being manipulated.
- Manipulated?
"- And the way they have her dressed, like she's some sort of common peasant..."
- Hmm.
"Roderick, I know what you're going through, with the loss of your parents, and now your sister, her illness."
And I understand that you've taken over your father's business entirely on your own.
Is that correct?
- I did not come here to discuss myself.
"- And I appreciate that, but you mustn't underestimate the toll the past few months have taken on your own psyche."
- I see.
"Thank you, Doctor."
"- Tell me, what is your name?"
- Isabel Porter.
- That's incorrect.
Where are you from?
- Worchester.
- Look at me.
That's incorrect again.
God!
Ah!
- Does that hurt?
Does that hurt?
"No, that does not hurt."
"When one is nothing, one feels nothing."
Okay?
Again.
I do this for your own benefit.
"Through me, you shall understand pain."
Now.
We were horsing around.
"No, we weren't."
Ahem.
What do you want from this vortex deal?
My company is in debt for 2 million.
"I've borrowed against the house, and my equity line is under water."
So what do you need from the deal?
At least $2.5 million.
"I need 2 to take care of the debt, and that would leave me with $500,000 for Jeremy."
For Jeremy?
I have cancer.
I'm scheduled to go to the hospital at the end of the week.
I'd like this closed by then.
"Oh, God."
I'm...
"I'm sorry, Liz."
I-- melanoma.
They think it might be heading for my lymph nodes.
So what are they gonna do for it?
I'm gonna have surgery.
They're gonna cut it out.
"I'll do radiation and chemo, and that will be that."
"It's not a big deal, Burton."
"They'll operate, they'll take it out, and that will be that."
"Well, what about Jeremy, does he know about this?"
Not yet.
[Front door opens] When you gonna tell him?
Ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
"We'll talk tomorrow, ok?"
Yeah.
Good night.
What's wrong with that?
"Master, the stance you taught us a few days ago"
Is it like this?
2nd Brother
"Oh, it hurts!"
You bloody fool
"Dad, 3rd Brother beats Gao Jian!"
What's the first rule of our school?

Will be punished severely!

Someone has got a ghost story to tell

I'll feed you to a dog if I get hold of ya
"Wow, don't be so cruel!"
It must be hard on you
T alking wastes energy!
Be careful!
You're out of breath
Mind you don't get a bad breath!
I'm now holding my breath
Save your breath.
I did that on purpose
So that Master will punish you
And I can release my long held breath!
Oh!
I'm sorry!
I've stepped on your injured foot!
Help!
"Quick, go practice after dinner"
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry
- I forget you need a bit of extra help.
Remember yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison late at night?
- You were nearly garrotted?
"- Oh, that."
- He wouldn't have gone through with it.
"- Just a kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way - turns up."
"Doesn't always knock, either."
So make sure you're not washing up naked.
"You'll be wanting to see your sister, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
- Is that allowed?
- Course it is.
"You're not on the run, licence is in order."
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't want to live here - too many ghosts.
Door.
- Yeah. you always told Frankie and me that a man is measured by the strength of his enemies.
But you're wrong.
A man is measured by the strength of the love others have for him.
I hope one day you and I can put away the pain and actually talk to each other. your son Brandon.
You're not gonna fucking believe this shit.
the prodigal son returns.

I take it you got me something.
Not exactly.
Exactly what then?
A business proposal.
Unless this conversation you ain't walking out of here.
Just hear me out.

I'm listening.
here's the deal...
Give me a call when you're ready to make some money.

Why not?
He's as greedy as his brother Frankie was.

And another thing-- see if anybody heard anything.
book the fight.
l want to go as far away as possible.
Yeah?
Where would you want to go?
as long as it's sunny and there's water and there's really nice beaches.
We can always take a ride up the West Coast.
Yeah?
That would be amazing.
Hey.

Yeah.

That leads nowhere.
Butyou should offer condolences to the families ofthose kids.
Sure.
I'd like to.
I'd like to offermy condolences.
But Nixon can't.

"Okay, this dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
Okay?
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
"And then, poof."

We've got your numbers.
"Number, number."
We've got your number.
Numbers?
Will you girls excuse us for a minute?
Thank you.
"So, you guys are old friends?"
No.
No.
We just met at the bar.
Yeah.
I recognized him from TV.
I went over and said hello.
What was your name again?
"Billy, don't bother."
We've already checked.
You guys have known each other for years.
You've worked on five movies together.
I knew I'd seen this logo somewhere before.
"At the press conference, it was on your friend's jacket."
That's the clue that capped the case.
That's not even a real phrase.
"It's all over, Billy."
We know why you killed Marissa Kessler.
The paint we found on her fingertips told the whole story.
"That night after the show, she must have caught you rigging the equipment."
It looks like you painted yourself into a corner.
Randy.
You think I rigged the super jackpot?
That's right.
- I expect Malaparte knows for sure...
Thank you.
- How much is it?
- Ten liras.
Thank you.
"Yes, understood."
Alright.
Thank you.
"Wow, a Renaissance banquet... in the middle of the Second World War."

"What are you doing, Sergeant?"
"Excuse me Captain, but Private Prewitt... had a regrettable case of Mussolini's revenge."
And it was sudden!
"Right, continue, Sergeant."
But get out of there!
Damn it!
"Stop, there are landmines!"
They'll be killed!
"My god, Prewitt!"
Let me see.
- Are you a medic?
"- No, but I know what to do."
Then get your hands off him!
Give me something to cover him with.
"Why waste time on that, Captain?"
- We have to get him to the hospital!
- There have been many cases like this.
"If we move him, he'll have a cruel death before we get him to the hospital."
"If we make him comfortable, the pain will pass."
- He'll die in his sleep.
- Like a dog!

Thought I bailed on you?
You had this poster in your other movie theater too.
Somehow it seems like they're linked to my movie-related memories.
What now?
It'll take some time for your friends to wire money.
I've got enough cash for us to take the Chinatown bus.
You wanna wander around the city for a while?
But-
I think I might've lived around here when I was a kid.
And I'm curious about that room...
Maybe I can find some proof before my past disappears forever.
"didn't you say ""it doesn't have a golden ring""?"
Did you mean...

This is brutal.

"Honey, you are really overreacting to this."
"I mean, you are totally attractive."
So you--you still love me?
"Of course, I still love you."
I love you no matter what.
"What does that mean, ""no matter what""?"
Nothing.
Just that I love you.
"No, ""no matter what"" means you love me even though I have some sort of problem, like no job or no money, or biggie can't fit through doorway!"
Ok.
I take it back.
I love you.
That's it.
Period.
"No, come on, Carrie."
I'm being serious here.
Let's go.
You're telling me right now you have no problem with that area in here?
Nothing?
"Well, you know, for health reasons-- no, no, no, no."
"I'm not talkin' about health here, ok?"

Um... he's my brother.
There's something really wrong with him.
- He really should have mentioned it.
- What?
"Um, he's really, er... passive aggressive."
"Basically, he's just a knob."
I don't care.
"It's only for an afternoon and I've got a regular fella, anyways."
- So...
- Classy.
"Still, plenty more fish in the sea, eh?"
Come on.
You all right?
What are you talking fish for?
Is there anything we can get you?
He needed to feed.
"So, you're saying we should have let him tear that girl's throat out?"
"No, I'm saying he can't survive like this forever."
"OK, but we can't turn him out onto the streets."
He isn't safe.

Oh.

I couldn't wait to move out and start my own life.
I thought I'd be an actress or a successful business woman.
"And then I told myself when the boys got out of the house, and started their lives, that I'd do the same thing."
And then I thought Dale had it together.
But he didn't.
He's starting over.

"Kill me if you must, Casshern, but this body won't last more than half a year amidst this destruction."
What does that have to do with me?
"Casshern, he who devours you shall attain eternal life."
That's ludicrous.

Die!

Now he said that the two of you we're trying to rob him.
Is that true?

An underground torture den?
There's a secret door.
If you look inside...
Secret door?

Let me get this straight.
The two of you were trying to rob the house of some kind of serial killer?

"Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burning in sky, do you like--"
Stop!
You worried about me?
- You were scared.
- Shut up.
"No, you were scared to go into the second tower on your own."
"I think you were afraid to go up the first time, so you were hoping that you could find some bullshit reason so you could stay downstairs."
Makes all kinds of sense right now.
"This is it, right?"
"This is it, pops.This is it, ain't it?"
- That ain't it.

Of course I wanted to go in.

All the bravado.
Running in like a madman.
"Tommy ""goddamn"" gavin, the firefighter with the biggest cock on the goddamn block."
"You know what, it's all bullshit, bro."
"But for right now, I'm free."
Once I get this ball and chain off my leg.
I'm waiting for my dad to take me to the courthouse for that.
I could drive you.
If you want me to.
So your mom didn't believe you when you said Leland was shady.
You don't sound very surprised.
"I'm used to that, that's why I called Syracuse University."
Talked to a lady at the school of architecture about how I was thinking of applying and did she know a James Leland.
You just called up and asked?
People love to talk.
And guess what?
James Leland went to S.U. And opened an office in town.
- See?
He's legit.
- Yeah.
He was a pretty good architect.
Right up until he dropped dead two years ago.
Introducing James Leland.
"Wait, my mom said his ID checked out."
Right.
"You ask a computer ""Is James Leland related to this Potter lady?"""
The computer says yes.
But you didn't ask if James Leland was still alive.
Knowing the right questions is better than having all the right answers.
Toby?
Mr. Dugan called with the good news.
Did you hear?
He told me.
We can get that awful thing off your leg right now.
The cab's waiting.
That's all right.
And a little bit of spit.
Kidding.
Testing.
Sorry.
"You have the Tesla, right?"
I'll trade you for the Farnsworth.
- But you have the gun.
"- I know, but it's the boring one."
"- Well, you lost the toss."
- I know.
Let's just go find this artifact and see if we can't change somebody's luck.
That thing is so freaky.
"- What, this?"
"- No, the thing behind you."
"Yeah, that."
"Well, trapped desires..."
"Refracted by light, sound, sex..."
Mind-altering drugs into a...
- Disco ball.
- Disco ball.
- A disco ball.
- I know.
"- Dude, how?"
"- Well, unknown."
"Unknown, but, mirrors are usually just gonna reflect light, but this thing projects yearnings and cravings."
You know what this thing does?
It imparts a grim stampeding inhumanity against anything decent.
You asked.
Don't worry.
"No, not in here."
"In here it's just a round, shiny object."
- But out there...
(SIGHING)
Gaston has escaped the Bastille.
And the King and Aramis have not returned from the Mausoleum.
This is not a coincidence.
ATHOS:
We ride for Saint-Denis.
(GRUNTS)
And I would apologise for the surroundings.
"But I imagine, as a soldier and a priest, you are well acquainted with death."
More than I'd have wished.
"Yes, I too am acquainted with death more than I'd have wished."
Death has a grip on me.
One I cannot break.
I am so sorry.
I don't want your sympathy.
That's not why you're here.
"But there is something I need from you, Aramis."
"Without it, I will not find peace."
"A truth I need to hear from your mouth, and don't lie."
You and my wife may think I'm a fool but I am not a fool.
I know.
Say it.
It will serve... no purpose.
You are a musketeer.
You only exist to serve my purpose.
I am ordering you!
Why dredge up the past?
Admit!
Admit you slept with the Queen!
I slept with the loneliest woman in Paris.
Don't you dare make excuses!
This woman suffered years of neglect and betrayal from your part.
- What?
- For my father.
Don't tell him I was with you.
"Wait, wait."
I'll take you.
"- No, we're going to take the tram."
- When will we meet up?
In two days.
In the same place as always.
Will you think about me?
I will.
I'd love to show you the youth of today.
"You can't imagine how different they are... they're better, they have revolution in their blood."
If only Trotsky and Lenin had known that.
Trotsky was a filthy traitor.
"Imagine what your mother would say if she heard you talk that way... about someone you never met, and someone who has passed away at that."
Mund...
"Sir, I want to go to Munich."
What for?
There's food here.
"Doctor, my head hurts."
Do you have something?
"No, I'm very sorry."
I don't have anything.
"- The Geneva Convention, prisioner."
- Mund...
The gentlemen will say that they're in good health...
- there's nothing to complain about.
- This prisoner has appealed...
- to the Geneva Convention.
- He's got no case at all...
- that idiot refuses to eat.
One not inclined to exaggeration.
What can this be?
Is Col. Brandon here?
- My horse!
- What's the matter?
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.
"Upon my soul, this is all very unusual."
"- Frailty, thy name is Brandon."
- Some cannot bear pleasure.
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.
Why?
"Everyone speaks well of him, but no one remembers to talk to him."
Nonsense.
He is highly respected at Barton Park.
- Which is enough censure in itself.
"- Really, Willoughby."
"Come, come, Mr. Impudence."
I know your wicked ways.
Reveal your beau.
No secrets between friends.
I'll winkle it out of you.
"I'll have you married to the colonel by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet."
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?
As you want.
"In the worst moments, Julian used to draw his silhouette with his finger."
He'd repeat it... over and over.
I didn't know what to say.
When you met..
What did Julian say?
We talked a bit about everything.
He told me what happened to him.
And about me?
That you were nice to him.
Nothing else?
"Also, what happened between you two."
He didn't look very affected that day.
It's true.
Shall we leave?
Do I look good?
Very good.
"The day he met you, he came home radiant."
The only important thing to him was that you wouldn't realize how happy he was for seeing you.
Do you know why he chose my poem to compose?
I thought he could've wrote it.
Specially the last verses.
"""And with hands trembling..."""
How was it?
"""With hands trembling by tenderness""."
He said you wrote it thinking of Clara.
Who knows.
I'm sure.
How is she?
I guess she's fine.
You and Clara broke up on time.
I was determined to leave Julian when he'd go out of the sanitarium.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day...
I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in.
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
You lose everything.
Everything...
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
"Excuse me, you've got a tag here."
I can't get it.
Where the fuck is my eyelash collar?
I get so mad.
These stupid people...
Here it is!
We're gonna do it this time!
We're gonna...
I think maybe we should get back out there.
We've got some time left.
They won't be finished for a while.
I'm gonna sew you out.
It's hideous out there.
I can't take it anymore.
I just walked off.
"I don't feel well, Paul."
I just wanna go home and cuddle off with you.
"Okay, I'II..."
- I'm gonna get your car.
- You're so sweet to me.
- I had a great time the other day.
- Me too!
I loved working with you at the shoot.
And I think we make great walking partners
- We should consider the marathon.
"- Listen, Jocelyn..."
I think you are amazing... and I loved... that walk with you as well... and I loved hanging out with you on the shoot... and God only knows I'm always so happy when I see your face...
I think we make great friends...
But...
Resin is a little pissed off because that I see so much of you... and I realized that...
I just hope I wasn't giving you the wrong idea.
No.
"Can you give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him."
All right?
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away, put it through the hoop."
Huh?
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
I can do that.
No.
No.
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge."
Here it is.
"Couple weeks ago, we're in rec watching some tube."
"This Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down there.
"You should have seen him, his eyes were crazy."
- Because he changed the channel?
"No, bro, it wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first class airfare, seven nights at the Kahiko Hotel."
"All-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of the Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now, and since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue,"
- we're throwing in $ 1 million.
- Aah!
Aah!
She's the reason Dawkins broke out of prison?
She won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
Thank you ...wonderful to be here.
Excuse me...
"Wow, you could have made an effort, Georgie."
Kill me now.
Hey!
"Oh, hey!"
Funny little dress.
"Such a little bitch, though."
"Ok, who wants to get high?"
"That's not very much for 3, is it?"
"Uh, we're gonna do blowbacks."
Blowbacks?
"What, what?"
Blowbacks.
What is that?
Who's got a light?
I've got a light.
"Thank you, thank you!"
Thank you for coming.
Everyone...
Thank you for supporting the Foundation.
"As you all know well, this auction is part of the Clios heritage."
And we are so glad to see the same familiar faces every year.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you and of course, we thank Georgina for the pleasure of this beautiful location, which is very dear to my heart."
Let's celebrate our beloved Constantine by having a good time tonight.
"Adele LeTissiet, leading light of the international opera scene."
Georgie?
Is everything...
Georgie?
What is this?
Is this live?
"Oh, my God, you are fucking hardcore!"
That was a close one.
Too close.
The little tramp!
"Ah, she's better than I thought."
"Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure."
"Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles."
Triton's daughter will be mine' And then I'll make him writhe.
I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook!
Eric?
If I may say... far better than any dream girl is one offlesh and blood... one warm and caring and right before your eyes.
Ariel!
"Ariel, wake up!"
Wake up!
I just heard the news!
"Congratulations, kiddo, we did it!"
Ooh.
What is this idiot babbling about?
"Right, as ifyou two didn't know, huh?"
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince... gettin' himself hitched this afternoon'
"You know, he's getting married."
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it!
"Well, now, Eric."
It appears that I was mistaken.
"This mystery maiden ofyours does, in fact, exist."
A-And she is lovely.
"Congratulations, my dear."
We wish to be married as soon as possible.
"Oh, yes, ofcourse, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know."
"This afternoon, Grimsby."
Which list?
The list.
It's a tragedy.
They burned it.
What are you talking about?
What is that list?
A hand written sheet with names and dates.
It was here.
I saw it only yesterday.
I did not think that it was important.
"I should have called you, Fandor."
Calm down.
Try to remember what was written.
"Well, I only remember..."
"""Baroness de Vibray"""
"""April 5"" and..."
And then?
"And then, of course, my brother's name with the same date."
"Maybe ""12 April"" was written too."
I'm not sure at all.
Not a word to anyone about what just happened.
We're here to help you with the circumstances you are going through.
We know everything about your financial situation.
Indeed.
"Through us, you could sell some of your unfortunate brother's paintings."
"Yes, and if he is still alive, as I wish, he will be happy to know that his paintings were taken care of."
It is very kind of you.
I'm very grateful.
You're welcome.
You are very pale.
Are you sick?
"No, not at all."
- What are you gonna do?
"Well, I have a plan, i do."
But I need money.
I need it fast.
I was thinking about that guy who wanted the snowmobiles.
- Yeah.
- You think he's still interested?
"Yeah, I think so, but you'd have to find some way to deliver 'em."
Set it up.
Set... it... up.
"- [ Dick ] $100,000?"
- That's right.
"You wanna sell me a lotto ticket worth $6.4 million for $100,000?"
Correct.
I want out.
"However, this is a one-time-only offer, Dick."
"I want the money, I want it tonight at the station."
"If I hear any excuses, any bullshit like, ""I can only get part of it""... or ""I need more time,"" the deal is off."
- Be reasonable.
It'll take days -
- Deal's off.
"- I'll get it, I'll get it."
- Good decision.
"[ Russ ] Now, I believe that i have solved all of our problems."
[ Crystal ] What century is this guy in?
"Put a motor on it, Jake!"
A year and a half behind this freak.
"One, I found a buyer for the snowmobiles, a guy in Colorado."
"I'm renting a trailer, and i'm gonna deliver them myself."
- But why Colorado?
"- But, uh, uh!"
Number two: the lotto ticket.
- Good and you?
- Not so bad.
Can we talk?
- Okay.
"- ""Talk."""
In your truck.
Okay.
Now that was just right.

"So how did you make out, super chief?"

"So, that's no toe-curlin' then?"
It's impolite to kiss and tell.
Nothin' wrong with a little stank on the hang down.
Nothin' wrong with a little takesin' out in the trades.
A little hizzin' in the skizzins.

Nothin' wrong with a little bacon makin'.
Nothin' wrong with a little shot twixt winds and waters.
A little building the blanket monster.
I know there's nothin' wrong with a little pituitary poke.

I do not.
This is the first time you fly.
Really?
You're doing very well.
What are you doing?
It should to sit in our seats.
Are you scared.
And champagne ... 1985 ...
For the women ...
I'm such a mess...
"On the other hand, I'm sure you chose right."
You're fine.
That's what the doctor says.
But it's not true.
You know I've always envied your job?
The music?
To me it's like magic.
Of course I have a terrible hearing.
There's nothing to envy about.
"It's just a hobby, not a job."
The composer who doesn't perform is nothing but an amateur.
I thought you were fine in Germany.
Yes...
Well that was before the sanitarium.
What sanitarium?
Didn't you know?
Everybody knows it!
I spent two years in a madhouse.
I didn't know at all.
Yes.
But what happened to you?
I had a screw loose I guess.
But know you feel better?
"Besides, you know, the crazy ones are the most intelligent."
It's a shame that no one else thinks that way.
You shouldn't care.
"Of course I care, unfortunately."
"Well, I'm fine now."
I have a couple of projects.
Even though I only need an orchestra.
But apart from that I'm practicing some songs.
I always mix that up.
Mm-hmm.
"Anyway, I suddenly found myself needing a G-7 encryption form."
Which are very hard to come by.

"I mean, we laugh about it now, but the rest, as they say, is history."
I hate couples.
You asked how we met.
"Granted, you kind of had to be there."
"Oh, no."
"No, not you guys."
You're great.
Just couples in general.
"The Jamaican resort I went to last Christmas, it was couples only."
And you were flying solo?
Changed my perspective.
Couples everywhere.
It was crazy.
Look at this airport-- it's got every variety.
Like those guys--
Self-Important Pete and his Electric Lady.
"Course, they haven't spoken directly to each other since the brownout of '06."
Then there's those two--
Daddy Issues Debbie and her college professor Marty Midlife-- teaching her all he knows about advanced economics
- and the Kama Sutra.
- Wait.
"Tony, that's no couple."
They're clearly father and daughter.
Think so?
Yeah.
I know I threatened you.
"In truth, I'm so glad"
You had the courage to tell me
How their fate had changed.
Yes.
They will be together.
For many years.
"I do this not out of any malice, as you are my son,"
But to ensure peace.
"So that should you return,"
You have seared into your memory
What is yours and what is not.

I'm a good man too.
"You're not a very trusting fellow, are you?"
I was a lot more trusting before you took my weapons.
You'll get those back as soon as you leave us.
They say you're a threat to the realm.
But your family wants you safe.
Alive.
Yes.
You're not thirsty?

I think I can win the competition without your charity.
"Thank you, though."
"Please, Mrs McCarthy, we're on our knees here."
Henry?
Henry!
Henry?
Henry!
Father.
Hemlock?
"That's what the doctor thinks, going by Henry's symptoms and the smell."
How extraordinary.
Poor Henry didn't notice the odd taste and drank the whole cup.
Probably because of his excesses last night.
How long does the doctor think he has?
Hours.
A day at most.
"Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man!"
- Louis!
- Ow.
- What are you doing?
"- Well, I was just, uh..."
"- I'm sorry, madame."
- [Huffs]
"You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom."
Something in the way of a tour.
"[Chuckles] I'm sorry, Grim."
What was that?
You can't spend all your time moping about.
You need to get out.
- Do something.
Have a life.
- Shh!
- Get your mind off...
"- Easy, Grim, easy."
"It's not a bad idea, if she's interested."
"Well, what do ya say?"
Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
Wonderful!
"Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate."
"- [Max barks] - [Whistles] Come here, boy."
- [Barks] - [Eric growls]
"This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life."
"I hope that you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady."
"Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you."
"Tomorrow when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best."
"You gotta bat your eyes, like this."
"You gotta pucker up your lips, like this."
Hmm.
That I am valuable.
That I matter.
And that I deserve to know everything I can about this world that you send me into every day so at least I have a fighting chance.
"You know, in spite of everything..."
"In spite of everything, I like you."
I think you're great.
And I want you to think the same of me.
I screwed up.
"Honey, my key's not working."
Where's him?
Him's not here.
- What room you looking for?
- My room.
Who are you?
You're cute.
And you're faking it.
You never con a con artist.
You had your chance to walk away.
You won't get another.
- Pete with you?
"- No, listen."
I'm a bit busy.
- Can I call you back?
"- Yeah, no, sure."
Everything okay?
It will be as soon as I can get back to work.
I got some bad news.
Leena tells me that your ferret escaped and she's tried to call for it.
She doesn't know its name.
"I don't even know if you finally did name that thing, did you?"
"No, actually, I never did."
Put some food out and it'll come back.
What is this?
I think I might as well go to Provincial Office work.
Just go then.
"You will just waiting for sleepy children, right?"
It might be more tiring.
It's better here!
We will not fall asleep here!
Didn't you say there's no point protecting the president's daughter?
It's very annoying coming here.
I know you enough.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Watch her closely.
I think she will dance until she slips off.
Okay.
"Today, we're also going to a Hotel, right?"
But...
You didn't meet with the old man recently?
"The days you did not meet him, made me very happy too."
We broke up already.
Maybe something has happened.
Even his mobile number has changed.
He should have contacted me.
What?
Broke up already?
Why?
Weren't you allowing me to sort out my relationship?
The case is...
"Now that I think you aren't popular amongst the guys, I've lost interest."
In just one moment my taste changed.
What?
Let's break up too.
"Really, Eun Ah..."
You do look handsome in your sou'wester.
Really?
Gin.
Mr. Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.
"Oh, we'll blame war transport."
- The old ham can make do with me.
So...
Positions!
Positions!
Everybody please be quiet for a take.
Don't stand under any thousand-pounders.
The director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
"No, he didn't say what it was about."
Tell him you couldn't find me.
But-
- But I have found you.
"No, you haven't."
You are exhausted.
"You're leaning against the rail of the ship, the wounded Johnnie cradled-- cradled in your arms."
"Oh, uh, no, thank you."
"You look up, and you see, coming towards you across the deck, a vision of loveliness."
And you say...
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I guess that must be you.
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
"You want your exponential growth, guys are gonna get busted."
Simple as that.
So how about we get him a real attorney?
"I mean, what the hell is this?"
This is who he hires?
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
- It's the guy you'd hire.
"- Look, you remember Emilio?"
"This dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
And then poof!
Dude's like Houdini.
"Seriously, when the going gets tough, you don't want a criminal lawyer."
All right?
"You want a ""criminal"" lawyer."
Know what I'm saying?
"Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White."
Badger's way too loyal to roll.
Why do you want him?
We have the two new guys.
Those cream puffs are useless!
Forget about 'em.
"Enough of your ""peep peep."""
"Mr. Biberkopf, my tie's come undone."
You got that patented tie holder?
Come to the Alexanderplatz.
They don't allow business in here.
"Franz, let's go somewhere else."
Take it easy.
Buy the real thing here!
Why do rich men on the west side wear ties but workers don't?
"One for 20, three for 50!"
Step right up!
"Shall I loosen my tie and sing a little song, boys?"
"Peep, peep, peep"
The dickey bird sings
Do you know where the dickey bird sings
In its cage
Where
On the wall Don't ask such stupid questions
Perhaps the honorable Mr. Biberkopf will sing something too.
You bet I will!
What should I sing?
Wait a minute.
What can the band play?
Wait a minute.
"Do you know ""I Once Knew a Comrade""?"
I once knew a comrade
You couldn't find a better man
But now it's all over and I've paid my dues
"Sid, what can I tell you?"
You know how I...
"How I felt about Claire, huh?"
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're ready, Mr. Fowler!"
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
Whoops!
We're hooked.
I'm terribly sorry to have this happen at such a tense moment.
"Mr. Fowler, we're ready!"
"I said, I'll be there."
"I'd better watch this, Lieutenant."
Do you mind?
SID:
"What's the story, huh?"
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're running a little late, Sidney."
"Let's move it, huh?"
"Lieutenant, what about this robber?"
Do you have any leads?
"Well, sir..."
"The truth is, it seems to be a little bit more complicated than a robbery, sir."
Oh?
What the Lieutenant is saying is that he's come to the conclusion that Claire may have been murdered and the robbery may be a cover-up.
Murdered?
That's insane.
"Don't you think you should have come to me first with this, Lieutenant?"
"Well, I tried to, sir."
I've been looking for you ever since last night.
I was with my lawyer last night.
"We meet for chess once or twice a month, and last night turned out to be a marathon session."
See?
That was easy.
"It's like I always say, when it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm."
You just show 'em that you mean business...
"And he's out of bed again, isn't he?"
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
"All right, what's this all about?"
Voices.
- Voices?
- In here.
Telling me what to do.
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
The early bird catches the worms!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey!
You're going to...
Maybe you sing him a little song.
"Come here, you..."
Hey!
What the...?
Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?
Sing!
Lullaby and good night
Close your big creepy eyes
If you sleep Away I'll creep
And get out of here alive
"You know, once you get past all the splinters and rope burns, he's actually kind of cute."
Now where did he go?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Now there's something you don't see every day.
"Oh, yeah?"
I am gonna punch a hole through your face.
I'd like to see you try that.
Yeah?
"- Ooh, you're gonna die!"
"- Oh, I am gonna rip your face off..."
- You're gonna die!
"- Make a shirt out of it, and I'm gonna wear it."
"I'm gonna take one second to take my shirt off, and then you're gonna die!"
What the...
"Hey, listen, lady."
"You wanna beat up on your little boyfriend, you go do it somewhere else."
Watch the car.
"- Dude, where the hell is your fighter?"
- He'll be here.
- He'll be here when?
- Soon!
"- Okay, you have five minutes to put a fighter in that ring."
- Okay.
Just got off the phone with Charlie.
"- Well, where is he?"
- He's in jail with Dee.
- What?
- Apparently they got all hopped up on amphetamines... and beat the shit out of some guy in front of the bar.
- Amphetamines?
"- Yeah, like, steroids or something."
I don't know.
"- Damn it, Charlie."
- Look at the dude he was supposed to fight.
- He's the scrawniest...
- I know!
Charlie would have killed that guy.
"It's not so shocking, and at same time it's true."
Ha!
Where is my report?
Here.
Yansky!
We'll deal with this together.
What do you look like?
You are dismissed.
The representant of the ecological committee of the UN.
"Ah, so that's him."
Could you please tell us what your first impressions were of your visit to us?
There he is!
"Really, you're right."
Sometimes even in your case it's possible to talk about intelligence.
Doctor.
-I didn't suspect that you know it.
-We scientists are one family.
Doctor Yansky is my best co-worker.
The pillar of our institution.
-Have you seen Mr. Cimrman here?
-He's at yours.
Master Miller!
I have read in Scientist your essay about the curvature of space.
Your hypothesis is absolutely crazy.
But these days crazy hypotheses have the right to be applied.
Congratulations.
Professor Horowitz.
I'm telling you here on this grain of space dust they tap excellent beer.
Come.
"I suppose, space is curved like this."
-I agree.
But...
Let's see what else you could have got.
"A sidecar - cognac, Cointreau lemon juice, sugar, syrup."
And you could also found Negroni.
Don't think I've ever heard of it.
"Gin, red vermouth, Campari, garnished with an orange peel?"
I bet you could do with one now?
LAUGHTER
"So, at the end of that, you had one point, that's taken you to seven."
The Lutrophiles are on 11.
In round three you're faced with a super-hive.
"You're looking for a number of answers that fit a certain category, but your challenge is to use every letter to find one, perfect solution."
"Team Lutrophiles, we're kicking off with you."
"Would you like the A hive, or the B hive?"
I think go we'll choose the A hive.
You're choosing the A hive.
You are looking for...
"You have two minutes, reveal the hive."
So...
You've got...
Cowdrey's maybe somewhere?
"Yep, yep, yep."
"So, who've we got?"
Gower.
"Hang on, you've got Brearley."
Gower...
That's clashing with Brearley.
Put the other Y for Cowdrey.
"Oh, OK."
Put the other Y.
There we are.
And then put Brearley round it.
Right.
DuBois.
DuBois.
It's a French name.
"It means ""woods,"" and blanche means ""white""  so the two together mean ""white woods""  like an orchard in spring."
You can remember it by that if you care to.
"You are stella's sister, are you not?"
Yes.
stella is my precious little sister.
I call her little in spite of the fact that she's somewhat older than I am.
"Oh, just slightly."
Less than a year.
will you do something for me?
Sure.
"Yes, what?"
I bought this adorable little paper lantern at a Chinese shop on Bourbon.
Put it over the light bulb.
"will you, please?"
I'd be glad to.
I can't stand a naked light bulb any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action.
"well, I guess we strike you as being a pretty rough bunch."
I'm very adaptable to circumstances.
"well, that's a good way to be."
-You're not--?
-Married?
"Oh, no."
"No, I'm an old maid schoolteacher."
"You may be a schoolteacher, but you're certainly not an old maid."
"Why, thank you, sir."
I appreciate your gallantry.
So you're in the teaching profession.
Yes.
-Yes.
A baloney sandwitch and water.

"Hey you, fellas, wanna go see High School Musical three tonight?"
Bunch of kids from school are gonna go see it again.
What's High School Musical three?
"You know, a sequel to High School Musical one and two."
What's High School Musical one and two?
This-
- This is not even condom its only's baloney sandwitch.
What's High School Musical one-
- DUDE!
Its only V most popular thing with kids in our age group.
Yeah!
Where the hell are you guys-- b-been?
Peru.
And then I saw High School Musical three again on friday and guess who was there.
Briden Gueermo.
"Briden Gueermo, oh, he's such a dream."
I'd give anything to be with Briden Gueermo.
But he'd never go for me.
I'm nobody.
"That's not true, Red."

Everyone is special in their own way.

Together we stay and every kid in school is special in their own way

He is sticking to me like a leech and torturing me.
What sort of background work have you done?
He is in love with me.
You have easily dealt many men before this.
This guy doesn't even stand a chance.
You are being a bit restless.
Fetch me some water.
Deal with him with some patience.
If it doesn't work out... we'll change the plan.
Thomas.
"Get me my handbag from the backseat, please."
There is a pen inside.
This one?
- Open the cap.
Thanks.
Vasundhara!

What's it?
Vasundhara...
"- Tell me, what is it?"
It will not take any time for me to poke this into your throat!

Ravi drafted the plan.
We went to Chennai to meet Varun...
Ravi sold all the jewels... we looted from Varun.
Ravi... has all the money.
Sorry.
I'm very sorry.
If uncle has taken such a step...
I'm the one to be blamed.
"I thought that if you had too much money, you will spend it all on alcohol and other such nonsense."
I have saved a share separately for you.

"They killed all the giant housekeepers, too?"
How are we gonna find a compass in this mess?
By looking.
Start searching.
I wonder how much treasure we could carry down the beanstalk.
"In addition to the compass, of course."
What the hell?
HOOK:
That would be Jack.
"- As in, Jack..."
- The giant killer.
With that toothpick?
It packs quite a wallop.
You'd be surprised...
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
It's about bloody time. (SIGHS)
Um... (GRUNTS)
It's a tripwire.
Quite a security system.
"Well, that's a plausible excuse for grabbing me, but next time, don't stand on ceremony."
Let's find the compass and go home.
Where you going with the time capsule ?
Home.
Unveiling it was supposed to be a special event.
The whole weekend's ruined.
"I mean, some things you just can't party plan."
"You know, actually, I'd like to see the contents if you don't mind."
At least someone will get to see the time capsule.
Here's the list.
We buried it underground right before graduation.
All our favorite memories.
"""Rubik's Cube, Atari 2600,"
"Whitesnake CD,"
"President Bush elected."""
"That's the first one, right ?"
"Dubé champagne."""
The same brand as the murder weapon.
The bottle's not in there.
"Did you take it out, Krystal ?"
"What do you mean, take it out ?"
No !
"Oh, my God !"
Our beach in a jar.
It broke !
That might be evidence.
Evidence ?
I'm confused.
Let me guess.
You brought it back from your trip senior year in the Bahamas ?
How'd you know ?
Are you the only one with a key to the time capsule ?
"Well, there's one other person."
Not that she ever cared about the class project.
I'm sure.
You gonna be all right?
I'll be all right.
And you?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I think so."
Tell Catherine it brought me luck.
I will.
"I'll be seein' you around,"
Dr. Jackson
"I'm telling you, the government has a car that runs on water, man."
"They just don't want us to know, because then we'd buy all the water."
Then there'd be nothing left to drink but beer.
And the government knows that beer... will set us free.
"Hyde, you told us about the car a million times."
Can we please talk about how hungry and horny I am?
I wish I had a lady made of pizza.
Or a pizza made of boobs!
"Yeah, hungry, check."
"Horny, check."
"It's getting a little old, Fez."
"God, I feel like I'm Luke Skywalker, you know?"
Remember when he was living on Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up?
Just workin' on Uncle Owen's water farm all day.
Not even allowed to go into Toshie Station to pick up some power converters.
Boring.
"Eric, enough with the Star Wars crap!"
"Whenever you talk about that stuff, I frown."
"And when I frown, my skin wrinkles."
"And if I get wrinkles, my free ride is over."
And I like my free ride!
I third it.
"All those in favor will please say ""aye."""
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Contrary-minded?
Nay.
You'll get your mop.
Aye.
That makes it unanimous.
Any further business?
Do i hear a motion to adjourn?
Let me do it.
I move we adjourn.
I second the motion.
I third it.
Meeting's adjourned.
"Good night, mr."
Fisk.
"Good night, mrs."

"Good night, arthur."
"Good night, sam."
We only needed a $1 million issue to cover our stock shortage.
What do you think you're gonna do with the other 9 million?
"If we can get cornele to buy it, we'll give him the licking' of his life."
"It'll take more money than you ever thought of, commodore, to stop that erie flood."
"You bought over $9 million worth of the stuff now, and they still got lots to sell."
"Cornelius, why don't you stop buying and start selling?"
I don't need any suggestions from you to make me a bigger fool than i am.
"If i sell now, the price will drop like a punctured balloon."
"I won't have any money, any stock, or any control."
And then it keeps on splitting wider and wider

- Good.
So--so what... does the sword...do?
The blade in this particular sword
Is said to be so perfect that light splits in its path
And goes around the person holding it.
"Um, are we--are we talking about, um, invisibility?"
Mm.
Kind of.
In effect.
"No, the person's still there."
"Although, you know, the light that we see"
"Doesn't hit-- yes, invisibility."
Awesome.
I knew-
- I knew that was possible.
I knew it.
Okay.
Invisible swords now...
"Hey, Artie, these are-- these are the same sword, right?"
- Yeah.
- They don't match.
What?
"Well, you see, disc thing that's attached to the grip--"
"Well, it's in the painting, but it's not in the sword"
From the dig site.
It's missing its tsuba.
"This piece right here is called a ""tsuba."""
"It's actually a collectible in its own right,"
"You know, separate from the sword."
But this is missing its tsuba.
"Oh, you Jews are so Old Testament."
I did my job.
How are things?
"Barney and I are still under the same roof, if that's what you mean."
"He does the dishes, I sort the socks and ironing, we don't talk."
So all back to normal.
"As in, you mean, are you off the hook?"
"No, I didn't mean that."
(Quiet knock on door)
Just a sec.
Wendy rang.
"Something about a meeting with John Bartrop, which typically you didn't share with me."
I don't know any John Bartrop.
Who is John Bartrop?
You were apparently due at Fuzz's school an hour ago.
"Oh, shit."
That John Bartrop.
Sorry.
"Um, Red, can we talk later?"
Why?
"He is a beautiful student, an absolute pleasure to teach."
"You don't have to sugar coat this for me, you know."
I mean every word of it.
"The other teachers' comments have ranged from,"
'Is everything alright at home' to 'Have doctors mentioned medication?
'
"(Laughs) Well, Finnegan has issues."
His attention span isn't enormous but he's so engaging and clever.
Wow.
"Well, he does like your classes."
English is the only subject he seems to study.
He expresses himself beautifully.
"Granted I was asleep, but I can feel it."
Something's happening.
And I have almost no makeup on.
"Take a good look around, fat, look at this house, 'cause you ain't comin' back here no more."
"By the way, uh,"
"I'm joining the gym on the Deacon's family plan, so if anybody calls, he's the man I share my life with."
Carrie.
I'm not putting it on!
I'm just looking at it.
It's sparkly.
Ok.
"Darling, let me introduce you to Frank, a.K.A. Mr. safety."
"""Mr. safety""?"
Reading about this recent crime wave made me concerned for your well-being.
"Just sit him on the passenger seat in your car when you go to work, and the carjackers will move on to easier prey."
"Dad, I take the subway to work."
"Well, then, take him on the subway with you."
He has no legs.
Pretend he's an amputee.
"Dad, how is a legless doll gonna protect me on the subway?"
Why are you being so difficult?
I'm trying to save your life!
"Oh, forget it!"
Nope.

"My dear, John is waiting for you to bring him home."
Wonderful.
"Well, it was a great 10 months."
This isn't the end.
We'd better go in.
We won't be able to see each other.
We can't pull this trick again.
-Because it's not.
What's his name?
-Daniel.
"Daniel is in college, and he faces issues completely different than yours."
What do you mean?
Strikes and all that?
-For example.
Well we're gonna make one.
I don't know if not going to school is considered as a strike.
I'm not sure about that at all!
You're so reactionary.
I'm worried about you dating an 18 years old boy.
And what if he were 20?
I'd be more worried.
Don't laugh about it.
It's not funny at all.
It's not that.
"The other day, a guy who's 20 asked me to go to skate with him."
Then tell him to go to skate with his mom.
"Hey, that would be if I wouldn't wanted to go, huh?"
Don't talk to me like that!
Can I know why are you upset?
"-I'm not, I'm just worried."
You sound just like mom.
"""Don't talk to me like that!"""
Is there any of your friends talking to their fathers about this stuff?
Not that I know of.
And is there anyone brave enough to tell them the same?
Neither.
And what about that priest you guys are meeting.
You talk like that?
Like you and me?
Get your heads out of your asses.
We got two frisees... one torn crab- and fire the sweetbreads.
Oops-a-daisy.
I'm sorry.
It seems I got a little enthusiastic with the coulee.
"Well, whilst you're licking things-"
Make it again.
"- I got your back, bro."
- Hmm.
Oh-ho!
Oh!
- [ Popping Sound ] - [ High-Pitched Squealing ]
- What the hell was that?
"- It's called "" the shocker."""
And any of you tools try and touch me again... and you're gonna get one of your own.
"Hey, I'm used to being the only woman in the kitchen... so back off or bend over."
- Oh.
- Raise your hand if you got a semi right now.
Semi-what?
"You don't actually like that thing, do you?"
"Oh, I know."
I wish I didn't 'cause it so fits into the stereotype.
But the truth is this poofy little dog has won my heart.
- I love you.
"- You guys... when my friend Jessica shows up tomorrow, please be gentle, okay?"
"Ooh, what's wrong with her?"
"Oh, does she wear the big shoe?"
"She's not a freak, okay?"
She's just a bit of an outcast.
"You know, could never get a boyfriend."
"She was kind of like my project, my mascot."
I tried to teach her how to be cool.

Aah!
It's in my finger.
hen was small had a desk.
"t was weird because wrote on it ""hen grow up wanna be a singer. """
lik e scribed it in.
And it's still on the desk.
Life at home was my dad mom and my three sisters.
You could say had a heavy woman influence  from a young age.
e lived in a tiny house.
used to have a little bed in my mum and dad's room.
used to sit on the windowsill and imagine things lik e winning the lottery.
hen was little knew that wanted to entertain people.
was a proper show-off.
At school was always trying to play the class clown.
've always been that guy that made people laugh.
used to get kick ed out of class for singing rish traditional songs at the back of geography.
could always hear my sister's music at the top of the stairs and used to pretend to have a guitar and 'd perform in my mirror in my bedroom.
wasn't really interested  in things that other kids were interested in.
Are they farts or are they queefs?
Do you know what I mean?
This is the problem.
A front bottom one.
"I often think it's easier to say it's queef than a fart, because..."
I've never heard queef.
I'm enjoying queef.
I know.
A fanny fart.
"Yeah, but queef, what's that mean?"
I don't know where that came from.
It's an American word.
"Yeah, it is."
It's a pussy fart.
"Well, thanks for clearing that up."
When your cat farts.
Exactly!
"I don't think a man's as put off by a pussy fart, because they just think it's funny and it's often the result of something good happening."
"Whereas if you just let rip, a man's not going to go,"
"""I'm going to marry you for that revolting smell you just made."""
"Queef I think could be onomatopoeic, as in it's the sound it makes."
Queef!
"If you did willy farts, men would never stop doing willy farts."
"Oh, my God, it would be..."
Can you imagine it?
Especially if it made a whistling sound.
The joy that spread over your faces just thinking about that!
"If we could do willy farts, I would do one right here on this show."
"It should be like old Victorian policemen, you know."
Feep!
Feep!
"It's like a call - ""I need help'!"" Feep!"
-What's this?
-It's an orange from Miami.
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.
Johnny?
Tom won't stay.
He only handles specific areas of the business.
"Sure, Mike."
"-What are you drinking, Johnny?"
-Anisette.
"-If you need anything, I'll be outside."
"-Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom."
-I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
-How is his health?
It's not good.
Can I do anything or send anything?
"He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect."
That casino...
Registered owners.
"Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay."
Beverly Hills attorneys.
The real owners are the old Lakeville Road group and our friend in Miami.
"Klingman runs it and owns a piece of it too, but I've been instructed to tell you that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along."
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.
Hyman Roth always makes money for his partners.
"One by one, our old friends are gone."
"Death, natural or not, prison, deported..."
"Only Hyman Roth is left, because he always made money for his partners."
I can't believe it!
Out of 30 professional musicians there isn't one Italian!
Let's have a tarantella!
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"If you just tell me who your supplier is,"
I think this can end very well for you.
What are you doing talking to my client without me present?
You Sneaky Pete!
Which is which?
"What, did the Academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to Baby-Face?
Did you say anything stupid?
"By anything stupid, I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago!
Go on!
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read 'em to you?
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
But you have to tell her.
You owe her and you owe me.
She doesn't give a shit.
You are so infuriating.
Is that the language you use in this house?
I just think that it would be good if you told her.
"If you don't, I will."
I'm going to see what's going on.
We thought he was dead.
- We didn't think he existed.
- You're still lying.
"No, I'm not lying."
Jørgen tried to find him in India lots of times.
He never reacted and so we assumed that he wasn't...
"- I don't have time for this, Mom."
"- Jacob was a big, immature child!"
He fucked everything with a pulse.
He was drinking himself to death.
He did drugs.
"He had grand ideas, but did nothing."
"He probably means well, but you can't trust him."
"- He wants to save everyone, but..."
- I don't care if he's fucked a goat.
I have a right to know who my father is.
- You can't manipulate people like that.
- We're not.
Fuck off and leave us alone!
Not right now.
You're far out.
What's Jørgen's reaction?
Anna?
- Should I come along?
No kid of mine is going to hand me any lip!
I didn't sweat half my life in a steel box to come out and get this from you!
You're Joe!
"Joe Krozac, jr., Understand?"
And you and I are going back to that dame -your mother-
"She'll tell you that I'm your father from first to last, understand ?"
- Yes.
- You gonna behave ?
Sure.
"Sure, I am."
Come on.
We got to get out of this.
Dig in under.
That's what you do with a haystack.
Did you leave any money for the eggs?
"Boy, you sure got funny ideas."
But you and I are going to get along all right.
We won't have any more beefs on each other.
I hope not.
'Cause you got brains.
"You know, I like brains around me."
"Your angle on digging last night, you know?"
"And this fire, with the poles and everything-"
Where did you learn that kind of stuff?
From dads.
"You see, he taught me all about camping out like this."
"You see, we went on a camp hike last month-"
"Come on, come on."
Let's get moving.
- We had a race to see who could-
"- Come on, come on."
"catch the most fish, and he caught 20 bass and pickerel, and that only made-"
"Okay, I am, kinda, but that doesn't change anything."
I still plan on doing the best job I can do while I'm here.
How lucky for us.
I would never have taken this job if I didn't respect what I.A. does.
We investigate our own.
When they've done something wrong.
But I.A. also defends and clears the innocent when wrongly accused.
Nice.
You been practicing that?
- How'd it sound?
- Good.
But I'm not the one you need to convince.
Joe Penn was a whiner.
Wanted morphine for four stitches.
I handed him off to an intern.
What about Valerie McDougal?
Valerie was brought in about 1:00 a.m.
She was involved in the same bar fight as Joe Penn-- come on!
The bartender-- she was pretty messed up.
Two broken ribs and a busted lip.
"I wrapped the ribs, glued her lip, and gave her some pain meds and told her to take it easy."
Is Valerie still here?
No.
Her boyfriend came and picked her up around 3:00 a.m. boyfriend?
Yeah.
Some big ugly-looking cop.
- How'd you know he was a cop?
- Ha.
Flashed his badge.
How'd you know he was her boyfriend?
I saw 'em kissing.
- Anything else?
- Or he wanted us...
"- Oh, man."
I remember that.
- He made me...
I smelled something.
- Everyone had to do it.
- We all had to do it.
- That's so right.
"And then, like, there were times where in the bathroom scene you were like, ""Girls, it's a great opportunity for like bathroom humor."""
"- Oh, my God."
"- And we were all like, ""What?"""
It was 5 in the morning and the three of us looked at you:
"""No, we're not gonna do that."""
I think it's relatable to an audience to witness someone else smell something bad.
"- Oh, God."
- It is.
Think about it.
I remember talking to you about this when you're like:
"""Why is it my instinct to make someone else smell something bad?"""
Right.
"And then inevitably somebody says, ""Here, smell this."""
Speaking of smelly things.
- How did you feel about this foot...
"- Oh, God."
- Nice one.
"- Oh, Alexis' foot, doesn't..."
- She's an extremely pleasant...
"- That's her real foot, right?"
- That's a stunt foot.
- Right.
"- No, that's really Alexis' foot."
- That's an Alexis foot.
Now we're even.
"So long, Stacey."
"Come on, you."
On your feet.
"Honest, Stacey, honest."
It wasn't my fault.
I told ya I didn't want anybody killed.
Get moving.
Where you taking me?
"You didn't think I was gonna let you live and welsh on that confession, did ya?"
"No, no."
Let me alone!
Let me alone!
"Please, Stacey, please!"
[GUNFIRE]
[¶¶¶]
[¶¶¶]
"So long, old-timer."
"I guess if you hadn't socked me on the chin,"
"I'd be laying in the icehouse now, along with Dale and the rest."
I-
"- Gee, I don't know what to say."
"Never mind, Red."
You'll be out yourself before long.
Thanks.
"So long, Frank."
"It oughta make up for what you've gone through in here,"
"Ross, to know that it hasn't been in vain."
"The day Stacey came to me and gave himself up,"
I asked him why he was throwing away his freedom.
"I didn't fully understand all he tried to tell me, but it was something about you living the rest of your life for him as he might have lived it himself if he'd had the right breaks when he was a kid."
Then he asked me for a photograph of himself.
Now you will know when the lenders..
..will come and ask you forthe money!
You will realize when your houses will be auctioned!
You will realize when your mills will be locked up!
What are you waiting for?
Go!
Leave!
Get lost from here!
Leave before my watchman comes here..
..throws you out of my cabin!
Just leave from here!
"I say, get lost from here!"
"Forgive me, sir!"
Forgive me!
"congratulations, sir!"
Congrats!
Why are you so sad at this happy occasion?
Now you have already revenged your enemies!
You have got back yourSwarg!
But still you are..
"Airport, heaven cant be a heaven.."
..unless God dwells in there!
"You are right, Krishna."
We have looked for him everywhere.
But we couldnt find him!
I am afraid that he might have..
"No, Airport!"
It cant be!
As long as I am alive nothing can happen to him!
He is not meeting me because he is annoyed with me.
"But tomorrow, I will visit a temple where.."
..he had found me when I was an orphan!
Come on Judy.
"Let's go, Clarence."

"(MAN, OVER RADIO):"
"This is Cape Kennedy, bringing to the entire world via international shortwave the launching of the most important animal in the world,"
Judy the astro-chimp.
At this moment a rocket is being launched into space.
"Judy, the sweetheart of the whole civilized world, sits in her spacecraft atop this mighty rocket."
Ready to be blasted into a perilous ride through space to make the first landing of any living creature on the moon.
"When Judy takes that first step on the moon, she will become the most famous chimp in history."
We are now in the last 10 seconds of the countdown.
All conditions are go.
"And still counting-- 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2... 1, ignition, blast-off."

She's awake.
"Atta girl, Sally, you did it."

- Right.

"- Yes, sir."
This is Captain Stedman calling Nagoro.
"Come in, Nagoro."
"Come in, please."
"(MAN, OVER RADIO):"
This is Nagoro.
"Come in, Captain."

We have found the missing astro-chimp Sally at Wameru game reserve.
"Repeat, we have found Sally."
What is her condition?
"Repeat, what is her condition?"
(MAN):
May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm.
She has a crush on Chopin.
The Polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
Absolutely not!
"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"Really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
Are we at a livestock sale?
"She's a woman, not a goat."
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not.
"""I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I love, that is all."""
"""But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
"No, it's like something out of a novel..."
- He's all right.
We'll run him through the wringer.
He'll wash.
- How was the ball game?
- We beat the daylights out of them.
"- You did, eh?"
What was the score?
- Sixty-three to 40.
But we only played five innings.
Fat hit a homer and we lost the ball.
And you've torn your pants again.
"Well, I was sliding into third and Muggy spiked me."
"Yeah, what did you do to him?"
I smacked him.
"You know, when I was his age, I could lick any kid in the neighborhood."
- Ouch.
- What's the matter?
- That's where he smacked me back.
That's all there is.
The fellows think I'm gonna get the job.
And I...
"Well, I'm the best man in the shop, ain't I?"
"Gee, Pop, you'll be foreman and that's about the highest job there is, ain't it?"
Heh-heh-heh.
"Well, I wouldn't say that but it's pretty high."
"Well, wait till I tell Muggy about this."
He thinks he's hot because his uncle used to be a foreman.
"Yeah, we'll get Muggy, won't we?"
"- Come on, boys, dinner's ready."
Okay.
"And if I'd have known about this, I'd have fixed us a real spread."
"Oh, don't you worry, kid."
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I got it.
- You sure?
"Okay, I'm just gonna sleep for, like, 15 minutes, right?"
"And then you wake me up, and then we'll switch it off."
- You good?
- I'm fine.
My God.
My God!

"And you, you shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store."
You shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store.
What is the matter with you?
I told you to pace yourself.
I have a drinking problem.
"Well, then, you should know how to hold your booze a little better."
I'll hold your boobs a little better.
"Oh, good one."
"Ladies, can I help you?"
Hello.
We are here for the Manolos.
- And what's your shoe size?
- 13.
We don't carry shoes that large.
Perhaps you'd like to try the Big and Tall store down the street?
You know what?
I don't like this bitch's attitude.
Did she just try and break a bottle over my head?
"No, of course she didn't."

"like me, too."
What happened?
"I was coming home from a date, happy, it had gone well between us."
It was exactly 1 :15.
"I slowed down in front of C,duIie's, all the lights were on outside."
"I saw polo, in his PJs, alone in the yard."
"I got out and I saw C,duIie with the gun."
"And then I saw the black guy, with eyes big as saucers."
"He came on his bike, but why come here?"
And why the gun?
"I asked C,duIie: "" What's going on?"""
What's going on is...
"what's going on... it's... that, there."
"...she said, showing her broken little plaster negro."
Then I understood what was going on.
"The statue was beyond repair, even for Crazy glue."
I Iooked at the kid and asked:
What got into you?
"Him, not a word."
He didn't seem to understand me.
So she told me:
Maybe he thinks it's ugly.
"That happens sometimes, huh?"
We don't all have the same taste.
"No, but you still got to be pretty shameless."
And he was shameless.
He didn't look at all ashamed.
"I took the gun from her, but she defended him and said:"
- Haven't you heard about Selena Cross?
"- No, why?"
"She killed her stepfather, Lucas."
"Her trial starts in two days, for murder."
"Lucas was always a bad joe, but she seemed to be able to put up with him."
Who ever knows what anyone's able to put up with?
"Well, that's true."
Sure took me a long time to know about myself and understand Peyton Place.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
I'm gonna go back and try and work things out with my mother.
Maybe we'll both be happier.
"If not, well, at least I've made the effort, you know?"
I always wondered why you enlisted.
"In the paratroopers, I mean."
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother I realized how wonderful life really was.
Then I fought like a tiger to stay alive.
I was running away from my problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
- Okay.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
All right.
"Hey, have you had dinner?"
"Would you like dinner, with me?"
- Okay.
- Okay?
That's why it's not magnetic.
I've never seen markings like this before.
It can mean only one thing.
"It must be a page from the Book of Atlantis, hidden there by Solon himself."
"Kelly, can you take us into the crater?"
Yes.
"If we leave now, we can make it before sunset."
Come on.
"Well, it looks like it was a temple."
Strange place for one.
Great place to hide a treasure though.
"Well, if there was an entrance, it's long since been destroyed."
Here.
Let's clear it.
"In ya go, MacGyver."
MacGyver.
Did you find anything?
"Oh, yeah."
Bigtime.
Incredible.
Look familiar?
A Copernican model of the solar system.
Built thousands of years before Copernicus was born.
The planets must be orbiting closer to the alignment.
The gravitational shift of the alignment's making the volcano unstable.
I hate when that happens.
"Solon said, ""Enter the Gates of Hades."""
"Well, what are we waiting for?"
Ah!
Poor devil.
What triggered it?
Do you think it's Cleeve?
"You know, some people might find it peculiar that I, a Muslim, am buying so much fertilizer."
OK.
"Well, enjoy your fertilizer and being a Muslim."
I'll get your change.
Aren't you supposed to go to Amaar's mosque kick-off press conference?
"Yes, I am."
"It's a town meeting, and I am the mayor."
And yet you're not moving.
I will.
Just waiting for Charles to call.
I just want to hear his voice.
We've hardly talked at all this week.
Hey!
"Stop ignoring me, I'm actually opening up."
I'm sorry.
I'm just lost inside my head.
I don't think I'm a Muslim anymore.
Have you eaten any bacon yet?
"I've toyed with the idea, but I haven't followed through."
I just keep asking myself:
Why am I a Muslim?
"I mean, is it because of Rayyan, because if it's because of..."
"Oh, my God!"
"OK, you win."
I'll go to Amaar's press conference.
Just stop talking.

Mayor Popowicz's phone.
Oh!
"Hello, Charles."
"Well, I must say that's very descriptive, but this is Sarah, and I'm not nearly that flexible."
I'll let Ann know you called.
- I know.
It's just that you...
This piece of junk is really badly designed.
Sorry.
You seem tired lately.
"As a lover of justice, you should understand... that I'm going through a difficult moment."
- Recent separation...
- Four months is not so recent.
"Right, it's not... but then there's my father's case against his latest wife."
The judge is going to rule this week.
Juan.
How is he?
He's all right... but I want him to stay away from all the dirt in the case.
"Welcome to England, Acacio."
Are you going to miss Brazil?
"Yes, I am."
And what do you think you're going to miss most?
Especially you.
What have you got to say to your new fans in Manchester?
"Hello, Manchester people."
I love you.
"Sorry to interrupt, but this is the fourth class that I've been at."
"Your grammar is perfect, but I disagree with the subject."
Really?
Gordo wants to change the program.
Wants.
Adapt the curriculum to Acacio's basic needs in England.
And these basic needs are?
Trash talk.
Yeah.
"The bad is good, teacher."
The English play an Anglo-Saxon-style soccer.
We don't have time.
HENRY:
We should take the time.
"If we're going to be in a relationship, we want to get off to a good start."
You know what?
Why don't we just hang out here?
Do you like board games?
"Henry, I really want to see the movie."
The 7:30 movie.
"What you want, Dylan, is very important to me."
But what your parents want is just as important.
Good man.
Nice to get some respect.
You sleep on the bed.
Let the girls sleep on these.
"Okay, I'm sure they won't mind."
Thank you so much for letting them come over.
Letting them?
"Honey, this is your house, too, and your friends are always welcome here."
I'm so happy you made some friends.
I know how lonely you've been.
"Yeah, my old friends kind of abandoned me."
"Ah, who needs them?"
You're a darling girl.
You're smart and you're a lot of fun.
You girls have a good time tonight.
"Now, I've got pizzas and salad, there's some fruit, popcorn, cookies."
There's some leftover chicken.
I can make some flautas and guacamole.
Whatever you want.
I think the pizza and the salad will be enough.
Thank you so much.
- Get out.
- Okay.
- So many questions.
It was never boring working with you people.
Hmm.
Back and forth.
Back and forth.
"One day your government wants me,"
The next I'm a crackpot.
"Your own partner said to me, ""never again."""
Even then I knew
One day one of you would be back
To place an order.
Huh?
"Oh, it better be cash."
American credit ain't what it used to be.
What's that?
Another gadget for me to tinker with?
Wait.
I did what you asked.
Lots of eyes to make the switch here.
I guess night's our only option.
White house won't be any easier.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable doing it
Before it gets anywhere near the president.
"It's ridiculous that we don't know what we're protecting him from, but..."
Typical Artie.
"I mean, I understand grabbing the artifact"
Before it causes trouble.
But he couldn't spare two seconds
To warn us about what we're walking into?
"Look, I'm sure if it were really dangerous,"
Do we have to?
Why?
No reason.
Is that all you have to say on the matter?
What is this need to have a reason for everything?
"Oh, of course, I forget, you're a pathologist."
You tend to be very literal about things like reasons.
"When you killed them, when you looked into their eyes, what were you hoping to see?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Killers meet the same end as saints.
"There is no heaven, no hell no final judgment."
You hope'!
Aren't you gonna ask me if I had a troubled childhood?
try and unravel the meaning of it all?
I've got more meaningful things to do with my life.
Tom?
I'm still here.
I've been thinking.
"Not about work, I hope."
About you.
Really?
I've been thinking about you and your father.
You need to forgive him.
If you don't want to end up like me.
What do you mean?
Bitter.
Bitter about what?
Not marrying.
Not having children.
Buying my life in my work.
You have a father.
Where are your two pals?
Ray and Pluto?
They'll be here soon.
How soon is that?
I don't know.
They have to call first.
How do I know you're not lying to me right now?
How do I know they're not going to show up here any minute?
"I'm not lying to you, Dale."
What are you going to do with me?
Go on.
Get in the other room.
Go on.
Go on in the living room.
What are you doing?
Sit down.
No!
What are you doing?
"There's some fellows from L.A. that want to meet you, Lila."
"Dale, put the phone down."
Why should I do that?
'Cause Ray and Pluto are gonna be calling out here to see if everything is cool.
And I'm not going to answer the phone if you call those cops out.
"Oh, yes, you are."
I won't.
Goddamn it!
"Lila, even if I wanted to, I can't help you."
I don't have the legal authority.
"You didn't have the legal authority to fuck me when I was 17 years old, but that didn't stop you then, did it?"
"Yeah, that's right."
"Instead of sitting out there spying on me all night, why didn't you just come in here and say hello to your son?"
He's not my kid.
Where do you hail from?
Suburban narcotics squad.
Sick of smashing syringes?
You could say that.
"Klein is sulking, stay with him."
Don't chat with the enemy.
We're enemies?
"bri/OCU, it's an old rivalry."
- Aren't we a big family?
- So they say.
She's private property.
Klein's?
Who else?
How could you be pals with him?
He wasn't always like this.
Their names?
Winterstein.
Bruno and Rolf.
The one who did me was Bruno.
Christo warned me:
"""Your big mouth will get you in trouble."""
Now it has.
"7 vans in 1 8 months 9 conveyors slaughtered, and a 2 million Euro booty."
The Ministry of the lnterior sent us a memo.
"Asking us, and I quote:"
"""to tackle the problem head on"
"""and neutralize the criminals"
"""who've derided our forces for too long."""
"""Too long"" is bad!"
"Means we've been around for too long, doing nothing!"
As of today you're on duty 24 hours a day!
"Drop your personal problems, don't laze on Sundays, go out and nab that gang of fuckers before they strike for the 8th time!"
She knows.
"She knows I'm helping you, she knows I'm following them."
She knows everything.
And she bugged my house.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
They were all over the place.
And they weren't even that careful.
And she made very sure I was aware of it.
She probably wanted to goad you into making contact with us.
Yeah.
They had someone follow me.
I almost killed myself unloading the son of a bitch.
"So, Fi, what do I do?"
"I mean, she's getting closer, and I don't know how much more we can meet like this."
"Well, I'll talk to Michael."
"But in the meantime, if you need to reach us, you leave the house and use this, okay?"
It's a burner phone.
It should be safe to use.
Wait.
One more thing.
"A long time ago, Michael disappeared, and he never said goodbye."
Promise me you won't do that.
I promise.
Nothing here.
Anything on your side?
Jabbar rolls pretty heavy.
"My guess is, when he comes, we're both gonna see him."
"So, where do you think you're gonna go -- after this is all over?"
I don't know.
I have no idea.
How about you?
Come on.
Get to work.
You'd think they'd feed you more if they expect you to do all this work.
That's what Eric said.
He always gave me half his rations.
Refused to eat them himself.
If he'd eaten more...
He's gone.
My team must have taken care of it.
We're gonna need a new plan.
- There's always Death Valley.
- No.
What's Death Valley?
That's Death Valley.
- See that door on the other side?
- Yeah.
It takes you to the front gate.
- If that's the only way...
- We're completely exposed.
"Also the barbed wire, searchlights, guard tower."
Goons can see everything from up there.
We'd be fish in a barrel.
It's out of the question.
You need to call your people off.
We're better off with the tunnel.
Your tunnel will take months to finish.
You could be relocated before it's ready.
"But if it works, we can get everybody out."
"Two hundred of you, running around the forest?"
"No papers, no clothes, no place to hide?"
You'll be hunted like dogs.
"Yeah, it's risky."
I expect they're dead now.
TARRANT:
It's a photocell lock.
Here's a key.
"Tarrant, wait."
Here's another one.
- What do you make of it?
- It's a Tangran code.
- That's what I thought.
- I wonder...
You just saved our lives.
- That other one must have been booby-trapped.
"- Yeah, that was a trick, tiny diffusers."
- Nerve gas?
- I expect so.
Let's just pray there isn't a backup system.
Ladies first.
You're so gallant.
In my hand I have an electrical contact.
"If it closes, it will detonate 700 kilos of glycerol trinitrate."
Put your guns away.
Put them away!
Nitroglycerine?
"It's a bit outdated, isn't it?"
It was all I could make with my limited resources.
And it is still a highly effective explosive.
"- You're not from the Federation, I gather."
- No.
Your surreptitious entry told me as much.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
"Come now, I may be friendlier than you think."
Larry King.
Yeah.
Or any of those shows.
That's right.
And you can usually find us at Big Willy's Dirty Dogs.
Most times.
"My name is Will, and this is Dale."
And we've been through a lot ofheavy stuff in that truck before.
"- Monster madness, dude."
- Major monster madness.
"- Gentlemen, please."
- What?
But-But...
- We're not fooling around!
We're not fooling around!
- Get in the back.
Sometimes you got to take the bull by the horns!
We're American citizens!
And there you have it.
Who says the great American hero is a thing of the past?
"- Back to you, Rocky..."
"- I hope you can see this, Bill and Wendy."
It's like a circus down there.
"You know, Byron, it's easy for us reporting this story... to forget there's a very scared little girl inside that car."
"We can only imagine, as this chase continues... the horror young Natalie Voss is experiencing right now."
"Oh, shit."
- Just-Just hold still.
- It stings.
- Mm!
- I don't want it to get infected.
- I'm so sorry about this.
- As you should be.
"Excuse me, you're not supposed to touch that!"
- I beg your pardon?
"- No, I'm just kidding."
"You are Jocelyn, right?"
Alex?
We met at the Couture Birthday Fashion shoot.
"- Oh, yeah!"
How are you?
"- I can't believe these people, man!"
They are nuts!
"What's up with the tooled on that broad, you know?"
"We're doing fashion here, not high art."
I guess she just takes pride in her work.
I need you to fill the water bottles to spray on Resin.
- What?
"- Pierre insists... on the misty look, I need you to put this Evian into the bottles... and practice spraying, now."
"- Yeah, I'll help you."
- That's what he said.
- He said to paint the cow...
- You!
You are the sprinkler?
Fantastique!
A vision!
Gentle worrying eels just outside Dublin...
"Meteorology: 66 degrees, a crispy October haze on a gray day... the charcoal clouds, they come, yet, back home..."
I'm ready now!
"Okay, okay!"
Let's get this party started now!
I'm not painting that cow!
I don't care!
I told you on the phone I wanted an all-black cow... and you and your make-up people are gonna paint the goddamn cow... all black.
You have to do what I told you...
- Yeah.
I wanted to see what it looked like on.
"It must be so cool being you, all kick-ass and everything."
I bet you always get what you want.
You'd be surprised.
"- So you're feeling better, then?"
"- Oh, much."
I just feel so safe here.
Feels so right.
"Jenny I know what it's like to be led on and I would hate to do that to you, so ..."
"I'm saying this not to be cruel, but to be clear."
"You staying here, it's just temporary."
Yeah.
Of course.
I'll be out of your hair as soon as it's safe.
Just say the word.
- Dyson.
- I have Olivia.
We're at the clinic.
"- So we can relax, then?"
- Or you can get your ass down here.
The Ash wants you to explain this.
"- Well, what if I say my calendar's full?"
- Don't.
- What's up?
- I've been summoned.
You are not leaving me with Weepy McWeepster.
"Oh, yeah, about that."
I need for you to do something for me.
"I'm not giving her a sponge bath, I swear to God."
"I put too much oomph in my zing, and she's crushing on me big time."
I need for you to talk her out of it gently.
But first she thought Jennif er was playing a practical joke.
Who's Jennif er?
Who car es?
I was standin' up ther e.
So Natalie blew the call.
"Oh, Natalie blew the call in a big ol' way, yes, but that's not my r eal problem."
I want you to take note right now --
I am not asking you what your r eal problem is.
My r eal problem is that I seem to have made no impr ession on her at all in the elevator.
"And then I was talking to her just now... being cute as a button, thinking that she'd say, ""Hey, listen, I don't --"""
"""Well, as long as you came all the way up her e, how about a date f or lunch?"""
-
- Something along those lines.
-
- Yeah.
"Yeah, but the r eason you went up ther e was to tell her you couldn't go out with her in the first place."
Right now that seems beside the point.
Does that look like he ran the caution?
No.
They'r e moving on the outside.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I'm gonna go talk to her again.
Okay.
I'm gonna stay her e and do our job.
Is ther e a message you want me to deliver to Luther?
No message I want you to deliver.
"Isaac, I'm on your team."
"You know, I know you don't think of me that way, but I am a good go-between."
"I don't need a go-between, J.J."
Luther isn't hiding out in the mountains with the r ebel army.
Isaac...
And my personal favorite is blaming the wife.
Pointing out all your little faults.
Leaving you to feel like you're the one with the problem.
"Do you just back into things and not look where you""re going?"
Look at that.
"That""s a serious..."
"You know how much that""s gonna cost?"
"- Maybe you""d be better off in a Chevy."
"- David, I work hard for my car."
A Mercedes was the first thing that let me know that I accomplished something.
I love my Mercedes.
"You should hire Bobbi, too."
Get some great stuff on Mike.
"You""ll need it when your custody fight gets ugly."
"I don""t want to fight with him anymore."
I want to be boring for a while.
"- I want to live a modest, uneventful life."
- What?
I met somebody.
Does this woman look familiar to you?
No.
And then he took me to a show.
Can you believe it?
And this has been going on for months?
Yeah.
"I couldn""t tell you because..."
"- he""s married."
"- He""s married?"
"But he hasn""t been in love with his wife for a long time."
"I mean, he""s only staying with her because of the kids."
They have kids?
"Well, three, but one of them is from his first wife."
Evil is the nature of mankind.
- Isabel!
- Evil must be thy only happiness.
- Isa...
"- Welcome, children, to the communion of your race!"
No!
Isabel!
"- I, young Goodman Brown..."
"- Isabel, help!"
Help!
-...stand before you with the devil as my witness.
And promise to strike down any who seek to impede my destiny.
"- Isabel, it's me."
"Isabel, please!"
No!
Ah!
"- Oh, Faith."
What would I do without you?
"- Allison, will you please leave us?"
"Faith, will you please leave us?"
Who are you?
- A simple good man named Brown.
"- And at the coven, you spoke the lines of the devil."
- Lines?
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
I admit that night in the woods is a bit of a blur.
There was so much darkness.
I'm just glad I was able to save my Faith.
- Very well.
It's a testament to your will that you were able to inhabit your role so fully.
But now I need you to forget him.
You are no longer Goodman Brown.
"Sorry, I am late."
Ghost!
Ghost!
Hey!
What's going on?
It's a mess.
I can't manage to explain.
Help...
Wu Man.
"How is it, hubby?"
"I sent you to UK to study law, why do you come back suddenly?"
I wish to give you a surprise.
It's really a surprise.
Let's eat.
"By the way, why were you flushed out of the room by water?"
And I see traps all over the house.
Do you have time to tell something about it?
"I have time, but it's not convenient to talk right now."
"Madam, don't mistake it."
Master knows that
I have an indecent and brutal desire.
"So he arranged all the traps, to let me have chance to kiss Miss Shiu."
Don't misunderstand him.
"But, master..."
"About the pig's tongue, isn't it convenient to give me an explanation?"
"Sure, but I don't have time."
"That's good, even you have time to talk, we don't have time to listen."
"Foon, you kissed the pig's tongue, didn't you?"
I did.
"Right, I bought that specially for you."
"Master, you promised to let me kiss Miss Shiu."
"In fact, it's me who wanted to kiss her."
"And this, a photo he had on him."
It's from 1940.
1940.
Everything's leading us to the same year.
Alright.
"Have Amelia and her team visit him in the hospital, immediately."
"Time travel with a shrimp allergy, now that is risky."
I don't know what you're talking about.
About this.
"We're pressed for time, so you can confess everything now."
"Relax, Alonso."
Tell us how you arrived here from 1940.
"I'm sick, not crazy."
Time travel can't be done.
"Yes, yes it can."
"We do it, as a matter of fact."
So I'm sure that you aren't crazy.
"But if you don't work with us, we can lock you up in an asylum for life."
Are you sure this will work?
I've synchronized the frequency with my phone.
We'll hear everything that Himmler says from his room.
I don't hear anything.
They haven't gotten back from the bull fight.
Here they are.
(HIMMLER) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
What did he say?
"-""What a disgusting spectacle""."
"""Gallito is a fucking murderer""."
Whereas they have Auschwitz... now that's a show for the whole family.
Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I really do.
"Well, thanks."
How about our going into partnership?
Or do we have to ask John's permission?
He's a charter member.
Do you have any influence with him?
I never interfere in his business.
But you just got a share of it now.
You just became a partner.
"Are you as conservative as your husband, Mrs. Brown?"
No wonder my husband thinks your ideas are too advanced.
I just meant we could make a lot of money.
"Oh, now you're angry again!"
Are you sorry John made you take me to lunch?
I wasn't drafted.
I volunteered.
I shouldn't tease you.
Your sketches are wonderful.
And most women would like to make a lot of money.
Sure.
Some of them marry for it.
That's a low blow.
I'm very fond of John.
I'm sure you are.
"Good evening, Mr. Skinner."
"Hello, Ellen."
"I'm a little early, so if Mr. Brown hasn't finished his dinner..."
He's not here.
He left for Philadelphia late this afternoon.
Well...
"Well, that's odd."
I'm supposed to meet him here to go over some statements.
You did good.
Listen.
You did a great job.
Here you go.
Careful.
It's full.
Okay.
"Paul, I'm-- I'm sorry I'm late."
It's okay.
"I, uh, gave the speeches."
"We're just, uh, waiting on you."
I got MVP.
Is my trophy in there?
I'm sure it is...
somewhere.
"Uh, hopefully, there are trophies for all the players that contributed."
"Okay, Hornets, bring it in, guys."
Come on over.
"Finally, now that the hardware is here, we're gonna give out some awards, okay?"
"And, uh, I'm gonna make you guys suffer through some more boring speeches, and I apologize for that, so bear with me, okay?"
He is so good with kids.
I think coaching's been a real solace for Paul during this time of upheaval.
I think it has.
"We should probably organize something with Joy's other girlfriends, make sure he stays fed, don't you think?"
"Or, you know, I could just... feed him."
It's been two months.
He's hardly wasting away.
"Libby, I'm looking for an excuse."
"You're gonna think I'm terrible, but how long, exactly, does a widower have to wait before he can start, you know... eating?"
I don't know.
A year?
Says who?
- Ha ha ha!
"What, did he hop the gate?"
You came!
- I said I'd come.
"- I know, but you came!"
How could I miss it?
"Manny, the first member of my family"
- to ever graduate from high school.
- Wait a minute.
Don't you have a brother in Colombia
- who's a doctor?
- Yes.
"He just does orthopedic surgery, no brain or heart."
"Think of it... tomorrow,"
"I will watch you stride across the stage with a sash, like a rebel's bandolier telling the world ""No absents, no tardies."""
"Manny and I were gonna grill some steaks and drink some, um, beers."
"Thank you, Jay, but if it's all right with you,"
I would like to take Manny out for a special father-son celebration.
- Is that okay?
"- Ah, sure."
"I mean, he... made the effort to come."
Didn't have time to button his shirt all the way up.
But... go ahead.
Perfect!
The night begins.
But first... here.
(spritzing)
Walk through this.
(chuckles)
"I know that smells terrible, but I've never seen that man get a mosquito bite."
(singsong voice) There he is... the graduate.
"I have one word for you, Luke... plastics."
"""Busty's"" pretty bad,too."
"It's clearly not working for you,Bella."
Why don't you just end it already?
I can't.
I can't hurt his pride again.
"I mean,like,I'll have to wait till he breaks up with me."
I wonder how he feels about the Gandhi.
Real men do not fear the Gandhi.
I'm sorry.
What was that?
I said that as loudly as I possibly could.
"Look,you really want him to break up with you?"
-Yes.
- Just be needy.
Be clingy.
Ask him how he's feeling every five seconds.
"Ask him about sex with his ex-girlfriends, and then get really upset over anything he tells you."
"Basically,just do exactly what you did wrong with the last guy you dated that you really liked."
I can totally do that.
Always be on my side.
Just stay.
I have a rehearsal.
Let's just be naked for five more minutes.
I'm sorry.
"I'm already 30 minutes late,all right?"
"I gotta go,okay?"
I'm sorry.
Please.
We could take a bath.
Just soak in the tub till we get raising fingers.
"That sounds really great, but the guys are waiting for me,all right?"
Fine!
Chad we barely go out in daylight as it is.
Come on!
I'm starting to feel like a vampire.
"- Besides, we didn't do anything wrong."
- I know.
"But Kev, I'm in this guy's sights."
"There are better options than laying low, believe me."
We can call Dan Silk.
Threaten him.
"No offense, but I don't think you could take him."
Pummeling this guy wouldn't do much for my public image.
I mean we could threaten him with legal action.
- It's true.
"- I'm a lawyer, truth is irrelevant."
I do this all the time.
"I need to make it clear, if he doesn't print a retraction, he'll face a very lengthy lawsuit."
I'll bury him in discovery and depositions.
It's Lawyering 101.
I've never seen you so...
litigious.
- Right.
- It's kind of hot.
- But no way can you call him.
- Why not?
He's not a major corporation.
He's one guy.
He's one loser.
He'll cave.
They all do.
Believe me.
No.
We just need to let it blow over.
[Chuckles]
He... made me... see the stars.
How did he do that?
Those kids.
Why do they hate me so much?
[Distant Siren Wailing]
[Men's Chorus] He has loosed the fateful lightning
Ofhis terrible swiftsword
His truth is marching on
I have seen him in the watch fires ofa hundred circling camps
They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps
I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
- His day is marching on - [Gunfire]
I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows ofsteel
As ye deal with my contemner so with you my grace shall deal
Let the hero born ofwoman [Girl] It's the president.
- Crush the serpentwith his heel - [People Murmuring]
Hi.
I'm Dick Nixon.
Hi there.
- Hi.
Where you from?
- Syracuse.
"Oh, yeah, the, uh, orangemen."
"Now, there's a football program, uh..."
"Jim Brown and that, uh, other, uh, tailback... the one with the blood disease."
- Ernie Davis.
"- Yeah, right, right, right."
[Boy Laughing]
I used to play a little ball myself atWhittier.
"Of course, they used to use me as a, a tackling dummy."
We didn'tcome here to talk aboutfootball.
"Before that, I was living here in Trnje for 30 years."
I know every house and street.
I kept knocking at the doors around to ask.
I'm sentimentally attached to this area.
So I decided to try my luck in Paromlinska street.
"So, this is how you came to me?"
People decide to rent their room after they've been suggested to do so.
I thought you were the one.
I don't know.
You have confused me.
Maybe I should tell you something about myself?
I'm retired for disability.
I was a land surveyor.
I could pay as much as you want.
I can make money in another way.
"Leave it, that's not..."
"I'm peaceful, too."
I don't play cards or bring women home.
I don't even drink or smoke.
"I'm mostly out, I even eat there."
"- That's ok, but I don't know..."
It is so suddenly.
"Understand me, I can't just do it right away."
You don't have to decide immediately.
I'll come in a day or two.
You think about it.
Ok?
- I don't know...
"Well, day or two, that would be fine."
Good.
"So, there is a chance, eh?"
"See you in a couple of days, then."
"All right, give me that."
"What's the matter, Bal?"
You've been woolgathering ever since we crawled out of the river.
"- You know, my time is up on May 14."
- What of that?
"You can sign on for another nine years, can't you?"
Make a man out of him.
I'm leaving the service.
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.
"I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business."
- Married!
- Tea business!
"Why, you're mad if..."
"March to attention, everybody!"
"Let's march in in good style, men."
- Fall in up there.
"- Left, right, left."
Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately.
"Yes, sir."
"Party, right wheel!"
Halt!
Left face!
Sergeants to the front!
"The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir."
"Eight killed, three wounded."
Otherwise all correct.
"Very well, Sergeant."
Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately.
"Very good, sir."
"Party, dismissed!"
"- Identical, Mitchell."
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(TASER ZAPPING) (SOLDIER GRUNTING)
(BODY FALLS DOWN)
(MACHINE BEEPING)
It's not my usual fantasy.
"Usually, you're wearing latex and a strap-on."
"Well, I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humor, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or you're still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
(GRUNTING) He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
"And, you knew that."
You fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott."
Yeah.
"But, unfortunately, I can only rescue you at the moment."
(GRUNTING) Lucky me... (WHISPERS) Bitch.
(GRUNTING)
(WATER DRIPPING)
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
But we're still gonna have to keep moving.
(GRUNTING)
You can still have that morphine shot if you want it.
That's all right.
"It's okay, I won't think you're any less macho."
Someone else might need it more later.
Hmm.
"You know, I think"
Henry and I should have the same last name.
"Yeah, I'm cool with that."
Henry Chase.
No.
Henry Krawchuck.
What do you mean?
"Well, what I mean is, I know I took a couple months to get back to you on your marriage proposal."
"The offer's still valid, right?"
Four more minutes.
"Well, the answer is yes."
So we're engaged.
Yeah.
"Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you, but how long do you want to wait before we have kids?"
Stay back!
What's going on?
What just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
"Oh, my God!"
Total 911!
Goblins have stormed our kitchen and they are eating all our sugar pops.
Tell them the milk has gone bad.
Was someone kept up late by a doggy-style celebration of love?
A little...all night long?
"I want all the hairy details, okay?"
"Okay, no."
"No details, hairy or otherwise."
I feel like crap.
Didn't you see Dyson last night?
- Yes.
"- Okay, well did you tell him you wanted him to be your boyfriend?"
Who's going to bed?
"Uh, you are, tough guy."
- Come on.
- Ow!
Ow!
Child abuse!
Child abuse!
"Oh, you think that's child abuse?"
You haven't even...
How about that?
What about that?
What about one of these?
"Stand still, you little booger."
Ugh!
"I'm telling you, just give me the big knife and this will all be over."
"Harriet, dear, you have taken a tomato sandwich to school with you..."
With mayonnaise.
...with mayonnaise every day for that past five years.
Don't you want a little variety?
Nope.
Not even cream cheese with olive?
Yum-yum-yum!
Or how about pastrami?
Roast beef?
"How about the fancy cucumber kind, with the crust cut off?"
"Mom, I can't help it if I know what I like."
And I know that I like tomato.
After school spy route...
Hong Fat's Food Emporium
"Holy cats, a veggie thief."
This must be investigated thoroughly.
"Frankie, you took the truck last week."
Nothin.
I said I can't find anything wrong with her.
Mr. Smallwood.
I just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night.
Are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights?
"Listen, mister."
Connie called me.
"She told me that you check out, and that's good enough for me."
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
"And as far as I know, I'm not crazy."
So if you're accusing me...
"Look, here's the thing."
I don't know how I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know I was in West Virginia.
"Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30..."
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad.
I really wanted to know what I look like.
"Sergeant, I'm curious."
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
"People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me."
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
I'll get seven.
- The next man.
- That's it.
- Any word?
- They say he'll be here any minute.
"You know, I told Margaret this would happen."
"I always say, marry in haste, repent at leisure."
The young man is now one hour and 25 minutes late.
That isn't exactly marrying in haste.
"As long as I am living, and longer..."
I have never seen cuffs on pants like these.
"What's the matter, can't you make them?"
I can make anything... but I would rather not be wrong than right.
I'm paying for cuffs and I want cuffs.
"No. 10 times... 20 times, no."
Can't you understand?
"Look, here, let me show you."
Do you see any cuffs there?
Not one cuff.
Thousands of no cuffs.
"Here, look these over."
You see?
No cuffs.
Millions of no cuffs.
No cuffs.
"More than that, positively not one cuff."
Why not?
- I want to speak to Mr. Garnett.
- Speaking.
"- Here he is, sir."
- Let me talk to him.
"Say, listen, you, the guests are all going home and..."
Thought you might know the right man.
He calls himself Fred.
Which one?
He calls himself Fred.
Which one?

"If I don't find my patient, I'll not spare anyone of you."
"He's a doctor, why is he behaving like this?"
- He's not a doctor.
- Then?
He's the memory loss patient we were just discussing about.
When he was brought here...
"Tell me, who am I?"
"If you don't, I'll jump down..."
Who am I?
Where am I?
I know...
We were scared he may kill himself.
Now...?
Please...take one injection...
let me give you one shot...
We are now scared he may kill one of us.
- Why?
"That's what confusing us, why did he suddenly change like this?"
Somebody has influenced powerfully and changed him.
He has a patient also in our hospital.
Where did you go?
That is...there...
Bloody!
Do you know how tensed I was without seeing you for 2 days?
With the problem you have...
what's that?
- Memory loss.
Where did you go?
Forgot the hospital address and took time to come here.
"What happened, doctor?"
Let's go.
"Pull over to the edge of town, man."
We're splitting up.
What are you talking about?
"Look, just pull over, man."
Everything's fucked up.
"I'll give you your half of the coke, you give me my half of the money, and then I'm gone."
"That's bullshit, man, I ain't doing that."
"Ray, don't fuck with me, just give me my money."
"I said I can't do that, man."
I don't have any money.
Say what?
I said I don't have any money.
"Where's my fucking money, Ray?"
"I said I ain't got any money, man!"
"She took the fucking money, all right?"
I've got 56 fucking dollars.
Now let go of me before I have a wreck.
"You're a pussy-whipped motherfucker, man."
"Now don't throw that shit on me, man."
That's your fucking buddies back there didn't have any goddamn money.
"That good friend of yours, Billy, man."
What the fuck am I doing with you?
"You're a pussy-whipped, sorry-ass motherfucker!"
Goddamn.
"Hey, look, if you want any money, you're going to have to go to Arkansas."
RONNIE:
"Come on, Lila, we got to go."
LILA:
I know.
"Just give me a few minutes with him, okay?"
"Come on, Lila, it's almost 4:00 in the morning."
They're weirdly popular.
I can order you one.
"Yeah, yeah, why don't you do that?"
"That'd be great, because then they'll get here, in what?"
9 weeks?
"Which is just in time for my daughter's recital, which is tomorrow."
It's the minimum basic requirement that a party store always have Hawaii.
"Children have recitals and their parents, their mothers, can't do it all and we rely on our party store to keep up their end of the bargain so that our husbands and our children don't despise us when we come home empty-handed."
I'll buy the lei.
He's really wrecked.
Usually we like to let this kind dry out for the night in lock-up.
"It reinforces the point, you know?"
"Sure, sure,"
We have driven all the way from Los Angeles.
There's a motel nearby.
See you in the a.m.
Bring coffee.
"All right, thank you."
Thanks.
Hi.
"I'm Justin's mother and this is his big sister, Kitty."
"Kitty Walker, ""The Right Idea"" and ""Red, White and Blue."""
- You're kidding.
- No.
You're her?
"Yeah, I am...me."
Yes.
I love your show.
And we're not asking to be the exception here...
"Yes, we are."
"No, we're not."
- Yes.
trust me.
I mean you're afraid of a real relationship Dale.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I am not scared of relationships
But you're scared of something.
Let's just forget about it.
Ok...
Sorry.
No it's Ok I just wasn't expecting that.
Was it weird seeing Dale?
"Yeah, yeah it was weird."
I felt like I sensed something between you guys.
"Yeah, yeah I think maybe you did."
Dale and I are really tight.
You know and as I told you before Hallie
I'm just not that interested in a relationship right now and I wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong impression about what's going on here.
She's the one that told me to pursue you just so you know.
She told you that?
Yeah you sound surprised.
She said you guys were just friends that you've never hooked up and that she isn't your type.
Not my type.
So are we cool?
"Yeah, yeah we're cool but I just..."
I don't think this is a very good idea right now OK?
This isn't a good idea?
OK I'm just...
Not that into this right now.
You're not into this?
No.
Are you into this?
Hey!
"Hey, Hayden."
"Well, then, do it."
Only this time it's for life.
I'll make sure of it.
"You were never gonna set me free, were you?"
"Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've only cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks from upstairs.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela that's her name she's gonna be down here dancing a cumbia on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
Sorry.
Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows..."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where there's shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
Is that why you're here?
Yeah.
I left him.
Poor guy.
He messed up.
Stupid guy.
"Well, I like to think of myself as the easygoing type but..."
"Well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
Don't you even care?
I'm not happy at the conservatory.
Of course I care!
"But I also care about scholarships, opportunities."
I care about your future.
"If you really cared about my future, you would not have sold my piano in the first place!"
"Mom, I'm sorry."
I didn't-
"Get in the car, now."
I have to go.
I understand.
I hope you're satisfied.
It took all my will power not to trip her.
Thank you for letting me know Amanda was here.
Glad I could help.
Welcome home.
"I'd ask you what you were thinking, but I don't think you were thinking at all."
"Actually, this took a great deal of planning."
Not helping.
The Blooms' situation was private.
We made it very clear you were not to see Amanda.
You were not to get involved.
"I know I broke a rule, but I'm not sorry I did."
"I had to do it, for Amanda."
"Good intentions aside, you're still grounded."
All of you.
Two weeks.
What?
"School, work, home."
Everything else is off-limits.
And I'll take your cell phones.
This was my idea.
What was that for?
I bet that this would suck.
[Laughs]
"What a fucking, fucking, fucked up thing, man."
It was a fucked-up burn.
These guys are doing a high fall for us later.
It's the same shit every time.
Never hire Lloyd's friends.
Never.
INTERVIEWER:
What's your biggest fear of today?
Not getting the shots and not going on schedule
Are my biggest fear every day.
"We had a-- we had to have a Toxie stand in,"
Because our Toxie was late.
He's usually incredibly punctual.
He's been consistent every single day.
I think he's one of the first people on set almost every day.
"And yet today, he overslept."
Fucking dammit.
I said 6 o'clock.
It's three hours and they can't get the guy into costume.
INTERVIEWER:
That did not make Lloyd very happy.
"No, it didn't make anybody very happy."
[Inaudible] at the office.
Yeah.
"I can't hold their fucking hands, Lloyd."
You can kick them in the ass.
You can certainly ring their bloody necks.
"And you know, mules-- if you kick a mule hard enough,"
You get it to pull the plow.
Our missing journalist's name is Amanda Kane.
I'm guessing Amanda Kane is a blast from your past?
She's the reporter who broke the north beach bribery scandal wide open.
She destroyed your career.
No.
I destroyed my career.
You sounded almost convincing.
If you want to bow out...
No.
Charlie's the boss.
"This could be more than just a case for you, Kate."
Signing on is your call.
I'll respect your decision.
There'll be no judgment.
Well...
You know me...
Not really one to sit on the sidelines.
Count me in.
"Pack your bags, angels."
The next sunrise cruise tour sets sail first thing tomorrow morning.
"Once upon a time, there were three young women who got into very big trouble, and now they work for me."
My name is Charlie.
Enjoy your stay.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
"Welcome aboard the Caribbean dreamer, Mr..."
Bosley.
I'll be in communication from my cabin.
Stay in touch.
Will do.
"- Abbs, are you in yet?"
- Approaching eagle eye now.
O
What is going on?
What is going on?
Why are they all being so mean?
Being mean here and in the club is no fucking difference than all those fuckers out on the street.
Or anybody else in the goddamn world.
The only difference is out there they all pretend to be nice.
And in here we ain't pretending shit.
What do you mean nobody's pretending?
We're all dressed up like for a masquerade going on stage playing hoodlums.
famous bags.
The biggest eye bags around chicken with the eye bag.
It's just like a three penny
You're too old to model.
Don't make me hate you!
You're so ugly.
And you are so beautiful.
You're the most beautiful boy in the world.
You're the most beautiful boy.
What?
I don't care what you say.
I don't love you.
Margaret what's wrong with you?
Let me see your eyes.
God what eyes.
Chicken woman.
"C'mon, Jimmy!"
And your lips.
"You're so old and ugly, I can't look at you."
"Come on, she's beautiful."
"No, I know I'm ugly you should punish me I'm not good enough for you."
I'm just an old and ugly whore.
- So the Starling sisters lied?
What difference does it really make?
"For God's sake, of course it makes a difference."
It's not the truth.
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man who terrified them and set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
- They never got there.
- Because their engine failed.
"Now, there's a truth we won't be telling."
"Morale-sapping, apparently."
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
We're saying this is based on a true story.
Then don't.
"Oh, Christ above, man, you're supposed to be the propagandist!"
700 ships went to Dunkirk.
"338,000 men came back."
Don't say it's based on a true story.
Say it's based on 100 true stories.
- A thousand.
"- 338,000."
"Dunkirk, the biggest retreat in military history, or the miracle that put the fire back in all our bellies?"
"Very well, carry on as you were."
I have a car waiting.
You won't regret it.
"Thank you, Mr. Swain."
Buckley!
Buckley!
Sit.
Sit.
I don't care that you lied.
I care that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
"Eddie, this is... this is really dangerous."
"He's fucking killing me, man."
Look...
"I know you're scared, but I'm going to have the cash tomorrow, all right?"
I'm going over to this crooked lawyer.
He's got the hundred thousand.
"Look, I'm not calling for a pep talk, all right?"
I am literally over it.
"I just want to let you know I'm not letting them cut any more pieces off me, man."
What's that mean?
It means next time I'm fighting back.
I'm pretty sure I can get a knife from under the bar.
"Eddie, don't be stupid."
They'll kill you.
You understand me?
Yeah.
"Well, they're gonna have to."
"Listen, you better stick to the fucking plan."
"Otherwise, we're all dead."
I'm sticking to the plan.
I'm sticking to the fucking plan.
I just want to let you know that if for any reason you don't beat the clock...
I'm...
I'm gonna beat the clock.
I'm telling you.
That's what I'm saying.
What if you don't?
Just go.
"Just go, man."
"They're going to kill me one day anyway, Marius."
Fuck it.
It might as well be tomorrow.
You want me to give you the death ray?
"Now, Marty."
"Well, then give me a quarter for a flying saucer or I'll let him have it."
"All right, dear."
Here.
MAN ON PA:
"Last call for the Santa Fe,"
"San Bernardino local, train number 54."
"Leaves at 5:30 p.m., entering through gate J."
This is the last call.
I'll take this one.
"25 cents, please."
"Here you are, I'll pay for that."
Thank you.
"Oh, don't be frightened."
(SHUDDERING) Here.
"No, no, no, that's for you."
I like little boys who have space guns.
You know why?
'Cause I have a space collection.
You have?
"Oh, sure, they're right here in this bag."
"And do you know that when I went to the moon,"
I got my first space gun.
"And since then, I've added almost 350 space guns to my collection."
"I have one space gun that shoots out little men, and those little men have space guns that shoot darts."
"And when I was in Tibet,"
"I got a space gun with camels sitting on the top of it, just about so big."
"I know it's pretty difficult to believe that, but you must believe me."
The train leaves in 15 minutes.
What if we miss him?
Not a chance.
A bit.
Don't catch a cold.
"When you get home, have a glass of hot milk, with some honey."
I will.
I like rainy days since I've been here.
Have you seen the new lawyer?
Yes.
He was here.
He told me everything.
"I'm screwed, right?"
"To be honest, yes."
At least Alicia wasn't affected by the birth.
It's the only thing that consoles me and gives me hope.
Are you all right?
I'd like to be able to hug you.
But I'd have to ask for a visavis.
"I checked it out, y'know?"
They asked if you were my boyfriend.
"I didn't dare to say yes, in case it bothered you."
It doesn't bother me at all.
You can say what you want.
I've hugged very few people in my life.
A message...
"Marco, I wanted to tell you how glad I was to see you today and be able to say goodbye."
You know they won't let me out of here.
Or it'll only be to lock me up somewhere else.
"I don't want to live in a world without Alicia, a place where I can't even have her hairclip with me."
So I've decided to escape.
"ldidn't tell you, so you wouldn't worry or try to stop me."
"A big hug, Marco."
Taxi!
To Segovia.
"Molly, you up yet?"
Aw!
Out!
"Oh, look who's coming to the kitchen in his jammie pants."
Morning.
"Cop a squat, I'll get you a cup of coffee."
Thank you.
"Listen, uh, Mrs. Flynn,"
I really appreciate you letting me move in here.
"Oh, please, call me Joyce, and it really wasn't my decision."
Cream and sugar?
"Black, please."
You'll love it with cream and sugar.
That's the way Molly's dad drank it.
"I don't really process dairy well, but okay."
"And listen, if there's anything you ever need done, just let me know."
I want to earn my keep.
"We're talking chores, right, not some sort of plus- sized gigolo action?"
No.
"I'm pulling your leg, hoss."
Oh.
"If you're serious about helping out, a couple of those kitchen cabinets could use new hinges."
I'll take care of that today.
We could also use a new screen for the back door.
Victoria walks through at least one a year.
Consider it done.
And a new exhaust hose for the dryer.
Easy to do.
"Oh, and the pulsating shower wand upstairs has seen better days."
Three women in the house...
don't ask.
Wasn't planning on it.
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
Boys!
Are special in theyr own way!
Girls!
Are special like the birthday
And always we dancing and singing alone here he comes [sings] [sings] [sings]
Who the hell is that?
That's Braden Gueermo.
We
Sings and dances better than anybody.
He's already seen HM3 over a hundred times.
Everyone is special in their own--
Special in their own way
"Let it out, party people"
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Yeah.
"I guess, we better check that movie out."
[singing]
This-- is cool?
[singing]
This is cool?
"We are really getting old, you guys."
[singing]
It says that DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and they did 80 millions in opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out guys."
"If this is much cool today, I'm done."
I no longer have any connections with this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing this."
"Yeah, one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh."
But right now we just cry.
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
[Mouthing] Thank you.
So Hannah you said you had some big news for us.
Half of our staff thinks you're running for governor.
The other half thinks you're going back on Flitter.
And Lenny hoping you're back for him.
"No, no, and Lenny, get a life."
"I mean, what is that?"
I don't want to be pushy.
But I've never had the same person on twice in one week.
"Actually, Jay, that's still kind of true."
I'm not the same person.
No.
No of course you're not.
[Whistles]
I think it would be easier this way.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
"Hey Lenny, I'm starting to think you dodged a bullet with this chick."
[All murmuring]
What she put in a diary you take above my word?
"Everything that happened that day, Roberts."
Now!
-l told you.
-The super says you were there twice.
The super says.
The snitch says in her book.
"What about what Roberts says, huh?"
All right.
"I was there before she died, okay?"
Okay?
And I brought her something.
I was desperate to break it off with this girl.
"What happened, Roberts?"
Now!
I bought her a bag of quinine.
"I brought her a beat bag, looks and tastes like dope."
She's not going to know it's not dope until after I leave.
I needed to talk to her. I needed to tell her how things were gonna be.
She wasn't gonna listen to me unless I did... .
Unless I gave her something.
"So I gave her the stuff, told her we were done..."
"... shefreaksout,thisandthat."
I'm gonna do myself in.
"Believe me, for her that was like going to the crapper."
That's how many times she threatened that.
And that's it.
"I broke it off with her, and I left."
"Why did you go back, Mike?"
Because I was worried about her.
Because exactly what I was afraid of actually happened.
I get there...
"European third type, that."
I have a job for you.
Mickey goes wrong.
She lost the joy of living.
We transmit life if he continues with that woman.
"Take it away, do it for me."
"If it is not cheerful, Mickey's not a dick."
"I do not want to see him, I do not want them both!"
"I do not want, no, no!"
"Purposes before, and now blames me?"
"- The love for piety, Mickey ..."
- I pity you did not?
- The love for pain.
- I love her and that was it.
- You will comply.
- Respect for the cemeteries!
You will not ever.
To have you in their hands has taken this empty apartment here in front.
"Okay, your part to exterminate the Venini you have done, but we still have three to go to the bottom."
You feel?
Now it is you who will flee.
Mickey is not the brute that you think.
I do not think anything.
You ... it is difficult to get wrong.
"In order to kill, should be a woman."
Wrap the blade in silk.
- Won't feel anything.
- No.
You.
Get in there.
No. ..
"We are like children, Prince."
You got money for the bus.
Bus?
I'm taking the car.
Huh?
Cory!
Cory!
Hey!
Hey!
You can't take the car.
You don't know how to drive!
"Eric, what can happen?"
"I lose control of the car and crash into, what, the world's largest Slurpee?"
Lay off my town.
Eric.
You're still here.
Why wouldn't I be?
"We had a great night together, didn't we?"
"Yeah, we did."
"I, um..."
I was thinking maybe you found someone more interesting and I wasn't going to see you again.
"Well, I think you're very interesting."
That makes me happy.
"Uh, do you want to say hi to my friends?"
They're real eager to meet you.
"Oh, and the little hitchhiker boy is more than welcome to join us."
"No, this is where the little hitchhiker boy says goodbye."
"So, Eric, if you're staying, then there's nothing left to say except..."
I'll be the one driving through the corn field.
"Okay, fine, at least let me check to see if you have the right keys."
What a moron.
"Well, you can take the keys, Eric, but you can't take my freedom!"
You don't have to worry about him.
"Well, we couldn't stand by and see you suffer for speaking your mind."
Mrs Cameron's loss is very much our gain.
"You're very welcome here, Claire."
I can't thank you enough.
- You just have.
"Well, here's to ""speaking your mind""."

"You're thinking about Joyce, aren't you?"
I can practically hear the pistons of frustration pounding in your head.
I'm not wasting any more mental energy on that woman.
But I am thinking about how we might resurrect the Institute.
Might not mothballing be for the best for the time being?
Given that everyone's looking inwards now.
Please.
Promise me you'll never see my daughter again.
A promise is only good if you shake on it.
Don't squeeze that hard.
Just promise you'll never see my daughter again.
I promise.
"I promise that every morning, the first thing I want to see is Marcia and the last thing I want to see at night... is Marcia."
I promise that I'll never let anyone get between us.
Let my hand go!
I promise to accept all we suffer together and truly enjoy all we live together.
Let go!
I promise to never think that I'm better than her nor that she is better than me.
"Marcia, tell this man to let my hand go."
I promise to use my own life to give Marcia a good life.
Don't squeeze it!
"And if I must,"
I promise to give my life to save hers.
Get out at once!
"Marcia, where do you think you're going?"
I won't let you date any...
low-class.
Date?
"We're getting married, mom."
I'll never let our daughter marry a worthless man.
"Hey, I'm right here!"
It's me!
"Mom, dad!"
I'm here!
Maria!
Maria!
"Get back, Maria."
We're too far up!
But I'm talking ANL Sydney.

That is not the same girl Chuck came home with last night.
"Has he, uh, come to talk to Lily yet?"
Do you want me to talk to him?
"No, I already tried, but thank you."
I'm gonna come to your lacrosse game after brunch.
Judge away.
Shame turns me on.
"Hey, man, she's going to Lily's for brunch."
Maybe a stack of waffles will help your hangover?
I find the cause is the best cure.
I gotta go.
"So I will see you later at the library,"
And I'm sorry about before
With the Tisch catalog.
It's fine.
"Dan, I don't know how to do this."
We've been tiptoeing around each other for days.
"Look, we're-we're two artists in a relationship,"
"And sometimes we're gonna be competing for the same things,"
"So, all right, we're- we're-we're smart people."
Let's come up with...
"Some rules,"
A list of topics that are off-limits.
Isn't that what got us in trouble with Tisch?
"No, no."
"This will be different,"
Because we'll know...
What we don't know.
"Hey, listen to me."
I'm quoting Donald Rumsfeld.
"Okay, until the sting of Tisch has worn off,"

Here we dreamt our dreams
3 large white rums.
With Pepsi
With Om...?
Shut up.
I got To talk To him... about Nitu.
"Besides, we brothers are meeting up after years"
It's a new drink.
I ordered it.
"Yes, give it a try"
But I don't take cold drinks.
"Yive it a try, for our sakes"
Cheering a cold drink?
What drink is this?
This drink will become popular
Isn't she beautiful?
Very beautiful
"Jagadish, just look."
She's exquisite
"What are you staring at, Jags?"
So beautiful

"I'm not an account, honey."
I'm a woman.
[Ticking]
That's right.
Louis Samuels.
Rockville Center.
"[Kojak] When you get home, the officers could keep you outside for a little while."
"And I may have to call you again, ask some more questions."
"Other than that, I'm terribly sorry for what happened."
And thank you very much for putting up with me.
Evacuate his house and the business if anybody's there.
Right.
Rockville Center.
Right.
"Lieutenant, everything's in the works."
[Sportscaster] ... a line drive headed for right field.
Mike Lum is back to the wall.
He can't get it.
It's off the wall.
"Staub rounding first, headed for second."
"Lum gets it back in, and Rusty Staub has a double."
It's 10 of 11:00.
And the Mets are still playin'.
I thought they were playing this afternoon?
"No, it was a twi-night doubleheader."
What time did the first game end?
"I don't know for sure, but it couldn't have ended before 7:00."
"Lieutenant, I just remembered something."
You asked about advertising earlier?
"About a month ago, Mrs. Holder specifically mentioned that her husband worked for some sort of agency."
- Did you hear me?
- What way was it?
Stuart had always been crazy jealous.
"That night, he was drunk too."
He started hitting me and jabbing a gun into me.
"He was mad enough to kill me, and I was terrified."
"Suddenly, Johnny came into the room."
He'd f ollowed us home f rom the club.
"He took the gun f rom Stuart, or was trying to but it seemed to go off right in my ear."
I passed out and when I came to Johnny was kissing me.
"That was the last time I saw him until he came back, two days ago."
I remember he said goodbye.
I think he was crying.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, sure, I believe you but I still want that letter."
Let's get out of this lobster trap.
We need salt air.
They say salt's antiseptic.
"Rip, what's the matter?"
is something the matter?
- Yesterday you called me Dusty.
Today--
- Johnny used to call you that.
Yes.
What would you like to call me?
- l'll have to think about that.
"- Yes, think of that."
- l want you to.
- We'd better get back to town.
I couldn't stand there looking at her. I had to keep moving.
Her story about Johnny sounded real.
"I'd buy it, on approval, as the dolls say."
That'll be my signal to go for the shotgun.
I'll try not to fire.
You know how adrenaline can be.
"Yeah, well, you won't get a shot off, but thanks for the concern."
You just worry about making it all look good for the camera and making sure you're alone.
I'll be alone.
Katie:
What I told you about Amanda's mother is true.
Her name was Alice.
She was my friend.
What I did not tell you was she was a grifter.
"After she died,"
Amanda moved in with Marius and me.
"A few months later, Marius... found another partner and took off."
"He'd say it was because I lost focus, but..."
I think it was because of the way he grew up.
He didn't like the idea of a kid-around life.
"Anyway, I got off the grift."
I met you.
And I never saw him again.
I swear to God I never saw him again until he showed up here a few days ago.
You could be conning me right now.
"No, no."
No.
Don't touch me.
Don't...
But...
I swear to you that this... is real.
Okay?
You are what... is important to me.
"Listen, Pedro, I love you."
"You know what's real right now, honey?"
What?
You do not have to say anything...
His cab is going to forensic services.
And so are his trainers.
"I swear to god, she got out and that was the last I saw of her."
Just like you never saw Kelly Mahon after she got out of your cab?
That's the truth.
So why did you run?
Straight up?
My cousin gave me a load of iPads last night.
"What, nicked I take it?"
They were in the boot of my cab.
I thought you were after them.
"You been inside, Carl?"
You know I have.
Two years GBH.
"Yeah, that's right.And your DNA was all over the bloke you punched."
The bloke insulted my girl.
I knocked him once.
Then the old Bill bang on my door.
But it was blood on your clothes that got you convicted?
Yeah.
But what's any of this got to do with those girls?
We think you've got a grudge against women who work in forensic services.
"You're joking, right?"
No.
"I mean, two years to sit in jail and stew over whose fault it was that you were sitting in that cell."
I know whose fault it was.
It was mine.
And the drink.
Not Kelly Mahon's?
Not Lucy Kennard's?
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
I do.
Previously on The Americans.
What is it that you do there at the church?
We talk.
They get them when they're children.
They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs.
I really like the people at work.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
"Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it."
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
We can expose U.S. Forces... secretly training contra commanders on American soil.
[Elizabeth] It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic.
- Which truck do you drive?
- Number nine.
- Where are the keys?
- Inside the truck.
We can tie him up and gag him.
- What if he gets loose?
- He won't.
What if a hiker comes by... and they call the police when we're in the camp?
No one hikes around here.
- Philip.
- Come on.
"Come on, buddy."
[Engine Off]
Your husband?
Why?
He did not know about the work or the boys.
Boys?
There were others.
"For the last time, where is the money?"
"There is 2,000 in the almirah, take it and leave!"
Next time you come my husband will be waiting for you!
I haven't come for a handout!
I want money that is rightfully mine!
So go and ask the one who has taken it.
Ask whom?
Your husband?
He earns more in a day than you have managed in all these months!
Go and ask your friend!
The scoundrel even looked like a thief.
Don't lie.
Why do you lie?
Did you learn anything from me in all these months?
Apart from sex!
"Our work can start again, leave now..."
Think of your sisters.
I am never sinking back into your filth again!
I want my money and I want it now!
"Sarika, open the door."
Did you foresee this while you were planning your break in?
Sarika!
Open the door!
I know there is someone inside!
Open up!
Open up or I will cal in the neighbors!
Today the whole world will see your true colors... I will rub your face in dirt.
- Isn't that true?
"- Yes, it's-- it's correct, but I-"
- I'm deeply...ashamed.
"So you get angry, and you take revenge."
That's what you do.
"You did it to a woman that you loved, and now you're doing it to the company that fired you."
- That's not a question.
- No.
Here's the question.
"Yes or no, the model on the blueprints that you were just talking about, did any of them have the Borns Tech name or any identifying markings on them?"
"Not that I know of, no."
They could have been made by anybody.
"I mean, for all we know, they could be Ryan Larson's design."
"I mean, yes, but that-- that wouldn't be feasible."
Yes.
I suppose so.
Nothing further.
[street noises]
[footsteps]
Hi.
I went by your office.
"I saw your stuff was still there, so I figured you might have come up here."
Clever of me.
Here.
It's liberating to do the wrong thing sometimes.
Most of the time.
What generation of feminism are we up to now?
Fifth wave?
Or sixth?
I don't-
- I've lost count.
I do know that it is still... really hard.
-And just hustling?
I said you're coming to mass You!
You're fucked in the head!
OK?
There!
Pierre!
"I wanted to find before you, but I have not arrived."
Sit.
"I can not, I parked illegally."
And my friends just go.
Come on!
I visited some Tellier.
"He wants 50,000 euros for an accident in the basement."
"Funny, it seems to think that I'll pay him."
This guy's a jerk.
I do not know what a lawyer.
What kind of accident?
UltimateFightChampionship.
Berserker fight in which all blows allowed.
"Not allowed, but the posjeæeno well the money is on the bet."
I know it is not good engage in illegal things.
"I'll stop, but I will not over become a provincial night clerk."
What exactly happened?
Stupid Tellier's cousin sent into combat.
In the second round broke his spine.
"Will no longer walk, but I do?"
He should not have come.
You know that you can be prosecuted because of the violence and causing disability?
"No worries, I have a very good attorney."
-Just so.
"I am a lawyer, I'm not to your debt."
Solve it.
Never mind the issue of proof...
I will never allow his wrongdoing to succeed!
-How do you see the outcome of this race?
-How confident do you feel?
Thanks to the absence of Mac...
I now have great hopes of winning the title.
What about Black Eagle?
I've never even heard of him.
So it may safely be said that I will be the one to win the championship.
What's that?
Mac!
So you are going to participate in the race after all?
"Yes, this is the prototype of my missing engine."
"I had kept it at a friend's place, so it wasn't destroyed in the fire."
"It may be not as powerful as the other one, but I'll race with it."
"Good luck to you, Mac."
I'll do what little I can.
You're right.
Let's do our best.
Am I in time?
"It's really a fine day for flying, isn't it?"
Has Moriarty appeared?
"No, not yet."
Please take care of Mrs. Hudson.
I'll fly with Mac.
Right.
"Finally, the moment has come for me to show the world... that my ""Crow"" is Number One!"
Here!
Here!
I can't wait to see who's going to win the championship.
"Are you ready, Mrs. Hudson?"
Yes.
I have a pair of cargos that come with a ski cap.
"- Just some long pants, if you got those."
- Yeah.
Sure.
Like drop-crotch slacks?
Just the best-- whatever.
It doesn't... [coffeemaker gurgling]
Pants!
- Thanks.
"- So, what's the what, man?"
"Yeah, like I was saying, I just, you know--"
"It's the first time I've been back in the 'hood in a minute and it kind of... you know, to be honest, it feels like people are... trying to hold me responsible for something I did."
"Man, that is unfair."
"But, I mean, that's like, just like a people, isn't it?"
"Like, they do that."
"Yeah, they do."
"And, you know, I'm just..."
I really just need somewhere to-- somewhere to stay.
"Oh, man."
You should talk to my landlord.
"- Man, he's the most accommodating dude."
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"He's always telling me he's got like, a line of people that he wants to get in here."
"You should get on line, Chip!"
He is a real coolio too.
"Like, I haven't paid rent in like, three or six different months."
"So, I mean, that's one thing."
"But, you should hurry, because he said that rents are gonna skyrocket soon because of the new hotel going."
So--
Shit!
I don't see why.
Huh!
"What, you -- spend money?"
"Granville, I am t--talking about advertising."
You keep on about s--spending money.
I wish you'd w--watch your language!
"I may be old--fashioned, but I hate to hear young people t--talking loosely."
I haven't brought you up to be promiscuous over m--money.
-
"- True, I'll give you that."
-
- You've lacked for nothing.
That's right.
That's one thing I haven't lacked -- nothing!
I've had plenty of that!
You've always had good food and healthy exercise.
I know.
But what about boring?
It's often been boring.
"Well, I should hope so."
But look what it's d--done for your complexion!
-
"- You've got wonderful skin, our Granville."
-
"- I haven't done a lot with it, though."
Skin like that is entirely due to good old--fashioned English b--boredom.
"We used to be famous for it, a while back, all over Europe."
"""There go the English,"" they used to say. ""Aren't they boring?"""
"Mind you, we were always r--respected for it."
"Yes, but the world's changed."
And d--don't they know it.
Look what they get now abroad.
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
Let's go.
I look like Kermit the frog.
"Oh, God."
"Artie, stop doing that!"
"Yeah, I gotta tell you, Myka, those really bring out your eyes."
"This is a, uh, 14th century Chinese firework"
Known as an ice flower.
Very few-- very few like it left.
Now...
"Do not tell Mrs. Frederic that I did this, all right?"
"All right, we've got about ten minutes, more or less."
Let's go.
The light pattern triggers a feedback loop
In the optic nerve that mesmerizes the viewer.
They won't remember a thing.
Booga-booga.
"Whoa, freaky McFreakerson."
So it's some sort of reverse chemical reaction?
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, take these off."
Just don't look directly through the window.
This was made by an implosion grenade.
It removes matter from the center of a space
And pulls everything-- Obviously everything--
Directly towards it with violent force.
This explains why they couldn't find the sword.
It could be in there.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no."
"No. the sword, long gone."
Stolen.
This was used by the thief as a cover.
- So the guy that I saw--
It's alright uncle.
How many people are so duty conscious like your son?
Feel proud of him.
"Sir, you're really great."
You will catch that thief.
"Looking at the fire in you, if you catch him, he will see his worst nightmare."
You are his perfect partner.
You will catch him for sure.
He won't.
He will catch him.
He won't.
"He will catch him, you shorty."
You won't catch him.
You stupid.
"I'm telling you, he will catch him."
Why are talking nonsense?
Why are you interfering in our matters?
I am talking to my brother-in-law.
You can't catch him even if he stands in front of you.
You won't catch him.
No way.
Day after tomorrow is very auspicious.
Lets fix the engagement on that day.
No.
I've an urgent meeting on that day.
Ministers are coming from India.
Actually...
Sorry.
Don't mistake me.
This meeting was fixed a month back.
Important business deal.
We will have it next week.
There are other people interested.
You thinking about selling to the Vietnamese?
I'm not gonna say who.
"I gotta do what's best, right?"
"You want my money in your bank, I want that Eastern territory."
"I'm not saying we won't make a deal, but there are other people interested and I wanna listen to what they have to say."
"You sell me the East, I make sure you make a lot of money."
- Keep talking.
- It's all I'm asking.
I got a meeting with this guy in 10 minutes.
- Where is this gonna be?
"- 400 block, Powell."
I'm in my car.
Let's go.
Julianna Vejzna?
Immigration.
"Would you come along with me, please."
- Am I being arrested?
"- Yes, you are."
Why?
Why are you arresting me?
"I'm sorry, I don't know the details."
Watch your head.
The Chickadee club's laid out like this.
"Two exit doors at the back, Ronnie's office, then you got the stage."
"These exits doors are open, or locked up?"
I don't know.
Can I get out that way is what I need to know.
Have they got chains?
I'll see if I can find out.
"This is the club here, all this."
"This is the lounge and your front doors, here and here."
"Hey, Sefton, what's snarling up the traffic?"
"By the time we get to look, they'll be old hags."
"Simmer down, boys, simmer down."
There'll be a second show when they put the next batch through.
"Hey, Sefton."
What's the big idea?
Take that telescope out of here.
- Says who?
-Says me.
You take it out.
Only you're gonna have a riot on your hands.
"Every time the men get packages, you think up some angle to rob them."
"The Krauts find that, they'll throw us in the boob."
They know about that.
I'd worry about that radio.
They know about your distillery and the races.
That's right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Ask Security.
Go on.
Tell him.
You've got me shadowed every minute.
- Haven't you found out?
-Not yet.
Answer.
How do you rate all these privileges?
I grease the guards.
I give them 10 percent.
And maybe a little something else.
- What?
-Maybe a little information.
Break it off!
"You know, I've always tried to be there for you."
"I was off making the money, they money that is in that trust fund."
I guess I hoped that you'd be there for me now.
"Well... it's up to you now, isn't it?"
"Excuse me, Amelia?"
Let me guess.
"You want to audition, and you're looking for advice."
"Well, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe lose 20 pounds and sleep with the choreographer."
"Actually, I'm not a dancer."
I'm a journalist.
"I'm from ""Interview"" Magazine."
They told me you were ready to talk to me.
"Wait, you're from ""Interview""?"
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you...
"I mean, you're so young."
"Well, I could say the same thing about you."
I'm 17.
"In this business, that's about a year away from being pushed out."
"And here I was, expecting I would have to talk to some old person."
"Nope, just me."
Cool.
"Look, I want to apologize."
- No need.
- It's just...
It's not what it looks like.
"Oh, it's not?"
Because it looks like you're married.
"Yes, but it's an open marriage."
We both want to be with other people.
Really?
That's not just a lie so you don't look like a snake?
Thank you.
Oh!
Um... ?
please.
Please.
"For as long as you receive an article coaching fee, I don't see no objection your continuing to instruct him."
Fee!
?
Yes!
Certainly a fee.
I should be raising the matter with Mr.Baker today.
Is...is there anything else you wish me to discuss with him?
Uh...
Dress-room articles?
Or your intimate needs catered for?
"Sammy, once mentioned you do not like to share studio facilities with crew."
Electricians in particular?
Er..yes...ehuh...well one...one mustn't complain.
They do their best to make one comfortable.
"And as for the work...people seem to be responding rather well, so..."
"Uncle Frank, I look..."
look forward to your opinion.
Thank you.
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.
Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
Smelt of you for the longest time.
"Then one day, I went in there... and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
Lily...
"I understand you know, that things have changed."
And that I would like to put my name on you.
Oh!
Not that she was drinking or anything.
I think it was a bad trip fajitas.
Yes?
I'll be right there.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
Pretty naughty!
What do you think about us going on a real date?
"I mean don't get me wrong, secret sex is awesome."
"Really awesome, but I think that you and I actually dating awesom... er."
On that thought.
We have a situation up here.
What sort of situation?
I'm kinda busy in here.
Code red.
I'll be right back.
"Someone drop the dime, called the coppers."
"Someone on the Greek task force phoned Bowman to say, claiming there's booze."
- Come on.
- Chambers.
Execute plan B.
- But there's not time.
- I wouldn't be so sure
There's always time for plan B.
You fellas and spread out.
"Hey, boys!"
Care to join me for a drink?
What the hell are you doing?
"Taking your cruise out on the open road, see if I can hit a few miles an hour."
"You wanna join me, I'd love to have company!"
"Let him go, we always know where to find him."
- Not with my squad car.
Because blood relations never break.
Good bye!
Sheen!
Sheen!
- Shadab!
- Yes!
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.
"Son, I want to talk something important with you."
"Yes, tell me!"
I was having a talk with your father regarding your marriage.
What have you to tell?
"Mother, this is a matter of the house."
I shall accept whatever you and father decide.
This is your generosity!
Yet we feel we should know your views.
We wish to talk about your proposal with Sheen.
Do you like Sheen?
"Mother, you know that I don't like interference in my work.-Yes."
"So, how can I interfere in matters between you and father?"
I am okay with whatever your decision might be.
- Bye!
- Be happy!
"If we could ask sheen, just once."
Sheen likes India very much!
She tells people in Karachi that we are half Indians.
So let the marriage happen!
She will become a complete Indian.
"Brother, India and Pakistan's relations are so sensitive."
It can go bad anytime.
And...
Let the marriage happen in this country.
I'd like to know what made him do it.
Maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters.
You ever think of that?
Next man.
"Right, you'll do."
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
And either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Tread on his blank blank fingers.
Right!
Next man.
You'll do.
- Let's try that again.
"You've had your treat, let someone else have fun."
"Proper airborne, weren't you, Canada?"
"Didn't you hear me, Evans?"
"What about the other boys, Sarge?"
I don't want to be too selfish.
Come on.
Right.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Right!
Gordon.
"He's leaving himself wide open, watch."
"I am, am I?"
Come on.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Argh!
Grand theft auto.
1984.
Armed robbery.
"1987, 1992."
You get the idea.
And here he is today.
Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-Out.
"City, State, and Federal."
He's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside.
An entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
"Sometime during the Clinton administration,"
Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
So...
- When does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy, and all it's gonna cost you is 80,000 and one pound of your finest meth."
"$80,000 for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'm gonna represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
50 goes to me.
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk?
Good as gold.
"Menu, sir?"
- A lemonade.
- You and your lemonade!
Rubbish!
Have some champagne!
Then you'll see what life's really like!
"Play my favorite song again, boys!"
A round for the orchestra!
When a man's 30 years old
He has life
At his feet
Later his hair grows gray
And he lies flat on his face
What's the point of being 30
And letting money go unspent
Slave away and all the rest
And end up with nothing
No!
We only go around once in life
"We get one chance at girls, schnapps and beer"
"Yes, let life's big moving van come"
"Adieu, Berlin"
We're driving on
To the orchestra!
We'll now announce the prizes for the three most beautiful bathing suits.
"First prize, a set of fine china, goes to Miss Clarissa Gordona."
"Second prize, a crystal bowl, goes to Miss Anni Behnke."
"Third prize, a travel bag, goes to Miss Schulz."
"Mieze, I have something else to tell you."
Watch out for Reinhold!
He's the most dangerous of all.
When?
"I mean, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight some of these people will never talk to me.
And what happens next year?
"What, she does this next Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair."
"Well, what else can you do?"
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer and not face the damage she's done.
- Wait.
"That's not true, is it?"
- No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
"Well, here's something new."
"I told Chuck I loved him, again."
"And he didn't say it back, again."
"- Blair, I'm not gonna tell people that."
- I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
- Don't wanna be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school.
- Look what it almost made me do.
- That's the thing.
You need to be cool to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart.
She got her head chopped off.
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
"Keep your eye on the prize, Jenny Humphrey."
"You can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you."
For what it's worth you're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Men fighting against bulls?
"Yes, yes, yes."
What did he say?
-That they would love to go.
I couldn't have translated it better.
(MAN) (COUGHING)
The fortune cookie was right.
Love and a cough can't be hidden.
"Get going, Luis."
And leave you here alone?
"No, don't even think it."
"Whatever way, you're coming with me."
-Don't be an idiot.
They won't let me board in this state.
I can't leave you alone with this fever.
You're burning up.
"On your way out, tell the guy that owns the guesthouse to call a doctor."
"But go now, you're going to miss your plane."
I'll leave you this so you can get by when you get better.
Hang in there.
(Door closes)
Is what you have to tell me very important?
It could be.
Tell me.
"Sit down, woman."
One of our internal agents called.
An hour ago someone checked into a hospital.
He was delirious and talking about a time door.
Couldn't he just be crazy or a science fiction fan?
Look.
"This is his picture in the hospital, taken this very morning."
I see.
"Uh, how long has this been going on?"
Ever since we got back from vacation.
It was not a vacation.
It was an aliyah.
That's a pilgrimage to Israel.
Where did you visit when you were in Israel?
We shopped in Tel Aviv.
We swam in the dead sea.
It was wonderful.
They have spa treatments there.
- Then we went to the wailing wall...
- Oh!
- Where... this one went bananas.
"- I-I mean, I was brought to my knees."
- And I was moved to tears.
- He was on his knees.
"- B-being there, praying there..."
"- It was very scary, actually."
That is as close to heaven as I've ever felt.
It changed me forever.
Jerusalem syndrome?
"Mm, it's been around since ancient times."
"Apparently, people go to these holy sites, like the wailing wall, and they start relinquishing possessions,"
"- wearing togas, sermonizing."
"- Yeah, but it's..."
It's temporary.
And they usually recover in a couple of days.
"Yeah, but this has been going on for three weeks with this guy."
Tracy said it's getting worse every day.
He's such a show-off.
You're eating doughnuts for lunch?
That's a sign.
He's so thoughtful!
I'm smitten.
I can tell!
You look green!
Is that your heart broken to cut chips?
Somebody gets a Pepto!
Spritzer girl?
Where is the art department?
Things should be clearly marked in these offices.
- It's down there.
- I'm supposed to meet Sebastian.
We're going to discuss strategies for covering up heroine tracks.
"It's so, so sad!"
I know.
It's terrible that these girls do that to themselves.
"It causes so much extra work for us, matching skin tones... blending palletes."
For arms can be quite difficult for artists.
"I can imagine, good luck!"
"My God, you're sick!"
I think I got a full poisoning atrophy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm horrified!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"Don't worry, it happens to everyone."
I'll get some water.
"Honey, are you all right?"
You got it all dripping!
I just chugged in front of Paul.
I'm gonna kill myself.
"Don't worry, you'll lose weight."
Here he comes Remember:
You're not OK with Kat and Christian.
You're still angry.
Since when had being gay defined me?
I kind of lied before.
I do like the neurotic ones.

"Go, go, go!"
What is going on out here?
!
None of you are going to sleep until your side is spotless.
But the first-years ambushed us!
No excuses!
"And you two, don't even pretend that you've been fishing."
"Oh, um..."
"In that case, you have broken curfew."
"Put that down, pick up a mop!"
Another strike?
There'll be more.
We're one step ahead.
Particularly concerning ballet.
We would thrash you any day.
Are you threatening a ballet battle?
There's no such thing.
A hip-hop war.
Second-year crew versus the ballet tragics.
"Saturday afternoon, 12:45 at the cafe."
We're done here.
Let's bounce.
"They're well oiled, I'll give them that much."
"Oh, sorry."
How is it possible you slept through that?
Let me guess
And thought why don't I come to your home... drink water in your house and... break their bones here.
Sir you know...
Don't interfere!
What do I care?
- All I want is to...
- Get water out.
Welcome Tauji.
I've invited him here specially... to tell him about your deeds.
And show him too.
Your man's taken our contract... and he's been beating up our men... instead of doing our job.
Enough!
My rule is we can sacrifice our kin... but never fail from completing a contract.
Sometimes... we make a mistake.
In life we often make small mistakes... as well as big ones.
They are 3D villains.
3 generous villains.
They gave me one chance to catch that scoundrel.
They'll give me a second chance.
Third... fourth... fifth...
Stop it.
Are you going to keep running after him all your life?
Mr. Pradhan.
Contract cancel.
What did you say?
What did you say?
We cancel the contract we gave you.
Cancel!
Cancel!
Cancel!
Uncle you heard.
They cancelled the contract.
When the contract's canceled... there's no question of betraying.
Mood:
"- Hassled, hot, hostile, relaxed."
- You're histerical.
I'm used to hanging out with these people too long.
- It catches on.
- Totally.
I like to stay away from the fashion car when I'm not working.
"But it's so incestuous, everybody is doing everybody else."
They feel like they don't get to miss out or something like that.
- It's pathetic.
"- Listen, I gotta get back to work... before I get fired, but maybe we could grab a drink after?"
"I'd love to, but unfortunately my day doesn't end here."
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Great.
"There's this cool band named Nimbus, playing at the Rebard's... it's like some disco, some funk, interested?"
"- Sounds fabulous, I'd love to."
- Cool.
And definitely bring that silly putty.
I'm all over that.
- Time to take your places!
- I'm not ready yet.
I'm still in make up.
"See, Chi Chi?"
I told you.
I don't work like this.
- Supermodels.
- I know.
Attendance!
"I needs standants, standants, you..."
- spritzer girl.
- Did I hear my name?
Go stand at the top of the balcony.
The kinetor.
Thank you.
"I repeat, we mustn't interfere with history."
And nobody should find out that we are visitors.
"Surely they wouldn't understand it, and wouldn't know what to make of us."

The colonization of Mars.
The Peace Treaty.

It stopped.
Don't touch anything!
"In brief, one hour from now the Bernaus' house will burst into flames."
We have more than enough time.
"If everything went according to plan, then we must be somewhere here, on the country road that's still under construction, between Bournak and Kamenice."
You know our task.
17 degrees Celsius.
The air pollution is within the acceptable level.
"- Well, but here..."
- Just say it.
There is no country road here!
That can't be.
The machines must be here as well.
"To the right, behind us."
Hold on!
- Hold on!
- Give me your hand!
- It's terribly deep!
- Give me your hand!
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
Seyed!
Seyed my cart is stolen my cart
"- Hey girl, have you seen a cart?"
- What?
- Cart have you seen my cart?
- No.
These ooward people put my father in trouble and now they are doing same to me.
"My father left Tangak because of me, because of Hanieh and my mom."
But at this time I came to Tangak by myself and I won't be stopped at all.
I will stand for it until the end.
How dare they underestimate me?
Are they Kufa's people?
"If my father can't play kettledrum till dawn, I will do it."
I promised to play kettledrum for Hanieh's leg to be cured.
"I stand for it, until the end."
What are they thinking?
"Seyed Abdullhossein, You make them understand!"
I am Bashirou!
Bashirou!
ZaerAli's son!
Tangaki Captain ZaerAli's son!
I confront them until the end!
Unljl last moment!
Can you hear me?
Did you hear or not?
"If you are real men, show up then I'll show them!"
I do something to you that nobody has done it before.
Their neck twisted.
"Do whatever you want with me, I am so tough skinned."
I am still in Tangak_
Do whatever you want with me.
I am still in Tangak_
What's the matter?
"Well, we're having a little trouble with these drills here."
- No more spares?
"- No, they're all shot too."
"Well, turn them in and get some new ones."
"Frank, these drills cost money."
- We gotta be more careful.
- Yeah?
You asked us to speed it up.
You better get some drills that will stand this gaff.
They'll stand up if they're used right.
Maybe you can use them better.
"Yeah, and so can you."
- Did you check your setting?
"- Yeah, it's all right."
That's tool steel.
You're giving her too much feed.
"Come on, boy, you're too good a guy for boners like that."
- I see that greaseball's been picking on you.
- Yeah.
How's it feel being pushed around by a honyock?
I don't like it.
I ain't gonna stand for it.
No?
"What are you gonna do, take a poke at him and lose your job?"
I'll take a poke at him and I'll get another job too.
That don't worry me none.
You were a long time getting this one.
"Weren't you, Frank?"
Yeah.
"All right, then."
Why don't you get wise to yourself?
"Forgive me, I don't stock new labels or small labels"
KK-Mix burnt out four years ago.
"And what an album, ""What's Life?"""
These songs don't sell.
And I won't annoy Mr Shekhar
Mr Om!
You...?
Hello...
You don't recognise me?
I remember you very well
Can I ever forget a pirate?
- That's just as well
"Market news is, no one's willing to distribute your label with KK-Mix"
But I can sell
"Until now, you only trusted gentlemen"
"For once, try out a scoundrel"
"I will, if you stop pirating music"
Stipulating terms?
Even in distress?
That makes me feel like agreeing
"Okay, God be my witness."
No more piracy

Has the gold arrived?
- Yes.
All right.
When can we pick it up?
Today itself.
I am floored!
"Not exactly, Baby."
You're vanquished.
What about the money?
- Ask Tiwari.
He looks aRer the transactions and accounts.
All right.
But who will come to pick it up?
Balwant.
At Malighat.
Sharp 4 p.m.
is that 533285?
- Yes.
I wish to speak to Inspector Vijay Varma from the special branch.
Go on. I am InspectorVerma speaking.
A gold consignment is arriving at Malighat at 4 pm.
"What's that, Larry?"
You want to show your appreciation somehow?
I suppose I could do that.
"After all, it would be rude of me to turn down a..."
"Oh, Larry, small but eager."
I'm going to need a serviette.
Hmmmm...
"Ah, thank God for rigamortis."
Councillors.
I eat you.

"I'm feeling really good, Sam."
Full of hope.
My spirit bear put me through an exercise program.
"Really worked my core, eh?"
"Good morning,"
I have and important announcement which will change the outcome of this trial.
Oh...
This may be very good for us.
I think we're gonna get a retrial.
"I'm beginning trust you, Sam Murray."
As you know someone has stolen my first and second-string gavels.
Now today my wife needs the hammer that I've been using as my third-string gavel for one of her projects.
Bird house.
"Which is all to say, you're looking at it:"
Today's gavel.
"All right, look, look."
It's just gonna have to do.
What a travesty this is turning into.
"Your honour, may I approach the bench?"
Yes.
- Shut up!
Who are you?
You come in here with your fancy lipstick and your fake name.
- How do I know you don't work for those guys?
"- Eddie, just stop!"
- Shut the fuck up.
- You don't.
"But let me tell you about when I was a little girl, and Amancio killed my whole family and took me out of my pueblo."
"Or the thousands of innocents he sacrificed, or the many, many years I was his slave."
"But at the end of the day, does it really matter?"
Because the only way for you to trust me is for you to believe that I want him dead as much as you want his money.
"So, what do you say, Eddie?"
"I say you broke the code, kid."
"Oh, that fuck!"
Where's my shit?
!
- Seth took it.
- He what?
- I knew he was up to somethin'.
"- And I can tell you where,"
- but I want in on the job.
"- What is this, a potluck?"
!
"Eddie, look, okay?"
"I know you're pissed, and you have every right to be."
I messed up.
Gimme a chance to make this right.
"Larry, Larry."
Lawrence.
"Come on, man."
You gotta stop taking things so personally.
- You put my partner in traction.
- where are you headed?
- to what i promised the last ghost i would do.
- [scoffs] clean up your mama's shop?
"no, you ain't."
- [scoffs] [snaps fingers]
- this ain't right.
this ain't the salon.
- this is like -  scrapbooking place.
- what the heck?
"- it looks god-awful, don't it?"
"[laughs] [coughs, laughs]"
"- hey, i know that laugh."
i know that laugh!
mama.
- [clicks tongue]
- you look terrible.
- well...
- what's up with the creepy black robe?
"- robe's part of the tradition for, uh, ghosts of christmas future."
"anyway, after you married wayne, you sold the place to bob and marge."
you never did get no job.
"- [scoffs] well, i actually think it looks kind of nice."
"- oh, you like the way this looks?"
it looks like a magazine or something.
it's got no soul.
"i mean, honey, look what you let happen to the salon that i built with my own hands."
- it's quaint!
- yeah.
then marge went even hog-wild after she got it all in the divorce.
- wait -- bob and marge got a divorce?
- yeah.
- see?
Perkins!
Get this old goat moving!
"Look alive, boy!"
Sir.
"Move, you bastards!"
Get up!
"Saved you for the firing squad, Harper."
"Perkins tells me that you were once a common soldier, a sergeant."
- So I was.
- Strange.
"In Spain, an officer must be ""of the blood""."
Un caballero.
righteous but charming A gentleman
"Sorry, wrong house, Miss."
Is that why you have trouble with your men?
"Perkins told you that, did he?"
Yes.
He said you were a proper bastard.
He's right.
You may as well know the rest.
My mother was a whore.
I was born in a brothel.
Grew up in an orphanage and hope to die in the army.
Right?
But the boy Perkins says you saved the life of General Wellesley.
"And the Irishman, Harper, he says that when the English wish to honour a man of courage, they call him a proper bastard."
"You listen to soldiers' gossip, ma'am."
"Yes, I do."
"You see, we have two ears but only one mouth."
So a good leader will listen twice as much as he shouts.
"I beg your pardon, Mr Sharpe."
But she's as dry as a bone.
"Essentially, it's like feeding the beast-- this big, ugly, greedy beast that demands to be fed over and over and over again."
Is this your first meeting?
Hi.
"Yeah, actually, it is."
My name's Nick.
I'm Monica.
Hi.
Your words were an inspiration.
Thanks.
"Yeah, she's great, isn't she?"
This is Hillary.
"Hillary, this is Nick."
"Hillary, it's a pleasure."
Hi.
"Listen, if this is your first time, you shouldn't feel pressured to join this group."
There's others in the city you might want to check out.
Hillary's right.
It's really important that you trust the people you're going to be looking to to help you...
And who'd you rather look to for help than Monica?
"You come here to get off drugs, and you meet Monica."
That's a pretty good deal.
I'd marry her tomorrow if she'd give me the word.
"Henry, settle down."
You're going to scare Nick off.
"Well, that's the idea."
Less competition.
"We'll, um, talk later, right?"
Yeah.
I'm his sponsor.
"Look, why don't I take you over to Angie?"
She's got books and pamphlets.
"Nick, it's going to be rough, but we're all here for you, and if you need any help, just call me, okay?"
"That equipment will bring back anyone for a while, but long term..."
It was my fault.
"I am responsible for what happened to Clara, she was in my care!"
What is the point of blaming yourself?
None.
Because she's going to live.
Hello.
"They all think I'm going to die, don't they?"
And I know you're going to live.
How?
I never know how.
I just know who.
The green lady... she said you were the saver of worlds once.
Are you going to save this one?
"If I do, will you come away with me?"
Yes.
Well then.
Merry Christmas.
I have in my hand a piece of the Ice Lady.
Everything you need to know about how to make ice people.
Is that what you want?
See you at the office.
"So then, Doctor, saving the world again?"
Might I ask why?
Are you making a bargain with the universe?
You'll save the world to let her live?
Yes!
"And don't you think, after all this time and everything I've ever done, I'm owed this one?"
I don't think the universe makes bargains.
It was my fault.
Well then.
Better save the world.
"Restaurants are big down here, right?"
Huge.
Kind of resisted them at first.
"As you know, I'm not much of a foodie."
"What, now you are?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"When in Rome, right?"
"Well, maybe you can help us narrow down which restaurants are prime candidates."
Okay.
What do we got?
(computer blips)
How about this...
Pat O'Brien's?
Pat O's?
No way they're cartel.
They've been in the Quarter for decades.
Make a killer hurricane cocktail that'll...
You should try one.
"I'm not here for the cocktails, T."
Okay.
Let's just get Garcia and get back home.
(computer blips)
I'm not sure I want to go back home.
Sorry?
I'm just saying I'm not sure.
"Ten years ago, you couldn't get far enough away from this place fast enough, and now you like it?"
"I don't understand, Tammy."
This cartel case is your big shot.
"Isler moves up, you move up."
It's... everything you've always said you wanted.
Isn't that why we broke up?
"This isn't about me and you, Hannah."
He just wanted to know when they were coming to Hawaii.
Why?
"Okay, Sofia, Dawkins has this guy Craig right now and he's gonna kill him."
The only way we can prevent that is if you tell us exactly what Dawkins said to you on the phone this morning.
He said something about a big payday.
Then asked me for my car.
Dawkins is driving a 2010 silver Chevy Malibu.
Car's got a vehicle recovery system.
- Can you track it?
No problem.
Ready.
"VIN number's two, niner, whiskey, niner, alpha, alpha, seven, niner, two, eight, one."
Give me 10 minutes.
"Hey, I pulled Dawkins jacket."
You guys gotta see this.
This guy's rasp sheet reads like a grocery list he's checking off.
"In Boston, he's jacking cars."
"In New York, he's robbing ATMs."
Then he graduates to full-on bank robberies in Cleveland.
"Cops there suspected him of murdering his partner, name of Paul Stark."
"Five million dollars they stole together, never found."
- Look familiar?
- That's Craig.
So no wonder he doesn't take Dana.
He doesn't care about her money.
He wants the 5 million he stole with Paul.
Craig.
- Kono?
I got him.
They just parked outside Pacific Rim Bank.
I watched you die.
Heh.
- Sing what?
- Dunno.
I'm not sure the lyrics make much difference.
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."
"That's an underrated song, John."
"Much darker than you, think."
"Like, he freely admits he was high and once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that..."
Curtains closed for them.
"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
That or La Bamba.
"Remember what you need to dance La Bamba, Calum?"
Feet.
- Do you want a bacon sandwich?
"- Yeah, all right."
"I'll stick the grill on, you nip to the shop for the bacon."
What?
That's fair.
"And if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them."
There is on thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life
- and that is you will never see me dance.
- I'll put money on it.
One day you'll dance.
- Who's that out there?
- Jude Cassidy.
Don't think that I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
- Argument about the M25.
- You had an argument about the M25?
"John, you can't leave me here on my own, please."
"- Who else can I go to, Rose?"
"I was, uh, behind enemy lines in France."
"First, it doesn't feel like anything."
Adrenaline's good that way.
"Then, it was burning."
White hot.
I was trying to help a family of Jews.
Police didn't like that.
You know about the Jews?
About the Nazi Master Plan?
All those trains taking them East every day.
"They're not being ""resettled."""
They're being exterminated.
Five thousand Jews per train.
Ten trains per day.
You do the math.
"Your father, he's in charge of running the train schedules for the German Transport Ministry, right?"
He's very good at his job.
Very efficient.
How'd you get captured?
My plane was shot down.
You survived.
What about your crew?
I always wanted to learn how to fly.
Must be something up there.
"Everything looking so small, like tiny little pieces on a board game."
It's not a game.
"Real men, dying every day."
"And I'm being moved from camp to camp, for what?"
- It doesn't make sense anymore.
- You won't eat.
- Why are you still fighting?
- I fight for my country.

Little appreciation of my cooking!
I want us to work together to remove the obstacles to Griff being rehired.
"Allen, I'm the obstacle."
- Last word?
- Last word.
You like the kielbasa?
- New chief came to see me.
- Gillray.
"He's planning on eliminating supervisory and middle management positions, so..."
I'm a supervisor.
"Allen, you gotta do your best to protect me, I..."
This is not the Allen Conner I know.
- He's my son.
- Mm-hmm.
You're not even a little ashamed of yourself maybe?
A little bit?
"He's in trouble, Frank, I know it and you know it, and I just, I..."
I just gotta keep him close.
"If I can, if we can do that, I can..."
I have a chance to help him.
"Otherwise, I don't know where he is, or"
- how to find him or he could be dead in...
"- OK, OK."
- OK?
What does that mean?
- OK.
Griff gets his job back and I keep mine.
"I won't forget this, Frank."
"Yeah, well, I'm going to try."
"I just, when I started these classes I had this feeling that it was all part of my destiny, but I didn't know how,"
- but now I do.
"- It's so great that you're back in school, Tash."
"Jo, you must play terribly quietly so that the man upstairs can sleep."
He won't hear anything.
"- Mummy, why..."
"- David, who do you suppose he is?"
A damn fool to be out in this weather.
He's not a working sailor.
- He's not a working sailor?
- No.
I noticed his hands are terribly soft.
His hands?
He's wearing a suit for God's sake.
"You're very observant all of a sudden, aren't you?"
I'm going over to Tom's.
David.
Suppose he wakes up?
"Who's that man in my room, Mummy?"
"I don't know, darling."
..a girl with long blonde hair with diamonds in it.
- Do you know what diamonds are?
"- Sort of treasures, aren't they?"
I must cut your hair soon.
"If you didn't, would it grow and grow and grow?"
Yes.
It would grow down to your ears.
Then it would go down to your chin.
Then it would grow down past here.
Then it would curl up here.
"Then it would start tickling your feet, and we'd all have to get out of the bath."
Why?
"Because if people don't get out of their baths, they melt."
But I haven't.
Mummy...
- How do you know?
- I know because Stacy Culpepper's got one.
And everybody was talking about it.
Let's get ours.
- We can't.
- Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe..."
What?
"Again, Vi?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
- We got it.
- What...
"He said it was an easy gig, right?"
- Yea.
"- Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me Daisy."
I know what we said.
"but, we've changed our mind and we thought... we considered your offer."
"And we think, that actually it'd work out quite well because um..."
"See, the day that you talked about..."
"Deeper baby, deeper..."
"Ow, gross!"
You weren't suppose to like it!
"Like I've end up better do with it, Princess."
Are you guys hear about this guy?
"Ok so basically, there was this guy who stole some shit from Chet."
- What did this guy take from him?
- A truck full of cologne.
"I am a grown man now, Your Majesty... and know better."

"Bring your resume, wallet, social security,"

"Minorities need not apply, or we gonn' sue your balls to the wall."
That sounds promising.
That job is perfect for you!

"Come on, get your car wash!"
Get it on ?
?
"Come on, get your car wash on ?"
"Hot dog, we want you to get your car washed!"
"Hey, look at this igloo!"
Now go on and get your car washed!
"Come on, y'all."
Somebody get a car wash.
- We're negotiating.
And how do you know that?
And are you really opening with a Shakespeare quote?
- Is that your plan?
- That's right.
Sonnet 65.
I assigned it.
I'm feeling nostalgic.
"Come on, Brooke, you don't miss me at all?"
"Consider this number blocked, too."
"This is my cousin, Eli."
Feel free to ignore him.
"This is Audrey, Noah."
"Hey, man."
"First day, huh?"
- School is school.
"- Sure, except, in this school, people get killed by knife-wielding maniacs every 20 years, give or take."
"Excuse me! ""Girl's only"" moment."
"(SIGHS) So, out of nowhere, Branson hits me up this morning."
Yeah.
"He said he just ""heard"" Jake and I broke up."
Whoa!
How did he hear that?
Barely anyone even knew that you were together.
What is it with men from the past mysteriously showing up?
"Wait, what does that mean?"
"Emma's deadbeat dad resurfaced, too."
"Okay, not cool."
And that is a totally different thing.
And I was also not ready to share that!
You weren't gonna share it with me?
"The person I told this morning wasn't exactly supportive, so..."
I knew you could do it!
Mr. Fuzzles!
"Thank you, Francis."
You can go now.
What?
What is it?
We've got something for you.
Dewey and I finally came up with something good enough for that insane voice in your head.
"-Here, put this on first."
-Roman candles?
"Well, that's how they started off."
We decided to give 'em a little more... oomph.
Do you care if you keep your eyebrows?
"-Hell, no!"
"Okay, the fuse is timed for 20 seconds."
"You're gonna light it, and then get up on the board and jump."
The rockets should kick in around there.
"They won't give you any momentum, but they will ignite that."
"Hopefully, you will land in that kiddie pool."
We think that's got a 50-50 shot of putting you out.
If the roof doesn't collapse.
Or ignite.
And it's all gonna be caught on that video camera.
This is more than anything I could have ever asked for.
Nobody deserves it more than you.
Should I get the hose?
Not yet.
He would've wanted us to wait.
Good boy.
You finished all your peas!
"Hey, slugger."
Guess what.
"- Yeah, uh-huh."
- You seem a little...
- Distracted.
"- I'm sorry, Amaar,"
I'm just trying to schedule an important meeting with Charles.
- Oh!
"Well, I can come back..."
"- No, no, you're here"
Interrupting me now.
Let's just get this over with.
- OK.
I was wondering if...
- You know the thing is...
"Charles and I are both so busy, we just can't line up our schedules."
I can't even get in touch with him.
"I've emailed, texted, phoned!"
The only thing left is Facebook or kidnapping.
"Oh, Facebook!"
"Hello, Facebook Charles,"
I'm poking you.
"Yeah, you like that, don't you?"
"Poke, poke, poke."
"You know, you can only poke someone once until they poke back."
"OK, really quick question:"
what do I do to build a mosque in Mercy?
"You know, what you really need is to start off with a press conference."
"Invite the media, invite the town."
You know what?
"There's a town meeting later on tonight, you can piggyback it."
I'll even waive the permit fees.
- What permit fees?
- Bribes.
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
L...
I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
- I have to go.
"- Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"[Door Opens, Closes]"
"[Woman] If you do engage in a lot of foreplay... so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina... and if you are putting your behind on a pillow... so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier... the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina... because this way you have some control over how fast...
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
And I'll tell you what...
If the two of you love each other...
- You going somewhere?
"- Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
- She's not feeling that well.
"- Oh, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so I thought that..."
[Sighs]
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"My dad died, and..."
"Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
- Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"All right, then stand up."
Easy.
I love standing up.
"Yeah, you're staying here."
"Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
That's not happening.
"All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
Vending machine at a rest stop.
Give me that.
- The dogs of Roland!
- What rock did they crawl out of?
!
We can't use big spells in a tangled battle like this!
Out of the way!
Where are they?
Where's the commander?
!
Is it you?
Are you this army's commander?
!
You're...
I just made mincemeat of the Estabul commander.
"If you resist any further, I'll kill you all."
That bloodstained red ring...
It's Crimson Fingered Claugh!
"That's Crimson Fingered Claugh, of Roland!"
Damn it.
All this pointless killing of each other...
Defeated again?
It's like they're reading our army's every move!
I told you!
I told you it was reckless!
- You pick a fine moment to say it!
- Crimson Fingered Claugh?
"You said Roland's commander was Claugh Klom, did you not?"
Ma'am.
"From what I have heard, he has gone to extreme lengths to force our men to surrender without killing them, has he not?"
- Ma'am.
- If that is how Roland battles...
"If that is the will of Sion Astal, the Hero King, then this fight is..."
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I'm not alone anymore.
That isn't a problem now.
I hope my question didn't annoy you.
"No, no, not at all."
- Was her father here?
- Yes.
- He asked me if I was a faggot.
- You're kidding!
"Well, he used the American expression, it's more subtle."
- What was my orientation?
- What did you say?
- That I'm into men.
- Really?
"No, silly, I lied to him."
How dare he ask me if I like men or women?
- Who cares?
"- Well, I'm glad to know."
Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches."""
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
He would forget to lock the case to the expensive watches.
Neal...
I resisted twice.
"The third time, this guy's asking to get took."
So I...
I grabbed a couple cases of watches and I hopped on a train to Portland.
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed 'em in a locker at the train station."
They're still there.
It's hardly stealing.
So you got away clean.
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras are stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught, and you're with me,"
- you're in trouble...
- You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake I.D.s and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car.
We make it legit.
We take a V.I.N. number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not gonna have you in the seat next to me"
I still believe things will work out for the best.
What do you believe in?
What do you believe?
I believe everything.
I'm just talking about the past.
"And today we go to a party for the first time with our daughter, and we quarrel about some stupid champagne."
That's all!
Champagne.
"One Martell, as if..."
Heaven's... what did you do there?
"You kept counting, you weren't even interested in what was going on."
You admire a poet...
That's just like you.
You come to a party and you say...
Recite the poem Bacardi for me.
To drink baccardi...
Have you ever drunk it?
"Of course, but not with you."
I haven't.
Why didn't you let us have it?
Why did you hum and ha?
"Don't ask me who I drank it with, I don't ask you who you drank what with."
What with who?
With no one.
And I've never tasted Bacardi!
What do you think it is?
Some Cuban cognac.
"No idea, of course."
What are you getting at now?
I don't know why you made such a fuss.
is that what we were making preparations for?
It wasn't how I imagined it either!
Erudite sim complete.
JEANINE:
There's only Amity now.
PETER:
She hasn't passed Abnegation yet.
"Yes, she has."
When she spared your life.
This girl is extraordinary.
She's tested positive for four factions in one day.
(CHUCKLES)
No one's gotten that far.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
MAN:
We've got a problem.
She's crashing.
We have to rest her.
Sure you're not letting familial attachment cloud yourjudgment?
See for yourself.
(PANTING)
Very well.
Detach the subject.
"Good work, everyone."
We'll resume tomorrow.
(DOOR OPENS)
"You were never planning on going back to Abnegation, were you?"
I had to do what I felt was right.
Our parents would be ashamed of you.
"Well, maybe not."
"I mean, I am willing to sacrifice you, the only family I have left, the only person I love, in order to preserve what's best for everyone else."
What's more selfless than that?
"What does Jeanine think is in that box, Caleb?"
It's a message from The Founders.
No.
INTERVIEWER:
"So Lloyd, do you think that this body burn will"
"Be better than ""Terror Firmer""?"
You're up.
[Screaming]
--[sigh] Nothing could be that good.
[Laughs]
Nothing could be that unbelievable.
Not since the Vietnam Buddhist priest
Was there such a flame up.
INTERVIEWER:
So how do you guys do this?
How do you light him on fire?
Carefully.
[Interposing voices]
Come over here.
I'll show you where to do that.
"We have Nomex underwear, two pairs,"
In here soaking in fireproof gel.
[Church bells ringing]
This should be the soundtrack!
"Then we have a Nomex jumpsuit over here, which doubles"
For his janitor costume.
"We get that all on him, all gelled up,"
His face and hair gelled up.
Then we put on lighter fluid and rubber cement.
Light him on fire.
He runs around like a maniac.
And we extinguish him down here.
"Maybe you should practice it now, before he"
Gets the stuff on him.
"As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,"
"I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance."
"Oh, really?"
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
"Well, I'm not really from Mattel."
I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.
"Well, sure."
Look at him.
He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
"Hey, a laser!"
"How come you don't have a laser, Woody?"
It's not a laser!
It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
-What's with him?
-Laser envy.
"All right, that's enough!"
"Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy."
-Toy?
-T-O-Y.
Toy!
"Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is ""Space Ranger."""
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
"Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?"
"Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious."
What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger!
"He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!"
Ok?
"And I need that in a cashier's check or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
And make it out to Ice Station Zebra Associates.
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"After that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard, but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"
I look like your high school girlfriend?
"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defense that money can buy.
"Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
Ok.
"Look, it's on your head."
You're not supposed to double up on Vitamin A. It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
"What happened to my masturbator, Francesca?"
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
"Gentlemen, I sense you're discussing my client."
I can see a UFO?
"Yes, through your window."
"You mean I can go over, there to my window, and I can look at it I can see a UFO?"
"No, but you can see it through my telescope."
"Oh, you have a telescope with you?"
"Yes, in my case."
So why don't you set it up?
I always dreamed about seeing a UFO.
"Hey, what did you say you were drinking?"
So you're dead now...shit.
And you're going to hell.
Straight from your marihuana jungles.
"Straight from your lies, your lies, your lies."
"You dropped it, fuck!"
Suits you well.
You go to hell.
Whe'll all go to hell.
I'll go to hell too.
But I know I'm damned.
"And you, never knew."
So you weren't ready?
to toll the bell.
For me it's easy.
From hell to hell I'm not dancing in marihuana jungles.
"I live in concrete mazes, stone and glass."
"Hard like my heart, sharp and clean."
No romantic illusions to changing the world.
I don't lie to myself.
That love can cure because I know I'm alone.
And you fucked that every day.
"You lived, you lied, you lied you lied."
You go to hell?
"Gosh, he's a big one."
Good grief.
"So what's the plan then, what do we do?"
"We will try to measure them, we will tie them up and then..."
So you kind of hog-tie them and then attach some device...
A GPS device?
Radio telemetry.
"Right, radio telemetry."
Shall we try?
You can try.
"You can feel it, can't you?"
It's being hog-tied.
It's like a chicken when you...
Measurement's beginning now.
Head width 14.5.
Follow the line of the tail.
Two and 2/3 metres - wow!
What's the next stage?
The next stage is to attach the transmitter.
"We'll see, it's probably thick enough."
That's working.
So this is fine tune.
"OK, keep the leg like this, even though it's already released."
It's a tough animal.
And then we release them in the three count like that.
"One, two, three and then everybody just go!"
"Right, OK, ready."
"Wait a second, we've just got rope on the..."
Just undoing the tape around the...
Just undoing the tape on the snout.
Got it.
Unwind.
Carter?
Ben went into the storm drains at first and pierce.
The city doesn't have any cameras down there.
And there are literally thousands of exit points.
"Yeah, Ben knows that."
He's been doing this a while.
This is him.
I'm gonna join you in.
"Listen, Ben barely trusts me so he can't know you're on, okay?"
Understood.
Andy will run a trace.
"Ben, talk to me, man."
I want $2 million.
"Not enough for what I've been through, but it's the most I can carry."
"Ben, you know I can't ask the government for that kind of money."
This is not an official operation.
It's not my problem.
You get me the money or I call bin-Khalid's men.
I took one of their phones at the construction site.
"Please, man, listen, you're strung out"
And you're not thinking straight.
"Eric, I've never been more clear in my life."
Show up at the 7th street metro station with my money in one hour.
An hour?
"Ben, you got to give me more time."
For the government to find me?
"No, you show up on time with the money,"
You get the list.
"If any of those things don't happen, Eric,"
I will sell the list to bin-Khalid's people.
Period.
Ben!
- guinea-pig pie.
- Smells good.
You just accept that?
It's pecan.
How cuckoo do you think my country is?
It's come to this...
"""What's cooking"" and ""smells good"""
gets me in trouble?
"Mom, you're already cooking for tomorrow?"
Don't make a big deal.
My baby's graduating.
He won the award for Integrity and Character.
"""No absents, no tardies,"
"""respectful to students and teachers alike."""
"My school had an award like that, but instead of a sash, that kid got a punch in the mouth."
"Proud of you, though."
"Why do all your stories involve a punch in the face, a shifty European, or a broad who's been around the block?"
That reminds me of when I had to rough up this Italian kid because he didn't want me dating his sister.
She was no nun!
"Jay, can you please take care of the steaks?"
Sure.
"On the eve of your big day, we're celebrating with rib eyes, and you and I are gonna have our first scotch."
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
I've been waiting to open a special bottle.
Huh.
Looks like the mice got into it.
"Hello, hello?"
!
Where's my son?
- Dad!
What I did was...
By artificial means...
I set it - in a way - since I created a sunset.
In color.
"It was fun to fake it, to change its position."
By showing it has set through the colors.
Even though it's here.
What's this?
"That's part of a series, it's called ""The Last Room""."
"It's the last bed I used, in my parent's room."
"It's my last bed, at my parents'."
"The last room, to put it simply."
The last darkroom as well.
If you look closely...
The light on the body...
Isn't coming from the light source you see here.
This light is strange...
Not really...
It is artificial?
"No, it's a lamp here, on the bedside table."
"Well it's a suicidal picture, in a way..."
It's a body that is...
"Mine, I suppose."
But glorious...
And dead...
I mean...
Dead but glorious.
It's also a rather morbid picture...
So I've been told.
It's deliberately morbid.
How can it be artificial...
Since it's about death and...
Shut up!
I got this one!
- Roldy?
- Please don't!
"I am in a great amount of pain, sir!"
Everybody relax.
Just calm down.
Everything is under control.
Tell 'em to turn the plane around.
These two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.
Secretary Fox.
Glad you could make it.
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack of this magnitude?
Not a fuckin' chance.
Who are these people?
Representatives of the different intelligence agencies.
I assume Secretary Whitmore's coming?
Negative.
He's on an ice fishing trip in Glacier Bay.
I'm in charge while he's gone.
"Well, shouldn't he be alerted?"
Isn't this issue of more importance than an ice fishing trip?
Who are you again?
"Dr. John Beecher, Vice Chairman of the NSA."
"Yeah, well, listen, Dr..."
Dipshit.
You've obviously never been ice fishing before.
"- No, I haven't."
"- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating."
The last thing anyone would want while fishing for pike is to be interrupted.
Now back off... and let me do my job.
What's up with the guy with the weird eyes?
Alright mate?
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks you alright?
Got you a gift.
It's still in the shop.
Oh man that's perfect!
'Coz I can just collect it when I get yours next month.
No Laura?
"No, no, she had a work-thing and couldn't shift things around."
Couldn't shift things around?
"I'm not 6, Slade."
I'm only doing this for my mum.
Have you heard from Danny?
"No, has he not called?"
Maybe he couldn't shift things around.
"Hello, I'd just like to say a few words."
"You know it's a celebratory moment for a father when you look at your son, your baby, and you realize that he's reached the age where he can no longer call himself young."
"Because if he is becoming an old fart, then where does that leave me?"
A gravedodger?
"So I'd like you all please, to raise a glass."
- Ignore his crows-feet and his receding hairline.
- Thanks mate.
"And wish a happy birthday, to my little boy."
To Mark.
Happy Birthday!
"Sorry, sorry..."
I wanted to say something too.
"As you all know, we've had some difficult times in the past."
I have two sons.
Mark... and Jesse.
Hey mom...
But only one of them is here every year on his birthday.
"Archaeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the purer faith."
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
"But I take it,"
"I bury it in the sand for a thousand years, it becomes priceless..."
like the Ark.
Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.
"What about your boss, der Fuehrer?"
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see Him together.
I've got nothing better to do.
"Uncle Indy, come back home now!"
Uncle Indy!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you."
Uncle Indy!
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
40.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
My God.
You really are a Chemistry teacher.
You mind?
I was terrible at Chemistry.
I'm more of a Humanities guy.
How did you find me?
We should talk about that.
"It should be much, much harder for people to track you down."
"My PI charged me for three hours, so I seriously doubt it took him more than one."
"So this is what, blackmail?"
"Walter, I'm your lawyer."
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shake-down racket.
I'm a lawyer.
"Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?"
Especially drug dealers.
"So what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?
"By the way, where do you keep the money?"
Is it in your mattress?
"Is it in a jelly jar, buried in the side yard?"
"This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up, but he won't be the last."
"And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit!
Right now you're Fredo.
Sire.
The palace has canceled Our King.
"Ludovic, we are the Palace."
Anything he has filmed will be censored.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lloyd."
But think a little.
His story and my film will never see the light.
"Once again, my footage was being thrown away forever."
But I could not blame him.
"After all, a king has no fate in his hand."
"At least, so I thought."
"Yes, that's fine, but we have to agree with Turkish security."
"Yes, our versions must coincide."
Nobody knows.
"Well, no one knew about the king's identity."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Sire, I have the official version proposed by the Palace."
"We left Istanbul yesterday, accompanied by Turkish security."
And our escape in the Balkans has never happened.
Mr. Duncan Lloyd?
"I, King Nicolas III, King of Belgium..."
I authorize her to do what she wants
With all the pictures and sounds
Which he recorded from the day we were at Mini Europe.
"Any pictures, sire?"
Yup.
Are you sure?
Agree.
His Majesty.
Do you think this trip is due to chance or destiny?
It must be fate.
I want my daughter.
"Agent Collins,"
Mr. Van Sciver will see you now.
Will you follow me?
"Sure, thank you."
"My mom is in that ambulance, let's go!"
What can I do for the FBI?
"Well, I'm just following up on a case."
What do you know about a young man named Zack Starr?
That name isn't familiar.
What about Krista Starr?
- His wife?
- Sister.
"I'm sorry, what is this about?"
"Zack Starr was murdered and the case was being handled by a local detective, a cop named Brian Boone."
Looks like Krista Starr was involved in the investigation.
"- Well, have you talked to her?"
"- No, she's missing."
"You wouldn't know where I could find her by any chance, would you?"
- Do you say Boone?
- Yeah.
Is this the same detective who is being accused of this cross country killing spree?
Yeah.
And you're handling that case.
"Well, it might be tied to the Starr murder."
"You think it might be 2 murders, him and his sister?"
No.
She isn't dead.
"In fact, her uncle saw her recently, just doesn't know how to get ahold of her."
- You spoke to the uncle?
- Uh-uh.
And he tells me that you and Krista know each other pretty well.
They all look like blocks of wood
One has a flat nose and funny eyes I really give it to her
Come and play
Are you kidding?
Si Sun has just arrived
Then you come
Come
Next is a clerk from the Western Street followed by a factory worker from Kwun Tong
Welcome them
Do you know where No. 196A is?
Go straight ahead and turn right
Thank you
Always big
Nine is small
A hundred dollars on small
"The bigger the bet, the more you win"
"Big lt must be big, open it up"
Excuse me
"Place your bets, open, small"
How come it's always small?
"Bad luck, what happened?"
Tough luck
"Brother Shing, what are we going to bet on next?"
What else?
Big
Big...
One hundred and fifty for small
Place your bets...
Open up...
"Place your bets, open 1 , 3, 4."
Small
"Pay up... lt's always small, tough luck"
"Give me $200 each, for your own protection."
And I'll forget the insult.
You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me!
Otherwise the cops will come to your house.
And your family will be ruined.
Of course if I'm wrong about how much you stole
- I'll take a little less.
"And by less, I only mean - a hundred bucks less."
Now don't refuse me.
"Understand, paisan?"
I understand.
My friends and I share all the money.
"So first, I have to talk to them."
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.
Don't be afraid to tell them!
600 bucks...
Suppose we don't pay?
"You know his gang, Tessio."
Real animals.
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci work this neighborhood.
"He's got connections with the cops, too."
We have to pay him.
$200 each...everybody agreed?
Why do we have to pay him?
"Vito, leave this to us."
"He's one person, we're three."
"He's got guns, we've got guns."
Why should we give him the money we sweated for?
This is his neighborhood!
I know two bookies who don't give anything to Fanucci.
Who?
My intuition?
Perhaps it's time you showed everyone what you are really like.
"Your feelings, your sense of humour and maybe even your flaws."
My flaws were already exposed by the media.
Nicolas the Humble?
Humbleness is an honourable trait.
Whatever they say.
Sire.
Did you manage to contact the Queen?
I couldn't get through to the palace.
- Prime Minister?
- He is not responding.
On purpose?
- We are ready.
"- Carlos, what is he doing here?"
- We are not going anywhere.
- Why is that?
The Security Service won't let us.
What again?
You have to find a solution.
We must get back home.
I'll try and reason with the Security Service.
Excuse me.
Maybe the Ambassador will be able to help us.
I'll go fetch the luggage.
"Sire, I will go and check if there is signal upstairs."
Where is the Ambassador?
- Sire.
- I can't concentrate.
The concourse...
Conc...
The concourse of cosmic and political circumstances...
I'm still your mother.
"No, my mother's dead."
I went to her funeral when I was six.
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.
"She was trying to use me, like you are now."
Why?
She wants an army.
An army?
I want an alliance.
"No, what you want is revenge."
- This isn't about me.
-(SCOFFS)
It's about putting an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another.
"This city may be surrounded by a wall, but it doesn't have to be a prison."
- I think that's a bit extreme.
-Hmm?
"I mean, the Faction System isn't perfect, but it's hardly a prison."
Let me guess.
Erudite.
I was Erudite.
You willing to kill Jeanine?
Absolutely.
"When I was married to Marcus, I knew her well."
"And believe me, there's nothing she isn't capable of."
But I think you already know that.
"Tris, we can't trust her."
Or maybe she knows...
"We're on the same side, Tris."
I'm Factionless because I don't fit into any one faction.
And you're Divergent because you belong to too many.
But we're both a threat to Jeanine.
"My people are ready for war, if that's what it takes."
I think it's just a question of joining them together...
legato.
Simplicity is the hardest thing.
It's the final thing.
"Well, er..."
"- Next week, then?"
- Yes.
"Good day, Your Highness."
"Monsieur, Baroness Dudevant is here."
Baroness Dudevant?
I don't think I know her.
"Well, send her in."
This is the first time I've found a use for my title.
You are incredible!
"I only need a minute of your time, then I'll go."
Very well.
I'll give you exactly one minute.
"I am leaving Pa... (PLAYS ""MINUTE WALTZ"")"
I am leaving Paris.
You can't have failed to notice I've been pursuing you.
I'm in love with you.
I don't know you at all...
(STOPS PLAYING)
"I don't know you at all, but I know this:"
you are great.
You have made a single instrument speak the language of God.
"And I wanted to learn it from your lips, you see."
"Anyway, you..."
"You don't want me and... it's become complicated, like everything between two people."
"It seems to me a pity, because it could have been so simple."
I'm begging you to give this up.
"I know that you're in need, with your children and your mother's funeral."
"- Oh, yes, of course."
"- Excuse us, darling."
- Sure.
"Dexter, I haven't said it before."
I will now.
I think your courage was admirable.
And I have you to thank for saving my father's life.
"Now, I realise the great risks you took, and I'll always appreciate it."
"I'm glad I was able to help, Michael."
And that we all got back safely.
"Well, there is one more favour I'd like to ask of you."
That being?
"From now on, stay away from my wife."
Michael.
"Look, whatever you're thinking-"
My suspicions are groundless?
- Yes.
- Good.
Then it will make it that much easier for you.
You know something?
This conversation is for the royal birds.
If you'll excuse me.
"Michael, why did you do that?"
"Oh, my God, Amanda, isn't it obvious?"
"No, it isn't obvious to me."
"Well, how do you think I feel when you throw your arms around?"
"Prince Michael, I have some good news."
Your father has regained consciousness for the first time.
- You may see him for a few moments.
- Thank you.
I'll see him alone.
Michael.
What's the last thing we want?
No panic.
Right.
"Okay, is the tutorial over?"
Let's get in there.
Out of here.
"Beers, is that you?"
"It's Janet Lewis, Beers."
You haven't been answering your phone.
Everything all right?
Beers?
"Oh, my God."
"You're right, that's not Beers."
But it sure looks like him.
He's not anybody anymore.
Looks like a stab wound.
"All right, it's time to shut down the airport."
Not a problem.
We've been unofficially shut down for the last 20 minutes.
No vehicles in or out until this storm ends.
"His gun's gone, Tony."
Great.
"We're snowed in here with an airport full of cranky passengers, a dead fake air marshal, and his killer somewhere on the loose, with a knife and a gun."
"Anybody else feel like they're playing ""Clue""?"
Unbelievable.
"These shots will be coming to you from Jake's phone, McGee."
"We'll send them to Ducky, too."
I think he's gonna be busy for a while.
"""And it ain't a fit night out for man nor beast."""
"Yet I'm the one who had to get out and push the van, Shakespeare."
"That was W.C. Fields, Mr. Palmer, in The Fatal Glass of Beer."
And I predict you will be pushing it again on the way back.
You scared me.
Hey!
You scared me.
"Hey, hey."
Why are you acting like this?
You came recently.
Yes.
"You were born in 1980, year of the tiger, right?"
"Your parents didn't register your birth early or late, right?"
Do you look at any half good-looking man with that kind of nauseating gaze...?
Are you a crazed fan of pretty faced men?
Fine.
"Watch, watch."
Watch as much as you want.
I'm going to sleep.
I'll hear the good news first.
The good news is...
Synced  ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Blue Sea @ Viki
Ah dah~
Ah dah~
"Say, ""hello"""
That's how we greet.
We've already forgotten that place a long time ago.
We can't remember that distant time long ago when life first sprouted in the sea to when we stepped onto the land to live. (THE LEGEND OF THE BLUE SEA)
What is the sea to all of you?
How many times a day do you think of the sea?
What are you doing?
Did you stay up all night like that?
How old are you that you've fallen for a celebrity?
Are you a crazy fan girl?
Stop watching and give it here.
Hello?
"Nah, that's not a bullet wound."
"Damn it, Lyle."
"Yes, it is."
Then where's the bullet?
I haven't found it.
"You don't have a bullet, you don't have a bullet wound."
She could've hit anything falling into the water.
"A rock, a nail-- anything."
But she didn't.
It wasn't suicide.
It was murder.
"Melvin, I'm startin' to worry about ya."
Beautiful dead girl naked under a sheet.
Must have a way of makin' a man think strange.
Sam.
"Don't lose your cool, Sam."
"Melvin, this is nothin' more than an unfortunate case of suicide."
Bury the poor girl.
"If it was suicide, where's the gun?"
She wasn't shot.
I'm the coroner.
I say she was.
"If it was a suicide, the gun is probably in the water near the dock."
Maybe the gun's in the lake.
If she shot herself-- and I don't believe that she did-- then the gun must have fallen into the water.
That lake's near freezing'.
You want me to send a man into that icy water lookin' for a gun that's not even there.
"If the gun is there, then you're right about the suicide."
And then...
I'll bury her.
"Okay, Melvin."
I'll look for the gun.
I'm a huge fan.
He's downstairs.
Gareth watson?
Yes.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm karen.
"In fact, there was an expedition"
"Mounted by hadrian in 121 a.D.,"
But by the time his legions
"Got to salisbury plain,"
The druids had hidden them.
And no roman histories of gaul
Give the slightest hint whether or not
Any other evidence was ever found.
But...
"If there is a map,"
It'll be the most extraordinary find
Since they very rarely used parchment.
"You don't suppose it's on oak bark, do you?"
He's not due until 10:13.
How did your colleague
Come by this map anyway?
He isn't my colleague.
He's an agent of the gural nataz.
How are they involved?
"In 60 seconds,"
"A courier dressed in a blue trench coat,"
Carrying a titanium briefcase
Will step off the train
And step through those doors.
A car will meet him at the curb.
I feel like it's my job to tell you the honesty.
Nobody else has.
Nobody else can.
"It's rare to find these things out, and also upsetting."
These little glasses.
Let me see these things.
"Oh, yeah, we have the exact same affectation."
Mm-mmh...
Ah...
Emily.
Erm...
Seems like a less than ideal place to carry on.
Is it 'cause you have a girlfriend?
You mentioned her in an interview.
It's because it's gauche to grope and kiss in public.
"You really don't remember meeting me, do you?"
I had a photo shoot in that same place when my first book came out.
I gave you a copy of it.
"You acted like you were better than some first-time author nobody had ever heard of, even though you were probably still in college."
"I wrote my number in it, twice."
I really honestly don't remember meeting you.
"Sorry, but I remember you now."
"Oh, of course you do."
OK.
I'll call you.
(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
ASHLEY:
Where were you?
Out.
"So, my meeting with Ike today..."
"Oh, so he's Ike now?"
- With Zimmerman.
"""with the $12.95."
"And I got away with it."""
I had a gangster situation happen to me where I had to be gangster in the situation.
You just had to be.
"Sometimes you just gotta, you know, buck up and do what you gotta do."
I was trying to get a cab in February.
"The cabdriver saw me, looked at me, and then sped the hell off."
But he got caught at the red light that was right in front of me.
"So I was like, ""Oh, snap!"" So you know what I did?"
I went Denzel Washington Training Day on his ass right there.
I was like...
"""Okay, all right."""
"""Yeah, my nigga, my nigga."""
"""Yeah, so you're telling me"
"""you were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""That's what you're saying, right, huh?"
"""You were just gonna drive--"
"""That's what you saying."
Huh?
"""You were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""It's negative 20 degrees out here."
"""My fingers are about to fall off my hand,"
"""but you was about to drive the fuck off."
"""That's what you telling me, right?"
"""Okay, well, let me tell you something, Abu."
"""That's right."
"I said it, Abu."
"""You just live here."
I run shit here!
"King Kong ain't got shit on me!"""
He just ran the light.
He ain't want nothing to do with it.
What are you doing?
"Before it was even time to go home, he was pushing me into the car then pulling me out."
It was ridiculous.
But Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday night.
We agreed.
"Of course, when Friday night came around, Henry stood me up."
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.
"He really liked you, too."
That's all he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date that night.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
"Tommy, what the fuck?"
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
"Who the hell do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?"
"Slow down, alright."
I forgot. I thought it was next week.
"It was this Friday and you agreed, so you're a liar!"
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you were gonna stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
What did you expect?
Let me make it up to you...
Karen.
I'll think about it.
"I remember, she was screaming on the street, and I mean loud."
-But she looked good.
"So, he must be around them."
Who is the new entrant in their family?
He is my friend Kalyan.
He can't be the thief.
He is memory loss patient.
I'm at peace in this condition.
Something is wrong.
Thanks partner.
How are you?
Who is your partner!
Do you know where will I be tomorrow?
How many people are so honest in their duty like your son?
Catch me before December 16.
You will catch him for sure.
You are his right partner.
You are my right partner.
"What do you say, Swami?"
"First, let's have tea."
"Later, we can deal with the money."
Thief...!
Money is more important to me.
"Yes, my son is a thief."
He became a thief for kick.
"He was in search of kick, but he didn't get it."
But it came looking for him.
We are Venkat  Swapna.
We have a daughter.
I work in a private company.
My salary is Rs.10000.
"Every morning at 8, I take the lunch box, drop my daughter at the school, catch a running bus, go to office, come back in the evening, play with my daughter,"
"sometimes go to theatre, count our savings several times and feel safe, this is my life."
We've no complaints on anyone.
All happiness belongs to her.
Don't speak anymore with Judith!
Watch out David!
"Dr. Martel, do you hear me?"
- His name is...
- David.
David?
"If you can hear me, blink your eyes."
Get it out!
- Intracranial nerves?
- There's no broken hematoma.
Scanning?
I want it in my office.
No sweat.
No tears.
"They still need eye drops, or they'll end like him."
What are they doing?
The guilty deserve punishment!
They are OK.
What do you mean?
They are the ones who did it?
Let me show you something.
Are you crazy?
These children don't know pain.
"That's why they're very dangerous to other children, but mainly to their own selves."
Can we cure it?
I'd never seen anything like this.
They suffer from an unknown illness.
"Citizens, I have to tell you that..."
"These children, they suffer from an unknown illness."
Tragic events and strange facts happen for months and kill innocent people.
This tragedy... shows ... the threat posed by crime.
- It'll look great on you!
It's a real guy-puller.
Do you know how many times I've been fucked in this dress?
Every time I go out:
"Whoa, someone's there."
- Champagne?
"- I just need to get organised, OK?"
Whatever.
I'm going out.
What about the washing up?
This is not a hotel.
Careful you don't start sounding like my mother.
I could have tried harder to find Johan.
"But hey, he was the one who knew where I lived."
(light classical music)
"Obviously, this was just another adventure of his,   and I wasn't crying over him again."
If it could be a bit more...
"Good, hard, honest work can take your mind off anything."
I'd designed the costumes for a small play that was a huge success.
"One night, this French guy was visiting the theatre."
...at the end of Act II I fell down the stairs.
Everyone was laughing.
- This is Pierre Gaultier.
- The top name at the Palais Royale.
"This is Miss Olsen, who plays the captain's first wife."
- How lovely.
- It's an honour to meet you.
- And who is this lovely creature?
"- This is Anna, our costume designer."
- Enchanté.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
Mr. Gaultier is artistic director at the Palais Royale.
Look at that.
Bobbies on bikes.
Everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
"Unfortunately, a million of extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould."
"Operation Merlin couldn't deal with him, either."
What do you want from me?
You're going to kill him for me.
"- Niece and nephew, right?"
- Yeah.
"I haven't even got them any presents, though."
A bit behind on computer games and stuff.
Should've talked to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games -"
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John."
That'd be irresponsible.
That's not their age range at all.
- How did it go with Lenny?
"- Pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"- That's what you did in the army, right?"
- Wrong.
- That was legal.
- Yeah.
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"- Shut up, Calum."
- I'm just saying.
"At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it, not just some scared kid in a trench."
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"- Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
- OK.
That made me so happy.
"I was really, really happy."
That's why I'm here right now.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
I wonder if that person still reads my novels today.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
"I see, so Izumi-sensei, you too..."
"""Sensei""?"
"Oh, n-nothing!"
I knew you wrote novels on the web!
I-I see.
But to think I'd see the day where I could talk to you like this.
"Big Brother, why are you bothering me?"
You should just leave me alone.
I'm just...
Do I trouble you?
T-Trouble...
It's because you're my little sister.
And Mom asked me to take good care of you.
Is that your reason?
I still don't know what counts as taking good care of you.
So I just do things that I feel would count as such.
I don't get it at all.
"Other than that, I'm just lonely, after all."
I'd like to eat meals together with my cute little sister.
"And I want to take care of her, too."
"Even a troublesome little sister like this, who hardly ever talks to you?"
So you were aware of that.
I want us to get along.
Because we're family.
Are we a family?
Of course.
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defence that money can buy.
"Yeah, but, Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
It's on your head.
You're not supposed to double up on vitamin A.
It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
You want your exponential growth guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?
Marion's dead.
"Yes, I know."
And me!
And me!
I'm sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
Uh-oh.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?
"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:
"A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher."
"In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
They made their calculations in the map room?
This morning.
"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp."
"The Well of the Souls, huh?"
"Come, come, look."
Look here...
look.
Sit down.
"Come, sit down."
What is it?
This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
"What about the height of the staff, though?"
Did Belloq get it off of here?
Yes.
It is here.
"I know I'm new here, but aren't dinosaurs extincted?"
- This one's about to be.
"- Heatwave, wait!"
"Look, if anyone sees you taking down that dino on your own, there goes your cover and your mission."
It's attracted to the light!
"Chase, take your lights!"
That got us attention.
Now what?
We need to lure him somewhere with no people around.
"Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue!"
He's following but we still gonna need an assist.
I'm comm-link to Chief in.
Rescue headquarters.
Go ahead.
"Dad, OK, first, don't worry I'm with the Rescue Bots!"
What?
Who gave you permission to...
They did it.
I mean...
"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this but the Rescue Bots aren't robots, they're from another planet, they're aliens!"
How long have you known?
"Wait, you know?"
"Cody, where are you?"
"Chief Burns, if I may, we're headed westbound to Lake Street with the dinosaur in pursuit."
"A dinosaur, again?"
"Cody, you're driving, are you?"
No!
Why did we take the old squad car?
That's why.
I'll explain later.
"Cody, you jacked my ride?"
"Listen, the T-rex likes lights."
"The photos are reflections of one another, right?"
"Reflections in lakes, reflections in people's eyes."
Pictures of people taking pictures.
"There were, uh--"
He was taking pictures of people taking pictures?
Yeah.
"I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I actually owe you one, Jack."
Thank you.
"So you'll be getting me those files, then?"
"Oh, I'll get back to you on that one."
[dialing phone]
"Dozer, I think I know why the Chameleon killed Walker."
"So I'm standing in line, which is already annoying enough, and this chick--"
Are you listening to me?
"No, no, baby, I'm sorry."
I just...
I got stuff on my mind.
"So this chick, she takes a step back, and she steps on my foot, right?"
And...
Yeah?
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check my messages.
"So, was I right?"
Give me a second.
Yep.
Chameleon was carrying a camera.
Shoot it to me.
So she was taking pictures of a building?
She was staking out the place.
These pictures could've been taken months ago.
"Well, maybe not."
Marla said that Walker was adding last-minute photos to the exhibit.
"- Oh, my..."
And you really are serious about getting yourself killed?
I figure it's people who visit me today as well.
"Small world, cos uh..."
me and Vi hate those guy's guts.
"Two months ago Violet ran into them, and they locked her in a dumpster."
It looks like someone had taken a life out of her.
Is that all they did?
"You mean, locked her in that trashcan?"
"Well, yea, I mean that's all she told me."
What else would they...?
Russ is such an ass.
"Thinks he's smart, but he's not."
Nothin' to say this time?
Maybe you've learned your lesson after all.
I'd like a something' for you to tell your boss.
In this fuckin' economy that chicken shit must be pretty hard up.
"to send a little... cunt like you, to do a men's job."

"Like you could do better, Zamboni-boy."
"Not in that butt-ugly uniform, I couldn't."
Did you get Hello Kitty to sponsor you?
- L'll just get Dad to fire you.
"- No way, your dad loves me."
"Besides, you like to stare at my butt when I'm working."
- That's disgusting.
- Is not.

Yes.
There's such a thing as evil.

The Second Coming.

"""Turning and turning in the widening gyre..."
"""the falcon cannot hear the falconer."
"""Things fall apart."
"""The center cannot hold."
"""Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."
"""And everywhere the ceremony ofinnocence is lost."
"""The best lack all conviction."
"And the worst are full of passionate intensity. """
So you know...?
So now what?
"The same old story, this time I am the king and you are the queen."
Now I need to decide..
..whether I should kill him to get you...
Or shall I get you and then kill him.
He will die and you will belong to me.
It was me who made the mistake.
Spare his life.
So much concern for him?
I have come back only for you.
- There is a difference.
- What's the difference?
You took a life and he gave his life to come back.
You have to also kill to get love.
I want to change this story.
You want to change it?
How will you change it?
I don't want anyone's blood on my conscience.
Blood...
Why blood?
He can fall from a tall building.
Or..
"..he could get electrocuted, while making toast."
"I promise you, I'll give you a right to choose."
And what if you can have me?
"Then you won't kill him, right?"
Yeah?
The one who had disarmed him is now his armor.
This time he won't die because of me.
"Okay, done!"

They were born when I lived in Florida with Bram.
"Don't you know Bram, my husband?"
-No.
You helped him go into hiding.
His name was Henk Meyer then.
1m90 and skinny as a rake.
I really don't remember him.
He was always hungry but he still gave me his distribution coupons.
There were so many.
He looked me up straight after the war.
Then we got married.
He'd be kicking me at least once a week during the night.
He'd have nightmares about Krauts and camps.
"When the Cold War started with Berlin and the Russians, it got really bad."
He kicked me out of the bed every night.
"Without being aware of it, the darling."
So we went to America.
"At least, there was an ocean in between."
"Yes, I heard you left the country."
"When the children were adults, they went to Israel."
We didn't.
"But we did come back, so we're halfway now."
"Nowhere at home, but still happy."
Very happy.
"No other news, and you?"
Do you ever think of Arie?
Arie...
It's easy to idealize.
-Would you have been happier?
I am happy.
But Arie's no longer there.
"On Remembrance Day, I sometimes think of what guys like Arie missed out on... after the war."
Said he had a plan that would get him out of the mob.
I guess he was wrong.
They found him.
What did my brother mean to you?
Everything.
Take me to his place.
I want to get to know him.
Take you to his place?
Are you crazy?
You show up and start this mess that almost gets us killed.
"You don't have a clue who you're dealing with, do you?"
"If you wanna kill yourself, be my guest."
But who gave you the right to risk my life?
I can't go home.
I can't go to work.
You painted a big red target on my back.
Where's the check?
Mikhail used to say we could never stay in one Place too long.
We have to move all the time.
It's time for us to move.
- They'll find us here.
- The cable didn't have to die.
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before.
"They won't stop until you're dead, too."
You can't go to the police.
You can't hide.
"Lvan and his boss, Kirov, are relentless."
"All right, I'll bring you to your brother's home."
This explains why Mikhail picked a bank in Nice.

- Maybe his name is Lobangulu.
- Loban-what?
"Lobangulu, king of the Zulu, from Honolulu-."
- What's with you?
- Nothing.
Just because Dad came all the way from Israel doesn't mean I believe that Morn had an affair with Muhammad Ali.
"No Maurice, no Boris, it's all bull."
"Are Mom's lies about Grandma and Grandpa bull, too?"
You're just afraid to find him.
"Okay, enough."
"Anyway, I left a message for Isabelle Moretti."
Then leave the rest of the world for me.
"What, Muraaki?"
Can you only fight?
Only the one who can fight can love.
Can fight for love.
Can die for love.
What is going to happen tonight?
Is the sky going crazy?
Don't question nature.
This is happening..
..because you are about to belong to me forever and forever.
Such a ferocious storm happens only once in a thousand years.
There will be only one Saiba and Jilaan in a thousand years.
The moon shall yield a sword.
You are the moon and I am a dark night.
How did I get so attached to you?
Trust your heart.
Does your heart beat to my name?
How would it?
Muraakis don't possess a heart.
Saiba belongs to me.
And she shall always belong to me.
I had said so.
You shall die in Paathar's waters.
So Muraakis don't possess a heart?
We gave you a heart and then stabbed it.
We killed you with deceit.
Saiba did.
"No trust, no love."
"Don't commit this sin, Kaabir."
Don't.
It is no sin to kill for love.
Not a dime.
"Honest, Sarge, they all owe me."
"Listen, right next to Zimmerman's name, put ""KEOZ."""
"I'll know what it means-- ""Keep Eye On Zimmerman."""
"All right, dismissed."
"Hey, Sarge, I got a couple letters for you."
"Oh, those finance companies must have radar."
What's this?
"Oh, this is a joker."
"This is addressed to the house I used to live in way before the war, when I was still a civilian."
"Hey, Sarge, maybe you've been drafted, huh?"
"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
"Oh, no."
Ten years.
"What is it, Ernie?"
It's just not possible.
Ten years.
"Hey, Ernie, come on back to us Earth people."
The squad I led in WWII-- way before I even met you guys-- they're having a reunion.
A reunion?
"Yeah, I forgot all about it."
"You see, we were pinned down on a beach in the Marianas, and we swore if we ever got out of it alive, we were going to meet ten years from that day for the biggest, fanciest banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria."
The Waldorf-Astoria?
"Man, what a crazy barrack."
(laughter)
"Oh, what a bunch of deadbeats they were."
"Wait a second, wait, hold this."
I got a picture of 'em in here someplace.
Get a load of that.
That's me holding the flag.
BARBELLA:
Let's see.
- Whoa!
Whoo!
Drink this.
Drink this.
"Now, just to be clear, these aren't steroids, right?"
"No, no, no, no."
Of course not.
These are performance-enhancing supplements.
"Okay, so how long before I start to notice something?"
This is the good stuff.
You'll feel it almost immediately.
"But I should warn you, you may experience some mood swings... some irrational thinking here and there... but it is nothing compared to the long-term effects."
- Which are what?
- You ever punched a guy so hard in the eye he swallowed it?
I'll get some water.
"- How you feel, man?"
You drunk?
- Yeah.
I'm pretty wasted.
- Great.
So what do we smash first?
- I wanna smash a crate.
"- Yeah, a crate on his back."
- Why don't you punch me?
- Punch you?
Punch you?
- What?
"I'm probably gonna get punched a lot in the tournament, right?"
- Yeah.
All right.
"- Okay, that's a good point."
- Let's punch him.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
And that's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
"Right after I got here, I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup."
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
What's up?
Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive.
You piece of shit!
you motherfucker!
Look at me!
I always wanted to be a gangster.
To me beinga gangsterwasbetterthan  being president of the United States.
Even before I went to the cabstand for an after-school job
IknewIwantedtobe partofthem .
it meant being somebody ina neighborhoodfullofnobodies.
They weren't like anybody else.
Hi.
You look really nice.
"Oh, thanks."
Where do you wanna go on our first date back?
I got to be in early.
"I got curfew, you know."
"Well, we were invited over to Amy and Ricky's."
What?
"Yeah, won't that be fun?"
I've never actually been over there before.
"Yeah, me neither."
And that's because we're not really friends with Ricky and Amy.
"Yes, we are."
We've known them for years.
That's where you want to go?
I was going to take us out for dinner or something.
"That's okay, I think they're just going to order a pizza or something."
They can't really go out because of John.
Great.
It'll be fun.
I don't think it will.
They're married.
They have a baby.
"Well, don't you want to get married and have a baby someday?"
Someday.
Not today.
Not tonight.
Tonight I just want to spend some time with you.
We don't need to spend so much time alone.
It only makes us want to have sex.
"I'm always going to want to have sex with you, so I'm just going to have to wait until you tell me you want to have sex with me."
"All right, let's go."
"This were the old way, this mean six kadam high."
-About 72 inches.
-Wait!
"""And take back one kadam to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is."""
You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.
Are you absolutely sure?
Belloq's staff is too long.
They're digging in the wrong place.
I am the monarch of the sea
I am the ruler of the..
Bad dates.
I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.
Archaeology is not an exact science.
It does not deal in time schedules.
The führer is not a patient man.
"He demands constant reports, and he expects progress."
You led me to believe...
Nothing!
I made no promises.
I only said it looked very favorable.
"Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct."
"Boy, they're not kidding, are they?"
What time does the sun hit the map room?
At about 9:00 in the morning.
"Not much time, then."
Where are they digging for the Well of the Souls?
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.
"Let's go, come on."
Sallah.
Sallah!
They're here.
- Yeah.
"- And you, just find out if anything unusual happened on the floor last 24 hours."
I'm taking all the new chips off the floor.
- Whoa.
That's big.
- You got a better idea?
- I can stick around and help.
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was getting through to you.
Go home.
Okay.
I'm gonna be here another 20 minutes.
I gotta meet my accountant.
Go home.
Okay.
Here.
"Hey, um, tell the cage, uh, we're gonna switch out the chips."
"Yes, all of them."
"Ed, it looks like the only counterfeits are hundreds."
"So, what's going on?"
We're just changing our chips... to get our players' feedback on our color combinations.
"- Well, I prefer burgundy and taupe."
"- And you, sir?"
Only color I care about is green.
Know what I'm sayin'?
"Ed, they took us for over a million."
Percentage of counterfeits stayed consistent.
"What, they have a million of our money?"
Million point two.
"Also, I looked into anything unusual on the floor yesterday."
"Only thing was a blackjack dealer, Jerry Smoltz, who was dealing 75% winners for three straight hours."
-Oh boy.
Man I can't believe you're gonna try to solve your problems.
By letting your friends make all the sacrifices for you.
I thought your father and I raised you better than that.
[Scoffs] I didn't make them do anything.
They did it on their own.
Oh yeah.
I'm sure Lilly really wants to give up her opportunity to go to Stanford.
Come on.
It's just for this year.
We'll go together next year.
If she gets in again.
And there's no guarantee that she will and you darn well know that.
[Softly] Keep it down.
They'll hear you.
I'm in your head!
[Loudly] I can talk as loud as I want to!
"[Groaning] All right, all right."
-Jeez!
I'm annoying sometimes.
-Tell me about it.
And what about Jesse?
Do you really think he's happy about being despised.
By millions of people for breaking my heart?
Ha-ha!
You said my heart.
We have the same heart and I know it's not broken.
"What do I have to say to that, huh?"
I'll tell you what I have to say.
If you go on letting your friends do this for you.
Sure they seem okay with it now.
But deep down inside they're going to hate you for it.
Two gyms and a cheese shop.
And he's going to Turks.
12C?
"Oh, my God, we're 12A and B."
"Oh, we'll be fine."
No.
You'll die.
Would it be awful to change seats?
Not as awful as composting right before you come to the airport.
Ugh!
"Okay, wish me luck."
"Jake, real quick."
The metabolism-- how does she eat like that?
"Pretty, isn't it?"
"Uh, oh."
"Yes, dear."
"It's just lovely, mm-hmm."
"It's lovely how it turned a one-hour drive into three, soaked a brand-new pair of my shoes right down to the toes."
Yeah.
Simply spectacular.
"Well, at least we'll be getting away from it for the holiday."
I'm going to Calgary.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the unexpected weather conditions, all incoming and outgoing flights are being temporarily delayed."
"Every effort is being made to clear the runways, but until the snow lets up, everyone get comfortable-- could be an hour... could be more."
Ooh.
Excuse me.
"Hey, I said excuse me."
"Yeah, I heard you."
"Is there a problem, sir?"
I don't know.
Is there?
"I heard my wife say ""excuse me"" just now."
What's the difference.
"So, what's this I hear about you and Jordan?"
- l can't believe this.
- You know they had sex.
- Rayanne.
- That's what I heard.
You heard it too?
"God, just shoot me."
- We could probably arrange that.
- You mean you didn't have sex?
"Angela come on, come."
You've got to start thinking of this as a positive thing.
This can help you get to the next level with Jordan.
Did he at least think you were a good kisser?
- l don't know.
- Did you like the way he kissed?
They weren't the kind of kisses you can actually evaluate.
I ntroductory kisses.
You should have had sex with him.
Where were you when the gun went off?
"Mom, it wasn't anywhere near us."
We barely heard it.
We have to worry about our kids being shot in school.
How did it come to this.
This is horrible.
This is a disgrace to all of us--
- That's too much.
- l'm sorry honey.
I'm going to say it in this meeting.
I am. I mean it.
We have to draw the line somewhere.
We just can't keep accepting the total deterioration--
That doesn't matter.
You said you weresn't 21.
There's a big difference between 21 and 16.
"Look, I'm sorry."
"You're beautiful, but I have to leave."
I feel really guilty.
I wish I had met you in high school.
I wouldn't have liked you then.
That's true.
If you really have to go
I want to give you something to remember me by.
And you can tell Jim he can put me in his movie.
Don't do that.
- Dad!
- What the hell is going on here?
That's right.
"Run, you little sick."
"Oh, shit, the script."
- You're gonna go to your mother's.
- You don't understand me.
I don't want to.
You're gonna go to your mother's.
You can't deal with being attracted to your own daughter.
Do not try to pull transference on me.
I invented transference.
"I called the girl, but she's already in Connecticut with her mom so she can't get the screenplay."
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- You gotta break into that place.
I can't break into a therapy office.
Why?
What difference does it make?
You gotta get in there.
Do you have conscience or not?
You don't answer your mobile.
Nobody knows where you are.
I'm nervous!
Have you forgotten that we're going to Paris?
I can't go to Paris now.
Take some rest there without me for a few days.
No.
- I have an important meeting.
- No!
You promised to spend two days with me.
Why are you sitting here?
"Who are you meeting with, if it's not a secret?"
It's not a secret.
I'm meeting with Garik.
- With Garik...
- Yes.
This meeting is more important to me than to him.
"So Garik can't wait, can he?"
Why do you react in such a way?
Lets go.
- What?
"- Let's go, I say!"
I'll give you a lift.
His place is on my way.
"Close the bag, let's go."
I got used to your lies.
I got used to the fact that you have affairs with other women.
But I can't get used to your cynicism and your perverse cruelty.
What women?
What cynicism?
"You've been telling me about meetings with your best friend, your former classmate Garik for a long time."
People have always had the potential to change in horrible ways.
Who in particular are you thinking of?
You or me?
"Mariá, everything might be over as early as tomorrow, but I think it's been worth it."
- There's Smithy with two others!
"- Emiliano, Smithy's coming with two others."
"- Yes, that's Smithy."
- Are you sure?
- Who are they?
- We couldn't have found anyone better.
- Is Carrasco here?
- I'm glad you're back.
"- Yes, he's here and waiting for you."
- We were in the same cell.
I'm Hidalgo.
"Hello, Smithy."
Is it really you or is it your ghost?
Of course it's me.
You know good old Smithy's body.
Ghosts can disguise themselves.
You scared us.
"This time I nearly died, but at a certain point I said to myself,"
"""You're going to make it, because you want to be embraced by Mariá again. """
"If you should ever leave your Leopard, a scrawny European is waiting for you."
"With you, I'd end up as a tea-drinking landlady."
- So you've cheated death once more.
- As always.
This is Hidalgo.
He used to fight in the north.
That's Joaquín.
He wants to go and see his family.
He's leaving today.
Athos saw me.
There's no going back now.
"My dear fellow, that would be treason and foolhardy."
Louis is already dying.
"I hope you are not having doubts, Feron?"
You are asking me to kill my own brother!
"If you don't, then he will discover your betrayal and hang you."
"And if he doesn't, I will hang you!"
Thank you.
You will kill Aramis and the King.
Very well.
(LAUGHS)
"Now we found a nice spot in the shade, we can wait."
Properly.
"Come on, come on."
"That's it, good... (WHISPERS) Please be good, please be good, please be good."
(SNIFFS)
"Oh, this could turn out to be a good day after all."
I imagine the General's aide will be a little while longer yet.
(LAUGHS)
"How many battles did we fight, eh?"
(CHUCKLES)
- Too many.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
"We've served our country, often and well."
"So if we are rewarded with the odd mission like this,"
I won't complain.
"In that case, I'd like to propose a toast."
"To easy missions, well earned."
To easy missions well earned.
Ooh.
No more shakes.
Fine!
Force me to live with this obscene obesity.
"You know, Aunt Zelda is so unfair."
"I know it seems unfair now, but someday when you're older and wiser, you'll be able to look back on all this and get revenge."
Hey... one more shake wouldn't hurt and it would be wrong to waste perfectly good guar gum.
"Hilda, here's an interesting news item."
"""Everything Emporium president missing."""
"Oh, look, Larry King likes the new Ludlum novel."
Did you have anything to do with this?
No.
Robert Ludlum has his own publicist.
"Oh, you mean the Everything Emporium president?"
Yes.
"He was bugging me, so I turned him into one."
Ginger beer?
A bug?
"Hilda, you've got to change him back."
He is in a perfectly humane situation now that I gave him air holes.
SABRINA:
I wonder if that last milk shake made any difference.
I certainly feel lighter.
"Salem, help!"
I've disappeared!
(gasps):
I'm so sorry.
"Hey, twirl me around so it looks like I'm flying."
SABRINA:
What's happened?
!
Where am I?
!
"I like you, René, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fräulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a... china cup.
Colonel!
Wake your men!
"Indy, the torches are burning out."
"Go on, get out of here."
Hyah!
- Sallah!
- Hello!
Hello!
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
"That's right, isn't it?"
"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
Son of a bitch.
You leave him to me.
I'll take care of him.
"No, maybe I'd better surprise them."
He can't do a thing like this to a daughter of mine.
"This is my affair, you keep out of it."
I'm your father and I'll settle this as I see fit.
We'll be the laughingstock of this whole town!
So...
Here I am.
"Young man, why didn't you appear for your wedding?"
I thought you'd ask me that.
Don't stand there like a statue.
You said you were gonna do something.
"Well, do it."
What are you gonna do?
Don't you dare touch him.
- Why don't you do something?
- I will.
"I will, but..."
"Pardon me, I think I'm in the way."
- Perhaps you two would like to be alone.
- You stay right where you are.
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- I had a feeling you weren't.
"I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000."
- How about twenty?
"- Not for $20,000."
- Twenty-five.
- Not for...
"Say, young man, where could you get $25,000?"
By dancing?
And there's another thing... coming back to your own hometown in a dancing act.
MAN:
Clear it off the south perimeter!
MAN:
Here comes your dad.
The rooms here also--
What's the situation?
He's gonna kill the girl unless we call CNN and tell the world we're not alone.
You two were going to pick her up.
This was supposed to be easy.
It got a little complicated.
I'm handling it.
How?
.
"I say what I have to, promise him anything he wants."
Just make sure the girl doesn't get hurt.
No one's going to get killed here today.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You got a nice move to the post.
"That kid yesterday thought he could get one past you, but you were right there."
What I do is I fool myself.
I make myself believe I'm really going to cover.
"Because I believe it, he believes it."
How do you get yourself over to the post?
I don't know.
"I'm afraid if I ever stop to think about it, it won't work anymore."
Do you know why you're here?
Do you know what this is about?
"I'm not sure yet, but I think we're gonna find out soon."
"This is the year for the ""big ideas,"" right?"
( groans )
Hey...hey.
It's never felt like this before.
They're coming at last.
The unidentified object has crashed at Narita Airport.
It is still emitting light.
82% of the enemy's makeup cannot be analyzed.
What in the world is this adversary?
This is our true enemy.
Our true enemy...?
I'll explain later.
Can Dangaioh be deployed at once?
Yes.
"In another 30 seconds, it will be loaded onto the Saber Sonic."
It will be ready to go in 140 seconds.
I'll be there in 50 seconds.
Clear Route 7 for my arrival.
What's happening?
I don't know.
I only know that the temperature is rising rapidly.
Vice-Commander...
"We have no data, this time...?"
N-no...
"We know so little of its makeup, power source, armaments that we can't draw any projections."
And so... um...
"I'm sorry, please switch off the monitor."
I had no time to change.
"Listen to me, everyone..."
This battle will be like nothing before.
Anything can happen.
But...
Come on!
That's enough talk!
"I'm itching for a good fight, today!"
I don't feel anything.
Put this in your mouth.
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.
"When the red light goes on, that's your temperature."
I don't want it.
A disorder of the nerves.
At least we think it is.
We don't know yet exactly how it works.
It's often seen in early adolescence.
She shows all the symptoms.
Hyperactivity.
Her temper.
Performance in math.
Yeah.
Why the math?
What is that?
It affects her concentration.
Ah-ha.
"-Now, this is for Ritalin."
-Okay.
Ten milligrams a day.
Is that a tranquilizer?
It's a stimulant.
A stimulant?
"My God, she's higher than a kite now."
Her condition isn't quite what it seems.
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.
The Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition.
"And as to how or why, we really don't know."
"But, uh, her symptoms could be overreaction to depression."
That's out of my field.
"He had a passion, a transmitted lustfulness,... a feeling which I had never experienced before."
-Are you still there?
-Yes.
-Are you alone?
"-Yes, but only momentarily."
Who is he?
Your boyfriend?
Your husband?
"-A peasant, but he's not here now."
-It's better that way.
Let's take advantage of that.
Touch yourself and imagine it to be my hand that fondles your sexy bits.
He was stronger than me and emerged spontaneously to satisfy... the unknown and the unseen.
I don't know.
"Are you doing it, Rosella?"
-Yes.
-Bravo.
"You are getting your caresses from me, you know."
-What are you touching?
-My breasts within my blouse.
-On top of my bra.
-Bring them out.
Moisten your fingertips with saliva... and wet your nipples.
Do you like it?
It is my hand that plays with you.
"-Tell me, if you like it."
"-Yes, I like it."
"Very good, continue and pretend that it is my hand, that fondles you."
Bloody hell!
"Rosella, my love, let me feel how wet you are between your legs."
"Feel it, my love."
My fingers just slipped into your panties.
Stop it!
Nobody... dislikes excitement!
Why are you following me?
"I have driven you a long way, you should invite me to your home."
What's the matter with you?
Why do you keep bothering me?
You can not escape from me!
Let me go!
Ride on!
- Who is that guy?
- He is a disgusting guy!
"If you hate him, why did you come with his car?"
You are right.
Poor me!
Everyday I face the dusty earth and burn below the sun!
"Dig and pant, dig again, plant again."
You have to study hard!
Hear me?
"Otherwise, you will end up like your sister!"
"The smooth completion of our project this time, relies on the efforts and contributions of everybody!"
"So today, is the time to enjoy!"
- Good!
- Great!
Come on!
"On behalf on the team,"
"I should thank our boss, Mr. Lin, for this long period he has been taking care of us!"
The next is... the miracle moment!
Kunlun...
the secret of lost martial.
The one-finger strike!
- Xiaotian.
- Yawang.
That's because he stepped in with the c-block.
Pete stepped in because Adam was too much of a wussy to talk to Kim himself!
- Ahem.
- We'll be right with you.
"Yeah, you guys good?"
Want a soda or anything?
Grayson:
No?
Great.
Why am I the only one looking out for Kim here?
"She wants tall, cool Pete, not lame, weird Adam."
You don't know the first thing about Adam!
You don't know the first thing about Pete!
"Hey, guys, do you like role-playing games and stories with dragons?"
"Get out of here now, please!"
Run for your lives!
"I'm hosting a trunk sale outside-- cigarettes, bad lite beer, and urine samples so clean you'd swear it was from the math club."
Parking lot. 10 minutes.
I think I'm having an asthma attack.
Leave now if you value your pants.
Just go.
Go.
"Dude, the cops are coming to..."
[ Inhales sharply ]
I can't lie to you.
Let's just... get in your car and see where the night takes us.
"Laurie, you're nothing like your mom"
- and you never will be.
- [ Sighs deeply ]
Where is your baby right now?
He's at home with a sitter.
"Where would Baby Laurie have been if her mother was out at a bar, partying?"
"You basically ran into the vehicle, right?"
No no no no no!
You're not married nor do you have any children.
What a stupid question to ask.
Don't say that.
My colleague is a good doctor and you'll go and finish your ward round.
"So, you're a hawker."
What are you doing exactly?
"It's really nice of you to sit here with me, Doc."
I wanted to...
The others keep asking when the bandages will be taken off of my arm.
"It will become stiff otherwise, right?"
You got a strong hand.
Squeeze firmly!
Good.
"- You're a real man, Biberkopf."
"- I am, I am."
It was a tragic accident.
You had a fractured skull and we couldn't save your arm.
"Oh, my arm is gone."
Th-thank you for letting me know.
Well.
You don't have such a great job either.
You have to walk around telling people those things.
"Yes, that's just part of the job."
"Now, you'll be getting up soon."
- Tomorrow?
"- No, a few more days."
- But it could work tomorrow.
- No no no.
But I can't stay here much later or my business is screwed.
I need to get up really soon.
We're going to need ten Jericho men to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
You can't just ride into New Bern and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliced it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
"She's dead,Jake."
Jake!
Everybody go!
Jericho is about to be invaded.
We'll do this day and night for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
"Jerry, I know this has great artistic merit, but I'm taking these shoes off in ten minutes."
"So, if you don't want to have to hide my toes..."
"Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable."
We can't really do this without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Yeah.
"Grandpa seems to be missing, too."
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
"Oh, Beth."
"It's so nice to see you, dear."
Charlie.
Marybeth?
Two-bars has been here all morning.
He went over the place from top to bottom.
You got to do something about Eddie's pension.
They're going to reduce it.
What about the Police Memorial Award?
The precinct says it goes to the next of kin.
"Well, this piece of brass isn't here to give me any award."
"$40,000 in cash was found in Detective Santos' strongbox here at his summer cottage in Ulster County."
Emergency Service Unit workers...
Frank?
"Yeah, I'm up at the cabin."
They found the money.
Good work.
I'm watching it now.
What is the connection to the deaths of James Bone and Tino Zapatti?
"What was Santos doing with $40,000?"
The mayor understands the implications of the discovery in Ulster County  but would like to stress that these are implications only.
Can you believe this shit?
We never set foot in that dump after Eddie's father died.
- It's full of hornets' nests.
"- Yeah, busy hornets."
"Never in our life did we see $4,000 cash much less 40."
There's only 2 people know that's not Eddie's money.
You and me.
Who is this?
Vinnie Zapatti.
I can get you out of this.
"I can get you the pension, the medals."
You want them?
"Sure, sure, I want them."
Good.
[sighs]
These civilians don't know how to drive.
They ought to be kept off the streets.
The streets belong to us professional drivers.
"Taxis, buses, trucks."
That's all that should be allowed on the streets.
"You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving."
I have a perfect safety record.
[honking horn]
"Come on, get out of the way, you bum."
[sighs]
[car doors shut]
[woman] thank you.
"Thank you, sickle."
"Well, this is a perfect test site."
Little traffic And low real estate value.
"It's adequate, I suppose."
"Ok, let's get this over with."
This thing on all right?
It's ready.
What do you want him to do this time?
I want you to climb that fire escape To the absolute top.
Wait a minute.
Uh-uh.
This is as high as I go.
You want me to break somebody's leg?
Just tell me how many pieces.
"But up there, I don't go."
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.
I will fall.
What'II happen if we call the cops?
"Touchy disagreed, he said:"
They'II talk to him and force him to buy a new one.
I can buy another one.
That's not the point.
He did something illegal.
Since when do you care about what's legal.
"And I suppose you drank milk at the hotel, so you could drive back?"
We drank milk... 0.08% .
The kind of milk Ducky could lose his license for.
And not you?
"I can't lose mine, I already lost it."
No... that's a joke...
he still has his license.
"Everybody was laughing, except... except the neg..."
"black kid, and Ducky convinced her about the police."
It's like drinking and driving.
"You don't get caught, you're OK."
"He got caught, he's gotta pay."
It's our duty as citizens.
What if he smashes all the little statues around?
"If we let him go, he might go and do a massacre at Gagnon's Nursery."
We'II feel guilty... our whole lives.
"They won't hang him, they'II just... give him a ticket."
alright!
"You want to do it, you deal with it."
"Bertrand, you know where the phone is."
I'm going to bed.
Come polo sweetheart.
We'II go beddy-byes.
Come with mommy.
She took polo by the arm and...
- Okay.
- Homesick?
I don't know.
How's Asger?
- Okay.
- Say hi.
I will...
See you.
"Hey, don't forget your little present."
"So I pocket the lump, catch the night train and go back to Jutland."
End of story.
But it doesn't work anymore.
It's like a prison I can't get out of.
I'm not like this.
I'm not.
"I only do it, because Asger hasn't got anybody else to do it."
And because I'm the one who knows people in Christiania.
A pusher frau.
"She waits on drug users, who come around to buy drugs."
"I get them coffee, while they tell me I look good   because they want to suck up to the pusher, who couldn't care less."
He's too stoned to notice anything.
That's Asger.
He's pretty spaced out and indifferent.
To me as well.
But it wasn't like that in the beginning.
He used to be a bouncer.
"Big and strong, with a sexy tattoo on his ass."
With Asger it was so different!
He ate pussy like nobody else.
"He was so good at it, and I felt I was in love for the first time ever."
Asger is not a bouncer anymore.
He's a full-time pusher.
Any time you like.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Skip, a Mr Forrester on the phone for you."
"Skip, a Mr Forrester on the phone for you."
He's got some information on Friday night.
He's got some information on Friday night.
"I'm driving into town this way, right?"
"I'm driving into town this way, right?"
Yep.
Yep.
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
White Ford Fairmont.
White Ford Fairmont.
"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it,"
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it, pulls out right in front of me and overtakes."
pulls out right in front of me and overtakes.
Did you get the make and the model?
"EJ Holden, green with a white roof."
It's all over now anyway.
"In a while, bim-bam-boom, I've got this town in the rearview mirror."
"- Hey, take me with you, boss."
- What?
"- Yeah, a little Colorado road trip."
"- No, no, Larry."
Come on.
Let me go.
I'm practically a fugitive.
I can't take you with me.
"Well, Russ, today, yeah,"
"I'm an authorized Yamaha sales associate, but tomorrow I'm just another guy... boxing peanut butter cups at Hershey."
"Come on, Russ."
"I have faith in you, man."
You would just drop everything to come with me?
"Yeah, let the word go forth -"
The Russ Richards freight train is about to leave the station.
"New horizons, new conquests."
- Ready to kick some new ass.
"- Bob Barker, watch out."
Russ Richards is heading west.
Now let's see what's behind door number three.
Whoo-hoo!
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
- Come on.
- This will be no bed of roses
"All right, I'll take the first eight hours."
- Ever driven one of these things?
- Nope.
I consider it a challenge before the human race and i never lose
All right.
You go too far-l'm not playing games!
I swear to Heaven!
"If I tell lies, I will die."
Okay-l'll kill you then
Raise a cup to woman kind!
Drink to cover many sorrows
A hero cries only for a true reason
But it isn't time for heartbreak yet!
Stop beating!
Stop beating!
"You know him, Beggar?"
Never seen him before
Could he be Chou Lien-Chan?
Who?
You're so old you can't hear
"Was that man looking for you, Ta-pei?"
Don't guess you want to go drinking?
"Wandering around, looking for friends..."
"Seeking the land of wine, all for a woman..."
"I'm from north of the pass, Fan Ta-Pei!"
"Wait for me to come back, Yu-lu!"
Ta-pei!
What do you want to do?
"I'll have a drink with him, and come back"
"Of course, your Nightsweet Premium is the best!"
Don't believe him-he won't be back!
"I am Chou Tien-pa, not Lien-chou."
I have to get instruction of your 18 falls fist.
Beggar'll definitely not escape the challenge
You are not Chien She-chun?
"All the same, let me subject you first"
"Chou Tien-pa, you can't do that"
Seeing them.
No.
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?
"There's stuff on here, but it's password protected."
"I know, but can you open it?"
I don't know. I'm trying.
(sighs) How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?
We don't.
Good.
Just keep working.
Fuck.
(sighs)
Can you just talk to me?
"Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?"
Anything.
Just regular stuff.
Like what normal people talk about.
"-Not really my strong suit, Katherine."
-l'll start.
(sighs)
How do you know I dropped out of college?
"Oh, that was just a lucky guess."
Grabbed my file or something?
-You fit a profile.
-Of what?
"Civilian broadcasters have a certain, you know, personality trait."
Keep working.
"Well, I can't work in silence, so you might as well just entertain me."
Okay.
A troubled childhood with an emphasis on extreme emotional loss or fatigue.
Death of a parent.
"Isn't that, uh, kind of inappropriate ?"
"I mean, given the sexual content of the lyrics."
"Well, it was the only song she knew all the words to."
"That and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."""
Ah.
"Well, this is really fun."
"Staying up late, eating sweets, singing songs."
It's like summer camp.
Coed summer camp with really hot camp counselors.
"No offense, Gary, but this is barely entertaining me."
"Yeah, Gary, young guy in Newport, cool job... you must have a lot of fun."
Not really.
No friends ?
No girls ?
Well... there is one girl.
"Oh, well, you only need one, as long as it's a good one."
She's an amazing one.
"Well, are you guys serious ?"
Pretty serious.
"You know, thinking about taking it to the next level."
"Oh, the next level."
That's very serious.
"Yeah, you haven't asked her out yet, have you ?"
"Not yet, no."
"Well, what's the holdup ?"
"I mean, if she's as hot as she sounds."
It's not her.
It's me.
She's a great girl.
And I'm... the ice cream guy.
"Oh, what the hell..."
we have nothing better to do.
- and you...
"- Will hate you, like I've always hated you."
"Patience, Mr. Hall."
All our teams need to act simultaneously.
I think that's a comet or something.
"It's a meteorite, in point of fact."
I was drawn to it as well.
- When can I kill him?
- We have to wait
- for the meteor to go critical.
- When's that?
When he starts the ritual in all three time periods.
"Um, we got a nuclear bomb, here."
"Professor, Jax, we need you."
"Oh, man, I forgot how much of a badass I was."
Look.
What do you mean you don't have the money?
I was going to sell a nuclear warhead and pay you out of the profit.
- Things changed.
- You expect me to just hand the meteor over for free?
"No, I expected to take it from you by force."
Ah.
Well...
I think that's our cue.
Really?
These guys again?
Now.
Keep them occupied.
You ready to show these fools what's really good?
You have no idea.
Glad we're past the point of worrying about the timeline.
Carter!
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't move, motherfucker!"
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!
"For a second I thought I was dead, but when I heard all the noise I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
Michael!
Lock the door!
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Hey fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't. I don't give a fuck."
"25 years, pal, that's what you're gonna do."
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter were just local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa.
They turned out to be narcs.
Just get the lawyer.
They'd been on me a month.
"Phone taps, surveillance, everything."
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.
"You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a fucking problem all night."
Each one of these counts holds 25-to-life in New York State.
"25 fucking years, pal."
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.
"What, were you guys grocery shopping?"
There's Tommy with that bitch Josephine.
She had the same clothes on last weekend.
And she lives in Virum.
I just saw Jonas Engberg and Nik Kragh.
MONEY
"We set the trend for what's ""in""."
If me and my sister are seen in things we bought in New York   everyone wants the same.
You can buy your way out of most illnesses.
You can always go away somewhere for a cure.
I spend my money on on sex and gadgets and drugs and booze.
My friends rate some of my friends rate money higher than happiness.
But I hope -
- I'II be happy.
Then money won't matter.
I use my credit card as a comfort blanket.
If I'm feeling low I feel I deserve that top or that bag.
I haven't found a door I can't open with my money.
Crying in a limo with shaded windows is always more fun   than smiling at the wheel of a Skoda.
- I don't get it.
- Get what?
Anja and Patricia.
"The biggest cock-teasers   with Tommy and Jonas, the biggest shaggers in town."
"- Yes, it's weird."
- I'm getting new rims.
20 inch.
Straight from L.A.
- Cool.
"- I want 22"" Chrome."
- As my graduation present.
"- You can't have 22""if I've got 20""."
- Another line?
- You know I can't take it.
"Mr. Brubaker, I assure you that my father is innocent."
"I... no, he's not in the office, but..."
I'll have him call you.
- I am so happy to see you.
"- Guess who no longer works for Partridge, Savage and Cann?"
- You quit?
- Or got fired.
Quit slash got fired.
Lot of things were said.
- None of them good.
- What happened?
Your father.
"They said as long as I was representing him, I wasn't working for them."
It's Thursday night.
No knocking until 9:00 p. m.
Cohen!
How did you get in here?
"Your stepmom, who's in unusually good spirits."
- It's the Klonopin.
- That'd explain that eye twitch.
"- Listen, I'm not going to stay long."
"- Actually, you can't stay at all."
"The Valley is on, so you should just..."
"Right, no, I have something for you."
"- Well, unless it's a plutonium -fueled car to take me back to last year so I can never date you, I'm not interested."
"- Oh, okay, it's two tickets to The Walkmen tomorrow night."
"- I'm not going to a concert with you, ass."
"Hey, I'm not going, okay?"
"Well, I am, actually, I'm going, but I'm not going to go with you."
These are for you and Zach.
- Me and Zach?
- Yeah.
"Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the particulars of the agency I work for and all that, that implies."
"You mean, uh, national security?"
(CHUCKLES) Let's put it this way.
"Every once in a while, things happen that just can't be rationalized in a conventional way."
People wanna know that their government has a response.
I am that response.
"So, were there any witnesses?"
"Well, sir, if you'll just follow me."
- (METAL CLANKING)
- We did find this.
MARV:
"United States Government, huh?"
"Guess that means something big's happening here, eh?"
"No, Marv."
Big things happen in big places.
"And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them."
"Enormous beast, yeah... (CHUCKLES)"
Biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen.
"Oh, my God!"
"- Come on, Marv."
Come on.
- MARV:
Okay.
I need a witness.
It's around the corner.
Come on.
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.
I've never seen anything like it.
"It's like a big, big ""chomp"""
- out of the side of the car.
- Take it easy...
"Damn it, I can't stand him."
I can't believe this is happening.
Richard... used to work for me years ago.
"And that's Priscilla, my best ex-wife."
They recently moved back to New York.
This is not gonna work.
Let's get out of here.
Why was she your best wife?
Everything with her was as intimate as kissing.
I never really got over her... the most orgasmic woman I've ever been with.
Who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
You could use my first name.
But I hope I'm not the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with.
I'm not that easy.
"- Hello, Priscilla."
"- Hello, George."
- You look absolutely beautiful.
- I don't.
"I look like shit, but thank you."
- How do I look?
"- Depraved, but well-fed."
"Jonathan, this is Richard and Priscilla Antrem."
Richard is the new editor of Women's Wear Daily.
"George, you know I'm editing GQ."
Don't be petty.
- I'm sorry.
I get the two confused.
- Of course you do.
You ought to try doing The Times crossword puzzle.
It's supposed to be good for senile dementia.
"Richard, George, please."
"Well, it's very nice to meet the both of you."
No stoppin' till dark.
Tin whistle plays
"You're in my light, damn you, Hagman!"
"I beg your pardon, sir."
But it's Captain Murray.
"He's poorly, sir."
Harris.
"Figure me this, Harris."
Where is the bugger planning on taking us?
Sorry to be so much trouble.
"You did well today, Sharpe."
"I did my duty, sir."
We're lost.
And we've lost Hogan's trail.
Try to find your way to Casa Antigua.
"I'll find it, sir."
"Don't be too hard on the men, Sharpe."
How can say this without offence?
You see the lads don't like an officer who's come from the ranks
They want an officer to be privileged to be set apart from them... touched by grace
They think of you as one of them Sharpe one of the damned
know now hard it must be
Sorry.
Of course I don't...
I don't know.
I'm just trying to think of some practical advice after I've gone.
"Oh, yes."
Get Patrick Harper on your side.
"Is that an order, sir?"
I want you to have my sword.
Maybe if the men see you carry it...
They'll think I'm a proper officer?
All right.
So where do we start?
I'm gonna work on the locations.
You're gonna work on finding Petty.
Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean War.
Something bad happened in Wonju... schoolchildren killed by U.S. land mines.
Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.
Court-martialed.
They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."
All right!
Everybody down!
"Oh, my God."
"On March 21, 1963,"
Alcatraz officially closed.
All the prisoners were transferred off the island...
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.
ALCATRAZ S01 Ep06
- Paxton Petty
"You're checking her for TBI, right?"
Concussions?
"Honestly, I barely bumped my head."
Thanks.
A guy is walking around with a backpack full of mines.
SFPD back in '60 thought he stole 'em from the Presidio while he was there.
"The Presidio isn't a base anymore, so where is he getting them now?"
"Maybe same guy who bought Cobb his rifle,"
Hastings and Sylvain their guns.
That's a good thing.
That means you're not like them.
"""Tell me not in mournful numbers,"
Life is but an empty dream.
"For the soul is dead that slumbers, And things are not what they seem."" Did you write this, dude?"
[EVAN] Huh?
"So, she's meeting you here."
[EVAN] Yeah.
Why?
[BENDER] I don't know.
Most chicks want you to pick them up.
[EVAN] She already knows where I live.
"Right, but still something peculiar about that."
How's this?
"Dude, you look great!"
You think?
Yeah.
Guys should take lessons from you on how to dress like a pimp.
"Yeah, it's like, this part is like..."
Do you want me to help you tie that tie?
"Yeah, that'd be great."
All right.
This is called the double Windsor knot.
"Don't fucking ask me how I know how to do this, like, I don't remember."
"I consider myself a modern-day cad, or dandy."
"A metrosexual, in the parlence of our times."
What was that?
"Dude, I don't know what I was doing, I just ..."
"I've been really lonely lately and, I mean you remember that one time we made out?"
"I mean, come on, just-"
Dad?
"Don't call me ""dad."" What?"
"- Yuck, Steso, why do you get those?"
- The pills are best when injected.
The physical and psychological agents are fluid.
"They add corn starch, parafin and calcium to solidify it."
- That's what gives you boils.
- You're gross!
- What are the dogs called?
- Chill and Ace.
- For chillum and acid?
- Right.
"- Very ingenious, Asger."
- Right.
- And yet so sad.
- Why?
- Are your dogs ill?
- I don't know.
Maybe it's the pig.
"They're in the bedroom or outside, till I've finished this."
"The dogs are used to the hash fumes, and suddenly you kick them out."
So they feel bad.
"Withdrawal symptoms, you know."
- What are you talking about?
- They're junkie dogs.
They are not junkie dogs!
They have a pedigree...
- Like you.
Your dogs are like you.
- I'm not a fucking junkie.
- You don't know what you are.
Stop it now!
- I have to go now.
- My dogs aren't junkie dogs!
Did a cop tell you that?
We need to get to the guy first.
He's in a hotel on rue Marcadet.
The Étoile d'Agadir.
You don't answer questions any more?
"Fuck, Gilou, I'm fighting for you!"
You want to end up in jail?
Let's go.
"Arnaud, are you aware that as an intern, you are allowed to follow a police investigation in the field?"
"Yes, I know."
"Our relationship being what it is, I suggest you take this opportunity."
"Thank you, but I'd rather stay here."
And I have seen enough of you.
You are starting tomorrow.
They are informed of your arrival.
"- Is everything all right, Marianne?"
"- It's nothing, Your Honour."
It's just the shelf collapsing.
"Wait, let me take care of it."
My husband has a safe in a bank on the Champs-Elysées...
"Average height, short dark hair."
Stocky.
This is a peaceful hotel.
I don't want any trouble.
"Please, answer."
"OK, your colleagues came yesterday."
Yesterday?
- Yes.
They took the man you're looking for.
What was his name?
He called himself Mr Bo.
Thank you.
"[all] Legendary ranger mode,"
Mystic force.
Ready.
"Magical source, mystic force."
- Pink mystic ranger.
- Green mystic ranger.
- Yellow mystic ranger.
- Blue mystic ranger.
Red mystic ranger.
Power Rangers mystic force.
Whoa.
Righteous.
I think you're having an identity crisis.
It doesn't matter who you are.
This ends now.
[shouts] [red] Gosei's right.
Legendary mode's hard to maintain.
Good thing super mega mode still rocks. [growls] [battle cries] [Gosei] Rangers.
Use the keys to your saber locks and combine your attack.
"Got it, Gosei."
Activate.
[all] Activate. [all] Super mega saber.
[all] Charging.
Ugh.
[all] Final strike.
"[grunts] Now, that's a super mega win."
Yes.
So a power ranger did this to my soldier?
The humans can fight back?
Yes.
"Apparently, yes."
"Well, I don't like that."
"He killed my client and tried to kill me, so there you go."
"Yeah, there's all kind of fucking motive."
I get it.
"But you got no prints, no blood, no weapon, none of that shit."
"So unless you're going to arrest me,"
I think we're done here.
Patty:
"No, so I thought I had more time this morning."
- Man:
Sorry.
- Patty:
Excuse me.
"So I decided to make breakfast like an adult,"
"And everyone saying ""Avocado toast, avocado toast,"""
so I'm there with an avocado in this hand and trying to get the pit out.
You call.
"The fucking knife slips, right?"
"And it slices me right fucking there on my middle finger, mind you, which I fucking need."
"And it's like four stitches, they're saying."
"And I think there's, like, seven to ten days, and then it's going to be fine."
[cough cough]
But I've never had to deal with that before.
Talk to me.
"Look, I'm-- I'm telling you, it's-"
- What's going on?
[muttering]
"Oh, my God, what's going on?"
What's going on?
Just talk to me.
Um... um...okay.
"Uh, I don't-- I don't know."
Um... do you-- How about a story?
The Association sent him up to talk to Coble.
Trying to figure what they're gonna do with a child killer like Tom Horn.
People think you did it.
"You don't understand what's going on, do you?"
"No, I can't say as I do."
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I want a drink.
"Whiskey, George."
Leave the bottle.
- Sorry I'm late.
"- It's all right, Charles."
- Let's get started.
"- What'll I need, Joe?"
Just your writing things.
Where's Tom Horn?
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.
What kind of condition is he in?
He'll be just about where we want him by the time we get set up.
Come on over here.
We got a mattress laid out here for you behind the door.
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?
Absolutely.
Got the bottom of the door planed off so you can hear real good.
But you got to be real quiet.
"Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?"
"- You mean, will he kill you?"
- Yes.
"I'm not going to let that happen, Charles."
A man like that you don't want to get mad at you.
I'm going to be sitting right over there at my desk.
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest... and a German automatic over there in the drawer... one of the new ones.
What?
Give me your key!
"But Mam, I haven't done anything."
You said I could go!
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
Upstairs!
"Well, Pauline had it right - what have I done with my life?"
You've looked after your mother.
Was I looking after her or hiding behind her?
"She never said ""don't get married"", ""don't have a girlfriend""."
"I was the one saying, ""Ooh, I have to go home and see to my mother."""
At least you plunged.
Wasn't much of a plunge.
I knew really he wouldn't leave Mrs Stanley.
"I was so busy being hard done by, I never thought about her."
What a twerp.
Me?
Me!
What have I got to get so high and mighty about?
I'm cringing.
Can't believe I turned down all that yoghurt!
I hadn't brought plain.
I hate plain.
We'll never have it.
# I want to make you proud I want to show
# That there's still time for me to climb and change and grow
# Somewhere along the way I lost my nerve
# I'm not the man that you deserve
# Face who you are - a man with a heart
# It's only in height I'm above you.
# Breathe on my dreams
# Don't blow them apart
- Say some things you don't like.
- Shut up.
- I'm bored!
"- Look, surveillance is boring."
"There's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look."
Big thrill.
You know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
Makes it easier to grab the kids.
You always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
That's more like it.
"That's the undercover's wife, Caroline Risdale."
Ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her but there's only thing that comes before a lady.
Me dinner.
I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
"I'll get us something to eat, then we can work in shifts."
- Why?
- Because I may garrotte you myself.
"Don't be like that, John."
"Come on, mate."
- What kind of bag?
- I dunno.
A bag bag.
"- A suitcase, an overnight bag...?"
- That's it.
An overnight bag.
He goes out for a jog like you said and... he comes back out with a bag.
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
- Did he see you?
The bastards who did this should be shot.
"No, I tried to get away and I lost control."
You did everything you could.
"Don't worry, the cops will get these guys."
- Have you seen Grace?
- She looks good.
- They think she's gonna be okay.
- Really?
We still have to run a few tests.
"Everything looks good, but as soon as I can, I'll bring her down so you can be with her."
"Okay, thanks."
I'm gonna go back and stay with Grace until they're ready to bring her in here.
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Your husband seems like a great guy.
"It's okay, Judy."
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.
"Okay, well, the Venus flytrap is nontoxic, so it's not lethal if ingested."
"However, the larger ones are extremely dangerous, and have been known to devour pets and small children."
"No, no, no, I made that last part up."
Uh...
I'm sorry.
"Ma'am, I..."
You're absolutely right.
This is not a venue for humor.
I...
I understand.
I-I apologize.
"You, too."
Do you need any help with the snakes?
Come in.
"Hey, Stephen."
- How are you?
- Good.
I just wanted to say I had a really great time with you the other night...
- on our date.
"- Me, too."
"Hey, did you get the flowers I sent?"
You sent.
Of course.
Thank you so much.
I love them.
"Um, then why are they in the trash?"
Can I be totally honest with you?
Molly put them in there.
She's a little bitter.
"Listen, I know it was just one date, and I don't want you to attach too much meaning to the flowers."
"Apparently, that's not a problem."
"Anyway, I was just wondering if, hopefully, there might be another opportunity to...."
"Well, someone is popular today."
Check it out.
These flowers kick those flowers' ass.
You want to know who they're from?
- Yeah.
- No.
"""Congratulations, you've been named ""to Manhattan Monthly's 'Ten Most Eligible' list, a who's who of the city's most datable professionals."""
I'm so excited for you.
She doesn't seem that bitter.
They are going to interview you and everything.
"Oh, you're gonna have your pick of any man in Manhattan."
"You know, I'm just... think I'm gonna..."
Okay.
Ishmael...
What happened brother?
You never came with me for help.
Ready for this?
"I do not know, Ish."
"Come on, Commander!"
Your team is waiting for you
All members of the UCF crew have arrived...
Ash-393 is considered to be the most sophisticated noid ever created by men.
A class one surface humanoid 300 Series.
It has full AI access.
He was the leader of Noid's rebellion.
He was.
Is dead.
"By rumors has many crimes In the Federation of Arizona,"
He recently arrived in the northeast corridor.
The reactor 12 has been turned off.
He killed 28.
"Hidden by intelligence, it is in the death zone 714."
Hidden in the death zone?
Does not sound very clever
The fusion of the nucleus has probably smoothed the brain of the Noids.
"Or, Commander?"
Not as soft as your dick.
Revenge is a bitch...
Like you!
"What, Kix?"
Stop him!
Five years ago I got a team sent to kill Ash.
We lost contact here.
There temperatures must be subarctic.
Your Iso-Gel will last 48 hours.
Take it easy.
Drive carefully.
"Alright, um..."
I'm not giving up on us.
You will.
"Just leave them on the, on the table."
Drive carefully everyone!
Thank God.
I thought they'd never leave.
Her grief runs deep.
I think Lindsay might be like a dam waiting to burst.
There is no right way to grieve.
And probably far more than five stages.
And the process itself is as complex as the people who experience it.
Especially if the loss is still a mystery.
Loaded with secrets.
"Um, your Dad's here."
Honestly... ..do I look fat on this?
"No, you, you look..."
Lovely.
As always.
"Thanks, Arlo."
You really have been so good to me.
I don't deserve it.
Of course you do.
"You know, I would do anything for someone going through this."
You know me and Jared used to get all these postcards from Mum at Christmas and birthdays.
"Yeah, I heard that."
We knew they were from Dad.
"'Cause he's got this really bad squiggly handwriting, but we pretended to go along with it just to make him feel better really."
It's kind of sweet.
In his own strange way I guess... ..he does love you.
"Isn't it, Laurie?"
"[ Drowners' ""A Button On Your Blouse"" playing ]"
How long have we been holding hands?
Huh.
Wasn't that fun?
[ Chuckles ]
Why don't you go spend some time with your friends now?
[ Gasps ] These kids are so happy.
They even gave me a nickname--
"""That lady who saved prom."" [ Laughs ]"
I even made a love connection.
"I found a lonely guy and a lonely girl,"
I put 'em together...
and now they're dancing.
It's a weird dance.
It's like they're trying to smother a fire between their crotch.
So what have you been doing since I lost you?
Gettin' crazy?
Yeah.
"No, I mean, I was."
But then I remembered that I left my purse over here so I came to find it.
That's the end of the story.
"Hey, it's early."
Let's go have some fun.
Go without me because I need to catch my breath after all the...
purse excitement.
No way!
We're a team!
"Also, you may have to rescue me in case anyone pulls me into a dance circle."
That is my biggest fear.
"Well, that and... [ Whispers ] clowns."
What about a dance circle made up of clowns?
I swear.
- They won't get over it.
- Who?
The others down there.
"Father Catolle, Mr Mayor."
"Most of all, those wives of theirs."
It'll kill them!
- And then there's Bertha
- Who's she?
Someone I thought of as queen of the village.
"But now, comparing her to you she's a cow."
"I like you a lot, Goubi."
Do you...
"Do you think the schoolkids will call me ""Mr Goubi""?"
"They'd better, or they'll cop it!"
But then there's the others.
The grown-ups.
They all know I'm an imbecile.
Even if I have a wife and a car I'll always be one.
It's true...
"Once the die is cast, that's it."
And then there's something else.
You're all that I think about.
I can't help it.
"One day, thinking about you too much... is going to make my head explode."
Because of you.
I'm used to people making fun of me.
"But they'll talk about YOU, because of ME and I'd hate that."
You'll have your own land and money in the bank...
So you'll never stop people talking behind your back.
The main thing is that they're silent when you turn around!
So you came to ask me permission to marry La Fleur.
So gossip girl most likely goes to or went to constance.
Yeah exactly. why else the focus?
"Well,i would also assume that she is our age."
The blasts all started when we were in the ninth grade.
An upperclassman simply wouldn't care.
"So you're saying gossip girl's a senior,like us?"
"Well,if she's a senior"
Then--then that means she's in the room right now.
So who could it be?
Rebecca sherman?
no her head's always in a book.
- She's not paying enough attention.
- Okay.
Not her either.
Then i submit nelly yuki.
Low profile
Good with computers...
Many grudges mostly against me.
No i have been with her way too many times
When gossip girl has sent out a blast.
There's no way it's her. i'm gonna speed this up.
What are you doing?
sending a tip to gossip girl.
"- Chuck,get the room quiet for me. - i'm way ahead of you."
If i could have everyone's attention please.
We'd like to thank you all for being here today.
Jonathan?
what?
Gossip girl is... a guy?
It's him. look.
What just happened?
What's going on?
Johnnie.
I wouldn't blame you.
Branigan is one in a million.
And I'm not much to write on about.
Am I?
I'm just an everyday sort of bloke.
Everyday!
?
Everyday for the rest of my life.
Good work!
Bloody good show!
Two shots so far!
"If this thing is being treated for color, it's going to look marvelous."
God!
The American's teeth.
Can that be real?
"If the studio shoot goes half as well, this picture is going to be a triumph!"
"There is however, one area of concern."
Uh!
"Memo, please."
From American distributors.
"I'd ask you to absorb what's said without division, Buckley."
American picture goers liked to be knocked off their feet.
"Bangs, crashes, ambulances careeding around corners."
The same goes for romance.
"What you call understatement, translates as a lack of, uhmf..."
Americans feel that the ending is presently written is too subtly too newses.
Restrained.
Restrained?
I mean it's practically a call to arms!
"Their concern is more, what one might crudely call..."
"""A love triangle"""
"I said, ""Really?"
"You've seen Cliff 60 times?"""
"He went, ""Yeah, but I saw him when I was 11, and I'm autistic,"
"""so whoever I saw then, I just loved forever."""
"So, even Cliff's biggest fan is explaining away why he's a fan."
LAUGHTER
It's absolutely insane.
Can you tell me about the time you met the Queen?
The Queen?
Yeah.
"Oh, I know what you're after."
Do you remember telling this story?
"When you came on QI, you told this story and it really made me laugh."
"Yes, I did a Royal Variety show and I was..."
"Yeah, that's it."
LAUGHTER
"And, you know, you have to wait for ages in a line, and Her Majesty was proceeding graciously along, and she spent quite a long time talking to Frankie Dettori next to me."
And you know when you are aware that you've got a little bit of wind working its way through?
"And I thought, ""It's nothing to worry about..."
LAUGHTER
""".."
"I'll just deal with this silently."""
LAUGHTER
"And just as the queen got to me, the..."
"It was the moment, you know, where the wind was making a break for it."
"So, I let nature take its course."
"Unfortunately, I shat myself."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
But it wasn't...
"It wasn't a great big, you know..."
Sure.
# Just put a melody to the words #
# That you're sayin' and soon you'll be-- #
"Dad, I wanna join the basketball team."
What did you say?
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do.
That's what I really wanna do.
Basketball?
!
No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
"But, Dad, it's what I really want."
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
"I know, that's kind of why I like it."
Don't you even think about it!
"If I had a jock for a son,"
I'd be the laughing stock of the men's choir club!
"It's my life, Dad!"
Don't make me slap you.
I will slap your face so super hard!
I am the man of this house!
You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
Maybe you should let him try it.
"What did you say, woman?"
!
You aren't being fair.
That's it!
I'm gonna slap you!
"No, please!"
# I slap you I slap you #
"# I slap, slap, slap you #"
# I'm slappin' you slapping' you silly 'cause you disrespected me #
"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class."
"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd."
About six years.
"You get some kind of sick pleasure from that, the boss' daughter?"
"""Boss""?"
I thought we were friends.
I love Mary.
And I think she loves me.
I want your desk cleaned out by tomorrow.
"After this is over, I'll be going back to Maine."
I don't wanna see you there when I go into the office.
How you feeling?
What's happening to me?
"- It's in her DNA, isn't it?"
- That's what makes her special.
Mum...
"I never believed that part of your story-- ""My grandfather was an alien."""
- Allie...
- Your dad--could he do things?
"I never saw it, but, yes, he could."
- But you never could.
- I can play drums and sing harmony.
A lot of people would tell you that's amazing.
There's you and me.
"The way I know where you are, how you're feeling, if you're safe."
I always figured that was just because I'm your only daughter and you love me so much.
"Yeah, I suppose it could be that."
"It's what made your dad sick, isn't it, doing these things?"
"You're not my dad, honey."
You've got a lot of other things in you.
"You've got Charlie's family, too."
MAN:
Everybody in position?
He's not gonna last much longer.
- Who are you?
- We?
We're the modest employees of our respected police.
I'm the Major and Seryozha is Captain.
- What are you incriminating me for?
- What words you know!
You'll tell us yourself what we're incriminating you for.
You have no right to...
Call her in.
Sergeant?
Bring the victim in.
Do you recognise this man?
I do.
- Did he rape you perversely?
- Yes he did.
Tell us about it.
What shall I tell you?
What shall I repeat it for?
I was standing on the road waiting for a ride to the city.
A foreign car stopped.The door was opened.
- And?
- A man offered to give me a lift.
"The man was decent-looking, in an expensive suit."
So I got in.
We passed a few kilometres.
Then he turned off the road and raped me.
That's all.
You may go free.
You'll sign the protocol of identification later.
She was your Statute 153 and a straight road to the rooster house.
In a blink of an eye a rusty shank will be stuck in your hemorrhoidal ass...
What do you want of me?
It's an act of love.
It's the divine mystery itself.
"You must think I'm inexperienced, but I assure you,"
I was baptised in the brothels of Paris when I first arrived.
"But, um..."
"I'm so ill, and I have been for such a long time, and my body is such a great disappointment to me that I've already said goodbye to it."
I'm not really in it any more.
I'm just happier floating about in music.
"And if I should come back inside this miserable collection of bones, then I am afraid that it would probably collapse altogether."
Forgive me.
- I am ashamed.
"- No, no."
Forgive me.
"I'm a fraud, you know."
Divine mystery!
I've never experienced that with anyone.
I've always had disastrous relationships.
- I've never managed to stay in love.
- Why?
I don't know.
I want too much.
I think.
Except when I hear you play.
And when I'm around you.
Look...
I simply want to be with you.
The rest doesn't matter.
Really.
Do you think we could just...
be together?
Like this?
Yes.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
"Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
So everyone's just gonna watch us?
Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"Come on, man."
How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
"No, those are actually always there... something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
NineNine!
"Chills, you guys."
"Literally, chills."
"Hey there, Nikolaj."
It's your papa.
"If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me."
She just loved the attention.
So ?
I opened your little time capsule.
Still as lame as the day we buried it.
"You removed the champagne bottle, breaking the glass jar in the process, didn't you ?"
"Okay, yeah."
I took the bottle.
The same bottle that was used to kill Patrick shortly afterwards ?
You're putting words in my mouth.
"It used to be Patrick's favorite, so I brought it to our hook up."
Remember this ?
Dubé champagne.
"Yeah, sure, great, we'll drink it after."
Come on.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Come on !
"I left the bottle on the floor, unopened."
You're only going after me because of my reputation.
A person's character does enter into an investigation.
Character ?
"I have a job, a condo, nieces that love me."
"I left high school, not like some of the people at the reunion."
"Oh, yeah, like who ?"
Take your pick :
"cheerleaders, band geeks, rockers, stoners, loners."
It's just like they never left.
"I mean, look at Dan."
He's still a total outcast.
Dan ?
Life insurance Dan ?
Dan Winslet.
I think this is about it.
- She hit an artery!
"- Michelle, call medical!"
"No, she's bleeding too much."
We got to take her there now!
- Tell security!
- We need someone from medical.
- Interrogation room 819.
- Uncuff her.
Now!
So what did Sherry have to say?
That Alan had a heart attack.
And you believe her?
I'd be a fool to believe anything Sherry says to save herself.
But murder?
I can't imagine she'd do that.
"David, we can't allow ourselves to be caught off guard this time."
Now we have to assume the worst.
Then we'd also have to assume that Julia was somehow involved.
What?
"Whoa, whoa, listen."
"David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not the same kind of person that Sherry is."
"When we find out all the facts, we'll proceed from there."
I have to go over the morning brief with Jerry.
All right.
- Hello?
"- Julia, it's me."
Wayne?
"I just heard about Alan, and I... are you alone?"
The police are here.
I'm was just going to speak with one of the officers.
"All right, tell me what happened."
Go for it.
Jeremy.
Jenna.
"Hey, what's, uh?"
- What's up?
- Regret.
Make sure you lock that up.
Did I just pass their driveway?
"Uh, I think it's up there."
This is an amazing car.
Did I pass?
- Um...
- The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I would do around Elena.
I don't know.
"You were reminiscing about the Elena years all night, so..."
"Caroline, that stuff came before, okay?"
It's not just gonna go away.
"- I know that, okay?"
- No.
"No, you don't."
Because you're letting it turn you into a crazy person.
"Look, it's my fault."
"I, you know..."
I made it pretty clear early on that Elena still means something to me.
"But all that talk, it was just two old friends and some memories."
Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.
I was there because I wanted to be with you.
And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you're the only person I want to be in this car with right now.
I don't even know if this makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself...
"No, no."
I think you're doing just fine.
Ow!
You lose me my customers.
Where else can I park?
Where the engineer's parked.
You choke us when you start it up.
We swallow fumes instead of tea.
I park right here.
You can't.
You have no right.
"It's my cafe, my territory."
You can't park your car here.
What's wrong?
Park where the engineer's parked.
What's going on?
"It's my cafe, my territory."
Leave him alone...
Mind your own business.
"I go to a lot of trouble, I work."
Serving tea isn't that tiring!
There's a difference.
My tea relaxes you.
Who takes care of me?
Are you tired?
I'm the one who's exhausted.
"I've been out harvesting in the blazing sun, in the full heat of summer."
is serving tea that tiring?
So I'm not working?
I don't make efforts?
Your work isn't all that counts.
Remember the first day that you served tea to your future husband.
You appreciated it and so did he.
Those days shouldn't be over now.
You have to remember that day for the tea...
-I probably won't even tell you.
-And you call yourself a friend?
The central computer has assessed our information and has found serious problems.
Planet Earth is heading for catastrophe.
Serious problems...
What do we have to do with it?
That is we have to stay hear and solve them.
"Cursed, fucking job!"
What's their problem?
Everything is in order here.
We described it so nicely for them.
"How it works, how fantastic it is here on Earth."
Unlikely.
"You don't understand it too much, you're a junior substrate, but I know different."
The computer is always right.
"-I'm so glad, Martin."
"-Me too, Yirinka."
Doctor Yansky?
You have been chosen as a representative of the election committee and...
-So Doctor Yansky will be really pleased with that.
-We can't do that to him.
He's such a decent man.
Who do we have next?
A Joseph Vanyerka.
"Excuse me, do you know where Mr. Vanyerka lives?"
Joseph!
Joseph Vanyerka!

"A previously unknown comet appears in space, threatening Earth with impact."
"And I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants."
It goes back tomorrow.
"Skyler, it will crush him."
That car directly contradicts our story.
"And if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting the story."
"What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt?"
What about Hank and Marie?
How about the IRS?
"What were you thinking, Walt?"
I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.
[scoff]
Look.
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
"Oh, he will."
"Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him, so thanks for that."
[sigh]
"But you know what, Walt?"
Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.

"So how the devil have you been, Eric?"
You've gotten a bit rusty since last I saw you.
BLADE:
"Noah's stiff the same, I see."
Only more so.
He's not exactly mellowing with age.

"He'll never get a job, not even in the fields."
He can't even calculate how much a man would plough during an 8 hour shift.
"If in one hour, 8 men can do..."
He'd only be good at playing football!
- Addie!
- You stay here!
"Hey, you!"
Open it!
Open it or there'll be trouble!
"Don't hurt him, it's his birthday!"
"Yeah, and I have a short temper!"
"Adam, come out!"
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
"Don't do this, my dear son!"
"Open it now, you hear me?"
Addie!
"It's only me, your father isn't here."
You can open it.
Please!
What is it?
You've locked yourself in again?
"The folks from the Council were here yesterday as well, complaining that you must be brewing alcohol here secretly!"
You know what?
They can all go to hell!
What am I supposed to do with the apples?
Let them rot?
They're travelling with their houses!
"Gee, animal sculptures."
They must be art collectors.
"I just changed the number plate, and the colour as well."
"And you just play here, when we're clearly late already!"
We'll never make it to Kamenice like this!
Bakk me up against the press now.
Please.
We need to lay off 200 in the first place.
"I'm sorry, but there is a Chinese on the phone."
"Take a message, Marianne."
He said you would rather discuss funding with him than bankruptcy with the board.
I've been thinking that maybe we should take some time off.
I can give my clients to someone else.
We can go on a trip together.
-What are you going?
-I'll going to Norway.
-Norge?
-There are work.
Cann't you send someone else?
-It is in Lifjord.
You're going back to your hometown.
I thought you hated being there.
It's an interesting business possibility.
A solar cell factory.
-It seems promising.
-Is this a strange coincidence?
-Can you stop interrogating me?
-No.
-Oh my God.
-How many times have I asked you about your past?
You will never say anything.
You give me one sentence about an unhappy childhood.
That's because there is not much more to tell.
Every year we send Christmas cards a mother I've never met.
"And now, suddenly, you are going there on business."
"These people, they are ..."
I mean...
You can have a job here if you work like everyone else.
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, dad."
"I know you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought..."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
"You haven't spoken with me for over a week, since..."
"Allison, I understand how you feel."
You'll just have to accept what's happened... make the best of it.
Mother?
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed... pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.
-You can't mean that.
-I mean it.
I'm going to New York.
"Please, Allison, I was only trying to protect you."
I was an accident that you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.
Try to believe me.
"Well, how will you live?"
What will you do for money?
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.
Suppose you can't find a job.
"Then I'll live off some man, the way you did."
"Oh, God..."
"God, help me!"
Allison!
Allison!
I didn't want you to come down here.
I couldn't say good-bye to you.
-You know I don't want you to go.
"Ooh, McGee."
Gibbs wrote something in the comment section.
"""Agent DiNozzo displays exemplary skills, though he can be too talkative in the field."""
"If, by too talkative, he means you never shut up."
"Well, I think Gibbs was being a bit too gracious."
"After ten years, he doesn't know this is how I work."
I always thought it was like a mild case of Tourette's or something.
It's my process.
You guys know that.
"It-It's how I focus, you know."
I talk it out.
Talkative.
Hah!
"Com-Coming from a functional mute, that's rich."
Maybe that's what he's...
Maybe that's what he's doing.
He's trying to tell me something.
Maybe I should dial it back.
Get...
Get my quiet on.
"I think you're, uh, overreacting a bit, Tony."
I'm gonna kill the next performance appraisal.
"Next time he writes down, in his little margin here, ""DiNozzo:"
"""professional;"
DiNozzo: focused.
"DiNozzo..."""
Too much yabba yabba.
"Sorry boss, I was just suppressing the yabba?"
Good.
Grab your gear.
Got a dead petty officer in Baltimore.
So now it's too much yabba yabba?
No problem there.
Wow.
"Soul mate, right there."
"God's little gift to Landry, that's what that is."
Why can't you just be happy...
"Hey, Smash, you're on TV, homes."
And I want to apologize to him and everyone for doing so.
"Anyone can say, ""I'm sorry. "" Doesn't mean they are."
"Smash Williams is an arrogant, violent thug who attacked us just because we're white and have money."
And everyone's defending him.
He's lucky me and my friends acted civilized.
"And from the Smash Williams controversy, we go now to Kevin with the rest of today's sports headlines."
Smash?
"Hey, what the hell are you doing here?"
"Looking for you, man."
Did you see Adam Hughes on TV?
Do you want to respond...
"No, you're trying to get me in trouble!"
I'm just trying to get the truth.
"Hey, hey!"
"Tell him the truth, Smash."
Just shut the hell up!
Just shut the hell up!
"Smash, what happened that night?"
Was your sister hitting on him?
Is what he said true?
"Hell, no, that's not true!"
That's not true.
"All right, look, I'll tell you like this."
He was saying some foul things to my sister and I.
"Racial, sexual and threatening."
That's right.
"Kids, your Uncle Marshall definitely doesn't want you to know this, but he also smoked off and on."
"It all started when he was 13, on a camping trip in Minnesota."
"Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate."
It's summer vacation.
"Okay, but just one."
This is my first and last cigarette ever.
"And that was the first of many, many ""last cigarettes ever."""
That's it.
"I am done, I am out."
Last...
Cigarette ev-arrh!
"So, by that point, I'd heard it all before."
Last cigarette ever.
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked in six months.
Is this about the McRib?
"It's gone, dude, let it go."
"I'm worried about work, okay?"
"They just hired a new head of the legal department, and he's going to be letting people go."
So that's why you're worried?
The new head of the legal department is Arthur Hobbes.
"As in ""Artillery Arthur""?"
As in your former boss?
Arthur Hobbes was the meanest boss
Marshall or anyone else had ever had.
"The last time Marshall worked for him, it ended like this."
I quit!
Yikes.
So does he hold it against you?
Worse.
"I'm sorry, who are you?"
"I'm, I'm Marshall Eriksen."
"Well, I was mistaken."
I've got a pretty good steak knife...
Just try to help.
"You go out the front door, you hook a right."
"Then walk three blocks straight down, its on this side of the street."
You can't miss it.
- I'll go Daze.
- Why can't I?
"Because you look 12, and I've an ID."
We might actually checked in this part of town.
"Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone, and remember what I said."
Okay.
You guys need anything?
"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"I'm not supposed to really talk to you anymore, so..."
"Oh, wait!"
I think you got a phone message.
"But that's all I'm sayin', now I'm gonna zip."
You have one new message.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone...
Me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time.
Maybe three years.
What?
An he's coming out swinging!
Ooh!
"Au revoir, Beautiful Steven."
"Parlez-vous ""Ouch""?"
"Now, a commercial."
- [Clink]
"- Oh, Arthur, there you are."
So nice to have company to watch TV with.
[Sniffs]
Brace yourself while corporate America tries to sell us its wretched things.
[Man on TV] I like jackhammering.
"I' better, I o it all ay long."
It's a man's job an I work up a man-size sweat on my brow.
[Woman] You sure o.
[Man] But I'm not afrai to pamper myself with a plush tissue when my brow nees a goo wiping.
[Woman] Plush?
"Here, big fella, sample my tissue."
I'll show you a tissue sample.
[Thrakkorzog] Fetch me a tissue sample from the Tick.
- [Suit squeaks] - [Toilet flushes]
Hm. [chuckles]
Knew I'd regret that burrito.
"Hey, what's happening here?"
"Uh, the little bunny guy was chafing himself on the ropes,"
- so I loosened him up a bit.
- You what?
He's a moth guy and how many times do I have to say it?
Don't touch my stuff!
This is my side of the living room and that is your side of the living room.
And must you drink straight out of the milk carton?
It's disgusting!
"Rally, Beautiful Steven, rally!"
"Boys, I'd like to introduce you to Ramases, he's on work experience."
"Hey, guys."
Cool office.
"I'm giving him a tour of the company, starting with the talking turds in the copy room and working up."
We should press on before we catch worms.
"Could I stay and play the jug game for a bit, please?"
"No, we're going to the grain store."
"Chop, chop!"
Have you thought about my request for a chair with back support?
"I have, and if the problem persists, I will take steps..."
It will - ..to hire a copier with a stronger back.
Right.
"I'm sure I'll manage, then."
Good-oh.
It's so bloody demeaning.
Even that gimpy work-experience kid is treated better than us.
You can say that again.
"He's got a sedan chair, look!"
Hup!
"Oi, Ramases!"
"It's Stylax and Marcus, the talking turds."
"Oh, hey, guys."
Is this sedan chair yours?
"It's my dad's, actually."
I sort of crashed my one taking it off-road.
Holy shit!
"I know, it was really stupid and I've learned my lesson."
"My dad's one's way bigger, though, if you guys need a lift."
All right.
Who's the flat-top?
This is Ramases.
He's Egyptian.
Hold this.
"If you find life so valuable, why not give a murderer what he deserves?"
For whom?
Who asked for this?
Arie.
-Arie hasn't asked anything.
It's us who wanted revenge.
-You owe it to your children.
They're 6 and 8 years old.
How does it benefit them if we kill a 60 year old man?
To warn them.
"When they'll be 30, they'll make their own stupid mistakes."
Because we set a bad example.
We have to get the ones who weren't caught.
And who will we bring back to life again by doing that?
Arie?
If we don't tell them that murder never pays... they won't learn anything from our war.
They don't want to learn from our war.
The only thing history teaches us is that we don't learn from it.
I want that!
"-No, me!"
Let me introduce my wife.
This is an old friend of mine.
Ab Spoelstra.
He suddenly dropped in.
I'm Tine.
-I'm Ab.
So sweet that you've already prepared everything.
They love a game of bite the cake.
"You'll stay here, won't you, Cees?"
They're counting on you.
He's so good with the children.
That was really funny how that guy smacked you.
Give him his rights.
Now that we're spending all this quality time together... let me tell you about your rights.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court oflaw.
"If you do not have an attorney, one will be assigned to you."
Do you understand all the rights I have read to you right now?
- Yes.
- Good boy.
Now shut up.!
- How's it look?
How's it look?
- It's beautiful.
Know what happens to pretty boys like you when they go to prison after the lights go out?
"""Oh, girlfriend.!"
"Oh, girlfriend.!"""
Shots fired.!
- Uncuff him now!
- What?
What the hell?
What in God's name?
"Have you lost your mind, young lady?"
I said uncuff Jack Hammond now!
"Come on, Miss Voss."
Put the gun down.
You don't know what you're doing.
This guy's brainwashed you.
Now come on.
"- Ned, get a shot of this!"
"- Natalie, stop embarrassing me."
"Do it, or I'll blow his brains out all over live TV."
"Miss Voss, don't do it."
Into the jungle!
- Hurry up!
Run away!
- I'm staying with you.
Idiot!
Do you want to die?
"Just drop everything and hide, for God's sake!"
We must help them.
We can't stand by and watch.
They're going to kill everyone.
"- We must do something, for Christ's sake!"
- We must go.
I can't jeopardise our plan.
"I know you don't understand, but more people would die than those whom we can't help right now."
I can't just stand by and watch.
I'm going back to the village.
"Right, let's continue."
Mum!
Mum!
- Dad...
- Be quiet!
Take him away from here.
"Come on, let's get back."
"Capitán, we've searched the entire village."
There's not a single guerrillero among the dead.
They've managed to escape.
"Once they're in the jungle, we'll never catch them."
Those bastards are creeping away like millipedes.
"Carry on, but don't take any prisoners."
"My patience is nearly exhausted, Silveira."
These leaflets are flooding the country.
It is your job to prevent that.
Who cares?
My Leno was great.
This is the guy that you hate.
So sad.
Wow this thing is everywhere.
"Hannah and Jesse, America's new sweethearts."
"Good night, everybody."
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.
"Oh great I just took over ""most viewed"" from ""Kitty Kat Flushing a Toilet."""
Uh that just means that you're bigger than.
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
[Whispers] You should be proud.
What was I thinking inviting Jesse back in the band?
I mean Hannah's irresistible.
There's no way that he could.
Go against her feminine charms.
I just want to go home put the wig on.
And smack that home wrecker in the face.
You know as much as I'd love to see how that works.
I think you're freaking out for no reason.
I mean you can still date Jesse as Miley just not in public.
Why does my life have to be so complicated?
Oh yeah.
Poor little most famous 17-year-old in the whole world.
Now will you just focus on the positives okay?
We're both going to college together we both have wonderful boyfriends.
-Except for you're more...
-No.
No cracks about Oliver until I find something.
Equally embarrassing about Jesse.
But sometimes we're so focused on finding our happy ending  we don't learn how to read the signs.
How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't.
The ones who will stay from the ones who will leave.
- Hi.
- Hi.
GIGI:
And maybe this happy ending doesn't include a wonderful guy.
Maybe it's you  on your own  picking up the pieces and starting over.
Freeing yourself up for something better in the future.
Maybe the happy ending is just  moving on.
"Baby, what are you doing?"
It's our turn.
Forget the dip.
"Come on, come on."
MAN:
"Let's go, Alex."
"Come on, Alex, your turn."
Ready?
LOL.
Laugh out loud!
We won!
GIGI:
Or maybe the happy ending is this:
"Knowing that through all the unreturned phone calls and broken hearts  through all the blunders and misread signals  through all of the pain and embarrassment  you never, ever gave up hope."
NEIL:
Now that we are married...
BETH:
We're gonna move.
Gonna move.
That's one thing we're gonna do.
Another thing we're gonna do is move a little further away from...
- Baltimore?
She might even... thinks she'll keep you alive for some silly reasons.
Kids...
"- May I ask you a question, Violet?"
- You may ask.
You ever miss the doll house?
Not particularly.
"And I think I know what you're driving at, mister."
"But this job never got to me, aside from the sensational rush to the action."
- What about those men?
- What men?
The ones you killed.
"That, was fucking magical."
Did you see that?
"It's a bit early to know, but career wise... that little miracle might be my Monalisa."
If not my Billie Jean.
- Actually...
- Do you have any family?
What?
Do you have any family?
- What a random question.
"- Well, do you?"
Daisy is like family.
You didn't answer the question.
I got a father somewhere.
What's with the interview?
When's the last time you and he spoke?
- What do you care?
- That long huh?
- Are you afraid of what's next?
- Me getting shot?
I mean after that.
I haven't thought about it.
- (Foster) Good evening.
(Cissy) Hello.
(Poppy) Hello.
- What your name?
- Jock McGregor.
Jock McGregor.
Do come in.
"I'm Cissy Meldrum, this is my sister Poppy."
I-I won't shake hands.
A kid were sucking' a stick of toffee on the bus and it went all over the handrails.
"Ooh, aren't you strong?"
Your muscles are bursting out of that suit.
"It fits you very well, of course."
You develop muscles when you work for a living.
May I say what an honour it is to be invited to your beautiful home.
We think it's a bit old-fashioned but you can't shift Daddy.
We know that fine at the factory.
"I'm serving drinks, who wants stout and who wants raspberryade?"
"Nonsense, Ivy, I'll mix some cocktails."
"Now, who fancies a white lady?"
"It's going to be agony, George."
They could stop for hours.
How will we get rid of them?
Don't worry.
I've invited the bishop after dinner.
One look at his dog collar and they'll be off.
"Ah, hello, everybody."
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
"Oh, not at all, my lord."
"I was just saying what an honour it is, and a privilege,"
- to be invited to your beautiful home.
- Ah.
In Benigno's house?
Yes.
Why are you living there?
Benigno is dead.
"One day, you and I should talk."
"Yes, and it will be simpler than you think."
Nothing is simple.
I'm a ballet mistress and nothing is simple.
TALK TO HER
The stage is full of wooden chairs and tables.
"Two women come out, wearing slips."
"Their eyes are closed, like two sleepwalkers."
You're scared they'll bump into everything.
"But suddenly, a man appears, with such a sad face."
The saddest I've ever seen.
And he knocks all the chairs and tables out of their way.
You can't imagine how moving it was!
"There was a man sitting beside me, in his forties, good-looking."
"He cried several times, from emotion."
I can understand why.
It was so beautiful!
I have a surprise for you!
I got Pina Bausch's autograph for you.
I had to buy the photo.
It's in English.
"It means: ""I hope you overcome all your obstacles and start dancing."""
"- Look, she's got her period."
- It's early.
Good evening.
"Benigno, could you stay tonight?"
My sister can't stay with the kids and I've got no one else.
WOMAN:
"Oh, my God."
It's okay.
Come on!
I'll take care of you.
Come on.
MARY:
It's okay.
Keep coming.
I'll take care of you all.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Keep coming.
I'll take care of you.
Come on.
( laughs )
ALLIE:
Miss Crawford.
I'm ready to go with you now.
Little girl...
I love the way your mind works.

The Conquest Of The Pole
The conquest of the North pole Fantastic aerial journey over north sea and north pole.
Fantastic film in two parts.
Part I
The scholars of the whole world meet to discuss a means for the reaching of the north pole.
A delegation of Suffragettes seeks to interrupt in vain the serious work of the meeting
"The meeting selects the committee, which will have the honor to take in the marvelous airplane of professor Klaps Platz"
"The professor demonstrates his flight apparatus, which is to reach the glaciers of the north pole"
In ways that I often thought I had imagined.
"I used to love the smell of her perfume,"
The-the tenor of her voice...
"Even now,"
When she lied to me.
She doesn't want us getting married.
She will stop it.
We have to elope.
Today.
Now.
Bash:
"There's a church just east of the old village, by the quarry."
I wish that I could come with you.
Let me get it
All arranged.
"It might take a few hours,"
"And if we're both missing, people will notice."
"If I'm not back by midday, we have our priest."
Get on a horse and meet me at the church before sunset.
"Don't plan on sleeping this night, wife."
Marie:
At least you're moving about
Freely now.
"Guarded, but with the mobility"
Required to plan my death.
How was the dungeon?
Were there fleas?
"Were you paraded through the town, mocked?"
Hmm.
I was in the tower.
"I realize you're not happy with the turn events have taken,"
But must you paint a bleaker picture of my fall?
How's Jai?
I hope he gets his degree and settles down
Come in with the chequebook
We've been childhood friends.
Don't hesitate about money... if it concerns Jai's education.
He's my brother too
Please sign there
Here's a million.
ForJai.
Repayable when able
You have taken God's place for me on earth
How's Jagadish?
- Jagadish?
"Oh, he's fine"
"I'm sure he's going to make it bigger than Jai, despite his education here"
He's so fast!
Not even I can catch up with him.
He wants to outpace time
You'll know more once the principal has noted your attendance record
Do you know how many classes you attended this semester?
What a brilliant record!
You will see the principal at nine am tomorrow
Stop going around with that bunch.
"- I'll try to, sir"
Jags!
I'm dead!
Dad will kill me!
Why...?
Only you can do something!
We'll see tomorrow
Where are you going?
To class
Ha-ha!
Boom!
You suck!
"Yeah, this is better than a cruise."
"I know you're disappointed, but we should be here in case Cleveland needs us."
Even though our bags are already packed and our non-refundable tickets are right there.
And that taxi's waiting outside.
(honking) 'Ey!
You vashlooks order a cab?
"Well, we could just take a ride in the cab with our bags, see where it goes."
We at least owe it to our bags to put them in the cab.
"Screw it, let's go."
"I guess everything I do is for him, just to hear him say, ""I'm proud of you."""
Your father?
"No, Bradley Cooper."
"Well, we've made some progress."
You guys are out of your minds.
I'm going to take a shower.
Anybody want to take a shower?
All right.
I do.
This is ridiculous.
I don't belong here.
(ship's horn blares)
I belong on that cruise!
We're getting out of here.
And here's how...
CLEVELAND:
The orderlies' shift change is at 12:32 exactly.
"Tim, that's when you'll hack into the mainframe, disabling the security cameras."
(cracks knuckles)
(roars)
"Yes, it is."
"Inside this skull is another universe... the biggest, scariest haunted house of them all."
"Elmer, will you hurry up and tell Dr. Hook how profound he is... so we can get inside this poor guy's noggin and reduce the cranial pressure?"
"Anyway, after I've paused to reflect on the gravity of what it is I am about to do... and only after I've done that, do I proceed with my mission."
"Yes, Doctor."
"Steady as you go, Otto."
"Patient to Nine, Neuro."
Standing by.
"You'll be fine, Mrs. D."
"Yeah, I will."
You tell Bobby not to worry.
Bye-bye.
These things are so slow.
Mommy.
Someone was crying in the Children's Ward?
"We call it Paediatrics these days, Mrs. Druse."
"Well, whatever you call it, it sounded like it was right on top of the elevator."
A little girl.
I see.
It's very hard to get a place in here.
A gusher!
Mop.
"Irrigation people, come on."
Don't let this man drown.
"Come on, you're up, Elmer."
"Jump in here, please."
- That's not my job.
- Your union steward is not on duty today.
"If you wouldn't mind jumping in, right about now."
"Come on, son."
Right there.
Very nice.
College is gonna be so much fun!
Totes.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
"When you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history."
You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
- Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
A trigger-happy girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
"...family, too..."
"Hey, is that your mom again?"
...if you're desperate....
"Someone needs your help, Michael."
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
"That's how we do it, people."
"Bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere."
Put the weapon down.
Hands on your head!
"Listen to me, Michael."
Gray shot your brother.
He murdered Nate.
"Michael, what happened?"
"Card's dead, Fi."
Now we need a way out of here.
- and I can't help feeling that...
- It wasn't your fault.
It was his.
Son of a bitch never did anything without a plan.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he wanted this.
What are you doing with your hand?
"Maybe he wanted us to, you know, be partners."
Think I'm going to be sick.
I think Snart knew.
"He knew that I'd keep an eye out for you, and you'd keep an eye out for me."
While doing what?
What we haven't finished doing.
What was H.G. Wells' childhood nickname?
- Bertie.
- Incredible.
You've gotten every answer correct tonight.
Since when did you become such a history buff?
I guess I developed a passion for it recently.
During your sabbatical?
You hardly ever talk about it.
Martin?
"I know, I'm sorry."
"My sabbatical was, um..."
I left some very important work unfinished.
"Ship's not going to be here, Gray."
"We saw it take off, remember?"
"Yes, and in doing so, it would have left..."
Quantum signature.
That's what I've been trying to tell Mick.
- Radio beacon.
- Quantum entangler.
-I got it!
"-Hey, ten days!"
"Wait, I can be out of here tomorrow morning, in Chicago, and outside of her dressing..."
"Hey, come on, fellas, I'm a little, you know..."
"-Sarge, I'm tapped out."
"-Me, too."
What a time.
"Men, freeze."
"Freeze, you heroes."
"Men, I may have seemed a little harsh with you."
It's only because I was mad at myself for forgetting to tell you the new thing I thought up for you.
It's only a buck a throw-- my new snack-in-the-sack raffle.
Snack-in-the-sack raffle?
What's that?
Just what it says.
The guy who wins gets his breakfast served in bed for ten days.
"How about it, boys?"
"-But Sarge, we're broke."
"-Busted, not a dime."
It's a miracle how this platoon is always broke at the same...
"Zimmerman, on the double, right here."
"Yeah, but Sarge, you told me..."
Right here.
"Now, Herman, you're not going to take me serious all the time, are you?"
I want this.
I want these deadheads to look at a real live wire.
This boy's not broke all the time.
Why?
"'Cause he's on the hustle, he thinks up things, washes officers' cars at a buck a throw."
He's all right.
(chuckles)
"How much did you make, Herman?"
I expect to be able to see the sea.
You can see the sea.
It's over there between the land and the sky.
I need a telescope to see that.
"Well, may I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea?"
Or preferably in it?
Right.
"Now, listen to me."
"I'm not satisfied, but I've decided to stay here."
"However, I shall expect a reduction."
"Why, because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment?"
"Because the room is cold, the bath is too small, the view is invisible, and the radio doesn't work."
"No, the radio works."
You don't.
What?
"I'll see if I can fix it, you scabby old bat."
- I think we got something then.
- What?
I think we got something then!
What are you doing?
Qué?
"Madam, don't think me rude, but may I ask, do you by any chance have a hearing aid?"
A what?
A hearing aid!
"Yes, I do have a hearing aid."
Would you like me to get it mended?
!
Mended?
It's working perfectly all right.
"No, it isn't!"
I haven't got it turned on at the moment.
- Why not?
What's up?
I don't know.
Sounds kind of phony to me.
"Hello, is that you, Sam?"
Thompson.
"Say, uh, Sam, I just had a long-distance from Gargan."
"Yeah, he sounded kind of funny."
Is there anything wrong?
Is there anything wrong?
"Oh, not very much."
Only Gargan put a bullet into one of his monkeys.
What?
Sure.
"And from the dope I get, he's hiding out."
And they're trying to keep it quiet.
"But if the guy dies, you'll never see that deputy again."
Out of the state on business.
A conference with the governor.
Giving me orders.
"Why, that dirty, little crook."
"When I go to the penitentiary, I'll throw peanuts at him."
- What did he do?
- Nothing.
"He just put a bullet in somebody, that's all."
And he has the gall to--
Let me look at those accounts for the last two months.
We're going to make up for lost time.
You ain't on the level about me going back to that hospital again.
"- Yeah, get back there."
- But I've been there 40 times.
Forty more.
"After two weeks, they don't know if the guy will live or not."
"Now, we've made a lot of plans and I won't let you upset them."
I want some money.
Fast.
"Letha, we are worlds apart."
My mind is filled with large concepts.
"Mankind, the universe."
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.
"Sure, I gamble But with my own money."
You're the worst kind of gambler.
You use other people's money
And want to keep all the winnings for yourself.
"Well, you can be sure of one thing, Victor."
I'll be around to pick up the chips with you.
- [wires pop and sizzle] - [Tony moans] [panting] [grunting]
We'll be back in the morning with maps and breakfast.
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.
And I'll bring some day-old bread.
- I'll bring some milk for you.
- Thank you.
- You're good friends.
- That's the trouble with us.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"[crusher] see you tomorrow, Tia."
[muscles] we'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"[Rocky] let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
[sighs]
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
I always admired that.
"You'd walk into a burning building, save your worst enemy."
"Time to save yourself now, Dad."
Okay?
Walk into the light.
It's okay.
Don't worry about us.
We're gonna be fine.
You don't have to suffer.
You did your job.
"Take care of yourself, Pop."
I love you.
Walk into the light.
Bye.
So you know if your dad could talk right now he'd tell you you were acting like a big pussy?
"Thanks, Mom."
- I love you.
- Love you too.
"You did good, man."
"No matter what happens, you'll know you did right by your dad."
"I don't even know if he could hear me, but I guess it needed to be said, right?"
"Johnny, I'm so proud of you."
"Being able to cry in front of your dad like that, that's huge."
Who told you I cried?
Hank.
"Your mom ratted you out, bro."
She was taking prop bets on whether or not you'd cry.
She lost big on that one.
You got a big mouth.
I'm serious.
"I really do think that this is a big step for you, Johnny."
Life is so much richer when you allow yourself to tap into some vulnerability.
What's this noise are you outside?
What are you doing out so late?
- We have run away from there...
We are on our way to Delhi.
Run away!
What do you mean you have run away!
Have you gone mad!
What the hell is going on there?
I'll explain everything once I reach.
I told you to stay on for a few days!
Can't you understand that much?
Are you little children!
"Brother, please don't get angry...the warden."
What did she do?
"Sonu, tell me what happened?"
She got drunk and came in Chhoti's room...
Was trying to slip into her bed.
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
You both take care of yourselves...
Do you have money?
Yes.
"Call me as soon as your reach, I will come and get you."
"Here, gulp it down."
Johnny bhai.
Could you lend me some money?
I will return it soon.
Money?
If I had any money saved do you think I would have been stuck in this city.
I would have gone away to Mauritius long back!
I live off the dead!
I bury one corpse to get one meal!
I am surviving because people die in this city everyday.
- Yep.
Here you go.
Thanks.
It's all old folks.
Not an asshole in sight.
Should we just go?
You know...
"Hey, does ""wheat"""
"sound anything like ""sourdough""?"
"You know, put a nickel in it, honey."
Assholes trump old people.
Good amendment.
It's a living document.
Mustard dip.
Ready?
The mustard dip... a simple yet effective small-time con.
- You know the secret to making toast?
"- Pick a mark with a calm,"
- easygoing temperament.
- You toast it!
"Next, casually spill a condiment of your choosing on your unsuspecting mark."
"Here, let me give you a hand."
"Now, in one simple, fluid motion, remove your mark's jacket."
This should be done without effort or aggression.
"Finally, extract the wallet just as your partner appears to seamlessly abscond with it."
Perfect in elegance and simplicity.
This man stole my wallet!
Well done.
Whoa.
"No, he did not."
Here...
It's here.
It's a meeting about having me replaced on the ticket.
I know how to count to 270.
"John, I assure you..."
"I assure you that if it were a serious notion, we would..."
- Texas is gone.
So is Florida.
- We're not doing it.
- You should think about it.
- Are you taking your name off that bill?
Nobody benefits from the Internet right now more than the rural poor.
You're taking your name off.
We can't campaign on it.
"- Yes, sir."
- And if somebody's attacking us you know what to do.
I call Leo.
"Yeah, but don't discount the possibility that it might be Leo."
"Yes, sir."
"John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you a little more than you thought I did."
But that's not why you're staying.
It's this.
Four words.
I've always liked you more than you thought I did too.
"Just a little, right?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Me too.
Anything else?
"- Thank you, Mr. President."
"- Thank you, sir."
Charlie!
"- Yes, sir."
- Let's go.
I'm a magic man.
Daddy?
"Your dad has a broken pelvis, which are the ring of bones around his waist."
Some of his blood vessels have also been damaged.
He's bleeding inside.
Can you fix it?
"We're gonna try, but he's lost a lot of blood already."
It's very serious.
It was supposed to be me.
"I was supposed to go get the pizza, but I-I... didn't want to go out in the rain."
"It's not your fault, and it's not your dad's fault."
"Hey, jerk-off!"
I can't drive for a week.
Not that I could anyway-- my car is totaled.
What was so important you had to be talking on the phone while driving!
Come on!
What was so damn important!
Hey!
That's enough!
"- Hey, get that guy away from me!"
- Shut up!
.
"Jason, hey, I know you're mad, but your father's condition is very serious, and your brother and sister need you right now, okay?"
"Come on, Jason, I'll take you to the Family Room."
"Dr. Kovac, one of your patients is getting agitated."
- Which one?
T- he girl from the nursing home.
"- She's in a coma, Inez."
- Not anymore.
- Where...
- I'm Dr. Kovac.
Wh-Where's my mom?
"Okay, keep your hands up as if you were holding a tray."
What ?
"Oh, no !"
A rabbit ?
"I found him in the garage, and he was limping."
Let me see.
Careful.
"Baby, come here."
Let me see.
"You know, he seems like he's okay."
Maybe it's just a sprain.
"No, I can't take a chance, okay ?"
I have to go get him help.
"Summer, you can't."
It's too dangerous.
"I cannot wait here any longer, okay ?"
I have a missing boyfriend and a sick rabbit.
I cannot listen to any more of your mother's whining.
"Okay, I'll go with you."
We'll brave the zombies together.
"Mom, we're going to need to take Pancakes to the hospital."
Wait.
"This carrion gets help, but not me ?"
"We don't have a car, you can't walk."
There is no way to get you there.
"Taylor, I risked my life and hoofed it all the way from Emerald Bay, and you're just going to leave me here to rot ?"
"I have an idea, but I don't think you're going to like it."
This is not okay with me.
"Well, I told you you wouldn't like it."
"Mom, it's not that far to the hospital, and it's kind of this or nothing."
"Fine, but I'm not holding the rabbit... unless you promise I can make a vest out of him."
Okay.
I'll carry Pancakes.
We'll find a way.
Just as soon as he has the company making money again.
Wait a minute.
John!
"Oh, hello, my dear."
And Harold.
Nice to see you again.
"How are you, John?"
All I know is what my psychiatrist tells me.
He says you're entirely well.
And it's going to be wonderful to have you home.
"Isn't it, Harold?"
It's the best news I've heard in months.
"Well, all packed, I see."
"You know, I'm beginning to think that you never liked this place."
"It's not so bad after you get used to it, Doc."
But you say I'm all right now and my wife wants me home.
"Well, you take care of yourself."
"I don't want to see you back here again, except as a visitor."
"I'll see that he never comes back, Doctor."
"Shall we go, dear?"
"John, if you'll sign this we'll spring you."
"Anything you say, Warden."
That's a fine way to talk.
"Here, I'll take those."
"Oh, I forgot this."
"Well, I think that's everything."
"Mrs. Brown, I'm sorry."
"Your husband won't be able to go with you just now, after all."
I don't understand.
He is not able to leave here now.
But he's completely sane.
So she's Alice.
"David,itis alwayssomething."
whynotme  like to leave with you.
Childrenfall.
Alice?
Why did not you wait presented to you?
Than?
They teach all days in the kids room not to talk to strangers.
Four years old.
How I am supposed to know who you are?
Do you have any idea how much It has taken me time to negotiate just see it unsupervised in a public space?
"- But David, fell off!"
"- Expected more from you, Alice."
I'm sorry...
Alice?
You lied about your name.
The Most swingers do.
"You have an STD, right?"
Do not.
"Worse, you're a journalist."
If you do not understand do you want to talk to me.
"Actually, it's time tell my story."
I have cancer.
Sinus and glands.
"If it removed, not would be nothing left of me."
I tried to get me this blow away.
Did you ever have children?
Good...
"You have to understand that it was the principle of the life of a woman, family planning ..."
Many of us did things that in retrospect ...
Abortion.
Adoption.
She picks up the phone and calls from the house.
"If anybody was listening, they'd know everything."
"They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd even have the time and flight number, thanks to her."
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to keep eye on the stove.
All day long the guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
"You see, I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy."
"Do you think you can come over here, fuck me, and leave?"
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?
Don't talk like that.
Come on.
- You all right?
"- Yeah, sure."
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
- That the last one?
- Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch.
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
- I have to.
- You don't have to.
I got to go home.
"What do you mean, you got to go home?"
I've been carrying this all day.
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I got to go home and get my hat.
"A buddy, someone who cares."
Joey?
You ever have... your best friend...
stab you in the back?
Not since the army became my best friend.
You ever... suddenly feel that you're...
lost... that there's no place left for you to go?
I used to.
That was before the army became my home.
- Oh.
Really?
- Sure.
Think about it.
"The army feeds you, clothes you... gives you a place to sleep."
Every guy in khaki is family.
"Oh, that's... beautiful, Joey."
- The army is beautiful.
- To the army.
Max... you've got character.
- I wouldn't make this offer to just anybody.
- What kind of an offer?
What you need is an anchor... something that won't run out on you.
You know what I'm talking about?
The army.
[Chuckling] Hey.
"You're way ahead of me, Max."
Did you ever think about reenlisting?
Where do I sign?
"Okay, I got somethin' to tell ya... and I don't wanna hear so much as a titter, a snicker..."
- or a guffaw from anyone.
"- You hear that, Charles?"
The subject of this meeting is... the army.
Have you stuck with Jags?
"This is my fifth Jag, my fourth X Jag."
"You know, I'm 59 now."
"I deserve it, don't I?"
I've had a Jag for years.
I'm embarrassed.
I always wanted one.
"The first I got five years ago, I was so proud."
"One day, as a trustee of the Royal Armouries, a priceless collection of arms and armour..."
In Leeds.
"£45m building, the most secure one in Leeds."
"I had to get a parking pass from reception, so I roared up, outside the big glass doors of the armouries, nobody around, opened the door, engine running, and rushed in to get my pass."
I parked at the front as I'm a trustee - who's going to tell me off?
"I pushed this door round, and saw someone getting in to my car."
"I thought, ""They're terrific, the armouries."
"They're valet parking it for me. """
"""Fantastic. """
And then it roared off.
A Jaguar does do 0-60 in five seconds!
"Whoosh, it was gone."
It was nicked?
It was nicked.
Did you ever get it back?
I got it back about ten days later.
It was OK.
They'd used the ashtrays...
"Oh, no."
"And they'd retuned the radio from Radio 4, so I was a bit annoyed."
"Anyway, I did get it back and it was OK."
"But a year later,"
"I went on a charity visit to Armley Jail in Leeds, we were being shown round and they echo, these prisons, have you been in one?"
Yeah.
"I was wearing a brown tie last night, not a red one."
This was a red one with a little figure on it.
I don't own such a--
Wait a minute.
- Was the figure sort of gray?
- That's right.
I think that's one of the ones I left at the office.
"Sure, that's it."
"You know, in case-- in case I lined up something kind of special."
"At the office, where anyone might have taken it?"
Yeah.
I mean no.
"A couple of months ago,"
Sandy spilled some soup and-- that's it.
That's the tie I loaned to Sandy.
"Beth, I have to see him."
Everything points in one direction.
Now if you want me to help your husband before the police get here--
"Perry, I don't know what I want-- just time to think, please."
"Beth, stop that sniveling."
You don't have to pretend to be loyal.
"Mr. Sandover, you went out to Lita Krail's cottage last night, didn't you?"
She lied to me.
She was up to something;
trying to get you into trouble.
She said she'd meet me in Phoenix.
She lied to me.
I bought a new sport coat.
I told her things-- things I never told anyone.
You thought she cared for you.
"What did she do, laugh at you?"
I didn't give her the chance.
Find anything?
I've been over the entire school twice.
No sulphur.
"No sulphur, no demon."
"No demon, no case."
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.
"Well, it happens to the best of us."
"I say we hit the road, huh?"
But after lunch.
It's sloppy-jo day.
"Good hustle, Colby!"
Walk it off!
"Hey, I need to copy of your algebra homework again."
Hey!
Why?
"'Cause you're a stupid, brain-dead dick?"
"I'm gonna shove my fist down your throat, you little freak."
- That fist?
- Yeah.
What happened?
How's the nonviolence assembly going?
"Apparently, shoving a kid's arm into a cuisine art is not a healthy display of anger."
"So, the kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?"
Which only comes from a seriously pissed-off spirit.
It's got to be ghost possession.
"Yeah, but that's pretty rare."
"Yeah, but it happens."
"I mean, they get angry enough, they can take control of a person's body."
"All right, so, what, we got a ghost in the building?"
"Yeah, but where?"
"I mean, there's no EMF."
- Don't worry.
- I just have to solve this quickly.
- How are you going to do that?
He's ten times sneakier than you.
What is going on between you two?
He's trying to frame me for something that he did.
What?
Did he... do anything to harm a person?
Is that what this blood is from?
Go home.
We never should have taken his money.
"It's all because of me, isn't it?"
I kept nagging about our loans and the lesson fees...
- All I talked about was money...
- Don't say that...
What family doesn't struggle with money?
If I didn't scare you with my words...
You would have cut that Park Seon Woo out of your life earlier.
But I didn't know anything.
I just got excited when I saw money.
This is all because of me...
We're a family.
Why do we have to throw blame around?
Don't worry.
Just go home.
Justice will prevail.
Remember that.
"You can come home by tomorrow morning, right?"
It's Soo Bin's birthday...
We should blow out the candles together.
Then of course I will.
"Hey, let me go!"
I'll have to get you a wedding present.
"Oh, no, no, please."
You don't have to do that.
"So, you're a sophomore?"
Yeah.
Are you a freshman somewhere?
"No, I'm a senior."
In high school.
I'll be going to college next year.
I hope.
Great.
You're gonna love it.
I love it.
Great.
"So, do you, like, have a boyfriend or anything?"
No.
"I went out with this guy recently, but he's a jock."
You know how jocks are.
"It was just, you know, a physical thing, I guess."
"For him, anyway."
"Actually, I don't really know how that is."
"I've only really dated Ricky and a couple of other guys, but no jocks."
"Well, I mean, Ricky is a jock, right?"
He's an amazing baseball player.
Or did he give that up?
"Yeah, I guess he did give it up."
"Oh, man, he was playing for this team one summer and they were going to nationals and he had a no-hit season going."
It was unprecedented.
His name is probably on some plaque or something.
And then he drew a bunch of body parts on the bases.
"Like first base for first base, second base for second..."
"Yeah, I get it."
But the guys without motivation always get sucked into them.
So what should the guys with no motivation do?
"Unlike Sion, I've never wanted to be involved in troublesome things like changing the country."
Is there some place where I could just take afternoon naps and live my life without hurting anyone?
What?
Hey...
"Kiefer, did I say something strange?"
Are you almost ready?
"Oh, right!"
"Okay, Kiefer, come here a second."
- What?
"- Go on, go on."
Congratulations to you for your release.
Congratulations to me for my imprisonment.
- What's this?
"- Do you agree with this, as your request?"
Perfect.
Deal concluded.
What's this all about?
Written orders.
Release of Kiefer Knolles in exchange for Ryner Lute's imprisonment.
Who are you?
A fiend so great who can make direct deals with the military?
Not really.
"Why would you do that, Ryner?"
I betrayed everyone.
I got everyone killed...
People don't kill people.
Monsters do.
War is a monster.
Kingdoms are monsters.
Greed is a monster.
- How about her?
How about the new girl?
- No.
"I mean, I don't know her."
Shut up.
"Look, I want someone I know, someone who knows me, someone who we know each other, someone like, uh..."
Topanga!
"Topanga, my honey."
- May I call you honey?
- No.
"Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend."
"Believe me, I don't want this any more than you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together."
"Cory, my dear little butthead..."
May I call you butthead?
Sure.
- I can't walk through life with you.
- Is there someone else?
There's everybody else.
Why?
"We're already standing together, and we look great."
"Oh, come on."
Work with me here.
"Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love."
"Then, after a week, they hate each other."
"So for one great passionate week, we'd lose a friendship that could last a lifetime."
- I'm in if you are.
"- Cory, don't worry."
I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
Gimme a name!
"- For the record, I dumped her."
- That's how I saw it.
"Well, Dubin's out sick again."
Then it became the TV show for HBO and that took you to Hollywood.
Yeah.
How did that come about?
"We did the Conchords on HBO, so even that was very popular."
"It was on a cable channel, so there were so many millions of people that never saw it, but of course, when it came out on DVD, a lot of people saw it after that."
On the one DVD?
There's two DVDs now.
You pass the DVDs around?
We pass them round.
Yeah.
So all the cast and crew saw it.
"And then word got out, you see."
It was big in the comedy circles.
You're familiar with those circles.
"Yes, I am."
"We're going to talk more in a little minute, but just sit back and relax now and please welcome the very, very funny Charlie Baker!"
APPLAUSE
Hello!
That's very nice of you.
That's enough.
I might be rubbish!
"Hello, I'm Charlie Baker."
I'm waiting for Jack Black to die.
LAUGHTER
I've only ever met a couple of very famous people.
"Jay-Z, Jay-Z, the world's biggest rapper, Jay-Z."
"I don't know about you, but if I see someone famous, I have a little voic in the back of my head that goes, ""There's Jay-Z there."
"""There's Jay-Z, the world's biggest rapper."
There he is.
"""Go and speak to Jay-Z."
Go on.
"""Say something to him."
Tell her I'm pleased about her and the plumber.
It's handy to have a man with a trade about the house.
She deserves a bit of happiness.
"I know I was never the father you needed or deserved, but you will always be my beautiful girl  and I will always love you."
Always... always... always.
He still had six weeks in solitary.
"If people don't respect the law, what have you got?"
"Anarchy, mob rule, and mice in your garibaldis."
What are you going on about?
You think his mouse brothers come and busted him out?
Mind you...
I think I can see a tunnel.
Ooh...
Back already?
Ahh... there's your culprit.
- A bleeding' heart liberal like Paul.
- What?
"Yeah, that's it."
"He's got the hump about that three-and-out thing, and he's come down here and he's let Mickey have it away on his toes."
"That's your man, Victor."
He even looks guilty.
It was a joke.
We were having a laugh.
What you talking about?
You know.
"The rule, the big game, three and out."
- What about it?
- You know what?
I think he believed us.
"You knew it was a joke... a wind-up, didn't you?"
What?
You actually fell for it?
"Come on, get out."
Quickly.
Be as quiet as possible.
What a surprise!
I studied in Fuente Nueva as well.
I wasn't there for long.
I studied for one semester and...
Padre Julio!
"Come on, señora, I think one of the men is dying."
Hurry up!
I was about to change the bandage when I noticed he was unconscious.
- Probably internal bleedings.
- Yes.
"- Padre Miguel, I want to tell you something."
- We must operate immediately.
Prepare everything.
"Nurse, I think there's enough plasma left."
"Yes, I'll go and get it, Padre."
Come on.
You ungodly lot!
How dare you threaten me with guns in the house of the Lord?
You're protecting rebels in the name of your Lord.
How many?
We're not protecting them.
They turned up out of the blue.
Some were injured.
What else could we do?
They carry guns like you.
You'd better be sensible.
"Being a priest, I'm sure you detest lies."
Where are the rebels' guards positioned?
You must promise not to kill them.
"Is there some new event, some change?"
No.
No.
I just thought...
"You've just been drinking to calm your nerves, huh?"
"It is your nerves, isn't it?"
Perhaps you should see a doctor.
No.
"No, I don't need a doctor."
"Would you like to have some wine, sir?"
I'll get you another glass.
Dr. Jekyll's a good man.
"Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll."
- Is he?
- Yes.
Yes.
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.
Yes.
Yes.
"""A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir wouldn't be knowing such a person."" No."
"""I ain't such a bad looker, sir, when I'm more myself. "" Yes."
"He's the kind of man you can get down on your knees to, isn't he?"
"A sweet, dear, pure man that you can trust and believe."
"He's a smug, hypocritical coward, that's what he is!"
- You couldn't know him!
- I know him intimately.
And I detest him intimately from his lofty brain to the soles of his virtuous feet!
"And you, you..."
"""I'll do anything you ask, sir."""
"Well, you saw him, didn't you?"
You saw the respectable fool.
Getting Scott to sell the bar wasn't going so well.
This place has been in my familyfor 112 years.
I promised by grandfather I'd come back and run it.
"So, the huge deal my dad had worked on for a year fell through."
I'm not going to repeat what he's saying there.
Let's just say my dad pretty much hates Scott.
But I kind of like him.
Enough to sneak out of work to do this.
"I got to tell you, you turned out to be a pretty good motorcycle passenger."
"Well, it involves two skills I'm good at-- sitting and not dying."
"Come on, give yourself more credit than that."
"You leaned with the turns, you didn't put your hands over my eyes and shout ""Guess who?"""
Just that once.
I got a little bored when you did that wheelie on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Well...
I guess I should go.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Alex, fantastic news."
"Julian, hello."
My upstairs neighbor.
This is Scott.
"Well, this is awkward."
"Two people about to kiss, and I'm not one of them."
"Well, I have a tavern to get back to."
Okay.
- See ya.
- See ya.
I'm sorry if I ruined your moment there.
"Oh, that's okay."
"So, what's your big news?"
"Would you be disturbed, or would you welcome it?"
Is that a special move I'm not aware of?
"Tell me, does it feel... does it feel tight, is there reverb?"
"Whoa, wow, we, uh, we can come back."
"Oh, no, no, no, I was just trying to see if my butt had changed since college."
"- Well, this is 40."
"- Oh, God."
"- Hi, baby girl, are you hungry?"
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Dive in.
- Ahh-ooh.
We got some carrots.
"Uh, hey, Mags, might I have a word?"
"Uh, yes, you might."
"Well, it's been approximately six weeks since we took Joanie and Cha-Chi to the carwash."
- Are you talking about sex?
"- Geez, Maggie, the baby..."
What?
"That's how she got here, right?"
"Anyway, since that wonderful night, I've been feeling..."
"Oh, no, no, hey, Bruce, we talked about this, right?"
- It was just the one night.
"- Oh, no, no, it's not that."
"- It's, uh, I met somebody."
"- Oh, okay, good."
"- I mean, that's great, yes."
"- Her name is Nancy, and it's been fast and furious, like the first movie, not the other seven, which I feel don't hold up."
"- Okay, Bruce, focus."
"- Anyhow, um, I really want Charlotte to meet her, but I was that maybe before she meets her that you might meet her."
- I'd love to meet her.
Very good.
"Well, normally I start with the cellar."
Why don't we go directly to the bedroom?
Did you forget?
I already confessed...
"- Right, we're even."
"- This way, please."
"- This is a marvellous home, Captain!"
- Thank you.
Did you buy it or have it built?
"I bought it, though I designed the landscape."
I congratulate you.
The lady's bath is ready.
Will she take it alone?
What did she say?
"Well, she wants to know if you're taking your bath alone."
But Maria sometimes simplifies things a bit too much.
Forgive her.
It must be difficult to handle so many baths for couples.
"No, thank you Maria."
I think I'll be able to maintain control... for at least the next five minutes.
"The lady will take a bath in five minutes, and by herself."
It's from Jean Louis.
- Urgent!
- Right.
"Don't tell me, it's an invitation to organize an orgy."
You're partially right.
What part?
"An orgy, organize or invited?"
The third part.
It's a party exclusively for me.
I know you understand me...
"Send a chopper, take a closer look."
Oh...
"Unfortunately, I don't have the resources."
What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
Excuse me?
London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya...
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
(CHUCKLING) Oh...
I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
Fuck you.
- We need the information on Latif.
"Yeah, yeah."
"In Latex, I know."
Should we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
"In Dieter's file, it said that he was a chopper pilot."
"It's a long shot, but they might have had a bird out here..."
To extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange.
"How unfortunate that you killed him, then."
"(LAUGHING) Is it worth a hand job, if I didn't?"
GRANT:
"Hello, Dieter."
"I'm Colonel Grant, British Military Intelligence."
(GRUNTING) GRANT:
"Don't move, please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you..."
GRANT:
It's a very nasty way to go.
"Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth."
So it's just us guys.
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!
How's that?
A little too bright?
Good.
(MANSLEY CHUCKLES)
"Forgive me, Hogarth."
I wanted you to learn something.
What can I learn from you?
"You can learn this, Hogarth."
"That I can do anything I want, whenever I want, if I feel it's in the people's best interest."
"The giant metal man, where is it?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't?
Well.
Does this ring a bell?
No?
How about this?
"You've been careless, Hogarth."
It doesn't prove anything.
It's enough to get the Army here with one phone call.
- Then what's stopping you?
- (YELLS) Where's the giant?
"You can't protect him, Hogarth, any more than you can protect your mother."
My mom?
"Ah, it's difficult to raise a boy all alone."
We can make it more difficult.
"In fact, we can make it so difficult that it would be irresponsible for us to leave you in her care and all that that implies."
"- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth."
- You can't do that!
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
- Brown.
"- Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
Before you dropped out?
There you are.
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 15 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
The world is full of mysteries.
"""Temporary physician's parking."" Right."
"Hey, nice one."
Idiots.
Why don't you learn how to drive?
Stop that.
"Sorry, Dad."
I...
"Look, Dr. Stegman is clearly not coming."
We've all got a lot to do.
Let's start.
He's got a heavy caseload.
You can't expect him here on the dot.
"As he has no neurological complaint, his mental condition... is irrelevant to this meeting."
"Come on, Brenda."
Let's start.
Incompetent system.
I should have just been issued a windshield sticker.
Check this out.
Boston.
General.
Why don't you go collect your welfare checks?
This is a hospital zone.
Look at him.
"How's the famous artist, Hook?"
He is stable.
I admitted Eleanor Druse yesterday.
Good-time Sally's back in town.
She's presenting with numbness of the right arm and possible neurological insults.
"What is this, her tenth admission?"
And that's just since I've been here.
"Sooner or later, the little girl who cries wolf is telling the truth."
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
Shit.
- Oh.
Mm.
Jules... is this hug a display of affection or are you just drinking wine?
[ Mouth full ] 'Splay of 'fection.
Adam is not lame.
He may not be tall and good-looking like Pete...
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.
"But-- but he's deep, interesting, and he's tired of cool guy idiots acting like he's inferior."
"If Adam had a fair shot, Kim would've seen his substance and known he's the better guy."
"Oh, so Pete isn't smart and has no substance because he's cool?"
- Well said.
I agree.
- That is so unfair!
"Cool guys can be deep, too."
"You know, you cut them, they bleed."
"And if you call them dumb, they hurt."
"But then they put on a tank top, and everything's okay, so..."
Uncool guys do not have a monopoly over feelings.
"- Hey, where you guys going?"
- Out to the party.
We settled the Kim thing on our own.
We're good.
"Also, this got weird when it became about the two of you."
Later.
About us?
[ Chuckles ]
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.
They're weird.
Totally.
Totally.
Out of anything.
I mean if everybody's...
already assuming it anyway.
"Maybe, we should just..."
It's amazing the things you notice.
Like the corner of his collar that was coming undone.
LIke he was from a poor family and couldn't afford new shirts.
That's all I could see.
The whole world was that unraveled piece of fabric.
I think I have to go.
"- Look, I'm sorry if l--"
"- No, it's okay."
- No pressure or anything.
- l have to go.
You could just think about it.
It's such a lie that you should do what's In your heart.
"If we all did what was In our hearts, the world would grind to a halt."
And they know that he knows and I can't believe he didn't tell them.
He got a perfect score on his PSAT.
Do you believe that?
Math will be ruined.
What does this have to do with Angela?
That's when they had sex.
Her and Jordan?
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
Are you talking about names?
"Fitzwallace, Leo and Ulysses S. Grant."
"Not for nothing, but before we go in there, I wanna be clear."
I didn't have to convince him or even suggest it.
"Right off the bat he said, ""Let's take my name off it."""
- Yeah.
- Leo?
The vice president.
Thanks.
You can go home now.
- I go home when you go home.
- I'll get back to you.
"Mr. Vice President, I like your style."
- It's money well spent.
- It deserved to have your name on it.
I've got my name on other stuff.
You know what I don't like?
I don't like we can't campaign on it.
- Can you sit for a minute?
- Yeah.
"I'm in a bind, and I think you know what it is."
"I'm sorry, I don't."
"I respect the anonymity of an alcoholic, I can't reveal what's said in a meeting but I've got a responsibility to the president, and in fact, to the country."
"Leo, I'm sorry."
I honestly don't know what you're saying.
- You've gotta tell the president.
- Tell him what?
- That you're an alcoholic.
- Are you telling me he doesn't know?
- How would he know?
- You didn't tell him?
Of course I didn't.
- Servalan?
- I thought you said she was dead.
- TARRANT:
We did.
- But she's not.
She's very much alive.
"- You tricked me, Forbus."
"- No, Sleer, I assure you."
You did something to that last batch of Pylene-50.
I did nothing.
Nothing at all.
"Look, let me show you the test sample."
I'm going to cut off your drug supply for three days.
- That means you'll die about another 10%.
"- Oh, no."
"Please, don't do that."
"- Look, this is the test sample."
- I told you... (Groans)
I'm not interested.
"I'll teach you to obey me, Forbus, if I have to destroy all your skinny little body."
"If you need a witness, Commissioner, I can swear it was self-defence."
What are you doing here?
I followed you from the concourse.
Those two off-worlders seemed very anxious to find you as well.
They seemed to think they recognised you.
Really?
"And of course, Practor recognised you as well, didn't he?"
That's why you killed him.
"- What do you want, Leitz?"
- The Presidency.
Anything is possible.
"Well, after all, somebody has to take Practor's place."
"What is it with you, huh?"
"Ah, this fuckin' guy ain't ready."
I knew you weren't gonna be ready.
-You didn't bring coffee?
"-What do I look like, a fuckin' caterer?"
Frankie will make coffee.
Make coffee.
Thought you'd have one of your bitches in here.
"Yeah, I did."
Where the fuck is she?
"Always got these hot books around though, or a bitch, or somethin'."
What time is it?
-lt's 11:30.
We were supposed to be there by 9:00.
-l'll be ready in just a minute.
"Yeah, you're always fucking late."
You'd be late for your own fuckin' funeral.
What the fuck you looking at?
"Come on, make that coffee to go."
Let's go.
What the fuck you doing?
It's a joke.
A joke.
Put the fucking pot down.
Ya gonna take the coffee?
Stacks was always crazy.
"Instead of getting rid of the truck like he was supposed to, he got stoned went to his girlfriend's, and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck."
It was all over the television.
They even said they came up with prints off the wheel.
It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.
I gotta talk to you.
-Have a drink.
Do you want any more?
Please
"Hello, Camille"
We used to see you at school.
We're Esteban's parents
"Hello, Mr Koretsky"
"Yes, I remember I'm sure a lot of people ask you this, but we wondered..."
Esteban is fine
Have you spoken to him?
Spoken?
"No, I wouldn't put it that way"
But our souls have made contact
Did he mention... well us?
Yes
He said he misses you
He can't wait to see you again
Esteban is at peace
He's waiting for you
He knows you will meet again
What is she saying?
She's giving them hope
Look at her I've never seen her so happy since she came back
She has found what she needed
What?
"A sense of purpose lf anything had a purpose, wouldn't we know?"
You scared me I decided to take you up on your offer
- You kept your keys?
- Yeah
You can take my room ifyou like I'll sleep here with Victor lt's up to you
It wasn't the cannibal who died yesterday
I think I sensed it
But you're safe here
"Oh, what a whore she is."
This is despicable.
You are drunk.
My only regret is that I didn't put 20 francs on the mantelpiece the first time.
"I can assure you, monsieur, that Madame Sand will gain no money from you on my account."
Hm?
(JAUNTY MUSIC)
Eugene!
Where's angel fingers?
I've lost him.
- He's taking the Countess d'Agoult home.
- Oh.
"If you plan to invade Poland, you should know that the countess has placed her troops at the border."
What are you talking about?
- I read a love letter she wrote to him.
- What letter?
What did it say?
Marie's jealous of you.
She couldn't stand it if you got a better composer than hers.
I don't know why I dress up.
Nothing here but old men.
You should bring that Mallefille fellow with you.
- He's at Nohant tutoring the children.
- So you took my advice and kept him.
No.
It's all over with us.
- What does he say to that?
- Oh...
He threatens to kill me and himself if I leave him.
He's been reading too many of your books!
- Let's stop here.
"- Mama, it is too cold for you here."
Goes to court tomorrow.
"If you don't give me the name of your source,"
- it's gonna get tossed.
- Bullshit it's gonna get tossed.
I already admitted to you I took part in it.
It's not enough.
Why is that not enough?
You got my word.
We got no corroboration of your word.
What's to say you didn't make up this whole thing when I came in here?
Then go to the goddamn prosecutor
I went to seven years ago.
She's got it all on record.
I thought she didn't pursue this case.
Then you didn't hear me right.
She pursued it.
She just didn't want to see it through.
Ask her if I'm telling the truth.

"Hey, buddy."
"Louis, I was just making a cup of coffee."
- Hey.
- What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
But why?
Apparently you can't say he's got a vagina.
"Oh, it's--fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
"Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page to take it down a notch."
"Oh, you mean Ken?"
"Yeah, he just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group."
I'll talk to him.
What is this?
"Ah, well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
Atta boy.
Chumley.
The beverage situation around here is reprehensible.
"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee.
"Yeah, or like a big coffee dispenser."
That's what a samovar is.
"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
"Uh, Cerie, do you wanna get some coffee?"
"No, thank you."
No?
"Hey, Josh."
I need to change your Michael Jackson thing.
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"More, more!"
"Come, how do you like the fucking!"
Now you will feel my prick from behind.
"Yes, do so my love."
Yes lend me a hand.
Please give me a hand.
-Does your man never do that to you?
-Never.
You are so right to be annoyed.
"-He is a peasant, yes, a bumpkin."
"Enter me, my love, from behind."
Pull my arse apart and hammer it.
Here we come.
"Yes, it fits well inside."
"Dirty slut, one hand masturbates in the front... and the other from behind."
"Say, that nobody ever made you enjoy yourself, ..."
-like that.
Made you come like me!
-Yes.
"Yes, nobody ever before you made me enjoy it so."
I am coming!
Do you hear me my love?
What is going on?
What do I hear?
Ahh!
"Look, Mrs. Rosella sees my films as committed by her husband."
Very well.
"There is a secure future for... telephone operators of the ""hot line""."
"-The more confessors there are,... the more 'talking sluts' there seem to be."
"And how do you react, when you see my films?"
"Obviously, it obliges me to please my boyfriend."
This was written by a man.
Good thing we have A truck and we drive.
But now captain kris kelly.
Has secured a deal To mine 80-miles inland.
Through alaskan bat country On the kougarok river.
This day's gonna be A good day.
I got a buddy that says He's gonna put us on a claim.
That's for sure good gold.
"But, like, it's a little bit Off the beaten path."
Because there's no Easy gold left out there.
River mining will be A new experience for the Kellys.
"Well, We're almost here."
And the first challenge...
Getting to the river.
That's where We are on this road.
Where's the claim?
The claim is right here.
You see these Little strips here?
- Those are roads.
- I'm pretty sure they're roads.
- Me.
- Man.
My buddy said That we're gonna find.
A trail already marked And it's how he gets there.
"What's the marked the trail, What's it say?"
It doesn't say anything.
It's just a trail in the middle.
Of nowhere on the side Of the road in about this area.
"How's it marked, though?"
It's not marked.
It's just a trail.
You said it was just marked.
A marked trail.
I know you got that movie deal.
I know you're starring in it.
Congratulations.
"I'm a nice guy, but I'm also a businessman, and I'm willing to get rid of those tapes, each and every one of them."
"And that's why we're here-- giving you three a chance to repent, forgive yourselves."
"And how do we do that, you snake?"
I think a million dollars will help you heal and cleanse that darkness you've gotta be carrying with you.
Bastard.
You can cover that.
"No, I know how this works."
"- Oh, do you?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Once we pay you, then in three more months, we hear from you again looking for more money to keep quiet."
We were acting in self-defense.
Self-defense?
"Mutilating, chopping up a lifeless body, that's self-defense?"
You three are crazier than I thought.
I made you all an offer.
I keep my word.
What are you gonna do?
911.
What's your emergency?
CHEERING
Tonight on 8 Out of 10 Cats.
"Our Pointless friend, it's Richard Osman!"
"She's having a laugh, it's Ellie Taylor!"
"And their team captain, Rob Beckett!"
And facing them tonight.
"Acting funny, it's Jessica Knappett!"
"Here for the craic, it's David O'Doherty!"
"And their team captain, Aisling Bea!"
Ruins with artifacts that have this kind of power are all over the world.
Spriggan!
What's that?
Look!
The ark!
Damn...
It's over.
Wake up Ominae!
you jerk.
Jean.
What?
I'm way too easy going.
I can still see that brat's dying face in my mind.
but that's what I like about you.
What did you say?
Just shut up hang on.
What's that?
!
That is the true figure of the ark.
The ark is breaking up!
It can't be!
We couldn't even scratch the thing!
Something must have been activated to have caused this!
Four thousand years of time... and returned to the void.
what about Yu and Jean?
look.
Yu!
You're alive!
The King's New Grammar School in Stratford upon Avon... where over 400 years ago a young lad named William Shakespeare... poured over his classical literature and history... and began to learn about the great names and events that had shaped the world.
"Today, Stratford has changed."
It's still the cozy market town of Shakespeare's day... but it has also become the epicenter of the 'Shakespeare World'.
- Explains no pulse.
"Okay, let's get a CBC, chem seven, dip a urine, chest and pelvis x-rays."
"Chen, give me your hands."
- What are you doing?
- Hold tight.
Ken!
Have you ever been to Hawaii before?
"- Well, pretend that you' re there now."
"- Pratt, wait!"
I can't believe you!
I feel better.
I feel totally better!
I feel totally sick.
Why would you reduce an ankle with no pain meds?
No pulse is no blood is dead tissue.
"In other words, I just saved your foot."
Thank you.
You' re wonderful.
- Subclavian's in.
Is that the film?
- Five hundred cc's are out the chest tube.
- He's holding his pressure.
- No pneumothorax.
Looks like a widened mediastinum and loss of the AP window.
Hard to tell.
The pulmonary contusion is impressive.
One of us should go with him to CT.
Not unless you' re ready to crack the chest.
"Flail chest, pulmonary contusions, and labile hypotension."
Could also be from a splenic fracture.
"Carter, I'd like an aortagram."
"Better yet, a TEE."
I know that.
You're going to take over.
You're going to be the Don.
"If what I think has happened, has happened, I'm leaving here tonight."
I give you complete power.
Over Fredo and his men.
"Rocco, Neri, everyone."
"I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife and my children, the future of this family."
"-If we catch them, will we find out..."
-We won't catch them.
"Unless I'm very wrong, they're dead already."
They were killed by somebody close to us.
Inside.
"Very, very frightened that they botched it."
You don't think that Rocco and Neri had something to do with this?
See...
All our people are businessmen.
Their loyalty is based on that.
One thing I learned from Pop was to try to think as people around you think.
"On that basis, anything is possible."
"Mike, they're dead!"
Right outside my window!
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!
Over here!
There's two of them.
Looks like they were hired out of New York.
I don't recognize them.
Won't get anything out of them now.
Fish them out.
Get rid of the bodies.
-Where's Mike?
"I know who you are, so it's okay."
Who do you want to interview?
"I'd like to interview you, actually."
- Is it okay with you?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Well, okay, then."
But I'm answering only the ones I can.
Nothing too personal.
- I appreciate this.
"- No, it's my pleasure."
- Sounds fun.
- Thank you.
Do you trust people easily?
I'm a little over thirty now.
I changed when I passed thirty.
I used to trust people easily.
"Back then, I had to define everything that I do."
"But after thirty, I loosened up."
"If I can't define things right away,"
"I just think some day I will, and take it easy."
"Wow, we're really different."
"I've been uptight since second grade, and haven't rested ever since."
Do you like dogs?
- Who doesn't?
- I'm afraid of them.
What do you believe in?
Have anything you have absolute faith in?
"- Yes, myself."
- You believe in yourself?
I think only about myself.
"I'm not perfect, but it's still me."
It's up to me to improve myself.
Do you know anything about this?
Yes.
I know all about it.
"You could say I killed him, I suppose."
"If he'd never met me, he might still be alive."
He was the most hated man on earth.
But he could have been one of the great men of the world.
He had a big mind.
When they talk about him they'll be talking about a giant.
A genius.
Some people called him an evil genius.
Go on.
He lifted me out of the gutter.
He made me somebody.
He was the only man I ever loved.
I was only really happy when I was with him.
Could you tell us anything about his activities?
Well...
He started his career only a few years ago in Europe.
It doesn't seem possible.
He could have accomplished so much... in such a short time.
Clementi.
"Well, aren't you going to ask me in?"
What are you staring at?
Is this the way a man greets his own brother?
They told me you had died in that concentration camp.
Who told you that?
Everyone who came back.
So I came back from the dead.
Where's mother?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
"And to go unnoticed, we created a whole new language."
"Words were numbers, and numbers were words."
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.
- Plus 6.
- Gun.
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.
Plus 12.
Is this chemistry review?
- Plus 14.
- Ring.
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.
Use it in a sentence.
"Man, that sugar's sweet."
"Because I knew the count, I knew which cards were left in the deck."
That's how I knew what to bet.
You're doing great.
"Micky, I just want to let you know that I'm only doing this for medical school, which is $300,000."
"I mean, if I can get anything close to that, then I'm done."
"Well, in the first place, Ben, it's not ""if,"" it's ""when."""
"And second of all, I get it."
I completely understand.
- You do?
- Yeah.
It's a means to an end.
"Look, they've got this new computer software that reads people's faces, so who knows how long this gig's gonna last for any of us?"
What if we get caught?
"Our system keeps us under the radar, you'll see."
"Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal."
"- So, there's no danger in it at all?"
What did you do?
What did you do?
Answer me!
Why are we here?
No one should live like this.
Drugged in a fucking tank!
It's for your own good.
it's not!
You're waiting for me to die.
I don't wanna fight but there's things we need to discuss.
What things?
would it be considered nagging if I was to repeat my previous observation that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?
It's what the guy gave me.
Wasn't in a position to make demands.
I almost died this morning.
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.
You're less affected.
You know he needs a higher dose.
And I know you got more money squirreled away.
That money's to get us out of here.
not us.
You and him.
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.
"Sun"" is the keyword."
I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.
Do you?
and making him spotted dick.
Found this in your pocket.
Adamantium.
"I just wish you would, too, you know?"
Hey.
I don't know why I had to be married to such a good man.
Who I'm still mad at.
"He'll just stay the night, Jackie."
And he's out by morning.
Yes.
Abbs?
Abby.
"Gibbs, oh."
Sorry I woke you.
I woke you.
I woke you first when I called you.
You spent the night here?
"Yeah, Tony found the knife in question in Petty Officer Smith's seabag, and I kind of got on a roll testing it, and the next thing I knew, the sun was coming up."
Was it worth it?
Totally.
"I mean, even with my little windows, the light was just gorgeous."
"Abbs, I haven't had my coffee yet."
"Ooh, all right."
The knife.
So it tested positive for blood but in the trout family.
These scales that are lodged in the handle suggest rainbow or steelhead.
No blood from Adams.
Means Petty Officer Smith wasn't our killer.
But somebody is.
"You know, it's probably somebody that we don't even know yet."
Or someone we do.
"Abbs, you stayed here overnight trying to clear Vance's brother-in-law?"
"Well, the director is like family."
"I mean, you would want me to do the same for you."
Tox results.
I thought he was a cop.
He drove by a few times.
He never got out of the car.
Sorry.
I wish I could be more help.
"Yeah, well, actually, you know what, you can."
What are you doing?
"This is one of those video doorbells that record you, right?"
"Yes, it is."
Do you know how much that thing cost me?
A lot.
They're very expensive.
"But it's good for you, because then it'll confirm your story."
Thank you very much for this.
Hey.
"Honey, let's go home."
It's late.
Mm-hmm.
I'm almost finished.
I'm gonna be done in a second.
"Oh, no, you won't."
Do not tell me that you are operating on a silverfish.
"Well, it's more like a scenic journey through his digestive tract."
Okay.
I'll be in my office.
"Hold on, Angie."
Look what I found.
Oh.
"Wow, that's actually kind of beautiful."
Right?
"So, this is just the sort of saccharide most silverfish love to munch on."
"In this case, it's a highly magnified particulate of professional grade acoustic foam."
- I gotta get a new suit...
- Mine's covered in blood.
- Really?
Wow.
Ok.
- Yeah.
Great.
Thank you for coming.
It's been crazy.
Um.
"My credits cards were damaged in the accident, do you think you could help me pay the motel and I'll pay you back?"
"David, they weren't actually damaged."
You're broke.
You told me that last night.
"I just wish that you would, you know, tell me the truth when you were sober."
"Ok, the important thing to remember is this."
"In that nightmare yesterday, you were the only person I called."
"I'm looking for a man, answers to the name of Dashiell."
"Middle-aged, tall, pale, sickly, ambiguous sexuality, seriously anxious, probably consuming enormous amounts of alcohol while he's trying to comfort another man who's likely crying."
"Oh, and they're both covered with blood."
Have you seen him?
- Is this ok here?
- Yeah.
You're gonna go park?
Yeah.
Ow.
I think he was wearing a ring.
"I can still see it, just here."
- You look good.
- Thanks.
- It's gonna go well.
"- Yeah, I think it will."
- In the messenger center.
- Somebody was trying to send it...
- I've been looking all over for these.
"- I know, that's why..."
"- This is very serious, Jocelyn!"
I don't understand.
"Why you have these layouts... and why you're ""messengering"" them to someone."
"I wasn't the messenger, I was asked to return it."
- Someone left it there.
- Someone?
Maybe that someone is you.
And maybe you were planning... on sneaking them back into my drawer before you were discovered.
"- Sebastian, I'm not the Yuri."
- Interesting!
You're very defensive.
- I can't believe this!
- But I'll believe it... until you come up with another Yuri.
I'll keep my eye on you.
Watch your back... jag.
Over here...
- Over here.
- Where?
Over here.
I told you to never contact me again.
It's an emergency.
You helped me with Manolo's and I really need your help now...
This is different.
This goes deeper.
- How deep?
"- Fucking motherfucker... cock-sucker, fuck..."
sorry.
- It's my Tourett syndrome again.
- Who wants him dead?
- No questions.
Take it or leave it.
- 1 .5 million.
- Seems high.
This is my last hatchetjob.
"All right, it's a deal."
Money's no object.
These guns are clean.
No serial numbers.
Untraceable.
Explosive head bullets.
Your favorite.
"Easy to pick up, hard to put down."
Want to change your mind?
Why take thisjob?
Ifshe doesn't have a cornea transplant soon... she might lose her sight forever.
There's a cornea bank in Hong Kong... but it's always empty.
"When a donation does come in, someone else gets it first."
So we're going to try abroad.
I have to leave you for a few days.
"When I return, I'll take you overseas for surgery."
"You will come back, right?"
I promise.
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
Many VIPs and government officials will attend the opening ceremony.
You are assigned to protect them.
Their information is in your files.
Make sure you're extra alert!
"Yes, sir!"
"Tony Weng, we're protecting that scum."
Attention please!
But she forgot us.
The money we had borrowed for the wedding... led us... into endless troubles.
"To help my dad,"
I started working.
Even after 2 years
We couldn't clear even a chunk of the loan.
Dealing with the money-lenders has become a struggle of our daily life.
But...
Today...
Today?
Some thugs came home... and insulted us very badly.
They said...
"If you can't repay the loan,"
Ask your daughter to...
"Unable to hear such things, my dad..."
In a haste...
He promised to clear the loan... in 2 days.
I surely know that it's not possible.
Either...
We leave the city.
Or...
My family should...
"Don't be foolish, Deepa."
Even the man with a million rupees on loan is sitting happily.
"Please, Varun!"
You could have asked me.
No.
I just felt like sharing it with you.
"So, I did."
I have some savings.
I don't have immediate expenses lined up.
I will lend it to you.
I'm sure that President Mateo and I... would both welcome the votes of only those people... with sexual indiscretions in their past.
We'd be landslide victors every time.
"Hey, Sheila."
- They've been waiting for you for about ten minutes.
- Okay.
Hey.
"- Henry, I gotta talk to you in five minutes, okay?"
- Okay.
"How about ""Her involvement in prostitution""?"
"No, no."
You gotta couch it like it's something... for the FB...
the AG to investigate.
"- Hi, Reggie."
- Hi.
"Well, how about, ""How embarrassing it is..."
"- that the..."" No, no, no."
- Who...
- What?
- Where's Gilmore?
- Gilmore.
"- Um, Idaho?"
Iowa?
Can I interrupt for one second?
We're all set with America Live.
What are you guys talking about?
We're just going over our statement... in response to The Washington Post story.
- What story?
- The one that says the secret investigation is ongoing... to determine whether she accepted money... for her activities in college.
I didn't hear about this.
"Well, it's, uh..."
"It's, um..."
It'll be in...
"My mother, on the other hand, resisted what she called the sly ways of the place with a fiery, feral determination."
"She dwelt in Moybeg, but she didn't live there."
And it seems she never gave Barnhill's letter to Emma.
Perhaps she felt that a note from beyond the grave was just too much for my sister to bear even as a grown woman.
What's this?
What do you think it is?
Stolen goods.
- Mrs. Coyne.
"- Rose, please."
Men are a deal more likely to do favours for a woman than for a man.
Did you want me to flirt?
My name is Andrew Black.
I'm the doctor's son.
He is REALLY nice.
Bailiffs!
What are you doing?
They've got the flag up.
"Well, they may put it down again."
Blirts!
Jail for our friend.
"I have to tell the truth, Seamie!"
You said that.
OK.
"You guys, he's being very annoying."
"Uh, Shel, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to me immediately afterwards?"
"Oh, no, sweetie."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
"I mean there's still a few girls in Detroit who think they had sex with Cleveland from ""Family Guy."""
Okay.
I want Danny to spend time with my son.
He promised that he would and now he's trying to pull out.
-The power of Christ compels you.
He brought you low by his blood-stained cross!
"Do not despise my command, because you know me to be a sinner."
It is God himself who commands you.
The majestic Christ who commands you.
"God, the Father, commands you."
"God, the Son, commands you."
"God, the Holy Spirit, commands you."
The mystery of the cross commands you.
The blood of the martyrs commands you.
"Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers."
You're guilty before almighty God.
Guilty before his son.
Guilty before the whole human race.
"It is the Lord who expels you he who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world, by fire."
Are you tired?
Let's rest before we start again.
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
Why?
Why?
No.
No.
"Dimmy, why you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
"Well, if he's telling the (phone ringing) truth, we need to find Dana and protect her."
That's where we're headed.
(groans)
"Christopher, where the hell have you been?"
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.
"I know, King, I'm sorry, and I'll explain it when I get in."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Where are you?
Are you anywhere near the track?
"Avondale, maybe five, ten minutes, why?"
Okay.
"I need you to head over there as fast as possible, take Dana Wells into protective custody."
"Arrest her if you have to, just get her out of there, and don't do it in front of any of her crew."
I'll fill you in when you get here.
You got it.
"(engine roars, tires screeching)"

Ms. Wells?
Ms. Wells?
(beeps)
PRIDE:
"Yeah, Chris."
"King, I think we're too late."
- What do you mean?
- Looks like Dana's been taken.
"Track surveillance camera has a pretty wide angle, but those are our guys forcing Dana into that black Charger."
Add the car to the bolos.
LASALLE:
"Nobody's seen Vernon, Dane, or St. Clair since this morning."
Didn't even show up to pre-check for today's race.
They must know that we're onto them.
Yeah.

Nice.

The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up to those 20-year-old tatas.
Oh.
"Gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
Now let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face.
- Mmm.
- Hey.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone."" Am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"- That's my sister, Ted."
"- Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you."
Thi-This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York, Ted... and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way... that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"- My sweet, little, innocent..."
- Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
It wasn't a bronnection.
It was a sisnnection.
"Look, I can I just talk to you for a second, Dale?"
Just about you and me and about us and what's happening here.
What about us?
"I don't know, I just..."
I think I'm falling in love with you.
"And I know that scares you, and I-"
It's not gonna really-
"I'm not going anywhere, Dale."
I'm not gonna die on you.
"I'm not your mother, or your father."
You are so scared of anything that's real.
And I'm right here.
And I just want to know if you feel the same way.
"You hooked up with one of my best friends, Zach."
Wow.
"Wow, I thought I understood what was going on here."
But I guess I was just I guess I was just totally wrong.
I can't believe you're saying that about me.
I can't believe you don't trust me.
I just want something real.
I've been chasing you for two years Dale.
Two years.
You know how that feels?
But I can't do it anymore.
Not if you don't feel the same way about me.
"Goodbye, Dale."
I told Zach I want something real.
And here I go screwing up the best chance I'll ever have at something real.
What do you think I wished...
for my birthday?
It... starts with Z and ends with Ack.
And it turns out...
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at est."
"[Sighs] No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan."
But I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me.
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"- Have a seat, please."
- I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
I think you can help with that... and I think you will help with that.
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
[Chuckling] That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
I-I'll write you a check right now if you want.
But... that's not why you're here.
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
For $600?
For your daughter?
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Why?
Because... he's evil.
You just don't like him.
The guy...
Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
"Hey, you don't look so good."
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"""Passengers arrived at the hospital doa."
The estimated time of death...

"Jasmine, please keep your hands off your partner's buttocks!"
Some of the girls are getting restless
Someone has to stay upstairs.
"Fine, you can take one couple downstairs but make sure you send people up to replace them."
You look....
Are you having fun?
"Yeah, it's great but, aren't you freaking out, a little bit?"
You're president of the sorority now.
- It's a pretty big decision.
- Not at all.
I did what I had to do and it's working just fine.
Relax!
I am!
Can I borrow your lovely sister for a moment?
- You really pulled it off
- I couldn't have done without you.
What now?
"I say if you can slip away, we see what the real party's like."
Hopefully it's some more of your naughty little clappers.
Dean Bowman?
What a surprise!
Come on in.
You're here!
I'm so glad!
How can I refuse an invitation to a party of the infamous Kappa Taus.
- Mind if I look around?
- Not at all!
Let me have your coat.
"You know what, Cappie..."
Cappie can take his coat.
Who invited dean Bowman?
Me.
He's stepping out on you already?
I'm gonna kill him.
That's the point.
There's nothing to step out on.
"Oh, good."
"Not yet, anyway."
Not yet?
!
"Look, I know you don't like him, but he's the first guy in a long time that I actually have fun with."
Fun?
"Honey, trust me."
Fun doesn't last.
My third wife-- a barrel of monkeys.
"Dad, it's more than that."
It's like I feel like there's a connection.
"Oh, dear God."
"I'm not saying I know what it is, but I'd like to keep just seeing him and find out."
"What's to find out, honey?"
"He's brash, he's rude..."
He's rude?
You called him an idiot.
And Roberta.
"Sweetheart, sometimes I just get worked up, because I care about you so much."
"I know you do, Dad."
Will you do me a favor?
"When this magazine comes out and you get all these offers, will you just test the waters a little bit before you settle on..."
Roberta?
"Well, my dad's talking to me again."
That's great.
He must be happy you're still going to be on that Ten Most Eligible list.
"Yeah, about that."
I'm not gonna be on that list.
"If my guess is right, his next victim is here amongst us."
- Who?
- You only!
"You gave an interview to TV9 channel, right?"
Is there any rule that your guess will come true?
He took charge and shot him.
Check thoroughly and kill without missing him.
"All your search is in vain, because I'm his next target."
He'll definitely come for me.
"I shot a bullet into him, right?"
He likes challenge.
He'll definitely counter attack me.
"Somebody gave this for you, sir."
"I'm going to rob Rs.20 crores from him in an hour, be ware!"
"We have an hour only, we must find who is he."
Inform all TV channels.
Fast!
Who is he?
Doctor?
Politician?
Who are you man?
I'm a peon in Revenue office.
Remember that while doing your duty.
It seems you refused to do household work.
Why are you so proud?
"Sir, madam..."
"Don't talk, go get me a tea."
Rs.20 crores?
!
Who is the mad man to say that?
"We don't have time, tell us the truth."
"I beg you sir, please leave me."
"I can help you, Nick."
I'm here for you.
Who can help your hunger?

"Good morning, Willy."
"Oh, uh, good morning, Aunt Nancy."
Did you sleep well?
"Yes, fine, thank you."
What happened?
The train ain't moving?
A bridge washed out down the road.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
"Oh, I'm not frightened when I'm with you."
That's very nice.
"You know, someday, I hope I have a little man like you."
That's very nice.
You know something?
"When I met you last night, that was the nicest thing that ever happened to me."
"Well, thank you, Willy."
"Well, you know, it... it's like..."
"Well, everything is different."
It's...
"Well, it's very hard to explain, but I have a very funny feeling in my stomach."
What you need is a good breakfast.
You're a growing boy.
"Oh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
We'll have a nice talk right after breakfast.
-Have you told the colonel;
"-No, I can't face him."
"I've gone that one time over, bringing him bad news."
Are you coming;
No.
"Then I'm finished, Brock, as far as you're concerned."
Too much for me.
One last word.
"I advise you to get in town, fast."
"Sarah Beth, tell your father I couldn't wait."
You can get out of this yourself or the way you got out of jail.
"What did Mr. McCurtin mean, the way you got out;"
"-He got you out, didn't he;"
-No.
-Who did;
-Chamberlain.
I guess he figures the young and foolish should have another chance.
"All right, Brock, you don't have to cover up with me."
I've known for a long time.
-When;
-For sure when I was 15.
-How;
-A lot of things put together.
"And before I went back to school the last time I knew you knew it, and I knew Papa did."
I could kill Chamberlain.
That's what the trouble was about.
"This fellow I was gambling with, he said a few things."
That's why I couldn't tell the colonel.
I couldn't let him know that I know.
"Oh, Brock."
"We've been around a lot together, the colonel and me and he never let anybody even think anything once, at least not out loud."
"Oh, don't I know."
Especially her own. (LAUGHS)
"No, this is more of a general grief... about everything."
Love is a farce and everyone dies.
See?
Especially in our family.
Look at Mum?
"I'm sorry, have you lost your mother as well?"
"No, she lives in a house-truck near Stafford."
Denise had a change of heart.
Mum turned lesbian and Dad cried for a year.
Now she's with a man again.
George doesn't need to hear about any of that.
How can we help our esteemed new editor today?
"I'm actually not feeling that esteemed, Monty."
Welcome to my world.
I want to apologise.
"Well, look no worries."
You're welcome.
Job didn't mean that much to me anyway.
I meant to Bill Jr.
"Oh, what for?"
For being the one to tell Lindsay.
That should have been his to do.
You would have done a much better job than he would've.
I'd still like to talk to him anyway.
Do know where I can find him?
Mm-hm.
I can do better than that.
"Siouxsie, cancel my appointments for the day."
You don't have any.
Excellent.
He likes the way the balls roll across the grass.
At ease.
The lieutenant will be with us a week or so until the Krauts ship him to the officers' camp.
Seems like all the rail road lines are fouled up.
Somebody blew up an ammunition train.
"Somebody, my eye."
The lieutenant did it.
Right in the station with 50 German guards around.
Glad to have you with the organization.
"Yeah, you're just in time for the Christmas pageant."
Looks more like the lost company of Tobacco Road.
He's an actor.
You should see him do imitations.
He can imitate anybody.
Do Lionel Barrymore again.
- Do Alan Ladd.
-Do Cary Grant.
"Hey, do Grable."
"Now, see here, Scarlet I'm crazy about you and always have been."
I gave you kisses for breakfast kisses for lunch and kisses for supper.
- And now I find that you're eating out.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Not Gable, Grable."
That's enough.
They were shot down two days ago and they've been on their feet ever since.
Price here will show you to your bunks.
"Fix them some tea, huh?"
We had a couple of unexpected vacancies.
Which will it be?
Upper or lower?
"Uh, it doesn't matter, just so I can get some sleep."
- Lieutenant Dunbar?
- Yeah.
"Dropped out freshman year, but still shows up to our reunion."
What kind of loser would do that ?
We're going to find out.
"I'm serious, guys."
You're making a mistake.
"No, we're not."
"Get your hands out, Mr. Winslet."
What ?
"You didn't go to the reunion to sell insurance, did you ?"
"Yes, I did."
I told you before.
I got blood smeared.
There was smeared blood on the floor where Patrick was killed.
How much you want to bet that's our victim's blood ?
"Puts you at the scene, Dan."
Do you care to talk about that ?
I should have been part of that class.
It's all his fault.
"Freshman year, locker room."
Dansy the pansy.
Shouldn't have told Coach I blew off practice.
That'll keep you from talking !
Yeah !
Good night !
You want to know how long I was in the hospital ?
How long it took them to get that tape off me ?
Skin grafts.
I can't take off my shirt in front of anyone.
Not that I even have anyone.
- Do you blame Patrick for the life you have ?
- No.
For taking the life I could have had.
Aside from our difference in age.
Hey... of course we are!
And I look young for my age...
I keep being told that I look young for my age.
It's really... difficult to be modest these days.
"As scary as Park Seon Woo can be, don't underestimate us either."
"Because, we're all friends."
That man doesn't have any friends.
I know him well.
"Oh, but Shi Yoon."
- There's something you must do for me.
- What?
Since I have to meet Han Gyul tomorrow...
"Please teach me the most important, or the most basic, element of fighting."
"Hey, Im Soo Bin!"
I heard that your dad was in a chase in our neighborhood yesterday.
Except he wasn't the one chasing.
He was being chased.
- Wasn't your dad a police officer?
"- Shut up, and keep stuffing your face."
Oh!
We should have recorded the chase and put it on the web!
"I would have gotten 10,000 ""likes""!"
Get a horde of fans!
And it would climb up the internet search engine rankings!
Soo Bin!
What's that?
Blood?
"Oh, spicy rice cakes?"
- Did you fight someone?
- Did you kill someone?
I'm asking you if you killed someone!
Monorail!
t's so much cooler  to be in a band than be by yourself.
Just simply because you've always got people to have a laugh with people to share your experience with.
"-Morning, everyone."
-Good morning!
"Guys, gonna quickly run through the day with you just so you know what's going on."
he way our life is moving at the moment there's no way I'd be able to do this solo.
I can't imagine being in a hotel room on my own.
'd be bored to death.
e know that we've got a schedule to get through but we always think to have a laugh as we're doing it.
Do it.
hat's what mak es these trips a lot easier.
Zip!
Okay.
Watch this.
"This is what we came here for, Tommo."
Right.
"-Do I have to drink it now, is all?"
-Do it.
-There we have it.
-Just try to--
"-"" little Things."" little taste."
"-Yeah, Iet's run "" little Things."""
e rarely get lik e a day off when we land in places so it's just nice to walk around and explore.
"Stupid enough of me, I didn't know it got that cold here."
Thought it wouId be one of those countries that's always hot.
Why?
I don't know.
Because I just pictured australia.
"It's quite near, isn't it?"
"Man, tell me...."
"Oh, no."
"For example, once, when Charlie and I were at camp..."
"... Ilostmy swimtrunks,andI had  to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and..."
... Ijustcouldn'tenjoy the pool at all.
"So, what are you saying?"
I'm a pair of used swim trunks?
"No, no. ln this case, I think you would be the pool."
Maybe this was a bad idea.
"No, no, it's a great idea."
It's right up there...
"... withthewheel,fireandrefrigerators that give ice through the door."
-Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore.
-What?
Why?
You can't be with me without it being some competition with your brother.
It's not a competition.
"And even it was, shouldn't we do it first before you decide who wins?"
You are unbelievable.
-That could be taken a couple of ways.
-Get out.
"Well, no ambiguity there."
Don't forget your brother's CD.
My eye!
"Man, I love sunsets."
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.
"It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know."
What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison.
"No, that's not what I'm really enjoying."
"Boy, I hope that's guacamole."

"Nah, he gonna do what he gonna do."
Right?
You know the man you married.
Look.
"I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh,"
"I'll leave a man behind to watch you, аnd Aisha can get you whatever you need."
Aisha doesn't seem too happy I'm here.
"Well, me and Aisha have been having problems for a while."
"Yeah, well, maybe I'm making things worse."
Nah.
It's not you.
"With Aisha, nothing's ever enough for her."
"She helped set up this deal but as soon it's done, me and Aisha, we through."
What you looking for?
Won't know till I see it.
"I know what you want because you and me, we want the same thing."
Isaac.
Why are you worrying about Isaac?
He treats you like a little bitch.
He is still running things.
What if he wasn't?
"What if I said,"
I got a way for you to get what's yours?
Hey.
Theo.
"Okay, okay,"
"I had enough of that when your mom was alive, come on."
"If this is about, uh, Rebecca not coming, we were able to tweak the speech."
"No, no."
It's not about that.
You asked me to do a little recon
For you with some of my old media contacts.
I will go get my earplugs.
- Where's your owner?
"- Hi, Olivia."
- Hi.
- I don't have an owner.
- Olivia.
- Good to see you.
I hope you're not back for an encore because last night was a one-time thing.
"No, you left me quite depleted."
I could barely walk.
"- So, what's up?"
- I have a problem.
I hear you have special skills for hire.
They are.
Let's talk rates.
"Whatever you have to say, you can say in front of Kenzi."
"So, what's the job?"
I want you to kill someone.
And that's gonna cost extra.
"When you mate for life, and your life is centuries you make it work."
So you invite other Fae into bed whenever you get bored.
Keeps things exciting.
"But we've had a rule, no snacking behind each other's backs."
- Naturally.
- What happened?
Samir and I own an event-planning business.
The girl's a florist we used on one occasion.
Her name's Jenny.
So Samir couldn't keep his hands off the help?
That's typical.
- I didn't know he was shucking around.
- Shucking?
They're doing the best they can.
No.
I'm not griping about how they're treating the Deucalion.
I've just... given up on them.
On us?
On the Martians.
"The war's going in their favor a little bit, and they're wildly misinterpreting it."
That's terrifying.
I will drain the therapeutic fluid and bring Princess Asselyum to my castle.
Tell no one of this.
"Not even Princess Lemrina, of course."
- But why not-.
- Do as I say!
Forgive me.
I did not mean to startle you.
No visitors are allowed?
My sister's condition is that serious?
She...
Perhaps it was a miracle that she held on for this long.
How much time does she have?
Today?
Tomorrow?
They say that they still do not know.
It is just as possible that she will remain in this condition indefinitely.
I see...
I can guess what you are feeling.
"You may have mixed feelings, but she is your only sibling by blood."
"It is you who are truly sad, aren't you, Slaine?"
I must go.
Slaine...
"I forgive you, Slaine."
Even if you cry in front of me today.
I must see to the sentries.
"Excuse me, ladies."
When will you pay me
Says the bells of Old Bailey
When I grow rich
Says the bells of Shoreditch
When will the...
"Oi, blimey!"
- Sh!
"Is that you in the dress, sir?"
Nice.
"- Give me your picklock, Cooper."
"- Picklock, sir?"
Catch me with a picklock?
They did.
"But when you got out of Newgate prison, you got another set."
- That's the one the officer wants.
- Come on!
"Do I get it back, sir?"
Trust me.
"It's very hard to trust a man who wants to borrow your picklock, sir."
So...
You could not wait until Torrecastro
"Very well, you shall hear the story."
A thousand years ago the Muslims swept across Spain orn their way to Rome
My ancestors made a stand in these mountains at a hard rock we call Torrecastro.
They were many.
We were few.
We died hard.
"At sunset my ancestor dying called on Sant'lago, St James, the saint of Spain."
Sant'lago came.
"He came with a banner of blood and a bright sword, and he slew the invaders in their thousands."
I hope so.
"What do you mean, you hope so?"
"Well, lot of people come here for dogs, but there ain't always enough people to take all the dogs we got here."
We're only allowed to keep dogs here five days.
"We got a couple here now-- they been-been, uh, over the limit."
- Over the limit?
-Yeah.
"Well, what happens to them then, when they're over the limit?"
Got to be destroyed.
"Hey, wait a minute."
"You mean that dog I just brought in here, my dog,"
-is gonna be destroyed?
!
-Right.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, come back... (chuckles)"
Who do I see about getting a dog back?
"Uh, lost dog?"
"No, no, a puppy that I got here yesterday."
And my husband brought him back today and I want to get him right now.
"Well, you'll have to wait till Mr. McGreggor gets out here."
He'll be out in just a moment.
Come on.
- Ralph.
-Alice.
What are you doing with my puppy and these other dogs?
"Look, I hope you're not gonna get mad, but I fell in love with him."
And these other two are over their limit.
"Come on, I'll tell you all about it at home."
"Come on, Alice."
Can't wait to see these little ones.
This was the night when friendship was truly solidified.
"Because at the beginning of this scene, I'd thrown up into a plastic bag but still had to hold the gum in my mouth, and then gave the gum to you."
- So you had...
- And I put it in my mouth.
You had my ABC gum that had been sitting in my mouth with fake throw up.
"With fake barf and then I put it back in your mouth because we realized, that once it lost its flavor it was better that way."
- Of course.
- This is so sweet.
This is the...
People go... when they see this.
- No joke.
- I'll do it.
"We had Chinese food, like, three weeks ago..."
"Oh, Chinese."
"- Oh, I love Chinese."
- There it is.
- There it is.
- These kids are so adorable.
God.
"Let's talk about something, like..."
"What's on your little paper, Pete?"
- A reference paper for stories.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, let's whip it out."
- What's it say?
- Does anyone wanna talk about...
Talk about the gum.
When you guys shared the gum.
"- We just did that, Mike."
- Okay.
About Mike and Kat living in New York for the first time?
This was the first time that me and Kat lived in New York.
He was so worried about losing more hair with chemo treatments I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men just to put his mind at ease?
- You did that?
- Yeah!
"- Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy."
- Wait!
You can't say anything.
- Why not?
- Because he'll know I told you.
"Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for nothing."
So because you're getting free parking I gotta pretend this guy had cancer?
Yeah.
"Well, I don't like it."
I don't like it one bit.
And I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Maintain the same disposition.
You can't act any differently.
You have to be nice.
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Because you were being so nice.
- I don't think I could be that nice.
- You be nice!
Gary?
What do you think?
Check it out.
- Is that from my gift certificate?
"- Yeah, buddy."
You came through.
You've been so nice.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage."
Yeah.
"Hey, know what I'm thinking of doing?"
I'm getting rid of all my fillings because that mercury's toxic.
"- Well, I guess I'll just sit with you then?"
- No.
"I mean, no, don't-- don't you--"
"No, that got pushed an hour, so that I can watch your web debut."
That's--That's... great.
"That--that--well, that worked out well."
So I'll follow you.
- Great.
That's...
"- Yeah, come this way."
"- Good luck, honey."
"- Okay, thanks, babe."
Thank you.
"- Oh, I--just-- - oh, don't worry about it."
I'm sure they'll figure it out.
Have fun.
The Cylons are jamming the wireless.
Every frequency.
"Okay, we need to establish our communications."
Work out a plan to defend this temple while Tyrol searches.
Defend it with what ?
"A dozen marines, maybe five more military ?"
We're gonna have to draft the civilians.
Can I make a suggestion that you won't like ?
Do you make any other kind ?
Use Sam to command the civilians.
You're not serious.
- Lee.
"- Hey, Sam."
Hi.
I heard you were coming down.
I guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.
I'd sold something.
I thought he could use the cash and I could sketch him.
What had you been told?
That he was beautiful.
I wanted to see for myself.
And you found him dying?
But he was exquisite.
There's a photo in the Tate Modern.
Like this.
How we look from 900m up.
"All dots, an irrelevance."
"Don't go metaphysical, mate."
Juries hate that.
The Greeks were terrified of beauty too.
"They saw it as a torment, excruciating, unreachable."
I want to capture the precise moment when things are exquisite.
"Listen, I don't normally make a habit of asking this but this time it matters."
Did you murder him?
"No, I did not."
Some dots stand out.
Are you OK?
"So why do you want to run, Dave?"
I'd like to make a difference.
"Oh, yeah?"
Example?
"Well, I think we could try to make New South Wales the hardest State in the country to buy a gun."
"Whoa, there."
Tread carefully.
We've still got a few very marginal country seats.
We don't want to upset the gun lobby.
"(Laughs) For fuck's sake, Wal."
What's so funny?
"Number nine, Nathan Road."
"You know, you should not follow the trend to cut your hair like this!"
Different people should have different hair styles.
"See, your hair doesn't match your face."
And your face doesn't match your body.
Your body doesn't match your hair.
Completely ugly!
What the hell do you want?
"Master, I know it's my fault, please don't blame me."
I regret to cut my hair.
Sit down first.
Tell me the whole story.
Alright.
"Oh that day, I wandered off alone on the Nathan Road."
"When I reached number 9, Nathan Road, a fat woman waved to me."
"She said, ""Come to have your hair cut, it costs 5 cents only!"""
That's why I followed her.
"I always told you, cheap things are no good!"
You know your mistake now?
"Let's go back to the case, alright?"
"On that day, I went to the HK Club for the lion dance as usual."
"After the performance, I went back to the back stage."
"Suddenly someone covered my head with a rice bag, he pushed me on the wall, when I struggled with him..."
"Suddenly, someone took off my pants..."
Did he...
Yes!
What did you feel?
Painful?
No.
Funny?
No!
"My ass was seen, and I felt a bit cool."
I'm fine.
Your son is arrived from London.
- Father...
- John...
You will see in my will the estate of Norland was left to me in a way -
- That prevents me from dividing it between my two families.
"Norland, in its entirety, is therefore yours by law."
And I am happy for you and Fanny.
"But your stepmother, my wife and daughters are left only 500 a year."
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.
- You must help them.
- Of course.
You must promise to do this.
"I promise, Father."
I promise.
Help them?
What do you mean?
"I mean to give them 3,000."
The interest will be an extra income.
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question.
More than amply.
One had rather.
On such occasions.
do too much than too little.
"Of course, he did not stipulate a particular sum."
"What do you say to 1,500, then?"
What brother would be so kind to his real sisters.
Let alone half-blood?
- They can hardly expect more.
"I already work with the greatest detective in the world, and I cannot wait to get back home to her."
"But, sir, you should seriously consider Kendall for membership."
She is one hell of a detective and sneaky in all the right ways.
You're sure about this?
"Absolutely, sir."
"You just keep getting more and more interesting, Mr. Castle."
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.
Hayley: [Sighs] Okay.
Are you not packed?
I can't do it.
Pack you clothes?
Walk away.
"Hayley, I need to know what happened to me."
"Okay, there's one last thing."
"Just before you left to get your memories erased, you came to me with one final request."
Like what kind of request?
"That if you demanded to know the truth,"
I show you this.
What is this?
"It's a, uh, secret website on the dark web."
What's on it?
Not a clue.
You installed a password that only you would know.
"Called it ""Blair's combination."""
From a short story I wrote when I was 17.
Never saw the light of day.
What was that combination?
4 left... 17 right... 21 left.
[Beeps]
I'll step out.
"No, no."
"You've, um..."
Henry.
(HENRY GROANS)
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
(THUD5)
ESTELLE:
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
AKAN:
I love how protective you are of me.
Mmm...
You owe me an apology.
For?
Doubting me.
I did have certain apprehensions.
Then Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
(GASPS) ls everybody dead?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
(SNIFFING) Ah.
(CHUCKLES)
"VVe1lhave a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week."
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will wake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
And you to me.
You are.
Oh.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
I'll tell you what -- if the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
You bastard!
"You don't even have tears in your eyes, can you see it?"
It's dry!
You are caught red-handed!
Why do you pretend crying?
To hell with you!
"Hey, you'd better behave!"
"Wait, let me tell you a story."
"Once upon a time, there was a noble named Ho."
He had a son named Ho Chung.
"Sir Ho was old, his son would be his heir of course."
"But, suddenly, his nullius filius Ho Foon appeared."
Someone worried his status would be affected.
So he sent his fellow Chun... to kill that nullius filius.
"But, Chun failed."
Someone just took this opportunity to kill Chun.
And made that poor kid be the scapegoat.
That guy is really hard-hearted and cold-blooded!
What do you think about my assumption?
"Prosecutor, why do you laugh?"
Because this is such a nonsense and stupid story.
"Nonsense and stupid, huh?"
But you are all sweat!
It's really weird.
"Prosecutor, where were you when the homicide happened?"
At home.
What were you doing?
Reading.
What book did you read?
A tale of two cities.
Where did you stop?
Well... the soldiers...
President Choi Eung Chan!
He planned all this and..
Is this true?
Is it really the President?
The President?
!
Then to take the President down...
You purposely spread bribes around him to make him look corrupt?
Are you afraid?
Just please bring back honor to my dead brother.
Shaking the nation...
Is something that I don't want
I'm just asking to bring back honor to those dead soliders!
And...
"Please let's end it all, General."
General!
Young Joo...
Why did this happen?
Young Joo ssi...
Bad punk.
I told him not to run around the scene by himself so many times..
He never even listens to his director.
Bad punk.
I didn't even know it was about his father's case and blamed him for giving me too much work...
And vented my anger at him.
I'm sorry Prosecutor.
"Prosecutor, I'm so sorry."
"You, dead or alive, you're still like my son."
"What you couldn't finish, I'll do it for you."
The people who made you like this...
I'll catch all the bastards who did this to you and feed them prison rice.
The justice that you always wanted...
And second of all?
"Oh, I didn't have a second of all."
"I was hoping ""second of all"" would make me feel better."
Second of all I can't stop thinking about you either.
[ANNA LAUGHS]
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
We hardly know each other.
I don't know.
"I mean, look at Becca."
"You know, my sister's friend."
"One guy waits on her at Bennigan's and by the end of the meal, they both knew they had found the one."
You're right.
You're totally right.
"I mean, it could happen, right?"
Not for me.
What about texter?
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.
"I mean, this guy could've had surgery, leaving him without a voice box breathing through a stoma and I would never know because I've never actually heard his voice."
"Well, I doubt he has a stoma."
MARY:
That's not the point.
I can't text.
"You know, I'm not charming via text."
ANNA:
Maybe you should just stop texting.
"But it's not just texting, it's e-mail."
It's voicemail.
It's snail mail.
That's regular mail.
Whatever.
I started imagining the future.
I felt everything fell apart.
As Clara was talking...
I felt more afraid.
"Without noticing, I repeated several times:"
"""I won't know how to live alone""."
One of them got Clara mad.
And she said:
"""You've always lived alone!"""
That I should be used to it already.
That even in those moments I was incapable of saying that I couldn't live without her.
That I only thought of myself.
You didn't think of me?
We'll talk about you later.
And what did you two say about me?
I remember telling Clara that I wanted to see you more often.
We discussed some issues concerning you.
And why didn't you ask me?
You were too little.
How long ago?
Two years?
More.
Three?
Would had you preferred to live with me?
No.
Then we decided right.
Yes.
"Not long ago, a girl wrote a letter to Max."
But then she broke it.
You tell me why.
If you interrupt me I lose the inspiration.
The letter said:
... whenI hadthechance to kill that man...
... alltheseyearslater...
... Ihadto do it .
I reckon I'll find out soon enough if God hold me to judgment.
But I'm glad I did it.
"I have to say, this is-- Well, it's a little unusual."
"Um, what shall I call this document?"
A pre-matrimonial stipulation agreement binding to both parties.
All right.
Where do we start?
First and most important...
... shemustbe availableondemand to the marriage bed.
-Except when I'd rather not.
-Agreed.
"And he will, of course, have accounts set up in my name..."
... atallthestoresandsalonsintown .
Of course.
Because she has to do the cooking and shopping for the house.
Only if you want to starve to death.
You'll want a chef and a maid.
-Trust me.
-Fine.
And he must absolutely stop spouting that maudlin poetry at all hours.
Only if she agrees to wear her wedding ring...
-... whenshe'soutinthepubliceye.
-l'll pick out the ring.
-Mm-mm.
-Agreed.
"is that it, then?"
-Can't think of anything else.
-Neither can I.
You both agree the wedding will be tomorrow...
Baby's gotta be with his mother.
How old is he?
Eight months on Friday.
I'm gonna give him a birthday present.
# Happy birthday to you ##
Hey.
Hey.
What's this I hear about a baby being back here?
Don't look at me.
Noogie's out of town.
"Mr. Nello, it's just for tonight."
Please?
I couldn't find a babysitter.
"Look, you've got 15 minutes to find one... and be back here in a tutu and on the floor."
Cut her some slack.
What the hell are you doing here?
Babysitting.
"for those of you who don't follow the Nobel Prize, I'm Morty Price."
"But seriously, I would like to thank right now..."
Mr. Cannata and Mr. Doss for bringing me back to glorious Miami.
"In fact, I was so eager to come, I turned down a chance... to be an extra in Coma Part II."
Not bad.
What?
"Not great, but not bad."
You ought to bottle his jokes and sell them for sleeping pills.
"I know it's hard to believe, I used to work in the stock exchange... till one of the brokers told me when my IQ hit 20, I should sell."
I really appreciate you helping me out.
This job is really important to me right now.
Better cover those.
You got husband troubles?
Not anymore.
I left him.
Please write it down.
Pen is not working.
Dad leave it.
"You just get to Pondi, and go to the Hotel Blue Diamond."
I'll will courier all the pictures and details.
Please Dad don't say bra and panty over there.
Let's see how's her design.
"I'm a designer, You'll see Name of my brand Pure Diamonds."
Will be on everyone's toung.
Whole world will wear my undergarments.
Not less.
Not more.
Please leave.
It's simple.
Make me leave or I'll leave.
Actually you father and my father were partners in this restaurant.
So either you buy the whole restaurant or let me buy.
You know that I don't have that kind of money.
Why don't you keep half?
M.M. Munde never takes half.
Whole world knows that.
"I will pay you back slowly, slowly."
How slow Jia Jee?
Tommorow at 11:00 my client is coming here to meet me.
He'll like my design definitely.
And Jia's doors of destiny will open.
"Come Tommorow at 12:00, you'll get the money."
"Tommorow at 12:00, it'll be your bad time or mine."
If just Laxminarayan likes my designs.
"Here, Ticket."
Look son.
Do the murder nicely.

Chief!
"Pawan, why aren't you in school?"
I'm sick
Sick?
But you don't look like sick
Did your teacher beat you?
I raced a Japanese kid and I won
And the kid was crying
"The teacher blamed me for bullying him, so he beat me"
Can I have another one please?
I'll win the race on the sports day
Those Japanese kids can cry their balls out when they watch me getting awarded
"Chief,"
I hate the Japanese
Chief Mouna?
My grandpa said you were a hero when you were younger
Your grandpa said I was a hero when I was younger?
I'm still a hero.
Does he know that?
"Chief Mouna, will you take me along next time you go hunting?"
"Pawan, where is your hunting ground?"
Chief Mouna!
I'm alright.
"Just a little bit tipsy, that's all"
What the hell?
Hanako!
Look what you have done!
How many times do I have to tell you that you cannot drag these logs along?
"After he died, I came back here and lied."
And I've been lying ever since.
You want the truth.
"And when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
-They want anything but the truth!
-Connie!
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
I told you that I'm committing myself to you all the way... that I plan to worry about you and take care of you.
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael!"
-How's that?
-Fine!
I'll get it.
-Merry Christmas!
-Aren't you going to invite me in?
Not very friendly after practically breaking my back getting here.
"Hi, Joey!"
"Say, there's a blizzard blowing out, a big one!"
You got a drink?
I'm froze.
You're nowhere near froze with all you've got in you already.
I see the Navy hasn't managed to cure you of drinking.
Cure me?
"Honey, the Navy started me in tricks you never heard of."
Say!
"You sure made a lot of changes around here, ain't you?"
You bet we have.
"And, for a start, you can pick up your things and go."
Ain't nobody going to tell me what I can't do in my own house.
-This isn't your house anymore!
-I don't care what you did.
"- Speak for yourself, okay?"
Can you please just open it?
- For me?
- What is it?
"It's a pony, baby."
"I don't-- Come on, for me, please just..."
These are White House passes.
Yeah.
That might mean we're going to the White House.
And that your dad here has a job interview with the Secret Service.
"This is really cool, John."
"- You're just gonna stick with ""John""?"
- Yeah.
"Now The Roger Skinner Show, today live from the White House."
"Hi, folks."
President Sawyer is one of those academics who never served a day in his life and now he wants to tell the military how to run things?
He's going to make peace with Iran because he has friends there now?
Come on.
"Sir, I have the first lady for you."
Remind me again why we let these guys broadcast from our lawn.
- Freedom of the press.
- You know what?
I knew it was something.
"Hey, babe."
How are the French taking it?
The treaty's gonna be a tough sell here.
- How's it going there?
- Raphelson is the key.
"We lose him, then we lose that Southern voting bloc."
"If this goes down, you're looking at a one-term president."
I know two people who wouldn't have a problem with that.
Do you still have that watch I gave you?
Girl's gotta have some secrets.
- To mysteries.
- To solving them.
Damn it.
Yes.
The bidders have arrived.
Let's get going.
I have to go...
And so do you.
So soon?
Some things are not meant to be.
A flower?
"Yeah, but check out the tube."
It's the exact same thing we found in Amanda's cabin.
"You guys, don't tell me, we uncovered a cartel of evil florists?"
"Bos, can you get a match on the flower?"
Already tried.
Got nothing.
- How wide was your scan?
- Seven continents.
"Whatever that flower is, it's one-of-a-kind."
Roman's guarding his lucite-encased corsage tighter than a kid on prom night.
It was important enough to make Amanda disappear.
And to make Roman break a date with you.
That says something.
I don't like it.
"Too many pieces, not enough puzzle."
We need a connection.
You said Roman got a call?
Yeah.
"It was kind of a mood-killer, actually."
"Someone told him the bidders were here, and that's when he grabbed his keycards and split."
Kissing with inside lip?
Is this nothing?
"Good my lord, be cured of this diseased opinion and belimes,"
- For 'tis most dangerous
"- Say it be, 'tis true."
No!
"No, my lord!"
It is!
You lie!
Mightst hospice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink.
What stand I in?
I must be the poisoner of good Polixenes.
The King hath on him such a countenance as he hath lost some province
What is breeding that changes thus his manners?
"Sir, I will tell you"
I am appointed him to murder you.
"By whom, Camille?"
- By the King.
- For what?
"He thinks, nay, with all confidence, he swears"
That you have touch'd his Queen forbiddenly.
"O, then my best blood tum to an infected jelly."
- How should this grow?
- I know not
But I am sure 'tis safer to avoid what's grown than question how 'tis bom.
"For myself, I'll put my fortunes to your service"
Which are here by this discovery lost.
I do believe thee.
I saw his heart in's fa.
Merry or sad shall't be?
As merry as you will.
A sad tale's best for winter.
"Hey, you understand that?"
"Hey, Hayden?"
Oh.
Oh!
It's...
"It's really, really nice to you."
So this is a great restaurant.
It's got lots of health conscious options.
Great.
Cause you know uh...
I take care of myself.
As you can see.
I...
I did notice your pecs just now.
Oh.
Hey!
Are you flexing?
Gwyneth Paltrow eats here.
Really.
"We need options for something low carb low fat, low sodium, high protein."
"Which is better, the bacon cheeseburger or the other?"
Is it wild caught or farm raised?
Do you have chicken fingers?
"Organic, vegan, non soy, gluten free..."
Do you recommend the mac and cheese?
Can you steam that instead of grilling I don't want any crudamites in my food.
I'll have the crab cakes with butter sauce.
Extra butter.
Are these Swedish meatballs kosher?
"You're right, but people really are vain here."
"I mean, I'm not."
I'm self aware which is like radically different.
"You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now..."
I'd sure like to hear it.
"The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things."
I don't mean the town speed freak.
"I mean good, honest, church going people."
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Weird lights.
"Strange phone calls, you."
I heard a crack...
A very strange sensation.
Reds eyes.
"""As a moth""."
Lights and calls phone strange.
You.
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so
Between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just.
Happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
How'd you know?
Wait a minute.
Freeze it.
And run that guy.
What are you lookin' at?
Nothin'.
"I need the, um, name and address of anyone... that's been fired or quit our chip manufacturer in the last 30 days."
Acme?
"Yeah, that would be the name."
Do it.
Why did you tell the Indian girl to delay the revenue report?
Her name is Sarasvati.
And unfortunately we had to fix a glitch... in our asset management ratio analysis program.
Or it would have put our activity-based costing system off by three or four percent.
"Well, we wouldn't want that to happen, now would we?"
"Next time, check with me first."
"Okay, Eddie?"
"""Eddie."""
Unbelievable.
What?
This is a betting slip that guy used to pay me.
It's a winner.
It's a five-team parlay.
"- My man, you just won 2,000 bucks."
- Two thousand bucks!
Two thousand bucks!
- Nice.
- That'll teach that guy to go light on me.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Wait.
Whoa.
You think I should cash this in?
Remember when you made me do chin-ups in the jib crane?
I bloody well did.
-Let's try it again.
Remember how you used to force me into the garbage can?
"Come back, I feel dizzy."
It'll be great to fall down once my muscles get tired.
It'll be such a relief.
How many can you do these days?
Twenty?
I don't feel like jumping anymore.
I want down.
"I'll do a few more, I feel so great."
You ruined my show.
He's coming.
You've been named firefighter of the year.
Irma did this at the factory.
-It's called The Flame Man.
"It's fireproof and you can take it anywhere, even the sauna."
"Come on, guys..."
Guys?
What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Where's Viljanen?
Dear colleagues...
Representatives of the TV...
Distinguished Governor...
I thank you on behalf of the fire brigade.
Let's hope that this publicity will bring us more funds.
Viljanen!
Here.
The costume is a gift from his colleagues.
"Congratulations, firefighter of the year:"
"It just contains pertinent medical data, family histories, you know, stuff like that."
Everything but a mix tape.
How would you characterize your marriage?
Perfect.
Fantastic.
"Well, let's start with something easy, then."
What's your favorite thing about your partner?
Uh...
She's a good mom.
He really is a great dad.
And where did you meet?
School.
High school.
High school.
Yeah.
She was a cheerleader
- I was on the football team.
Fullback.
"I coach now, but I used to play."
And we had...
We actually had our daughter...
We...
"On prom night, we conceived Lacey and it was a little confusing at the time, but it's been a blessing."
It's been the best thing that's ever happened to us.
It's been the best thing that ever happened to us.
We did the right thing.
How often do you have sex?
"She wants me to be tougher, screw harder."
"Work less, but bring home more."
I can't keep this shit straight.
"All I know is, whatever I do, it's not good enough."
Mmm.
Cricket!
Never mind.
I've decided to diversify Charles' evenings at home.
Tonight I have a surprise.
I've asked a few young friends over for a little music-making.
"Charles, you know the Orme-Herricks?"
Did you know that Miss Orme-Herrick was a student of the cello?
She's going to play for us tonight after dinner!
Charles.
Charles.
I really have to go...
Please.
"I'm afraid Jorkins has to go, father."
He has to be up very early in the morning.
"Oh, what a pity."
"Goodbye then, Mr Jorkins."
I hope that you will pay us another visit next time you cross the herring pond.
"Goodbye, Mr Ryder, and thank you."
I'm so sorry I have to leave.
"- I'll just see him out, father."
- Such a versatile young man.
"You must ask him again, soon."
"Goodnight, Jorkins."
What very dull friends I have!
"You know, without the spur of your presence I would never have roused myself to invite them."
I have been very neglectful about entertaining lately.
Now you are paying me a long visit I will have many such evenings.
You liked Miss Orme-Herrick?
No.
No?
Was it her little moustache you objected to or her very large feet?
Do you think she enjoyed herself?
"Far as I could tell, you just keep your goddamn mouth shut unless you're opening it to pour booze in."
And you cheat on your wife.
"That's all i knew about after, you asshole."
You goddamn son of a bitch.
"Goddamn teddy, vietnam."
"Goddamn million gooks dead, 50,000 americans."
Goddamn won the war.
What did he do when he came home?
After?
"Drink, fight, cheat on his wife."
I ain't no goddamn coward.
"I got goddamn medals out the ass, asshole."
Proves I'm a hero.
"God, bombs going off, buildings coming down."
I know exactly what to do.
"If it happened right now, if this bar blew up, I'd know exactly what to do."
"Kids, marriage."
That's where--that's where I suck.
That's where I really suck.
That shit... that scares the balls off of me.
"Here I am after, surrounded by booze and dead assholes."
Thanks.
Get up slow.
Ok.
This is how it's gonna go.
You're gonna take that bag of cash I saw earlier.
Yeah.
You're gonna hand it over to me.
"And if you so much as twitch a muscle while you're doing it,"
I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off.
- Capiche?
- Ok.
I know.
And now we're not together.
I know.
"Well we just got to-- like I said, man."
We're gonna get this in a master.
"We're gonna get closer, and we're gonna get this."
"We just need this for the master shot, all right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
So--
Is there any way to go back and just
Do the first 12 feet of this?
"Because in the rehearsal, you said I would"
"Carry both of them, right?"
-We'll do a close-up.
We'll do close-ups.
We'll do this thing.
We'll have you carrying them out tight.
You're like this big in the stuff I'm doing.
So we'll get you-- we'll do it again.
It's just not gonna match if I'm-
"- I mean,"
I was carrying them both in rehearsal [inaudible].
Now we're going to do it to match the way it was
When you walked out the door.
And that was--
That's what I'm saying.
"When you walked out the door in there, you had him,"
And you had her on your arm.
And we did that.
We had her on--
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Well, can we just do this"
"I mean, we're writing a children's book, not how Joy mouse got her groove back."
"And then I said, ""middleton?"
"I thought you said wimbledon."""
Reminds me of the time I was invited to the duchess of... oh.
What?
Do I have something on my tooth?
"No, quite the opposite, actually."
Seems you have a tooth on your something.
Oh.
"Excuse me, won't you?"
Goodness.
"That woman's a bit of a disaster, isn't she?"
Perhaps you and I could go somewhere a little more private.
"I'd love to, but that disaster is my sister, and she needs my help."
Would you excuse me?
"- Honey, are you all right?"
- Are you hurt?
"I'm fine, just hideously embarrassed."
- Let me help.
"- Jill, what about the Earl?"
You took a tumble.
It's my turn to pick you up and dust you off.
"On your feet, cabbage."
She looks like a pirate.
All that's missing is a parrot on her shoulder.
All that's missing is my fist in your throat.
"Jill, that's so sweet."
"Let's save the smiles till we get home, shall we?"
Thank you.
There's the end of our story:
The sisters choose each other.
"Oh, I love the way we write."
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you as well but... that was the last of the bacon.
Are they always this noisy upstairs?
I like it.
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So, what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry.
I forget you need a bit of extra help sometimes.
Yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison.
Do you remember that?
You were nearly garroted.
"Oh, that!"
They wouldn't have gone through with it really.
"Just their idea of a little kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way."
Turns up.
"Doesn't always knock, either."
"So, make sure you're not doing any washing up naked."
"You'll be wanting to see your sister after this, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
Is that allowed?
Course it is.
Play you?
That's right.
You win-- I tell you everything I know.
What's to stop me taking that basketball and beating it out of you?
Bring it.
They got better food at the hospital anyway.
"What the hell you got to threaten me with, man?"
- More lockup time?
- Okay.
We might be able to help you.
Shave some time off your sentence?
"I'm doing double life, gimp."
Excuse me?
"You got a busted ear, too, man?"
"I'm on permanent vacation, no parole."
"You could shave 10 years off my time, but I ain't never getting out."
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."
I got all the time in the world.
What do you get if we lose?
I get the pleasure of beating a cop's ass in front of the whole yard.
"Oh, yeah, play basketball."
"It's not like we got a killer to catch, or anything."
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.
"All right, game's to 21."
Ten.
Man's in a hurry.
"Okay, since you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is-is bad."
"Danno, shut up, all right?"
"Please, do me a favor and don't call me Danno, huh?"
My name is Jean.
Jean Jacquemonde.
Where is Mayzel?
!
You want to pick on an old man?
I'm here.
I've got you.
My body became like this because of you.
Ominae!
Jean?
Don't move!
brainwashing him with all the troubles of life your abilities are still only this much.
I'm going to stop the source of your breathing now...
Ominae!
...with this machine body of mine!
You've finally shown your true colors!
That is ENOUGH!
He's already dead.
Both Little Boy and Fatman failed to obtain Mayzel.
They were just big talk.
It was predictable.
that was all they could do.
what if they continue to hold Noah?
Don't worry about that.
When our satellite probe was destroyed the investigation into the magnetic field occurrence was quite significant.
along with the other message plate prove that we are the ones who are holding the key to Noah.
What great confidence.
I will kill all who interfere with me.
quietly.
You seem to be tired.
Who was he?
My former boss.
And we've learned over the years to separate the real Lucy from who Lucy is when she's ill.
"- Yeah, because that's so easy."
"- No, I totally get it."
You what?
"Well, I understand what your mom's saying."
"I mean, people can't be blamed for something if they're sick, right?"
Hm?
- Thank you.
- So now you're on her side too.
"No, no, no, I'm not on anyone's side."
"- Uh, uh..."
- Except for your side.
I'm on your side.
Don't let the sniping fool you.
There's affection there.
I'm sorry.
Are you new here?
"Because my loving sister, well, she tried to kill me."
"That was just the illness, right?"
She didn't want you dead.
Dead enough.
How dead do you have to be around here till someone takes your freaking side?
Let me guess.
This wasn't a typical dinner at your house.
Heh.
You can't even slam a freaking door in this house!
"Look, I was just trying to understand your sister."
Everyone is always trying to understand my sister.
"Trust me, no one has come up with anything yet."
I thought you were gonna be the person who'd try to understand me.
"- Everybody can hear those voices, right?"
"- Yes, honey."
"Uh, I-"
You were the one that trained me in the delicate art of giving people useless information.
"I said nice things, for what it's worth."
Thank you.
You have a job for me?
A woman I met.
Evelyn.
She heard I worked security.
She asked me for help.
I guess her ex ran off with their son.
"We ran checks, credit cards, airlines, got nothing."
"Somebody's gonna have to do some legwork... but a job that small, not really our thing."
You thought of me.
"I would consider it a favor if you took the job,and the money's not bad."
- Money's not the pressing issue.
- Why?
What do you need?
- Identity.
- Not for traveling.
"Michael, if you leave Miami-"
I can't help you with that kind of thing.
Seriously.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Fine.
"Get your documents together, I'll have my guys do an I.D. package."
Go see Evelyn first.
Thanks.
I separated from Doug a few months ago.
"I tried to keep it together forJasper's sake, but-That's our son."
But it was hard on him listening to us fight all the time.
He started acting up at school.
"Jack, he's here."

"For Claytor, everyday is part of a grand-if solitary-adventure."
He's been away form home for nearly three years and it could be three more before he returns.
"From Africa, he will head east to the four remaining continents between him a home."
Claytor has grown accustomed to being a stranger everywhere he goes
but he is also changed by every place he visits and every person he meets.
"I think there's a part of me that's become a little bit African, because the Africans have a saying which is when you ask them when they'll come back or what time something will be ready they'll smile and look at you"

- Then send the men out again.
"Ask the local police to keep searching for Emilie, and coordinate it with Lund."
Give them all the help they need.
Call the Zeuthens in for an urgent briefing.
Asbjorn is asking for reinforcements.
They've traced the perpetrator.
"Asbjorn, what's happening?"
Lund and Borch have tracked him down.
We're on our way there.
It didn't sound good.
They're not in control.
- What's the problem?
- Apparently they're trapped inside.
"I don't know what happened, but we're on our way."
Yes?
What's up?
"Push the book under the door, then I'll spare you."
He wants the book.
Give that to me.
"Listen, we don't have that book."
People are on their way here.
Turn the damn car engine off.
Do you hear me?
Hello?
Hello!
"No, you do it."
"You do it, and then get me out."
"- All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
- That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
- Vending machine at a rest stop.
- Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"- Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
"- Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
- So everyone's just gonna watch us?
- Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"- Come on, man."
- How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
- Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
- Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.

"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.

Coca push to make the road and the money washed them to become construction materials for guinea pigs.

"Hey, Christine."
I think we're done.
"I-I have to go, Mom."
"No, they're calling us back to the sabbatical room."
"Yeah, of course it has a room."
"Uh, do you even know what a sabbatical is?"
"Oh, it is?"
"Okay, I-I love you."
I do show it.
I have to go.
Bad news.
Mom and Dad can't make Grandparents' Day.
Why not?
"Dad's run out of miles on his car lease, Mom did some calculations and, at 15 cents a mile, it just wasn't worth it."
Does this mean I can't go to Grandparents' Day?
"No, of course not, sweetie."
"You know what, Uncle Matthew will go as your special friend."
I don't want to go with a special friend.
The only one in my grade who has a special friend is that weird kid with the gray hair.
"To be honest, I'm also getting a little uncomfortable introducing myself as a nine-year-old boy's ""special friend."""
"Daddy, maybe you could go as Ritchie's grandfather."
You guys had so much fun when we went miniature golfing the other day.
"Well, I'd be happy to, if Ritchie wants me to."
"Yeah, that'd be great!"

"No, no."
"I'm sorry, that's not appropriate."
Appropriate?
You once dated your cousin.
Second cousin.
And he asked me out.
But you've got an off switch.
Do you have any idea how terrible that is?
"I know, i didn't say i was proud."
"You wanted to know, so i'm telling you."
Why did i stay?
What did you do to me?
"You just kept wanting to find dylan, look for dylan."
"I couldn't get past it, couldn't make any progress,"
"And then one day, it occurs to me."
"What if... instead of trying to fight your memories,"
"I make you someone else,"
Let the core al work against itself.
"The nightmares... my core al, trying to reconcile conflicting data."
It's a subconscious do-Loop.
We've all got them.
"It's a stroke of genius, really."
It makes you more human.
But you have no right to turn me into something-
Someone i'm not.
I know.
I just... i just wanted rommie back.
I just wanted my old life back.
"Well, argent knows whereandromedais,"
And i want to go there.
He says dylan is there.
"No way, uh-Uh."
"You, dylan, and theandromedatogether?"
Bad idea.
"But you'd like that, yes?"
"To see your old ship, your friends."
Do i sound like i'd like it?
"Tempting, but no thanks."
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.

- I'll read them to Alicia at night.
- They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
- About what?
- Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
You're crazy!
We get along better than most married couples.
Why shouldn't a man want to marry the woman he loves?
Because the woman is in a coma!
"Because Alicia can't say with any part of her body: ""I do!"""
Because we don't know if vegetative life is really life!
Get in the car.
- How can you say that?
- Get in the car!
Your relationship with Alicia is a monologue and it's insane.
I'm not saying talking's no use but people talk to plants and they don't marry them!
I can't believe you're saying that.
I thought you were different.
What shall we talk about?
Alright.
Take it up.
Easy!
You're a stubbornness that girl.
You like her too much I think.
Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a....china cup...

We got to get out of here.
Sallah!
"Hello, hello!"
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
"Why don't you come on down here, I'll show you."
"Thank you my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
That's right isn't it?
Yes we are very comfortable... up here.
"So once again Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
"Ha, ha, ha, ha... son of a bitch."
I'm afraid we must be going now doctor Jones.
Our price is awaited in Berlin.
"But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place, all alone."
"Slimy biff, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Aaahh..

Hang on!
Just do it!
"You are really rude, aren't you?"
You're making me angry.
It was three days ago.
I saw you walking along side him in the Ginza.
That was in daylight.
"If you continue to do things like that, I'll stop talking to you."
It's just a joke.
"Look, I've always wanted you."
You know that.
Am I bothering you?
"Well, if I am, there's nothing I can do about it."
It's just my rengai for you.
"You know, Mrs. I'm not trying to get you directly, but I am trying to get you."
You are my ultimate goal.
"I was waiting for you to fall in love with someone, and then when that fell apart,"
I was going to snap you up.
"My heart has been broken already, so it doesnt makeanydifferencetome if  youvelovedsomeoneelse ."
"Ah, miss, over here."
I came with Nozu-san.
How do you do.
Thanks for taking care of Shinako for me.
Don't worry about that.
What happened?
"Mother, Kayama-sensei was here!"
Kayama-sensei?
He just left.
What would he be doing here after giving up dancing?
"Mother, I want to meet him."
Don't you think it would be better not to meet him?
I just want to see him.
You should go to Tokyo Station now.
And Mary's.
Sharpening my chompers and waiting for wonders.
"I'll ship your miserly, meagre coffin back."
I don't like you.
It's because of her.
"She's deranged, she feels the cold."

"Shut your trap, Mr. Innocent!"
Don't forget that I'm being generous to you!
Just like the Police at home!
Do you want to feel my trotter?

With all the crime that you and Robin should be out fighting how do you find time to come here and fix Black Widow's coiffeur?
"Those aren't hair dryers, Chief O'Hara."
"They're Bat Wave Brain Analyzers, which Robin and I have slightly rewired."
"Oh, you mean you're not really fixing their hair?"
Right.
What we're doing is decriminalizing them.
"It may take months of treatment, but we feel it's worth a try."
If we can permanently short circuit the bad streaks in them we will make honest useful citizens out of those spidery crooks.
"Chief O'Hara, do you realize what time it is'?"
I'm famished.
"Please bring me a menu, doll."
And don't forget the wine list.
"You heard the lady, chief."
Get a menu.
Yes.
"Yes, ma'am."
A menu and a wine list.
I'll see if I can locate them.
"Divine, darling."
Absolutely divine.

I lost the Emperor's favor... because he badmouthed me.
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
Mr. Hwang.
"This is my brother, Prince Daeso."
"(Hwangjagyung, Han Emperor's relative)"
I've heard a lot about you.
The Emperor heard about the alliance and was very impressed.
Long time no see.
Hope you had a nice trip.
What brings you here?
Your request for more provisions has upset the Emperor very much.
He was so upset...
I volunteered to come and offer some help.
I'm here to help you out.
Tell me whenever you need something.
Thanks for the offer but I won't need your help.
I'll organize a small feast for you.
I hope you enjoy your stay.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."

I'm off to see Buwiyum.
Will you make an offer?
Yes.

"Okay, have a nice bike ride."
Whoa.
Ramon just threw a rock at me.
We're still friends.
What kind of God would put a chocolate fountain on a train and not let kids near it?
!
Yeah!
"Learn how to build a train, God!"
"Well... the chocolate fountain is impressive, but the real supply's all the way up front."
"What do you mean, ""The real supply?"""
There's way more chocolate up in the kitchen.
I've seen them load boxes and boxes of it in there.
"Well, then, are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?"
That I need a bath?
"Oh, yeah."
You do.
No.
We break out of here and steal the chocolate from the front of the train!
I'd do that.
I'm in.
Great!
The Belcher kids ride again!
For the first time!
And Rudy!
Is there.
"Okay, if we're gonna rob this train, we need to take it step by step."
"Luckily, Rudy has been trapped in this caboose for the last nine weekends doing some serious recon."
I see everything out this window.
"Once, a skunk got on the train for a little bit and then it got off and I was the only one to notice."
"I mean, isn't it?"
I can hardly stand it when he's away for a night.
"Oh, stella."
"When he's away for a week, I nearly go wild."
-Gracious.
-When he comes back I cry in his lap like a baby.
I guess that's what's meant by being in love.

I haven't asked you the things you probably thought I was going to ask so I'II expect you to be understanding about what I have to tell you.
"What, BIanche?"
You're going to reproach me.
"I know you're bound to reproach me, but before you do take into consideration you left."
I stayed and struggled.
You came to New orleans and looked out for yourself.
I stayed at belle Reve and tried to hold it together.
"Oh, I'm not meaning this in any reproachfuI way."
-But the burden descended on my shoulders.
-Best I couId do was make my own living.
"But you were the one that abandoned belle Reve, not I."
"I fought for it, bled for it, almost died for it."
Stop this outburst.

-I knew you'd take this attitude about it.
-About what?
please!
The loss.
The loss.
belle Reve?
"Lost, is it?"
"Yes, stella."
But how did it go?
What happened?
- I will return another time.
- Don't go.
You haven't visited me for a long time.
Forgive me.

Do you hear anything from Madame Sand?
- Will she be coming to Paris this year?
- I am no longer her friend.
She severed herself from Franz and me with no explanation.
"- You have her latest book, I see."
- Yes.
- Have you read it?
- I wouldn't touch such trash.
"Madame, last summer you gave me a letter."
"Yes, I took a chance... you would forgive me speaking the truth of my heart."
"In fact, I was appalled."
But I could not reject it entirely.
Something touched me.
"A phrase, like a tune one can't forget."

Stop!
I won't have this!

"Report, Mr. Spock."
How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field?
"They didn't, Captain."
Not clearly.
We beamed up all life-forms in a given area.
"Which means Trelane is not a life-form, or he'd be beaming through now."
Prepare to warp out of here at once.
"Oh, Captain, I was so worried."
"Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines."

To spare you the humiliation.
To find you a way out.
What are you talking about?

- Yeah.

- How'd you do?
"- Well, I got an A."
- Professor Rosa...
"- Micky, please."
Is there a problem with my paper?
"Well, you found a more efficient method for finding true zero than Isaac Newton and that, my friend, is not so much of a problem as it is a major ass-kicking."
"Although Newton has been dead for over 250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight."
"So, is this some kind of a math club?"

It's a game with memory.
"Cards drawn are the past, ones to come are future."
"And the best part, it's beatable."
Are you talking about counting cards?
No.

Fine.

This time I want to get a little more creative.
You got a wind machine handy?
Just shoot me.
Okay.
Great.
I'm going to have to take the camera to the dance with me and keep having my picture taken.
Don't let anyone else in the picture.
"If people aren't flickering out, they'll gain a hundred pounds."
And to think I used to complain when I got a run in my stocking.
"I keep him in a little glass jar, which I refer to as ""Oz."""
Uh-oh.
Jailbreak.
You lost him?
"Oh, perfect."
"Thanks to your overreacting, I get to spend my Friday night looking for a cockroach with my sister."
"Oh, come on."
This is stuff that keeps us young.
Ooh!
I think I see a dropping.
You look terrific.
Do you think so?
Because this is more of a standing-up dress than a sitting-down dress.
I thought we'd be standing up more.
It's too bad your car doesn't have a sunroof.
You look terrific.
"So, what's up with the camera?"
"Oh, you know, I wanted to preserve the memories of our big night."
"Uh, did you drop your left cuff link?"
What was that?
Northern lights?
(upbeat music playing)
Great.
"But hey, look, with Hank, maybe it'll be different, you know?"
He's a cop.
He's already seen a bunch of crazy stuff.
"With any luck, it'll wear off in a couple, three years."
[Inaudible dialogue]
[Camera shutter clicking]
[Camera shutter clicking]
[Phone rings] Hello.
I found your friend.
Marquesa.
It's time for you to get on a plane to Portland.
Thanks.
You don't look like you slept too well.
I didn't.
What's going on?
"The usual suspects, tossing and turning."
Must have been something I ate.
What did you get from Interpol?
File on Akira Kimura.
"Ah, yeah."
One of the guys responsible for killing your parents.
It's a great way to start your day.
"And get this, they tied him to the beating death of a coin collector in hamburg."
Turns out the victim was the dealer who sold the three gold coins to Sam Bertram here in Portland.
I'm not sad those coins disappeared.
"You know, that's a nasty-looking guy."
The hell is that thing on his face?
It's called the Aegishjalmur.
And it means what?
Helm of awe.
It's a symbol the vikings wore for invincibility.
He looked down and realised that she is a he!
"Man, that's bullshit!"
You mean to tell me that the whore was wearing nothing but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference?
"Hey, man. he had one of them ""tuck jobs""."
"Come on Jones, you know how they do that."
"You might, I don't!"
"Yeah, whatever."
"You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?"
"Can't, got plans."
Shit!
"See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night."
"Hey, what's up with you?"
You used to be alright.
"Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright."
"You need to realise, Jackson, that some men prefer the company of women."
Who!
"Howdy duty, he don't get no booty."
"Maybe he has got a date by the name ""tuck jobs""."
"No, your mother said she couldn't make it."
Oh!
"Reznik talking smack, I can't even respond to that."
You okay?
Do I look okay?
"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."
What's wrong?
"I don't know, déjà vu."
"You are tired, you need to sleep."
How do you do it?
What?
Sleep so little and still look so good.
Are you flirting with me?
Commiserating.
So...
So...
How do I get my money back?
What do you mean get your money back?
"- My 40,000 euros."
The judge has to give them back.
You told me so.
Wait.
Why do you think you were freed from jail?
The workings of the Holy Spirit?
Do you think the affidavit from the casino appeared by magic?
Wait... you used my money?
But... what did you want?
You wanted me to use mine?
- What's left?
- Nothing.
Do you know how many signatures are needed to get someone out of jail?
"Between the clerk, the judge, the guards... 40,000 euros goes quickly."
This money wasn't mine!
The guys who entrusted me with it will kill me!
"Tell them that the cops took it, that's it."
"40,000 euros in cash..."
I don't know many who could resist.
"These guys will never believe me, they'll rip my head off..."
"Mr Zeppini, you are free."
That's the most important thing.
"And if you need me, you know where to find me."
"Good luck, Mr Zeppini."
Shit!
That's enough.
I'm losing my concentration.
"See, this is our sesame."
How fortunate I'm here.
I'd like to help you.
"Let me back in there so I can bash him on the nose, that's all!"
"Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?"
Always ready to flare up.
"Oh, I like that."
"Here, here."
This is just to prove that I want to help you.
"The rainbow is wide and long, lvy."
"- Oh, now wait."
I better get home.
"- No, no, no."
"Ivy, my darling, you belong with the immortals."
Come with me to Mount Olympus.
Drink nectar with the gods.
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure.
And put Athena and Diana to shame.
"Oh, you aren't half of one with the words, aren't you?"
"And don't be frightened of me, will you, lvy?"
"When a botanist finds a rare flower, he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?"
Are you one of them?
"You like a man who sees a girl and makes up his mind, don't you?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, she doesn't know what I'm talking about."
"- Please, sir."
"- But you'll find out, won't you?"
- Please.
- You'll find out what it means.
"Please, sir."
"The London Post, Sir Charles."
"Oh, thank you."
"And one for you, mademoiselle."
We'd like to call...
"I forget his name, but that guy."
"Prosecution calls to the stand town coroner,"
Dusty Diamond.
This ought to be swift and painfree.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?"
"Remember, darling, if they ask, tell them everything, everything."
Well... do you swear?
Hm?
"Oh, um..."
"Well, I'd like to know what I'm swearing to."
"Um, perhaps I could read it."
'Cause I can't very well give a good book recommendation if I haven't read it.
"Mr. Diamond, please."
"Yes, I swear."
Hm.
"Mr. Diamond, so nice to have you today."
Mm-hm.
Let's start with:
Were you friends with the Mayor?
Friends.
"Mmm, mmm..."
Thirsty.
"Friends, ah."
"Um, yes."
"Can we get to the meat of the matter, sir?"
Yes.
What was the cause of death?
Cause.
"Well, um, first of all,"
"I, uh, ascertained that his heart would beat no more of that beautiful blood and then I further ascertained that his lungs would breathe in no more of that lucky air."
Lucky because it was allowed to go inside of him.
I rang the doorbell.
"Didn,t you hear?"
I brought your dinner.
Can I help?
No need.
Sit down.
"The gas will be hooked up tomorrow, so you,II be able to cook for yourselves."
Water.
Wine.
"It,s not working."
Excuse me.
There.
"You,re on TV."
- What will we do tomorrow?
"- You,II see."
"Here,s a mattress."
The bedroom will be ready tomorrow.
This afternoon the model couple moved into their happy new home.
"We,II follow this fascinating experiment closely over the next six months."
"Tonight all of France wonders,"
",Who are you, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI?"
","
"We,II try to answer with a few images."
"CIaudine is 25, a keypunch operator at a maiI-order company."
"She,s Parisian."
"Jean-MicheI is 29, from Thonon-Ies-Bains."
"In middle management at a Iarge marketing firm, he earns 3,220 francs a month."
"He,s dynamic, athletic, conscientious, and likable."
"Married two years, they plan to have their first child in the model Apartment, and they,ve received special leaves of absence for the duration."
"We,II let our couple settle in."
"We,II check in again tomorrow, and throughout the experiment."
"Good night, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI, and good luck!"
We forge some German documents and make the clothes of French peasant workers out of these blankets.
It's a great night for dying!
"Then we wheel the wooden horse into the exercise yard, we build a glider and we pole vault over the fence."
- What do you think?
- Pathetic.
"- Let's do it, then."
- Yeah.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Your plan worked brilliantly.
Yes.
Shame about old Spurty getting shot by the Gestapo.
"No, the SPG, Eddie, the SPG."
Not the Gestapo.
They're completely different things.
"The Gestapo, er..."
- speak German.
"- Ah, yes."
We're all right.
That's what matters.
"Of course, Eddie."
Safe and sound at home.
Perhaps now I can prepare for my fantastic dinner party.
Empty the big trousers.
"Okey-dokey, me old spunky cock sparrow."
"Now then, I've invited Tarby, Lynchy, Parky, Brucie,"
Tommy O'Connory and you and me.
Have we sufficient comestibles?
Oo-er!
I don't know about that but here's the grub.
"Good Lord, how did you get so much meat in your trousers?"
That's what all the girls say.
"Smut is the last recourse of the emotional cripple, Eddie."
"WHEN BOBBY HIT THE HOME RUN,"
EVERYBODY STARTED LEAVING THE FIELD.
JACKIE STOOD AT SECOND BASE
AND MADE SURE THAT BOBBY THOMSON STEPPED ON EACH BAG.
TYPICAL.
"YOU KNOW, WITH EVERYTHING ELSE,"
"UH, HE WAS STILL DOING HIS JOB."
RACHEL ROBINSON:
JACK SUDDENLY LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT.
AND HE BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN HIS LEGS.
NARRATOR:
"IN 1952, AT AGE 33,"
JACKIE ROBINSON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES.
RACHEL ROBINSON:
THE DOCTOR ALSO FOUND
THAT HIS HEART WAS DETERIORATING.
IT WAS A SHOCK TO BOTH OF US
BECAUSE IT MEANT OUR LIVES WERE GOING TO CHANGE
FOREVER AFTER THAT.
AND THEY DID.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT WITH ANYONE
AND NEVER TALKED ABOUT WHAT CHANGES HE HAD TO MAKE
IN ORDER TO KEEP PLAYING.
NARRATOR:
KONO:
"All right, so it looks like she came alone."
"I'll pull up the surveillance footage from outside the Palace as well as nearby traffic cams, see where they went."
We got to find her before she forces Dalton to decrypt these files.
"Danny, grab some earplugs."
DANNY:
Why?
'Cause you're gonna need 'em.
- Yes.
Keep up the good work.
Boy-O.
"- What's up, Felix?"
- Nothing's up.
- You should make a move.
- On Gemma?
"End of term, mate, anything goes."
"That's not true, actually."
"Certain things definitely do not ""go."""
No matter how much you may want them to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area where I may be able to help you out.
I'm so horny.
"Come on, let's do it dirty, any way you like."
"- Hi, Gemma."
"- Hiya, Felix."
- Can I have a word?
- Okay.
"I mean, obviously, you're out of my league, but I thought I'd ask just for clarification purposes."
Ask what?
If you'd like to go out with me sometime for something like a coffee or a film?
Sit.
Paul.
I don't think of you in the same way as you suspected.
But I'm sure there's someone out there who does.
You just have to be brave and keep looking.
"Okay, great, thanks."
"Seriously, you're very sweet and polite."
Unlike certain people I know.
So why do you go out with him?
"Truth or Dare, everyone."
Jimmy!
What'll you have?
"Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar."
So what's new?
I'll give you the headlines.
S  P's lowering the city's credit rating.
We're gonna close two firehouses.
Result: 1 50 demonstrators at City Hall.
The park commissioner has quit...
... toruntheSan FranciscoBallet.
The stock exchange insists on leaving town.
Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies.
Plus a kid got shot.
-And a drug dealer.
-And a cop.
No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn.
"Well, but..."
... he'sverywelcome.
"Where is the stock exchange moving to, my boy?"
"White Plains, they mutter."
They've been muttering that for years.
One day they'll stop muttering and go.
That's why we need city land for BankExchange.
"-No argument, Lenny."
-And a subway stop.
And an off-ramp from the expressway.
The city's $25 billion in debt.
We're in no position to build off-ramps.
"3000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop?"
What's your interest in this?
Did you buy a few options around the city property?
Of course he did.
I believe it is.
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(LAUGHING)
"Because you don't have the facts, sir."
(CHUCKLING)
Wait a minute.
You're gonna love it.
Let's see what we got here.
All right.
I don't know why you started laughing.
Here.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(WARD LAUGHING)
"I'm just silly, sir, but that machine, that is really fantastic."
"How much, roughly, would a thing like that cost?"
"Oh, about $3,000."
"Not counting the camera, of course."
Three thousand?
Dollars?
"Why, I can get a new car for that."
Not that I need one.
"Lieutenant, you have something to say to me, don't you?"
"Yes, sir."
"I'm really sorry to bother you like this, sir."
But just a couple of questions before my report on Sid Daley.
"It doesn't look like he could have done it, sir."
He was with a girl and she confirmed it.
You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!
Get off of me!
Stop it!
Hey!
Get off her!
Get off her!
Get up.
"How'd this guy die, Doctor?"
"As I told you, when I know, you'll know."
Know faster.
Shaving off your moustache has brought back your usual impatience.
Good.
Means I'm doing my job.
I do have a potential cause of death.
But it's by no means airtight.
See this fracture?
"Well, yeah, you're pointing right at it."
"The brain revealed an epidural hematoma, verified by this CAT scan."
Though it's far from massive.
"Statistically, it's only fatal in about 17% of cases."
Blunt-force trauma?
Most likely.
"We're looking at a baseball bat or a golf club, perhaps wielded by a disgruntled fiancée."
You tell me how;
I'll figure out who.
Intelligence has placed La Grenouille in Nairobi.
That might mean a shipment to Somalia.
We'll continue to monitor these activities.
Just do your best.
Mission trouble?
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
I've had plenty.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent."
Okay.
I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands.
"Tell Travis to set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."
"Right away, sir."
Hey.
"SUBTITULADO EN EL ""PROYECTO GENESIS"" 3 TEMPORADA ENTERPRISE"
- Mar.2004
NARRATOR:
Previously on Enterprise:
HELMSMAN:
The Insectoid ship's been damaged.
Target the second one.
Is that what this is all about?
You think I want to replace you?
"You just can't stand taking orders from me, can you?"
-Tell me something.
-What?
Why won't you let me do my job?
Tell him to go the fuck away!
That's what she says.
I just want to talk to you for a minute!
"Tell him, no, he's an asshole."
"That, too."
Don't even start.
I didn't say anything yet.
I know what you're gonna say.
"No, you don't."
Bullshit.
"First, you'll deny it."
Then you'll lie about it.
"Then you'll say you're sorry and swear it'll never, ever, ever happen again."
Then it happens again.
You're making my sauce?
I'm making sauce.
Put the butter in yet?
"No, 'cause it's not your sauce."
It's better with the butter.
I'm not putting your fucking butter in.
"Hey, I get it."
You're mad.
But don't blame the butter.
"Look, this whole D.U.I. thing is bullshit."
You were arrested for driving drunk with our kids in the car.
"Well, when you say it like that, yeah, it sounds terrible."
I had a couple glasses of champagne.
You tell me you never had a few drinks and then drove the kids?
I know you did.
You just never got caught.
"Yeah, well, not anymore."
I haven't had a drink in six weeks.
And we got saved by a girl.
"We might as well cut our nuts off, and turn them in to the dude sheriff, 'cause we don't deserve these badges that we call testicles."
We should just give our balls to that guy.
- Yeah.
"- I mean, he's a man."
He probably has three balls.
He definitely had horrible B.O.
I think that's a sign of giant balls.
- Rank.
- Lucky.
Testosterone stinks.
I smell like flowers.
These hands of mine are so soft.
It's like Chinese silk ribbon.
It's weird.
They've never done anything manly in my whole stupid life.
Not one thing.
I pet a llama once.
That's the manliest thing I've ever done.
"That was cool, though."
We went to that petting zoo.
All those cute ducks.
They were scary.
"Guys, this is what I'm talking about."
We're going to petting zoos when we should be slitting the throats of those animals.
"Yeah, we should slit throats of animals."
"We should be hunting or, like, pulling marlins out of the ocean or, like, doing..."
What do men do?
- We should go camping.
- Yes.
- At the Brianna concert.
- Yes.
"- Come on, don't start again now."
"- Yeah, yeah."
Hidalgo!
Put him on the bed.
"Look, a message."
- He was one of us?
- Nonsense.
He's particularly bad.
- He demands a lot of money for this.
"- So, what does it say?"
They're going to let us escape tomorrow.
And you're probably the reason why.
That's insane!
"They would let us rot and die in here, but as soon as one of the Great Leopard's men turns up, everything's sorted."
- Of course.
They're afraid that I might talk.
- Would you do that?
I haven't talked yet.
But it's not impossible.
I'm a mercenary.
I fight for money... not for my homeland.
"Padre Julio, what have you got for us?"
- Look what he's brought me!
"- Help me unload the truck, children."
I want something too!
You mustn't put yourself at risk by driving around just so we have something to eat.
"Who else is supposed to do it, then?"
- Have you found out anything?
- Carrasco and his men destroyed a bridge.
The supplies for the troops have been held up.
"Oh, and..."
I didn't need this.
- Not if you're gonna call it‎. ‎
"- I told you‎, it's your nickname‎."
I told you not want a nickname‎.
Cut it‎!
That's your nickname‎.
"You know‎, like the song:"
"""Oh‎, Danny boy‎,‎.‎.‎."""
That's an Irish song‎.
"I'm not Irish‎, nor my ancestors‎."
Come rájate with gum‎.
Thank you‎.
"Do you feel better‎, sir‎?"
"Now I can see where we go‎, much better‎."
"Well‎, as you can see let me give tourism‎."
"Welcome to ""Empty""‎."
"Killing 1‎,000 miles‎."
"After our troops crossed the line‎, they moved like 15 millaspor day‎."
These are the remains‎.
We can go home and the people of this country gets to see this‎.
Like driving trucks‎?
"As they say‎, it's better than being in the back of the bus‎."
Sorry‎.
I'm not familiar with that term‎.
It's what the bus drivers told us in America‎.
"Blacks had to be at the end of the bus‎, even if it were empty‎."
What kind of behavior is that‎?
In me it seems fair‎.
"That I say‎, sir‎."
What happened there later‎?
Back off‎!
¡Let's go‎!
"¡Vamos‎, walking‎!"
"This band not only wants to re-invent the wheel, but wants to pound spikes into it, as well."
- She's awfull.
- Yeah monkey face.
"It would be disastrous, and would cause irrecoverable damages to"
Utah's women and children.
"Hi, we're at Nine Inch Nails !"
Fuck you.
- He's tellin' me there's no god !
"- There's no heaven, there's no hell."
All you are is fucking worm food.
Might as well face that shit right now.
"The only reason human beings created god, god did not create man, man created god."
I just scored front row tickets.
- Really?
"- Hello, my life is good."
Woo !
He keeps saying :
"""I'm gonna be in Trent's jock strap."""
"""I'm gonna be in his underwear."""
You know what my dream is?
"I'm gonna lick trent when he comes down into the audience, and he will."
- I'm not a big nine inch nails fan.
- That's ok.
But i wouldn't mind licking him.
"Keep him, away."
"Hey God,"
Why are you doing this to me?
"Am i not living up, to what i'm supposed to be?"
Why am i seething with this animosity?
"Hey God, i think you owe me a great big apology."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
I hear that you're a high school history teacher?
- How is that?
"- Where have you been, Isobel?"
I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you.
I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you.
I wanted this.
- It's that simple?
- Yeah.
You were supposed to mourn me and move on.
You were my wife.
And I loved you.
How could I not search for you?
"Because I wasn't lost, Ric."
"I understand that you know my daughter, Elena."
And I hear that she's been looking for me.
So I want you to arrange for a meeting with us.
"You want me, ahem, to deliver a message?"
Yeah.
Screw you.
You selfish bitch.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[WHOOSHING]
What do you want from me?
- I told you.
- I'm not gonna do anything for you.
[ALARIC GRUNTING]
You better tell Elena that I wanna meet.
Or I'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one.
And I'm gonna start with your History students.
Got it?
I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic float for the Founder's Day Parade.
"If I don't, I get the wrath of Caroline."
We'll see if she calls back.
I don't want to hear it.
Shame on you!
"- Is this what you ordered, sir?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
I'm not staying with you.
I'm finishing my apple and going home.
"Mom wanted to protect us, that's why she hid it."
"She was a wise woman, she realized our lives would be a nightmare if her secret came out."
"- What, that he's an Arab?"
- Exactly.
"You can play innocent and call me a racist and pretend you're from Mars, not from Jerusalem."
"And that you don't care it he's an Arab,"
- but it means something to me.
"- Me, too."
But I want to see who he is.
You don't have to be here.
You only get in the way.
"- Shai, you're going too far."
- You're right.
I found what I'm looking for.
I don't need this.
- Are you implying something?
"- No, I'm saying it."
How long can you blame Dad for your screwed-up life?
And we're following you like idiots.
"Leave me alone, Shai- Go find your answers somewhere else-."
"Right, maybe I'll find God and eat apples."
Maybe you should.
- Is that your idea or did Haziya write it for you?
- Watch your mouth.
What is going on?
Leave me.
Leave me...
leave me!
What is going on?
What happen?
"I think his death will happen with my hand, stand straight, or i will beat you some rascal is getting nail."
Not wall the door.
"Now i had enough of beating him, now call the police."
"Don't do this Sir, my hotel is very good."
"You are right, not necessary, the work has done."
"Papa will not do this again, Papa say sorry to Mummy."
Just finish it sir.
They have beaten me a lot.
The worst way.
Like Dog.
"You told me to beat Papa, not like this!"
Please let me go.
"Papa he also nailed you., he nailed him like pig, he is very dangerous man."
Size of your underwear...
"Laxmi Narayan is going away with bag, where are you going?"
"You take your bag too, lets press the remote from here."
"Not from here, take this left right from here."
Lets move.
Press the button boss.
Not now.
Come-on sit in the car.
"Let me go please, no!"
"Press the button, which one Papa?"
The left one.
And now you cant ask who's left because its everyone's left.
"There is only one... make target on Laxmi Yadev, and Khujli make target on Laxmi."
Lay down on the operating table.
You are going to me to anaesthetise?
no?
One does not worry.
We already are.
In question?
Biliary vesicle.
You want to see the x-rays?
It does not matter.
"Once open, which does not go exempt it."
"A little while, it excuses..."
You quiet.
The patient does not have to speak.
It wants that to me it puts nervous and that it does a cut to him in zigzag?
So that the biliary vesicle.
You want to indicate to me where is?
Ah... here.
Wonderful.
Perforation of the stomach hemorrhage and in half an hour bushes to the patient.
congratulations.
Stupid!
idiot!
More above.
More above.
Cicchirini.
Moron I here to it say only.
"It seems to me right, Professor, nobody says ""idiot"" like you."
"Thanks, idiot."
Well?
we are going to find that vesicle or we postponed the operation for morning?
"Yet this mess, would be better."
-Quit!
"By saving all these children, do you want to be a hero?"
I'm not doing this for the people.
I'm doing it for myself.
The happiness I saw in her smile...
"If there is so much kick in one smile, think about the kick in millions of such smiles."
I want that kick.
I want that kick.
The kick started from a child's smile.
It won't stop.
"Nowadays, people want to be happy even on someone else's sorrows."
He looks for happiness in others' happiness.
He is not giving any suggestions.
He is not fighting against the system.
He never orders anyone to do something.
He does what he wants to do.
He is not saving those children.
He is showing us the kick in saving others.
Which father will get such a great son?
I get lot of kick.
"Till now, I wanted to see what he will become."
He has now become a thief.
He has become a true human.
What if he gets caught?
There is truth in his efforts.
Nothing will happen to him.
He will not get caught until he completes his job.
Where is he now?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
"When did you come, boss?"
How are you?
What?
But the reason I was chosen to do that operation is that I can read.
"One might even say that I'm the pick of the ""litterate."""
"Evening, laddies."
Say howdy to Sergeant Vickers.
He's our friendly neighborhood retention officer.
Too bad he didn't come to a friendly neighborhood.
No offense.
We just don't like war-to-war salesmen.
Hey!
You're a great bunch of kidders.
I like a good joke myself.
"In that case, may I present Major Winchester?"
Major Winchester.
You must be a career man.
L... [Chortles]
[Chortling Continues]
Let me ask you something.
Doesn't it bother you to sweet-talk young kids... into risking their lives all over again?
"- Hey, I'm just offering a little free advice."
- Like how to avoid old age.
Ah.
Nothing I like better than the free exchange of ideas.
That's Sergeant Hutchinson over there.
He's on that short-timers list of yours.
"Oh, yes."
Excuse me.
Enjoyed shooting' the breeze.
- Oh.
Wait a minute.
"- Let the man be, Pierce."
We all got our little tasks in life.
"- Incidentally, there's a meeting in my office tomorrow at 0900."
I thought we're being honest here.
"You got some balls, you know that."
All of you.
"You want to talk about self-control, how about you, Sil?"
Fucking every slut working in the place when you got a wife and kids.
"Or you, Paulie."
Remember last winter in the woods with the Russian guy?
I am warning you!
"There he goes, Mr. Type A personality."
We're talking about you killing yourself with drugs!
Not my fucking personality!
-Right.
-I'm going to kill myself?
"The way you eat, you'll have a heart attack before you're 50."
-Sit down.
-You're talking to the boss.
"Good, maybe someone will smack some goddamn sense into him!"
"Great, my own mother."
"Fuck you, you fucking whore!"
Son of a bitch!
"Guys, please!"
Come on!
Stop it!
Excuse me.
How's he doing?
I'm a relative.
He slipped off the kitchen counter spraying for ants?
He was wearing socks.
-Are you aware that he has a drug problem?
-Really?
The man has a hairline skull fracture.
"We'll admit him, keep him overnight."
"I'll support the mountain, if it collapses!"
"Yu-lu, I'll do what you say!"
Just nod to me
"Just nod, and I'll do what you say, Yu-lu!"
Look at me!
Me!
You get to one side
You...
What's happened to you?
Both of you get to one side!
Who could make such good Nightsweet wine except Wang Yu-lu of Clearwater Winery?
You...
You...aren't you already...
Didn't you fall over a cliff!
?
"Yes-into the water, and someone saved me lt's a long story-let's have a drink"
I never expected to see you again!
Really?
Didn't you write and invite me?
Write!
?
I didn't write
But I got a letter inviting me here!
I invited you here 30 years...
Father and Uncle died 30 years ago today...
I want you to sacrifice to their souls
"Don't be sad, Yu-lu!"
"Don't cry, Yu-lu"
"You dad's gone, but I'm still here"
"Master's gone, but I'm left lf heaven falls, I'll hold it up lf the mountain collapses, I'll support it"
"Just nod, and I'll do what you say"
"Just nod, and I'll do what you say"
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?
Suppose I wanted blueberry.
You had that last night.
"You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik."
I have you figured out.
"You do, huh?"
What else do you know about me?
That you are lonely.
"When you work graveyard as long as I have, you get to know the type."
"Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor."
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"How can I be lonely, when I have you to keep me company?"
"Check, please."
"Yo, Reznik, Furman's office."
Now!
"How are you doing, Reznik?"
What's this about?
Frankly I am concerned about you.
"To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit."
I've had a lot on my mind lately.
- Anything we can help with?
"- No, thanks."
There's nothing I can't handle.
- Wanna see the doctor?
"- It is not necessary, I'm fine really."
"Are you doing drugs, Reznik?"
Where is the shop steward?
He couldn't make it
- Shouldn't even be in here without a union.
- See what I mean.
"Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, believe me, but there's absolutely nothing to worry about."
"- Yes, you did."
- I came to tell you the truth.
- You don't owe me an explanation.
Allison didn't leave home because of Nellie's suicide but because she hated me.
- She won't answer my letters or calls.
- Why not?
"The night you walked out, Marion Partridge called me."
She told me Allison and Norman...
I heard about that woman and her phone calls.
"Well, I've always been so afraid of scandal."
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.
"Without thinking, when Allison returned, I told her some terrible things."
What things?
"Come on, Connie, what things?"
"I'm Allison's mother, but I've never been married."
"Not to Angus MacKenzie, not to anyone."
I went to New York and lived with a married man.
"After he died, I came back here and lied and I've been lying ever since."
"You want the truth and when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
- They want anything but the truth.
- Connie.
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
"That I'm committing myself to you all the way and that I plan to worry about you, and take care of you."
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael."
- How's that?
- Fine.
I'll get it.
- Merry Chris...
- Ain't you gonna invite me in?
- How are classes going?
- Tough.
Physics.
"- Oh, physics is tough."
"- It's not the work, it's the students."
"A student, to be exact."
- My back.
Personal growth is so painful.
"- My son, doing manual labor?"
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
"Hey, Mom."
Check out this ironic twist of events.
"- Ryan is now a science nerd, I'm working a blue-collar job."
"- That's nice, honey."
- Mom?
"- Oh, Seth, don't worry."
"Your grandfather's situation is very serious, but your father and I are handling it."
Right.
Grandpa.
"To tell you the truth, I haven't even like... um..."
"- .. slept well the past couple nights, so concerned have I been for his well-being."
- But everything is going to be okay?
Right.
- Right?
- Right.
"And what, if Grandpa, like, he did have to go to some white-collar prison with tennis and TiVo, then...?"
"- Don't worry, Seth, it won't affect you."
- He wouldn't lose the company?
- No.
- What about the house?
- Son.
That's crazy talk.
We have got hundreds...
"As you can see, the military's moving into position but won't advance because of safety concerns for the hostages."
"--Obvious to everyone, this is the work of al Qaeda or some like-minded Arab terrorist group."
- The National Guard...

Rooftop's secure.
- They attempted contact yet?
- Not yet.
"- Apparently, we're all Arabs."
- Good.
- Cake?
"- No, I don't want cake."
I'm diabetic.
Hallelujah.
This is my Graceland!
Sweet Shiva.
Sugary pops of delight.
"Come on, let's go!"
Move!
"Let's go, sheeple."
"Now, welcome to my house."
"Now, sit down and shut up!"
"Oh, baby, I've missed you."
Let's get you plugged in.
You fit in nicely right there.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Skip Tyler has arrived."
"By the time you're watching this, I will have pulled off the greatest hack the world has ever seen."
"This is difficult for some, it is but for me, it's as easy as one, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
Yes.
Showtime!
"Oh, some latecomers."
Secretary of Homeland Security is in the house!
Have faith.
We have no choice.
Crossing the Adriatic on this?
- You do not have to continue complaining.
I'm not complaining.
I'm realist.
Mr Moreau?
- Yup?
"The palace will pay me back for the boat, right?"
"But of course, Mr. Lloyd."
- I spent all I had.
The west is from that side.
"At sea, the most direct route is always a curve, sire."
"Tell me a little, do you still have a future in Belgium?"
"I mean, why split a peanut into two?"
Diplomacy and moderation
"They must lead us to the compromise, Mr. Lloyd."
Maybe we should split it and that's enough.
Wonders say they are tired.
"She is tired, Mr. Moreau?"
- I'm tired...
Of simplifications and stereotypes.
"Carlos, tell me a stereotype."
Wonders are lazy and take advantage of it.
Mr Moreau?
- The Flemish are arrogant.
He did not hear you.
- The Flemish are arrogant.
Why do not we look at the positive side?
Are There Stereotypes Positive?
Wonders are warmer.
More warm as people.
"Mr. Goode, no matter where this ends up, I want you to know, justice was done here today."
Whoo-hoo!

Congratulations.
"I am rarely speechless, but I am speechless."
Thank you.
Thank you both.
It's not over yet.
"They're going to drag this out in appeals, so..."
I thought it was going against us.
Sometimes fate smiles.
"Will, are you standing or sitting?"
Which one do you want me to be?
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Do you know what this means?
That we can pay off our balloon payment.
And dodge the executioner for another quarter.
If you get a settlement.
Where's Canning at?
He'll appeal.
For effect.
$25 million should motivate him.
"Peter, you okay?"
We have a problem with the house.
We?
"Uh, Jackie."
She paid ten percent in cash on the down payment.
"Apparently, she was bidding against someone."
Me.
She was bidding against me.
So I'm planning on going ahead with the purchase and then flipping the house in a few months.
What is happening?
I do not see that pretty smile that all of Paris envies.
You cannot smile forever.
"Yesterday, I asked for 60.000 francs from my banker."
And since then no news.
What do you fear?
The banker Barbey has foolproof credit.
"It isn't his credit which I doubt, but mine."
"Usually,"
He sends me what I ask in the shortest time.
Mathilde...
You had to speculate deplorably to need so much money.
I bet you still bought some of these copper mines in Rhodesia.
I thought they went up.
But what do you want?
I like to play.
This is the only distraction I have left.
We never change.
"Mathilde, can I help you?"
"Oh, no!"
"That, never."
What happened between us was too precious to me.
Even if on your side...
It is no longer a subject of money between us.
"We'll have dinner later, but you will not regret it."
I invited the lady of your thoughts.
- Princess Danidoff?
- Herself!
Norbert Thomery?
Here you are.
- How's the sugar?
"- It melts, Madam, in your presence."
"Well, I am, sir, aren't I?"
"- Nothing to worry about, sir."
"- Oh, I'm sure there's not."
I'm inquiring about a missing cabinet last seen in her possession.
- I don't know if you know anything?
- I've no idea.
"Now, please..."
"- Well, won't you come in?"
"- Yes, thank you."
This is Lord...?
- How do you do?
"- And this is Miss, um...?"
This is a most genial gentleman from the police.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Will you have a glass of sherry?
"Well, I'm not supposed to on duty, if you'll pardon the... word... but a small one for medicinal purposes."
- Splendid.
- Yes.
"Well, for what we are about to receive..."
"Oh, Mumsie, need we flee the country?"
If we made a clean breast of it...
Murdering a stranger by mistake?
Go and finish off that trunk.
How you can use that of all trunks?
(Screams)
- Now what?
- It's...
It's Daddy Batty.
He would come!
Get rid of him.
"We're going on holiday, remember?"
"Well, let me in."
He's a consultant.
I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna.
He can't have a hobby?
!
"Excuse me, I have to pee."
"Or is that implausible, as well?"
!
"It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?"
"All right, guys, you have to go back."
I can't afford you.
"No, don't send us away; we love you."
"I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent."
"But, Penny, you look so good in us."
"Damn it, the shoes are right."
"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless."
"What do you got for me, wildebeest?"
I think they're on to me.
The story's starting to fall apart.
Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.
We may have to kill her.
"Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone."
Where are you now?
In the bathroom.
"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests."
What's the problem?
They're just asking me all sorts of questions I can't answer.
Just change the subject.
I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya's parents.
What?
!
They said something about going there this summer.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
"One second he was calming down and then the next-- well, where's the surgeon?"
He's back on the ship.
"Well, you better take care of my brother!"
"Yes, sir."
"Go, lad."
"Go now, lad."
Easy does it.
Put him on the table.
His throat's constricted.
Maybe he swallowed an insect and it stung him.
His only hope is if I can open his throat below the swelling.
"Well, do it!"
"If you have a god, pray to him now."
"If not, I suggest you get one quick."
The ghost pointed at him and now he's dead.
Shut up!
I'll take his body and bury him at sea.
And I trust ya to take care of things while I'm gone.
Of course.
I'll be back.
Haibal didn't have gunpowder when he crossed the alps.
He broke up rocks with fire and vinegar.
Shall I tell you how?
You always do this to me when I cannot get away.
What's wrong with expanding your horizons?
Makes my head hurt.
"Crusoe, you should stop worrying."
We have a plan.
I just want to go home.
"Hey, you should take a slug."
You should take it easy.
"Ms. Ramsey, uh, would you say that you and your niece"
Are close?
"Oh, of course we are."
But she's my sister's only daughter.
"And, uh, now that Stephen is..."
"Well, now that Stephen is dead,"
She's the only family I have left.
How did Stephen and his sister get along?
"Oh, just fine."
They were as close as any brother
And sister I've ever seen.
Why do you ask?
"No particular reason, Ms. Ramsey."
"Uh, we just have to ask a lot of questions"
When we're checking out a possible homicide.
Homicide?
What are you talking about?
I thought it was an accident.
I read it in the newspapers.
"Well, yes, it may appear that way, ma'am."
"But, you see, we have to, uh, check out everything,"
Every possibility.
It must have been an accident.
Run over by a car?
"Uh, that's the way it appears, yes, ma'am."
"Well, if it wasn't, then someone wanted Stephen dead."
"Oh, that's ridiculous."
"I don't believe that boy had, uh, an enemy in the world."
RICHARD:
Seems like everyone we talk
To feels about the same way.
"And then, of course, the next question is, who"
What stark had for breakfast two months ago.
Mm-hmm.
You feel him sweat?
Wife's the key.
Stay on the wife.
"Mr. Jarvis, I want you to meet..."
I'm afraid I mistakenly took your stolen-car report.
"Well, thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen."
"Unless you're going to arrest and charge me,"
I'll be on my way.
"If there's anything further you'd like to discuss,"
Please feel free to contact one of mr.
Stark's attorneys.
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?
I didn't...
exactly.
You didn't think.
"For the love of eve, will somebody tell me what I did,"
Who I cheesed off to have you dumped in my lap?
Why you never catch any actual assignments.
Hey.

"He did exemplary work today, and you ruined it."
"Now, what do you have to say to him?"
"Agent thompson, I apologize."
"Agent carter, sorry doesn't even begin to cover it."
Doesn't even begin to cover it.

And my family.
"And your friend Scott, he promised me much money, and a new car if I help you, yes?"
You gotta love that mercenary spirit.
So what's your reason?
"This isn't only about Latif, is it?"
Not for you.
"If we don't get a signal soon, get some back-up, we're driving towards Clare in a hearse."
"Look, I'm not going to hurt you."
"I need some drugs, adrenalin, something to keep me going."
"If you come with me, I can get you your drugs, and examine your wound also."
Soldiers here.
They are looking for me.
Why?
"If Dr. Helck thinks I'm sick, why doesn't he treat me himself?"
Why does he slough me off on a strange doctor?
Sam thinks it's best or he wouldn't have suggested it.
Mr. Brown.
Yes?
Dr. Croatman will see you immediately.
"May I use the phone, please?"
Certainly.
"How do you do, Mr. Brown?"
I'm Dr. Croatman.
Won't you sit down?
We'll have a little talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
"You want me to take some medicine, give me the prescription, let me get out of here."
"I don't prescribe medicine, Mr. Brown."
Sit down.
Just what kind of a doctor are you?
"Hello, Harold?"
I'm afraid John won't be able to come to the office today.
I've had to bring him to see a doctor.
"Oh, really?"
What's the matter with him?
"Well, we won't know until Dr. Croatman completes his examination."
Will you be able to manage things if John should have to take a long rest?
"If it's long enough, I'll have this business coining money."
That's what I thought.
I don't want to stay.
Let me out of here.
All we can hope is that the doctor finds nothing wrong.
He thinks I'm insane!
I've nothing wrong with me.
I'm getting out of here.
"What are you doing, sir?"

You mean I'm supposed to wait here while you and Shorty go-
That's it.

That won't be necessary.
We're sick of doing nothing.
We're sick of being afraid all the time!
"That thing is hunting in daylight, now!"
We'll never be safe.
Just be patient.
We'll take care of it.
See?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.
Can you confirm that?
Not yet.
It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
Alright.
"Well, in the meantime, there's another Wraith out there."
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.
How?
May I speak with her?
Alright.
May I join you?
"Ellia, we need your help."
You can sense the other Wraith.
It is alright.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"In fact, I have the same ability."
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us."
And I knew even then that you were different.
"Your father has raised you well, he has taught you right from wrong."
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
Your Picassos and Bacons and those fellas who paint your ceilings.
I know those guys.
Doughnut economics!
50/50!
"The cake for you, the hole for everybody else!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, hello!"
The Middle East!
Flat-packed atomic bombs!
Nerve gas!
"School-kid soldiers minced in the swamps, between Iran and the other one!"
Our export figures look so good in the National Assembly reports!
And I being a zero!
"- No, the other one."
- Sorry.
- So what now?
Go straight to the hilt?
Right.
I'm doing this by the numbers!
"The price of the Queen, like in Shake-a-spear."
"You must have ran into a book, now that you're no longer working the streets."
Nobody surrenders a Queen.
"You have to take her, you buy her, you have to deserve her."
"Come on, all together!"
"""O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,"
"""How are thy leaves so verdant!"""
Were you talking about me?
My love.
But I'm worthless!
My Queen!
"Excuse my lateness, I was drowning in Ministry paperwork!"
And what the fuck are you doing here?
"And what about you, you, you!"
"Come on, you guys."
We went on one date.
I know how much you guys like to gossip about everything but we don't want to talk about this at all.
As far as you're concerned we're not even dating.
"- Okay, is that how you feel, Bursk?"
- I was instructed to feel that way.
This day is so perfect.
"I mean yeah, sometimes I do think about a different ring"
"Oh, because the diamond Justin's got you is so tiny and ridiculous?"
"- No, I love it."
"- Oh, yeah."
Me too!
It's so perfect!
No.
It's just because I kind of wish I had my grandmother's ring.
What happened to it?
"My boyfriend Trent, he pawned it to buy protein powder."
I loved my grandma.
It's really all that I had left of her...
"Oh, I know what this is."
You're trying to manipulate me to try to go get that ring back by using your sad face.
"But I'm sorry, sweetie."
It's not gonna work on me.
I'm not buying it.
No!
We're gonna get you that ring back!
Danny is such a jerk.
From now on nobody named Danny allowed in this bar.
My name is Danny.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, man."
I was talking about my room-mate.
"Lil, I feel like maybe you're trying a little too hard to keep your mind off Neal."
"Oh, pft, don't be ridiculous."
I'm completely fine.
Should I get braces?
"Honestly, I saw an infomercial, it really got me thinking."
"Oh, my God, it's Neal."
"He's on his way, he wants to pick up his key."
I don't want to see him.
We've gotta get out of here.
"I've got to go, grab my uggs!"
"Lil, Lil, stop, stop, stop."
"Look, I know this sucks."
But you can't just run from this.
Or drink from this.
"Or yoga from this, or invisalign from this."
I'm not.
I'm just keeping busy.
And taking advantage of my groupons.
"Come on, Lil."
I see what you're doing.
You don't want to be alone in this apartment.
"You're attached at the hip with a best friend, you're trying to drink away the pain of a breakup,"
"I mean, you're not dealing with reality."
How do you know?
Because I'm doing it too.
"Only, in my case it's even sadder, because I have not changed my underwear in three days."
"Yeah, you're right, I have to deal."
"I've got to cancel all the wedding stuff, and find a new place."
Can I live with you?
"Wow, that's aggressive."
"But, uh, yeah."
"Will you, please?"
"Julie will get bored after a day, anyway."
"Want to go to a cardio bar, fashion island..."
Do I get a raise?
"- So, um..."
I appreciate what you're trying to do with the...
"- Okay, I'm reading here."
"- Oh, uh, take your time."
- I just wanted to let you know that you didn't do a bad job.
"- Your work isn't terrible, either."
"A little rushed, maybe."
"So, I've been thinking."
Um...
I owe you an apology.
"Well, several, actually."
You have to actually say the words.
That's kind of how it works.
"I would like to extend... to you a formal acknowledgment that I... may have, um, unintentionally..."
I'm sorry.
"Me, too."
I'm sorry.
- I-I'm sorry about the coffee and the... black eye and the... tampons.
"- Well, you can see why I thought you were intellectually"
I'm just...
I'm really glad that you're not.
"- Your, uh, penmanship, however..."
"- Hey, what's wrong with my penmanship?"
"- Nothing, just..."
"Just, next time, don't hold the pen between your toes."
"Oh, well, um, next time, don't spell ""canceling"" with two L's."
"Yeah, that's wrong."
You want to... you want to fix that?
- I...
Uncle...
Perhaps I have worn it too long...
General...
It looks like the kid is telling the truth.
We just received report that
Kwon Yul's entire army moved out to Soon-chun last night.
The contents of that letter are true?
And there was my father-in-law's report as well.
He paid one thousand heads to Jin Lin for it.
It has to be true.
Yi Soon-shin has left Noryang open?
Is this assign from god?
Send a report to General Shimazu.
We must pass through Noryang tonight at full speed and strike Yi Soon-shin from the rear!
"Yes, sir!"
Yoshihiro!
Aye!
Check the assault team for readiness once again.
They have to be right there on Yi Soon-shin's command ship the moment that we attack his fleet and throws them into confusion.
Is that understood?
Aye!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
My son!
We've decided to let you live.
"If we win the battle, your lives will be spared."
You will be our oarsmen!
Row the oars on the ships that will destroy Yi Soon-shin!
No way!
You want me to dirty my hands and row a Japanese ship?
Won't you send me off with a kiss?
- Here?
!
No.
Here.
Bye.
Deepa.
Say hello to my father-in-law!
Severe head injury.
But now he is alright.
Since he is under heavy medications
It may take a few days for him to gain consciousness.
Let him stay in the hospital till then.
He will recover soon.
"Thanks, doctor."
At what age did your son lose his eyesight?
When he was 15.
All of a sudden he had a high fever.
It continued for 2 weeks.
He started losing his vision slowly.
Doctors diagnosed him with...
"Retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease."
But none of those treatments helped.
We checked his eyes now
His retina is responding to light.
The ophthalmologist will be visiting tomorrow.
Let's see what he has to say.
Varun has light perception.
Surgery may help him get his vision back.
So...
"- There's nothing to think about, doctor."
If Varun can get his sight back...
It's been out there ever since.
"It feeds three, four times a year."
Takes two or three people each time.
Two years after the crash it took my own son.
That's it.
One Wraith in the forest.
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
We all go together.
In the daylight.
Are you really going to help us?
"Like the man said, it's just one Wraith."
It'd be downright unneighbourly if we didn't.
"In that case, drinks are on me."
Well... let's not forget the food.
What?
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daemus?
It looks that way.
"I heard it has two heads and it can turn you into stone, just by looking at you."
Well you heard wrong.
My uncle say's it'll come and take me if I don't do my chores.
He said that?
"Well then, if we get rid of it, you got nothing to worry about."
You'll never have to do chores ever again!
- Really?
"- Yes, look, go away!"
What?
"As far as we know, no-one was taken last night."
But it will strike and soon.
"Well, we'll kill it before that happens."
You must be great at parties.
It's a leopard.
Around here?
He's probably lost and hungry.
Thinks he has supper up that tree.
Over there.
That's Sally he's got treed.
"Ok, fellas, let's get that leopard."
Wait a minute.
This is leopard territory.
A gunshot could bring on 30 or 40 more of them.
Yeah.
Five of us could never handle that many deadly leopards.
But what about Sally?
"As long as she's in the tree, she's ok."
Jack and I will tranquilize the leopard.
Quietly.
"Ok, we'll keep you covered."
"Sergeant, you follow right behind Mr. Makula."
"Captain, I think it might be safer for all of us if you gentlemen stayed under cover."
"Look, we just wanna help."
What difference does it make what we do?
The difference is we're using tranquilizer darts.
You're using real bullets.
I have no desire to be a battle casualty.
Come on.
"Well, now, what have we here?"
Who is that fancy looking chimp?
"Why it must be Sally, the world-famous astro-chimp."
- What are they doing?
"- Sergeant, we're moving in."
Hold it.
"Well, if that's the case, we better keep pretty far away from her."
Don't you want to feel good?
"Yeah, man."
This is the biggest thing that ever happened to us.
You're just sitting over there like some little brown turd.
Goddamn it!
"You watch yourself, Ray."
"Listen up, motherfucker."
Listen up!
This is what's going to happen.
"We're going to Houston and we're going to sell the shit 'cause this little $15,000 is not going to last."
"Until then, I'm going to hold on to the blow."
"And, Ray, I don't want to hear any more bullshit out of you or her."
You son of a bitch.
Fucking son of a bitch.
"Why don't you just fucking go to sleep, motherfucker?"
You know what you forgot?
You forgot one fucking thing.
You forgot about the goddamn money.
"I got all the goddamn money, motherfucker."
"You keep that little $15,000, Ray."
"He's right, baby."
We should sell the stuff in Houston.
"Think of all that money, huh?"
"We'll be okay, baby."
"Pluto, he knows people in Chicago."
We can live off that money for a long time.
"Baby, it's going to be okay."
We can buy all the blow we want to when we get there and we'll be safe.
Pluto will take care of us.
"We'll be safe, baby."
DUD:
"It's really beautiful, man."
"Well, we must play to our strengths, must not overreach ourselves."
- Right.
- Er...
How does 12 boiled eggs sound?
"Er, usually like this..."
"Nice gag, Eddie, and totally unexpected."
"Perhaps a little sophisticated for BBC2, though."
I can just see it now.
"""How's the golf going, Tarbs?"""
"""Oh, really?"""
"""Do you wanna hear a stupid joke about an Irishman being stupid?"""
- Can't wait.
"- What do you suggest, then?"
"You're supposed to be my friend, you freeloading parasite."
Smelly Eddie to the rescue.
"When I was watching TV-am in the lav this morning,"
I saw this fantast ad for a new mag called Poncy Cooking.
"And when you buy part one, you get part two completely free."
That sounds like a marvellous offer and one not to be missed.
"Actually, it's a clumsy setup for a gag later on."
"- Oh, what a shame."
- Yes.
- Let's go to the newsagent's.
"- Okey-dokey, diddly squat."
Over we go.
Don't ever say I'm not there when I'm not needed.
You're not there when you're not needed.
Thank you.
"- Ready, Eddie?"
- Ready-weddy.
- Let's go.
"- Right, then."
"All of a sudden you had to get this off your chest, huh?"
"To be honest, it wasn't really my idea."
"After yesterday, Mary found out that I was using again, and she hired a private nurse to come to my house and make sure I stayed clean."
Nice friend.
She demanded...
That I come down here and I-I tell you the truth.
"And what is the truth, Desmond?"
Mary.
"Mary, I was just about to call you..."
I'm in trouble.
What... what do you mean?
"Grady Burgess, Des's dealer."
I came to see to him to tell him to leave Des alone.
"Help me, please."
He drugged me.
He's going to kill me.
"Okay, stay on the line, okay?"
Keep talking to me.
Where are you?
1287 Monu-ment...
Monument.
Mary?
Mary?
Shit.
So you're saying Mary had...
nothing to do with this.
"Mm-hmm, that's right."
"The truth is, I couldn't pay my drug debt because of the whole lost license ordeal."
Grady knew about my work with the terminally ill.
"He said that if I gave him our client list that he'd forgive me my debt, which I did, which was... stupid."
Go to Grady's house.
"You'll find a vault full of drugs, including pentobarbital."
"You two,"
"How graceful, it is the first time that you attend an operation?"
"Yes, Doctor."
Well.
In first row.
"And that nobody dares to faint itself when begins to sprinkle the blood, or some other organic liquid."
Far from it that it is happened to you to vomit.
-The others can remain back.
"-Thanks, Doctor."
Wash the hands.
I do not want to impure people in the operating room.
What?
"Good morning, Professor."
Everything is to point for the operation.
Well.
These must be the novices.
"You have explained to them that if they must faint, they do that backwards?"
"Because when I operate, short what it is put to me ahead."
They have been warned already.
"Italia, the towel."
Firm.
Moroni.?
Again here?
How he is that?
"Professor, to attend to an operation hers it is like attending a concert of Rubinstein."
Slight ball.
"Cicchirini, you have found to which it surpasses to you."
"Well, we are going to operate."
We go.
You.
"Here, here and here."
"Quickly, we go."
Yep.
"They'd find the magnet, you'd be the first and only suspect, so you framed us."
Do you have any idea what you did to this man?
This man has nothing.
His...
His wife left him.
His girlfriend is in jail.
And he's been living in a ratty little condo.
"Thank you, Randy."
He's been looking at a sad little picture of a boat on a wall for 11 years...
Randy.
"...and you gave him hope, and then, you ripped his heart out."
Randy.
"For that, you're going to burn in hell."
That and the homicide.
"Actually, two homicides."
Don't forget the lottery fanatic who had a picture of them both together.
I think we're done here.
You two are under arrest.
Stand up.
"Let me see your hands, hotshot."
Thank you.
"Glad you like numbers, Billy."
You're going to be wearing some numbers on your shirt.
Is that right?
They won't be lottery numbers.
I get it.
Because you're going to prison.
"Yeah, I get it."
You have the right to remain silent.
I will if you will.
"You miss it, don't you?"
"yeah, i guess you're right."
i wonder why harley would have lied about skipping school.
"- well, maybe... he's hiding something."
- huh.
harley has a shirt with his name on it?
!
he has a job!
that little bastard.
- literally.
- hey.
what does he need money for?
"i mean, if he has a job, then i should be getting..."
- you should ge getting what?
"- well, i should just know about it because he's my son, and i should know about everything that he's doing."
"- mm-hmm. so if you knew about this job... you wouldn't buy all that needless crap on his credit account, ask him to bring home pop, cheez whiz, and lotto tickets?"
that wouldn't happen?
"- [sighs, taps foot]"
"- ah, champ."
they got you stacking toilet paper.
"- merry christmas, uncle bob."
and i'm... [sighs] i'm sorry about tim's black eye.
"- oh, he'll be fine."
"i'm not too merry, though."
marge left me.
- how come?
"- oh, it's nothing."
she'll be back... i hope.
"anyway, i'm here for you."
is this what you wanted?
"- yeah. thanks for doing this, uncle bob."
"i mean, they wouldn't send the bill out to a kid."
"- hey, champ, you don't have to do this."
- So?
- So everything's goin' great.
Terrific.
Beautiful.
"I'll need a few more days, though."
"The boys think we oughta cool it for a while, just to make sure there's no heat."
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm levellin' with you."
I need a little more time.
"My people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch, that's all."
It has to be by the end ofthis week.
"Look, Charnier, you gotta be reasonable."
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem, too."
So nice to have seen you again.
We found a set ofworks on the kid driving the sports car.
- His girlfriend's in the back.
She's dead.
- Give the car a toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"- Jimmy, give it up."
It's all over with.
"Ifthere was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew our warrants and we blew our cover.
"Listen, I know the deal hasn't gone down."
I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Break it up!
It's all in there.
I don't know what to say.
"That it, then?"
Yeah.
WALDRON:
So many years I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again.
And then I did.
"In a photo, in a briefing room."
And I was being sent to meet him with a gun.
ARNOTT.
I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.
(Mumbles)
What's he saying?
"This is a young Ronan Murphy, shot by Danny Waldron during Operation Damson."
What'?
They knew each other?
Did you fabricate the improper relations
- between you and DS Arnott'?
- No.
Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you'?
- What is your verdict?
- Not guilty.
It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun and it's only his word for it that it was self-defence.
I owe you an apology for the other night.
Your...dinner invitation.
You're a married man.
This is it.
Danny Waldron purposefully created a trail of evidence.
And now we're on the trail of the other abusers.
Don't be emotional.
Please leave!
I must see the chief.
"Brothers, the way he fights looks similar to us!"
Stop!
He must have a particular reason.
Brother!
We'll let our chief decide!
Thanks very much!
"Chief, we couldn't stop him from entering here."
Please accept me!
Why do you want to be my student?
My master Liu Chung belonged to Shaolin.
He was a student of Wu-mei.
I wish to learn more about kung-fu.
"Although you're a Shaolin student, you're too eager to kill, so we can't accept you."
He was anxious to enter the temple and so fought with our fellow monks.
That's why he gives off a killer's aura.
Fat-chi!
What's your opinion?
I still sense a killer's aura on him.
"Sorry, but I can't accept you!"
"Chief, I'll never leave this temple!"
"Behave yourself, this is a sacred place."
Buddhism mentions fate.
"I'm here, that's fate."
Why don't we keep him?
This will set a bad precedent.
Amida Buddha!
Mercy!
Mercy!
Shaolin was founded because of our ancestor's determinate spirit.
"It just wants something to eat, and then it's going to leave."
"Let's just make a path of chips to the window so it can get out, but we can't feed it anything too nice or else we will never be able to get rid of it."
"Okay, well, that was my mistake with you."
"Well, hello there."
"Mr. Squirrel, I know exactly how you feel."
I hate people too.
Come on.
Come on.
I've been in the same situation.
"Stuck in a strange guy's bedroom, just looking for some nuts."
Come on.
Come on.
Dude.
Bam.
"Oh, my God, that was awesome."
How did you know how to do that?
I was raised on a lot of cartoons.
"Who was the guys, the, um..."
The...
"Chucky, and Bucky."
Bucky?
Who?
"Chuck... no, Chuck, and the guy with the, the, the..."
Are you talking about rocky and Bullwinkle?
Yes.
Do you know them?
They were basically my parents.
"Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting you were raised in the wild."
"Well, not actually that you were raised in the wild, but more that you were, just, kind of not raised at all."
"But, uh, hey, this is the first time it came in handy."
I don't know what to tell you.
You fell in love with a hood rat.
Self-affirming.
"Well, so you really need that written on your chest?"
You don't already know it?
"No, I don't already know I'm a precious, wondrous... special, unique, divine, rare, valuable, whole... sacred, total, complete, entitled, worthy and deserving person."
I don't know that.
Menswear is the other side of the escalator.
- Over here?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Doyou have any glue?
"- Oh, we have Shoe Goo."
"- Yeah, that might work."
We have to hold this for one to two minutes.
"So, how's the separation going?"
Orwas that temporary?
Maybe even momentary?
"No, we're really separated."
But we have two kids.
Okay.
How old are they?
It's a real madhouse in here.
It's 'cause of the sale we're having.
"Well, go if you need to go."
How did you do that?
"Oh, well, do you want the long version or the short version?"
The long one.
"I was trying to save my life, and it didn'twork."
What's the short one?
I burned it.
And when doyou get to take that off?
I don't know.
I think when it stops hurting.

"We were on the roof replacing tiles when we fell through the ceiling, and luckily your bed broke our fall."
"Eric, you're in some big trouble here."
"Hey, go easy on him, I need this brother."
He taught me how to get what I want from a girl.
- Excuse me?
"- He taught me how to get a date,"
- and it worked big-time.
"- Oh, I see, and who is this girl?"
"- Uh, I don't know her name."
- You don't know her name?
"Not yet, but I'm gonna find out before I make any type of commitment."
How can you manage to ask a girl out if you don't know her name?
- All part of Eric's foolproof method.
"- Cory, get the phone."
"- Oh, Eric has a foolproof method?"
- Ring!
Ring!
"- Go ahead, Cory."
"- All right, first you pick a girl, any girl."
- Just any-ol-body.
- Yeah.
Then you pretend you're interested in her.
Now you don't really have to be interested in her.
"I thought you did, but Eric said it wasn't necessary."
- Ring!
- That's what you told him?
What?
Does it matter what I told him?
I'm dead.
You had the big sex talk with him two years ago.
What did you tell him?
I still can't understand.
Nothing explains how Greta got in.
OTIS:
"Through the door, don't you see?"
"But I'm sure, positive it was closed."
"Now, Greta is a very strong dog."
It wouldn't be much of a problem for her to just push it open.
"It's so strange, the things she seems to be able to do."
"Has she ever tried to attack you, ever been vicious?"
Just the opposite.
She's the most gentle dog I've ever known.
They'll be through in there in just a minute.
"Oh, good."
"Uh, I'll be downtown in a little while."
You go on with them.
OK.
AUDREY:
I know this sounds crazy.
But it's something I feel very often.
"When I'm with her alone, sometimes it"
Feels more like I'm in the room with a person.
She watches me.
Do you think I'm losing it?
"I mean, like Mom?"
"No, no, of course not."
You can handle it.
Will they arrest me?
"No, no need worrying about that."
"But you'll have to admit, it looks"
A little bit fishy though.
"This is the second one to die recently,"
And you were the last one to see them... just you.
There were certain errors in your report of the incident.
Don't tell me the guys in Washington ref used?
Those guys decided to award the Congressional Medal to Drake and the Distinguished Service Cross to the officer with him.
How's that?
The congressional.
Won't you look pretty standing up there?
Maybe he'll even let you sit on his piano.
- With the newsreels grinding.
- ln Technicolor.
What's the gripe?
That's the best they've got.
You shouldn't have done it!
Sometimes you go soft-headed.
I'd like to see a blond do that to me.
- What's the gimmick?
- Basic grammar.
- l'll bet she talks beautif ully now.
- Think so?
You look like the first time you jumped.
"Look, kid, if it's trouble...."
"Yeah, we had some, didn't we?"
"Not like this, though."
Quit living inside there.
If you can't tell me-- l can tell you.
I just don't want any medal.
is that all you don't want?
- Captain Murdock?
- On the hoof.
Camera boys would like shots of you two.
Could you come out?
You only stop here f or 5 minutes.
- The city of brotherly love?
I'll lock it up in my safe.
Give me the pen.
"Now, get out and leave a man to work."
"No, Lucas."
You get out.
- You get out of Peyton Place before dark.
"- Doc, I signed it for you!"
"If you do, I'll keep this in my safe."
"But if you don't, I'll use it against you."
I signed it!
Don't you ever try to come back here.
"Not next week, not next year, not ever."
"If you do, I'll kill you myself."
Why you little... .
Mary.
"Unofficially, this was a miscarriage but officially, for the records, it's an appendectomy."
- That's a lie.
- I removed her appendix.
Understand?
You want to ruin a girl's life for one word?
"- No, but falsifying records... ."
- I'll make them out personally and if you tell anybody this wasn't an appendectomy I'll tell the whole town about you and that drug salesman.
"Doc, that's blackmail."
It sure is.
"Nellie, she's all right now."
She's just fine.
Thank God.
"What a disgrace, disgrace!"
- Disgrace!
- Nellie.
Don't talk that way.
Nobody's ever gonna know but the three of us.
We'll make sure no one knows that you were involved.
"Oh, god, no, no."
Please.
"Mr. McGovern, you're under arrest."
- Stay here with your son until we get back.
"- Please, you can't do this."
- Where's Dr. Robert Swan?
- In the O.R.
"This is my son, please."
You can't go in there.
You'll contaminate the room.
Who the hell are you?
Police.
Please stop what you're doing.
"I have to close this man's incision, and you have to get out of here before he gets infected."
- Where's his kidney?
- Right there.
- And it's going into Kyle McGovern.
"- No, it's not."
It's evidence.
And you're under arrest for trafficking in human body parts.
Now close him up.
I've got less than 24 hours to transplant that kidney.
"Doctor, you're not transplanting anything."
"Just, please, get changed."
"I'm not going anywhere until that doner wakes up, and Kyle McGovern is transferred to a hospital."
- What happened to Kyle?
- He's in hypertensive crisis.
His blood pressure is through the roof.
He needs a kidney in the next few days.
- He's on the transplant list.
- I have a kidney for this dying boy.
How are you?
I'm okay.
I was gonna call you.
Then I saw you were coming for the parent-teacher conferences.
I want you to know the school is not gonna be bullied by Nick McCullers.
Everybody here loves Emily.
What about Nick McCullers?
"Uh, well, he came in making a big deal about how he thinks Emily's getting special treatment because she's gay."
Everybody knows Emily's the better swimmer.
Except McCullers.
He came here to school and said that?
In front of everyone.
"Students, teachers."
- Was Emily there?
- She was.
Hello?
Hello?
You better put that back.
Put it back or she'll know you were in here.
I'm sorry.
I knocked.
The door was open.
"I heard you, but I couldn't answer the door."
I was on the phone.
My lawyer called.
The DA is dropping the charges against me.
They're not gonna charge you with killing Alison?
I didn't get the details but he said the blood evidence was corrupted.
The district attorney can't go to trial without it.
- They're finished with you?
- Not finished.
They can charge me anytime they find new evidence.
"Yes, of course, I want all those things."
Then tell mary I will cause her no harm ever.
And that she will cause you no harm
By loving you.
By marrying you.
Go to her.
Marie:
But do it quickly.
I see your son's return has restored your will to live.
It's because he will live.
Your magic has changed.
How silly and marvelous.
"You don't believe in prophecies, do you?"
"No, I never did."
You're...
Marie de guise.
"Your future mother-in-law,"
If you so desire.
"If you get on your horse, and stop mary"
From making the biggest mistake of her life.
Where is she?
Heading for a church near a quarry.
The servants talked about a village
Nearly destroyed by the plague.
"Yes, I bribed them."
He may as well know
"Who I am, if we're to be kin."
I know the place.
Then hurry.
His hands on everything you want.
"Your majesty, a messenger has arrived."
He said there's news regarding the line of succession.
A special task was formed by selecting 21 agents experienced in anti-North missions.
And their mission was to enter Pyeongyang City.
Even though they successfully killed 7 generals in the North Korean Army.
From inside their promised home-bound submarine belonging to the Republic of Korea's navy.
Sniper shots killed them.
The people who planned and implemented this mission are as follows...
Lee Kyung Wan.
"If I don't, someone else would take the money away anyway."
I'm the one who's been trying to protect democracy in this country!
Why?
Hey!
Turn it off!
Seo Yong Hak.
In return...
I need to receive a 20% comission.
Look here!
Turn it off right now!
"Everyone, don't believe what you see on television!"
Kim Jong Shik.
The City Hunter stole our college operational fund and in order to amp up his fame...
He distributed the funds to our students.
Guilt?
Forgiveness?
Surrender?
Forget all that!
Don't come any closer!
Cheon Jae Man.
City Hunter is not a hero.
He is a criminal who betrayed this country.
Choi Eung Chan.
In the end... this is what it comes down to?
Cheon Jae Man's blood...
"""This is fun."
Do it anyways.
"They'll figure out how to save you."""
It just gets quieter and quieter.
Pretty soon I won't be able to hear it at all.
"But before it dies, I want to say good-bye to it the right way."
We'll give it the best send-off any crazy voice could ever ask for.
I'd do it for mine.
"...and then, right around the time I was starting to walk, there was some kind of..."
Ah...
I don't know.
Let's stop.
I want to stop.
"Honey, please, keep going."
You can't stop now.
"No, I don't want to."
We've been sitting here for five hours.
"Why are we doing this, anyway?"
"Francis, please."
I think we're really close.
Just one more time.
Well...
I kind of remember that Frisbee game we used to play...
"Okay, honey."
Maybe we'll eat later.
"Lois, did you see what he did in there?"
He used my tennis racket to smash my camera and all my lenses to bits!
I still had film in it from the Us Festival!
Where is he?
"Hal, it's not his fault!"
I'm pretty sure he's working through a limitation-anxiety phase.
All the literature says this is the age where he's trying...
- A teenage waste of space.
- A name would be nice.
"It would, wouldn't it?"
You ask a lot of questions.
Why did you compel that man to kill himself after he told me to stop looking for you?
Dramatic impact.
Wish it would've been more effective.
- Human life means that little to you?
- It means nothing to me.
It's just part of being what I am.
"No, it's not."
I know other vampires.
That's not true.
You mean your boyfriend over there by the pool table?
Stefan Salvatore.
Why Stefan?
Why didn't you go for Damon?
Or do you enjoy them both like Katherine did?
- We should be in there.
- No.
Isobel made it clear we're not to step foot inside.
- I'm not gonna kill her in a restaurant.
"- You're not gonna kill her, period."
She ruined your life.
You wanna protect her?
She's my wife.
Was.
Was my wife.
"I looked for the woman I married, but she wasn't there."
Whoever that is is cold and detached.
- Yeah.
- She's given up her humanity.
"Can I help you?"""
"That means, ""Please don't rob me."""
And the guy will be the nicest dude ever.
"He's like, ""Well, actually, my name's Jamal."""
"""I just graduated from Harvard,"
"""and I can't wait to start the IT program, 'cause I really feel I can be a valuable asset to the team."""
"""Okay, Jamal."
"""Well, I'm gonna go call up Karen and see if she knows anything about this."""
There's always a Karen.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I was in the middle of a bit."
Hold up.
"""Hey!"""
How you gonna control a child named Blue Ivy?
"She's sitting there pitching a fit, and Jay-Z looking all helpless."
He just...
"""Oh, oh."
"""Yo."
"""Hey, yo, Blue, you really need to calm down, you know?"
"""'Cause I'm really starting to get irritated, you know?"
"Jeah."""
¶ All I'm saying is I'm your daddy ¶
¶ You my little baby goi-rl.
"""Jeah."""
¶ But you don't want me to go and get that belt ¶
¶ 'Cause if I do both of your ass cheeks will melt ¶
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."""
"Shoot, Blue Ivy gonna look her dad dead in the face and be just like this here."
"""Do you hear what you named me?"
"Fuck you, Shawn."""
"""And since you wanna name me weird stuff,"
"""I'm gonna go sleep with Chris Brown and R. Kelly."
"How you like that?"""
"Two large bowls of chili and, uh, I'd like some milk."
I'll have some orange juice.
That's it.
That'll do it?
And do you know how you'd like that?
Rare.
Rare.
"Well, you got it."
"Billy, what's the matter with you?"
Nothing.
"[man] Okay, fellas, when you put that away, come back and give us a hand over here."
"Okay, Art, you got it."
"Get ready, Charlie."
"All right, Charlie, start that winch."
It's coming.
It's coming.
"Hey, that's the RV we saw this morning."
"Yeah, I think you're right, Billy."
Maybe I better go up there and tell that sheriff about that.
You guys stay in the car.
"Hold it, Charlie."
"Hold it a bit, hold it."
"All right, all right, give it to 'em."
"Hey, keep those kids away, will ya?"
Get those kids out of there.
I'll call you if I need you.
"Pardon me, officer."
"Suppose someone sort of found something, then later on, it turned out to be important."
"What's ""sort of found something""?"
Is it anything like stole something?
"Suppose it did, what would the police do?"
"I don't know, lock 'em up for 99 years?"
You came over here to tell me you told me so?
Yeah.
And I wanted to show you how much nicer I am.
That's because you want to make out with me.
"Uh, not in here."
"It's a little intimate, you know."
And it would be a little difficult since I can't sit on that bed.
Maybe I'll just sit...
Over here.
I feel like such a loser.
I have no girlfriends.
"I don't have any friends either, but I'm not a loser and neither are you."
"It's not that I'm feeling sorry for myself, but..."
I miss my room.
I miss my bed.
"I miss my pets, my friends, my family."
"And most of all, I miss my virginity."
"Well, if you want, you can have mine."
(CHUCKLING)
Shut up.
I knew you were going to say that.
"So, what were you girls going to do at your sleepover, anyway?"
Talk about you.
I told you that's my favorite subject.
We can talk about me all you want.
"Cecilia, you are a heck of a mah-jongg player."
Played growing up.
I'm still lost.
"Next time, poker."
"Oh, I don't gamble, but if you make it penny poker,"
I might be willing to lose a buck or two.
"Put the phone away, Dylan."
I'll be right there.
I don't want Chris to see this.
"-Well, what's wrong?"
What is it?
-Shh.
You're convinced that it's genuine?
I don't know.
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
Might be best to have a man with experience.
Maybe someone who's spent time in foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
Bye.
"Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it."
"*MICHAEL EVERY DAY* Season 02 Episode 06 ""Hodophobia Part 2"" Synchronized by srjanapala"
you're an alcoholic.
Yesterday was an unusual day.
You drank at lunch.
I had one beer.
"Three, actually."
And then you drank the champagne before you tried to poison a moose.
That was to make room for the pills.
You drank at the trucker bar.
"I mean, you really drank there."
And let's say
- it was stress-induced drinking...
"- I can relate to that, but..."
It was something you said to the stripper
- that really sealed it.
- At the bar?
"- At the hotel, at 4:28."
- What did I say?
"You said ""I'm an alcoholic."""
Did I have sex with the stripper?
There was more crying than sex.
- I made her cry?
- Not her...
Oh God!
Look...
- I don't know what I said last night...
"- I mean, I really don't know what I said last night, but it wasn't necessarily the truth."
In Vino Veritas.
"Is not accurate, is what I'm saying."
"It's just an expression, and it's Latin so people give it more weight than it deserves."
So what does he like?
"Well, I kind of just gathered that so far he likes sitting on people's shoulders and sneezing on the top of my head, so..."
Okay.
"Well, um, I'm gonna go."
"Will, it was really nice to meet you."
Can I get a high-five?
- No?
OK.
- All right.
"Anyway, should we go show off to all of Detroit?"
My ring says yes.
Yoohoo!
"Dude, I can't believe you didn't tell me about proposing."
Give me a break.
I didn't tell anyone.
"Well, you told Backstreet Boys"
You didn't tell me and I'm your emotional guidance counsellor.
You know it's like I'm your sensei.
I don't speak Japanese and neither do you.
"Anyway, see this is the kind of thing we need to cherish."
Okay?
Our banter.
Our back and forth.
It's awesome.
"We've got to love this while we can because you're engaged and we may only be be living together another 7, 8, 9, 10 years."
- Who's engaged for 11 years?
- Turtles.
OK.
I didn't...
I didn't know 7-year-olds can improv like that.
"Actually, since Candace has her house we thought it might be romantic if I moved"
- in on Valentine's day.
"Honey, look, it's best not to talk much about it until she's calmed down."
Is that gonna be the deal?
Sister blanche can't be annoyed with details right now?
"well, you saw how she was last night."
I saw how she was.
"Now, Iet's cop a gander at the bill of sale."
I haven't seen any.
What do you mean?
"She didn't show you papers, deed of sale, nothing like that?"
Seemed like it wasn't sold.
"well, now, what was it, then?"
Giveaway to charity?
-She'II hear you.
-I don't care if she hears me.
"-Now, Iet's see the papers."
"-Honey, there weren't any papers."
She didn't show any papers.
I don't care about papers.
Wait.
"Now, listen, did you ever hear of the napoleonic Code, stella?"
-I haven't heard of the napoleonic Code.
-AII right.
"Okay, then."
-Let me enlighten you on a point or two.
-Yes?
"Now, we got here in the state of Louisiana what's known as the napoleonic Code."
"According to which, what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband also and vice versa."
will you listen.
"Take, for instance, I had that piece of property--"
My head is swimming.
"Oh, well, all right, dear."
Okay.
Just what you see.
"With the Ministry's cutbacks, when someone retires they don't send anyone new."
And the weapons are from the Moroccan War.
So what's the plan?
Do you have what we asked for?
There's the clothes.
Here you go.
"Two Civil Guard uniforms and for you, a monk's robes."
And the explosives to blow up the door.
I'll carry that.
I won't argue with you about that.
"Ah, one more thing."
"In case of an emergency, ring the Abbey's bells."
And what do we have the phones for?
"They're worthless here, in these mountains there's no coverage."
The Spanish hell is everywhere.
What is the Spanish hell?
"Nothing, a joke."
You can tell it on the way.
Let's get to the monastery.
(Thunder)
"(ANSWERING MACHINE) ""This is the talking device of Ambrosio Espínola Doria,"
Grandee of Spain.
"If you want to leave a message, do so after hearing the signal""."
(beep)
Message for Espínola.
Emergency call from the Ministry.
I repeat: emergency call from the Ministry.
(Thunder)
Are you worried?
Aren't you?
We have a very complicated mission ahead of us.
This is the center of the collection.
You'll find this in the Main Room.
All the artworks are to be removed and all of them handled with the utmost care.
"You'll enter the property at midnight, on my command."
Is that clear?
"Yes, sir!"
Alright.
Good evening.
"Good evening, everyone!"
"Ok, let's not stand on ceremony, let's jump straight in with"
item number one in your catalogue:
"""A drive around the circuit in Monaco"", beginning bidding at... 50 thousand!"
"Now don't be shy, do we see 50 thousand?"
50!
Do I see 55?
55!
I see 55...
Do I see 60?
Your hand up?
Do we see 60?
"Is that 70, sir, or wonderful hair. 70!"
That's gone to you.
Thank you very well!
Auctions can be pretty torrid affairs.
Yes!
"I believe the last time you and I saw each other, we were bidding on the Malevich."
"You won that one, I guess."
Have you still got that Mondrian:
"""Study In Composition number 2""?"
Red and Blue!
"Yes, of course, that's one of our favorites."
Constantine hung a Rauschenberg next to it and would talk about the unbroken tradition between the two.
And I lied to a whole lot of people who you didn't wanna talk to.
And I also listened to your friends tell me what a great boss I had.
As if I needed to hear that.
"Alex, I know you."
I know what a good man you are.
And I know how you've tried with Louise.
I love you for that.
All right.
Now just tell me one thing.
"When you were up in that kitchen a while ago, chopping those vegetables, you were very happy."
Yes.
And why did it change after that telephone call?
"You called her before when I was up there in the kitchen, right?"
You don't get a divorce on the telephone!
What difference does it make?
It's over with!
"Now, wait a minute!"
[Sighs]
I should've told her earlier.
You wanna know why I didn't talk to her?
I just wasn't sure how you'd react when I told you that I loved you.
"[Chuckles] Oh, no."
You weren't sure how I'd react?
- That's right.
"- Alex, what you decide with Louise... shouldn't be tied up with my reactions."
Go and find her.
Talk to her.
"Even if she hates you, she needs you."
And when you've got that settled...
Okay.
All right.
"I'm not going to, uh, lose you, am I?"
You're broadcasting it that to Akan!
Enough!
Enough.
"Even if I did believe you, you still have to..."
Oh!
"Henry, no!"
No!
You brought them to my lab!
I trusted you!
"Henry, please kill me?"
Akan won't.
"He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!"
"What the fuck was I thinking, that Akan's toy robot was my friend?"
"Thank you, Henry."
"Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks."
"My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife... together, right?"
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"Right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.
Got it?
Here they come.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Now.
- 0h.
- (Laughing)
- You know the purse I bought in Paris?
- Yeah.
Bill Edward's tonsils.
(Hank) Mommy!
Daddy!
"Daddy, come with us!"
We're gonna see the medicine man.
"- Maybe you can learn something, Daddy."
- l wouldn't be surprised.
Anytime he starts wearing you out - l haven't enjoyed the market so much.
- l never thought of it that way before.
- What?
I'm wearing Johnny Matthews' appendix.
What about the boat trip?
"It took two boys, one girl, and two sets of twins, didn't it?"
And Mrs Morgan's hives.
(Laughing)
- How are the acrobats today?
- Wonderful.
Watch that kid that goes clear to the top there.
- l'll see you later.
- Yes.
All the way home we'll be riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcers.
And Allida Markle's asthma.
Now if we could just get four cases of seven-year-itch we could retire.
"0r if Mrs Yarrow's really gonna have triplets, we could completely redecorate the house."
What would they say if they heard us?
0ne of the reasons I came to a place like Marakesh is so we could say things like that without everybody hearing us.
I'd like to say something where nobody could hear us.
This is the safest place.
Your love blobs looked like Yul Brynner snogging Kojak.
I'm not prepared to rise to it.
Your spite and venom offends me not.
- Baldy blobs.
"- Right, that's it."
That is it.
"I hope you've got a good lawyer, because I am suing and you're going to prison forever."
"Hello, Filthy?"
"Yeah, it's Richie here."
I wanna sue Eddie.
Richie Rich.
Your client.
"I'm five foot ten, brown hair..."
"Look, it's not important."
"My minder, Edward, says that I've got bald love blobs and I want to sue."
Have I?
"Well, they're not so much bald as receding."
I'd put a wig on them for the trial.
"Bloodsucker, what do I pay you for?"
"I know I don't, it was a rhetorical question."
Goodbye forever!
He was furious.
But I persuaded him to give you a chance.
Shut up and tell me why you are wearing a hat that makes you look like you've got a toilet roll on your head.
"Because, Eddie, I have taken up the skillet and the frying pan."
I've been studying cookery all morning and I am now a master chef.
- That's why I'm wearing this great hat.
- You look like a chicken drumstick.
Ha ha!
"Wrong again because, actually, I look great."
- We are having a dinner party.
- Oh-hoo.
The City hunter... is you!
He recklessly ran around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor... became like that because of you!
You killer!
"Entered the country on April 13, 2011."
"On May 2nd, he came to work in Network Security and Communication in the Blue House."
"When the Blue House's IP was used during the Lee Kyung Wan incident, I met Professor Lee Yoon Sung in this room."
"When the Blue House's IP was used to hack the police CCTV system, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo came."
He was even there in the library looking for the Blue House Security Agent Album from 83'.
Is it Lee Yoon Sung?
Seoul Prosecutor's Office's Investigator Jang Pil Jae is here.
Okay.
Let him in.
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo was investigating two people he thought might be the City Hunter...
Lee Jin Pyo and professor Lee Yoon Sung.
Lee Jin Pyo and Lee Yoon Sung?
Lee Jin Pyo was part of the Special Forces team.
And before 1983 he was definitely a bodyguard at the Blue House.
"However, he went missing after that."
So Prosecutor Kim Young Joo thought he definitely has something to do with the Sweep Mission.
"He now uses a new identity as Steve Lee, a Korean living in America."
But that's actually fake.
He was a drug lord in the Triangle...
although it's not confirmed yet.
Triangle.
Then Lee Yoon Sung?
"As expected, another Blue House bodyguard in 1983 who came from the Special Forces named Park Mu Yeol, and a woman named Lee Kyung Hee gave birth to him."
Park Moo Yeol and Lee Kyung Hee's...?
From what I found out...
Lee Jin Pyo took Lee Yoon Sung when he was 1 month old and raised him in the Triangle.
Wait.
I think the president noticed something.
Is everything a joke to you?
Hey...
"I figure one day we're going to be buried here ourselves, and I"
"think it would be nice if our kids came and, and joked around with us."
I hope that's not for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
"We got more coming, right?"
"Oh, they're trickling in."
It's taking a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
"Jake, Eric, get on down to the pass."
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time before their advance unit hits.
Not you.
Why not?
Because these people elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
"And, besides, in a few minutes,"
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying a rifle and... and I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
"You know, Allie's safe."
"She's been assigned to Town Hall, and the fighting is miles from there."
"Right now, there really isn't anything else you can be doing."
Here we go.
Jake?
"Jake, you are about to have company."
Already?
Romeo and Juliet.
"Act 2, scene 2, line 2."
The balcony scene.
That's-
Your favorite scene in the play.
I like that you pay attention to weird little details like that.
You do?
You're blushing.
I am?
I shouldn't have said that.
I totally embarrassed you.
No.
Amanda... you can always say whatever you want with me.
"Glazed Cornish game hens on a bed of sautéed greens, sweet-potato soufflé and asparagus, with shaved Romano and pancetta."
I don't think this is what we ordered.
Right. 'Cause nothing says romance like a smoked turkey wrap.
I took some liberties with the menu.
You made this?
No one knows I'm secretly a fan of Top Chef.
And no one ever will.
Bon appétit.
Stop staring.
I can't.
I'm O.D'ing on suspense.
I wonder how it's going.
You wanna know if it's going badly.
What you witnessed earlier was a completely uncharacteristic outburst.
"No, it's how you really feel."
It was just a mini meltdown brought on by some stupid homework assignment.
"The ""Who You Really Are"" essay?"
No one ever takes that seriously.
"Well, almost no one."
Looks like she didn't suffer.
Sometimes...
"For some, death is a kind of deliverance."
"That's it, a gun shot, 12 gauge... almost point blank She died on the spot,"
And... the young black man?
"At first glance, from what the ambulance guy said.."
brain dead... most probably.
"As for the lady... she'II be on the table around 1 1 :00am, so my report should be on your desk around 3:00pm."
"I can send it to montreal, if you prefer."
No big deal.
"We'II take it, to hell with the montreal guys."
It's a change from horse theft and conjugal violence.
"Are you sure, Gary?"
"Yeah, sure."
alright then.
"We'II talk around 3:00, 3:30."
Perfect.
Bye.
What more do we have here?
"There are 3, 4 witnesses inside, there's this."
The neighbors say it belongs to the victim.
There's this.
Three cartridges.
"One was found near the victim, another here, in the grass."
"One is part of those over there, probably shot at martial."
How is he?
Not so good.
Quite a shock.
Anything on what started it?
"Yeah, it's all over there."
It started here alright.
"could be the young black guy, we found his bicycle."
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
"Mr. Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."
It's called accessory after the fact.
I don't like accessories after the fact.
I don't want them in my school.
You are going to come to my office today at 3 o'clock...
and you are going to tell me everything you know about...
Why would he call me?
"Even if he calls, I'm not ready to talk to him."
Please.
Don't get furious.
"Even when he had was blind, he was peaceful."
Now everything has turned upside-down.
Why are you telling me this?
Varun left for Kanyakumari all of a sudden.
He didn't share any further details.
He has not been picking my calls either.
I'm confused.
And worried.
So I called you.
"Sorry, aunt."
Don't call me hereafter regarding him.
I'll get it repaired.
"This Alphonse can fix all phones, don't worry."
Okay.
I'll leave.
Bye.
Welcome.
- Did you get any information?
No call from the number you mentioned got completed.
From Manoj's number?
Yes.
"Unless the call gets completed, I can't find the number Manoj has been dialling."
I checked the date you mentioned.
"After the 17th, there are no incoming or outgoing calls to and from the number."
"But before the 17th, calls have been made and received to and from a specific number."
I eve have it written down somewhere.
Here it is.
7599... 447333.
- Apology accepted.
"For God's sakes, you're the only woman for me, now hang up the fucking phone!"
"Listen, your skills are missed around here, Frank."
I need you.
"Oh, my God."
"So, how about you come see me at the airport tomorrow?"
It'll be great to have you back.
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, God, yes!"
"All right, Frank."

"America is a nation of believers that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics."
"All of the people telling you, ""You can't have the country you want,"""
are the same people that wouldn't stand...
"I mean, they said, ""Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight."""
"Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we?"
Don't we love defeating them?
"To all Americans tonight, I make this promise."
We will make America safe again.
Hands down.
absolutely not.
hello.
Sing it!
Sing it!
There it is.
The crown jewel.
"AII right then, lads, tourists for the day."
"Get in, NiaII."
Ghetto.
Can we do one of those pictures where you go like that?
How do you do that?
Where you stand like this?
"Like, touching the top."
-How do you do that?
-You have to get down.
Is it working?
Looks like you're holding it up.
We're back now.
Start of the European leg of the tour.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
We need to try one of them local delicacy things from every place.
And here's the frog legs and snail stuff.
Are you down?
I'm not down for snails.
I think we should try it in every place.
Just try a delicacy from somewhere.
I've tried frogs but that's still not that weird.
"Like, snails is probably a bit disgusting."
"We've never toured Europe before so because this is the first time we've done it, it feels like an adventure because a different country every day, it feels like we're on Euro rip."
We're in D0sseIdorf.
Germany!
Do you want her to get raped and murdered?
Of course not.
You sure?
'Cause this is America.
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.
Then stop fucking with me.
This is serious.
She's adorable.
So you guys are fucking fugitives?
It's just it's Kumar's fault.
If we get out of this... the chances of us remaining friends is highly... highly--boobies.
Yeah.
"Hey, what do you think you're doing?"
Put that back on.
And keep it on.
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?
Yo.
What are you guys talking about?
Roldy was just letting me in on your situation.
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.
What about that fuckin' time we had to cover for you... lie to your ex-girlfriend about how you got crabs?
"You owe us, man."
"- Yeah, that's right."
- What?
"- OK, that was a long time ago."
- I love crabs.
Speaking of ex-girlfriends... isn't yours getting married or something?
How does everybody know about this except for me?
Wait.
You'll leave her alone?
- Yeah!
Meltem said you know me?
"Yeah, we have a mutual acquaintance."
This is getting exciting.
I know your father.I'm his partner.
Shit.
"- Hey, don't worry."
I'm here alone.
Let me go.
"Let her go, will ya!"
"- Shut up, okay?"
I'm not going back.
- You know you're father's almost cracking up.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh man.
Shit.
Want some chewing gum?
"Here, they make the best bubbles."
What kind of cop are you anyway?
A new reform-oriented generation.
We're civilian friendly and practise painless police brutality.
Hey?
Are you gonna tell me what happened back then?
I heard about your mother's accident.
My father totally cracked up.
He just couldn't understand why it had to happen to him.
"There was always a reason, a motive."
"Hey, I got so sick of hearing that crap."
Then he started observing me even more than ever.
He'd secretly watch me on my way home from school...
"I didn't want to run away, but he nearly smothered me with his love."
- Yes.
My goodness.
I hope you have friends here.
"Well, there's Tom who takes care of the lighthouse and the ferry comes every other Monday with our supplies."
- That's all?
- Yes.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What do you do if there's an emergency?
"There's a radio transmitter at Tom's cottage, but that's really more to do with the lighthouse."
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.
"Well, you see, David and I had a motor accident on the day we were married."
That's how he lost his legs.
He was training to be a fighter pilot.
And then after the accident he...
"Well, we both wanted to run away, so we came here."
It seemed like a good idea.
It might have been a mistake.
You can't blame him for wanting to run away.
"No, I don't."
It's terribly sad.
"No, it was our fault completely."
We'd had a bit to drink and we were driving much too fast...
- Suddenly there was this lorry...
"No, no."
Haven't the leisure.
"Oh, dear me."
And here I thought...
- I'm glad to see you're not really hurt.
"- But I am, doctor."
- Really.
- Maybe I better send you to the hospital?
"I give up, Higgins."
What is it you want from me?
"Are you, by any chance, the T. Magnum who played on the American bridge team... in Sao Paulo in '72?"
"Say good-bye, Higgins, because the answer is no."
I will not make a fourth for your Wednesday afternoon bridge club.
- I don't play with amateurs.
- We are all Life Masters.
"- Well, then, you're better than I am."
"- Magnum, I wouldn't stoop to ask if it weren't a bloody emergency."
- What happened?
Your fourth die?
- Yes.
"Higgins, uh, I'm sorry."
Look.
I was just joking.
I quite understand.
Look.
"I am on an investigation, but if I can wrap it up by tomorrow afternoon, I'll play."
Splendid.
"Now, what can I do to assist you in your work?"
What do you know about Robert Caine?
"Well, only what I've read."
A rather obscure judge till his recent nomination to the Supreme Court.
"However, those who should know speak very highly of him."
- Shall I pull some clippings?
- That would be very nice.
Thank you.
- But I have to leave in an hour.
- I'll have them ready for you and warm up the Ferrari.
Splendid.
"Higgins, who died?"
Mr. Blackmore.
No...
Trevor...
You still got half an hour.
I can fix you some eggs.
I'm tired but thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on guys, keep it moving."
"Yes sir, yes sir, Master Tucker, motherfucker"
"Hey, why is that machine down?"
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill.
"Where am I going to make up that 7 minutes, Miller?"
Your paycheck?
"- Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations."
- What regulations?
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery.
"Ocean, 1989."
Yeah?
Write to your congressman and hurry that up.
"Congratulations, Reznik."
You just made my shitlist.
"She copping his joint, right?"
"And he's tellin' her, you know, baby this, baby that..."
Chatting her up like mother fucking Barry White.
"Talking about what he going to do to her, and how he going to make her coochy feel and all that."
That's right.
"So then, she stopped"
She looked up at him with these big old puppy eyes she's like...
"That sounds good pappy, but me no have no coochy."
"So, my man's like ""Say what?"
"!"""
"The last time we went to a concert, it, uh, didn't turn out too well."
Things are different now.
"- Well, then, come on."
You like this band?
- I like Journey.
Julie's waiting in the car.
You and I are gonna talk later.
Yes?
- I'm not sure I want to talk to you.
- Sandy.
Kirsten is the one good thing in your life.
How could you do this to her?
After all she has done for you?
- I have to think of my marriage.
- What does Julie Cooper know about being the CEO. of a multimillion dollar company?
- It's a figurehead position.
You said so yourself.
Kirsten will continue to run the show.
- And work for Julie?
Why the hell w
- What do you suggest I do?
- I suggest you find a way to make it up to Kirsten now.
"Unless you want Julie to be your lawyer, too."
- Can you see okay?
"- Yeah, I can see fine."
"- There's no, like, obstructed views or anything, right?"
- Right.
- Okay.
"I just know, sometimes at shows, you can't see so well, 'cause, you know, the tall people are standing."
"Yeah, right, you know, but now I'm just having a hard time hearing."
"- But, thanks for getting me a seat."
- No problem.
The same reason why she wanted to fly around the world... so she didn't have to deal with me.
Why are you telling me this?
You should be telling her.
Greg!
This is coffin talk.
"You know, you're critical of your mom, but you're the one who's thinking of herself right now."
You're acting just like her.
"So, this is it, Greg."
This is where your life ends.
"Sweetheart, this is your chance to have a real conversation with your mother."
Fine.
I've never been able to get through to her.
At least you know how to touch her.
Hey.
Everything okay?
"Oh, my God."
So good!
I know it's none of my business...
Here's where you stop talking.
- ...but if you want my opinion...
- I don't.
...medication has done wonders for my step-kids.
"- Viv, I am not gonna..."
- I get it.
"I had my doubts about it going in, too."
"But those kids were totally out of control, and once I started taking these,"
I found them much easier to handle.
"So, these pills help you smile through the pain?"
I feel nothing.
Mm.
"So, turns out Anna-Kat doesn't need drugs..."
We do.
- a nice walk.
- I hate walking.
"Besides, my driver's around the corner."
I have to go meet Simas Gort Morgan... and he's going to introduce me to Milo Norbuck... who's gonna be in the new CK campaign with me.
I can.
Should I come with you?
- It's business.
"- It's business, right."
"Page me tomorrow and maybe we'll have dinner, okay?"
Page?
"You know, Jocelyn, I have been inside all day... and I would like to take a nice walk."
- Would you like to join me?
"- Sure, I'd love to."
"Darling, change of plans."
"I have to meet Norbuck, at the Mercer, at 2AM... let's have some dinner at Raul's."
"- I'll take you next time, okay?"
"- Sure, no problem."
Okay.
"Antoniette, can I borrow your intern?"
The Doyle Gallery just called and... they desperately need this gown.
"It's the dress Kim Basinger orderly... asked, the one with only one sleeve, the one for the celebrity couture... auction, immediately."
You can finish this when you get back.
Hurry up!
- You heard her.
"- For God's sake, watch your back."
There are spies everywhere.
Trust no one.
"- Guard that with your soul, darling."
- I shall.
I owe you lunch.
"November, December or something..."
- our girls will figure it out.
"See, this gentleman thinks that we should comp his room... because it was haunted by a ghost thief."
- Delinda!
- Wolfgang!
What a surprise to see you.
Ed.
"Hey, Wolf."
We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
I wanted to get here early to make sure everything is perfect... for the grand opening tomorrow night.
"""Wolfgang Puck at the Montecito."""
"Has a good ring to it, don't you think so?"
I think so.
Wow.
Just rolls off the tongue.
"Ed, let's go."
Where we going?
- In the kitchen.
- [Delinda] I so don't need this right now.
"On top of Wolfgang's opening tomorrow,"
I get a tip the health department's inspecting Mystique this week.
- [Danny] Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
- Pay up.
You heard her.
So you gonna pay your bill and leave nicely or is this gonna get ugly?
[People Cheering] There you go.
Can you believe this guy actually thought he was gonna get a free room by saying it was haunted?
"He said the ghost was a dark-haired woman, right?"
"Uh, no."
I think he said the ghost was a ghost.
Oh.
Maybe it was Monica.
"What, stopping dine-and-dashers from the great beyond?"
"I know where my life is going, and I want you to go with me."
"I'm not saying I want you to move in right now but I don't want to buy this place unless, at some point you could see yourself moving in."
"So, what do you think?"
I can't do this.
Okay.
"Well, if it's too fast, I guess we can always just..."
I can't do any of this.
I mean what you're saying and what you're offering is what every girl wants.
It's what I always wanted.
It's just...
You don't want it with me.
Okay.
I have a question.
"Is there any way we could dial it back to before, when we were just sleeping together because I don't know, I felt like that gelled."
Babe?
It was nice meeting you.
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.
You too.
Good night.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
You forget something?
"Yeah, I did."
Really?
What did you forget?
This.
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night to bring me back a promotional pen?
Yeah.
I thought I should just come up with some really great excuse to get over here.
"That's how it's done, isn't it?"
Sometimes.
"Look, I can't stop thinking about you."
It's a problem.
You never called.
What's wrong with you?
He is in deep shit.
You don't even know him.
His family doesn't accept him.
I can't leave him here.
I don't understand why this should be your business.
He will be saferwith me.
"""German rescues gay lover from radical Islamic family..."""
Perfect!
Have you gone nuts?
"Not only that, I love him."
Why don't you adopt a gay boy from all nations of the third world?
You could build a rainbow community.
I can't abandon a person in need.
Those kids in Afghanistan were going to die anyway.
There was a war going on.
I didn't even speak the language.
I shouldn't have pushed forthose pictures.
You could have stepped on those mines yourself.
I'm the one who lives with this every day.
There're mines everywhere.
I can't keep doing this.
"If he everbreaks your heart, don't call me."
What's up?
She won't stop.
She starts calling at 5am everyday.
I'm really sick of lying for you.
Is it worth it?
What are you hiding?
"Whatever it is, just be brave and come out with it."
They delivered this yesterday.
He was sick.
"I can only go off what I see, and I'll be honest with you, the personal stuff..."
It scares me.
- He put his dad in a chair.
- He was punished.
I'm handing you a world-class fighter with a redemption story.
The thing is he's never addressed the father thing.
What's their relationship?
"Is he helping the guy out, or has he got him stashed in some home stewing in his own shit?"
Ryan never talks about it.
It makes him look arrogant.
The timing's just not right for us.
This is the last time you'll be able to afford him.
Do you have any female fighters?
Rick:
That's right!
Don't stop running till you get to the border!
- Get out of my fucking house!
"- Hey, what happened?"
Stay out!
You made a mess!
"No, no, no."
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
You made a big mess!
Now just go!
Don't come back!
Stay out of my fucking house!
You stay the fuck out!
You tell her to stay the fuck out of here!
- [Engine turns over]
- What happened?
Maurice:
The king plans to behead her within the week.
Francesca:
He's accused you of adultery.
"Clarissa, dear, listen to me."
I'm your mother.
Let yourself be loved.
It'll take us hours to dig her a grave.
There's no one around to check us.
Catherine:
Make the blow sure and quick.
Remember I've paid you extra.
I don't want my children
To see you hacking at me.
Don't break the clasp.
I've promised this to one of my ladies.
Prawns?
My youngest daughter can't eat them.
The flowers.
"Full vases, cascading bouquets..."
Where are they?
We were told by the king to save them
For the actual day.
I need to see their placement.
What about the wine?
"100 casks, flowing freely."
The nobles will expect it.
"Yes, let them drink and swim in my blood"
And wonder who among them is next
Once that bastard sebastian takes the throne.
"Come in, please."
I'm nearly ready.
"Oh, forget it."
Look.
"Where are all your weapons, Captain?"
Don't you display your weapons?
Trelane.
"Don't fret, Captain."
"I'm only a bit upset with you, but this Mr. Spockyou mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly, impudent act of taking you from me, which is he?"
I'm Spock.
"Oh, surely not an officer."
"Isn't quite human, is he?"
My father is from the planet Vulcan.
And are its natives predatory?
Not generally.
But there have been exceptions.
"Oh, really?"
You will see to his punishment?
On the contrary.
I commend his action.
But I don't like him.
Get off my ship.
"Oh, rot!"
You're all going back with me.
We're not going anywhere.
Nonsense.
I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos planned for you all.
You shan't spoil it for me.
"Anyway, the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate and tasteful."
Don't you agree?
No.
"But so much more fitting, honorable sir."
You...
DeSalle.
"And how he had, like, eight surgeries."
"This is in the middle of us trying to hook up,"
- she starts telling me that.
- Ugh.
"And I was just like, yeah, I can't."
I can't do it.
"And I'm sorry, but all I kept thinking was, is that gonna happen to me if I have sex with her?"
"Like, you're gonna catch her son's thing?"
"I know it's totally irrational, but that's what I kept thinking."
"Like, it's her vagina's fault and I'm not going anywhere near that vagina."
What's the oldest woman you would have sex with?
The oldest I've had sex with is 48.
How old were you?
17.
- Was that your virginity?
- Yes.
"- Oh, my God."
- Really?
- You lost your virginity to an older woman.
"- Oh, yeah."
You must be-
"- You should be great in bed, then."
- No...
"- No, there's no way."
- She was a real pro.
- Really?
"I couldn't keep up, yeah, and I think it scarred me."
That's why I would assume you were great.
"Was she a real pro, like..."
"I think she was a prostitute, but she didn't charge me."
Okay.

Excuse me.
"[Derek] Come on, Sara, this is for your audition."
Come on.
"No, no, no."
You're not attacking it.
"You're not working it, okay ?"
Come on now.
I'll get it right the next time.
You don't have time.
You gotta get it right now.
- l can't work like this.
- Like what ?
"Like this, with you dictating to me."
Allright.
Let's take a break.
"I'm sorry. lt's just that the audition's next week, and everything is so messed up at school."
"Ooh, I like him a lot."
"Just sign here, and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate."
Whoo-hoo!
We're rich.
"Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows."
We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.
"- Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet."
- Huh?
"Oh, right."
"So I guess you're in okay shape, huh?"
- No heart problems or anything?
"- Well, I--"
- Boo!
- [ Groaning ]

Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death...
"I must return to my large, empty mansion to rattle around... and await the inevitable alone."
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.
- Let's push him down the steps.
- No!
"You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money... maybe it would be nice if you spent some time with him."
- Well--
"- Come on, honey."
All right.
How come Bart gets to do that... and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?

They had it the hard way.
You can not even imagine what will happen to them ifthey are taken to our premises.
Take them.
Theywill make up fortheir guilt.
I've my orders.
I do not have the right.
And I have my orders as well and they are about our offensive.
So you'd better stay awayfrom me.
It is underyour responsibility.
Surely it is.
It is not your business.
All this war is only my business.
The division security section speaking.
I need Captain Shulgin.
He is in the headquarters.
- Kotov!
- Kotov!
Private Kotov reporting.
-Why have you been sent to the court martial?
-A intentional self-wound.
Yourfile states that you used to be a sergeant and had battle awards... including a Medal for Battlefield Courage.
"That's right. ln fact I was discharging the gun, it came off and the bullet hit my leg."
No one believes me.
-Will you believe me?
"-Yes, I will."
when I see you in the battlefield.
If you want to keep fit in this weather.
"Don't worry, I will."
Bye-bye.
Ah-choo!
"He's always been a poor one, Mr. herriot."
He never seems to put on no flesh.
- Which field was he in?
In the orchard for a few hours.
That's a thriving cough you've got there.
You're right there.
I'm sure I've got bronchitis.
"I'd watch it, if I were you."
Was there any fruit in the orchard?
"Aye, we had a greatly crop-- orchard is full."
"- That's it, then."
That fruit's brought his digestion to a complete standstill.
"Bogged up, is he?"
- Uh-huh.
A good dose of linseed oil will soon shift him.
"No, we're going to have to open him up, I'm afraid."
It's a very serious condition.
And we're going to have to operate here.
Anyone around who can lend a hand?
"Aye, if you're set on it."
But I still think a good dose of oil will put him to rights.
It'll be a lot easier.
I'm sorry.
The condition's far too advanced.
I've got to shift that fruit immediately.
"Thou knows best, I suppose."
"Hang on then, veterinary."
I'll get old George down at village.
All right.
Welcome!
Would you like to go inside?
All right.
Bring us a bowl of hot soup and a bottle of rice wine.
You got it!
One bowl of hot soup!
All right!
Rice cakes?
It's a grand opening cake.
I hope you'll visit us often.
You're so nice.
And you're pretty too.
"Oh my, I'm blushing!"
I haven't been complimented on my looks since my teen years.
"I know you're just being nice, but you made my day."
"The papers fell down, your blouse dropped, the captain said to hang it."
- What's the matter with your mouth?
- Personal secret.
Never lets go of it.
"Six-two and even, he swallows it, his senior sorority pin."
"I peeked at your papers, and he rescued them."
You went through my papers?
The war's over.
Where are we going and why?
We don't like secrets.
Thank you. I should have known better than try to hold back f rom men who have operated the way you have behind enemy lines.
I wanted Gen. Steele to see your f aces when you heard.
Cold Steele?
It's his doing that your recommendation passed.
- Johnny's congressional?
- Congressional?
"He isn't finding it easy, following the success of his first novel."
I do what I can to help.
I take care of the day-to-day things so he's free to focus on his work.
Try and keep him happy so his mind can focus on being creative.
Cook him his favourite food.
That sort of thing.
Tonight I've cooked him pilchards.
Hmm.
Bob loves pilchards.
There you are.
- There's a lot more than I'd expected.
We've been at it for hours.
"- We have, haven't we?"
I want to apologise for the other day.
- There's no need.
I should never have put Dr Campbell in that position... or said half the things I did.
I understand.
I can't imagine how it must feel to think of your child going to fight.
What...?
- It's heading for the village.
"If Will doesn't need me, I'll be straight back."
Do you want a lift?
Thank you!
What happened?
- I heard Bob shouting for help.
I found him being violently sick and doubled up in pain on the hall floor.
"We need to go, Doc!"
- Tell Pat.
Ah...
Pat?
Come in.
Will asked me to let you know Bob won't be discharged until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.
I will not go down that way.
I choose to fight back!
"I choose to rise, not fall."
"I choose to live, not die."
And I know I know that what's within me is also within you.
That's why I ask you now to join me.
Join me.
Rise up with me.
Rise up on the wings of this slain angel.
We'll rebuild on the soul of this little warrior.
We will pick up his standard and raise it high.
Carry it forward until this city your city our city his city is a palace again!
Is a palace again!
"I am with you, little James."
I am you.
Thank you very much.
Terrible thing to bury a child.
Your trip to Washington.
The stuff for the Convention Committee.
History of New York City for Senator Marquand.
Reservation at the Willard Hotel.
"Lincoln stayed there, by the way."
Enough about me.
Enough about me.
What are you going do tonight after I'm gone?
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about it.
You're going to get yourself a good meal.
You're going to pass up that double cheeseburger from Roy Rogers.
"You're going to go to Dominic's and get take-out, on me."
Get a decent meal.
"But before you go to Dominic's, go to Macy's and get a chair with legs and arms."
Everybody out in the trenches.
Quick.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Do you want to get killed?
Not particularly.
"Hey, you two."
Outside with you.
- Must you two always be the last?
"-Oh, yeah?"
You try jumping in those trenches first.
Everybody jumps in on top of you.
How do you think I got my hernia?
Ugh.
"Go on, let's go."
Aha.
Aha.
Aha.
So it got to be Christmas Day in Stalag 17.
"You ask me, it was more like the 4th of July with all the fireworks that were to go off and bust the camp wide open."
It sure started off innocently enough with a party going on in every barracks.
"I love you, I love you"
Is all that I can say
"I love you, I love you"
The same old words I'm saying in the same old way
"I love you, I love you"
Three words that are divine
And now my dear I'm waiting to hear
The words that make you mine
"Come on, Animal, let's trip the light fantastic."
Leave me alone.
"Ah, don't cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive."
Snap out of it.
- Not at all.
Do you think we're alone in life?
I get criticized because I... don't take care of my family.
You know my parents have nothing.
I can't support... two families.
Go back to your parents if you want.
You talk to me like that... precisely now?
How can you want me away from my parents?
"Besides, it's you who forced me to work."
"From now on, I will work."
Did you find an employer?
That's my problem.
Also mine.
"Anyway, it'll happen soon."
"My only frustration in this relationship, is not having children."
And also mine!
"If we don't have kids,"
I can't do anything.
I don't want to hear you... talking that way.
"Let's stop this discussion, we're too nervous."
"Smarten up, tonight we'll be having dinner at the Director's house."
I don't want to go.
Your hosts look down on everybody.
You're only coming with me.
"I know, but I don't feel like it."
Get ready!
- Djénéba... hi!
- Sinaté... hi!
- Is you husband in?
"- Yes, he's expecting you."
- How much is this sack?
- 20700 FM.
I wasn't sure if you cared about me being here and him not.
- I do not.
- Right.
Because you are a guest.
And this is probably your summer home.
He used to bring other women here so he could cheat on my mother.
"So, no family vacations."
"Only horrible, traumatic ones."
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(LAWNMOWER)
(ENGINE STOPS)
You never smell cut grass in the city.
I don't find you charming.
"You are just like him, and I hope you learn to take responsibility for yourself before you destroy the lives of people who care about you."
(STRAINS)
This is really nice.
"Thanks, Dad."
"So, how's it been up here?"
It's been good.
I've really enjoyed all the alone time.
I'm sorry about the scheduling problem.
Will you admit that you made a mistake?
I don't think that's necessary.
It was a simple misunderstanding.
Could happen to anyone.
Was anybody speaking to you?
- I thought I was part of the conversation.
"- Well, you weren't supposed to be."
"In fact, you're not even supposed to be here."
I am.
Does that make sense?
You are the scheduling problem I was referring to.
Either your informant is bad or someone's taking the mickey.
Now can you tell me who gave you this shitty tip?
You'd better cross your fingers he's forgotten your face.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hello?
Now?
I'm coming.
I have to go.
What about the debriefing on the whores?
Start without me.
And be ready.
We're doing it again tonight.
Where are you taking me?
Nowhere.
The road ends here.
You didn't realise it was a trap?
I give you information about the squat and you charge straight in.
"I saw you leaving the hotel, you and your guys."
Someone from your team has enquired several times about this case.
Who the fuck are you protecting?
Don't say anything.
"I've got the dealer, the bullet."
It's easy to follow the story.
Get lost.
We both made a mistake.
There's nothing left to say.
Even in 15 years.
Fuck.
Yes.
This is Arnaud Ledoré.
The judge is going to search the mayor's home tomorrow morning.
"The documents he's looking for are in a safe, and the key is in the left drawer of the desk."
"-Most interesting thing probably was, um, what appeared to be that broad head arrow mark."
But it's one of those universal characters
"-that, you know, it stands for the King's Mark."
"-Yeah, exactly."
What else can it stand for?
A directional symbol?
It may be an arrow that was used for a different purpose.
"Exactly, yeah."
I mean that's...
"All that is, is my take on it."
That's my part of history that I-I know.
"But, I mean, symbolically, is that symbol used by other people?"
I don't know.
"Well, it's a symbol on the 90 Foot Stone."
-Is that right?
-Yeah.
"A triangle is on the 90 Foot Stone, an arrow symbol is on the 90 Foot Stone."
"Isitpossible that what appears to be acarvingof aBroadArrow, or the King's Mark, issomethingquitedifferent?"
"Coulditbe , as Doug Crowell insists, anotherimportantclue-- onelinkingthecarvings found at New Ross tothe90 FootStone found buried intheOakIslandMoneyPit?"
"Tim, you've taken the first step on a longer journey."
-Yes.
-Congratulations.
Welcome to Oak Island.
"Okay, let's gear up and go home."
"Onedayafter the team's productive investigationatNewRoss,"
"Rick,Martyandmembers of the Oak Island team meetwitharchaeologist Laird Niven."
-Hello.
-Hello.
They'veinvitedhim to investigate the strange square-shapedholefoundnear Dave Blankenship's property.
Okay.
"Laird, we got something we think"
-really peculiar.
- I'd lay dead just like you're gonna do.
- You would?
Sure.
"Always remember, don't be a sucker."
I'm pulling every string I can.
I'm seeing the right people.
- I can get you off with about three years.
- You talk like I can do it in a handstand.
That ain't no picnic.
You'll be outside having it soft on cushions.
It's tough.
I'm not gonna mark time.
"I'll scout around, make connections."
"- Not only for me, for both of us."
- Why should I take the fall?
There's no other way out.
Be sensible.
"If they get me, I'll be disbarred."
They'll check my vault box and grab the 100 grand.
"You don't want to lose that dough, do you?"
"All right, Frazier."
"It's my rap, and I'll take it but it's my 100 grand, and I'll take that, too, the day I get out."
Look...
"I know you're a smart lawyer, very smart but don't get smart with me."
"Very good, boys."
That's all.
"Wait till I get you outside, mug-face."
I'll immobilize you.
Yeah?
You and your old maid!
Come in.
"What's on your mind, son?"
"Inaho insists that she is an imposter, but there's no telling just how much he can see."
Have you eaten?
In a bit.
Let me find a good place to leave off.
You've been this way since we were little.
"When you're into something, everything else fades away."
Here.
"Thanks, Yuki."
"You've heard, right?"
"About Asseylum's, uh..."
Yeah.
That proclamation seemed to prove everything you've been saying.
"It all seems a little too convenient, and if that really were the genuine Princess Asseylum, would she think of a founding a kingdom in Earthspace?"
Slaine Troyard.
That douchebag who shot my dear little brother?
Thanks.
"But watch your language, Yuki."
It doesn't matter if she's real or not anymore.
I don't think anyone would bother to listen to her.
Even if she tried to broker a peace between Earth and Mars again.
"About the attack on Earth, Milord, if there are no problems, I will get preparations underway."
Milord Slaine?
I'm listening.
Proceed as planned.
"Yes, Milord."
Her Highness has yet to-.
She will wake up soon.
I know it.
"I eagerly await that day, Milord."
But... tragedies do happen.
Milord?
It's nothing.
"Where are my drawings, man?"
Maybe I burned them.
Maybe I threw them in the Hudson.
Maybe I broke them in pieces like this.
"What are you gonna do about it, huh?"
What are you going to do about it?
"You're wasting your time, Carlos."
The gringos are not going to print your fucking drawings!
Carlos:
I want you to tell me what you see.
"I can't see, Carlos."
I don't have my glasses.
You can see.
You don't want to see.
Tell me what you see!
Carlos:
And why haven't you arrested her?
"Maybe we should have, but we can't now, not without the letter."
Oh.
"We couldn't go in and search the hotel without compromising our man, which we'd rather not do."
But you and your officers-- you have every reason to go over the place.
"Well, we've already done that and found the gun that we were looking for."
I'm sure you could find a reason to do it again.
I thought we'd already searched this place once.
"Yes, we have."
What are you looking for now?
A letter.
To whom?
To giuseppe bastianini.
Who's he?
He's the Italian ambassador.
Is he a suspect?
And you to me.
You are.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"The more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
If the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while,"
So...
I thought that...
"Thank you, friend."
"- Thank you, my boy."
-(chuckles)
- A toast.
-Thank you.
"It just goes to prove, what I've always said, every dog has his day."
Thank you very much.
"Morning, Mr. Marshall."
"Hello, Kramden."
What can I do for you?
"Mr. Marshall, I have a million dollars in here."
Then you must have had a mighty good day on the bus.
Oh-ho!
"Ha, ha, ha!"
Very good!
(chuckles) Very good!
"Well, it's like the men say, Mr. Marshall, you're a good guy."
All the fellas say the same thing:
"they say you're a guy that likes new ideas and a fella that you can come to and get advice, sometimes even financial assistance. (chuckles)"
"Mr. Marshall, I have here a fortune."
"My wife made a whole bowl of this last night, and I scooped some up to bring it over as a sample."
And there it is.
What is it?
An appetizer.
The most delicious you've ever tasted in your life!
- Appetizer?
"-Sure, an appetizer."
People go nuts over appetizers.
"Walk into any supermarket-- all along the shelves, they got jars of appetizers."
But the difference is that this is something new and different.
"That's what the people go for, something new and different."
This is delicious.
"So you neglect him most of his life, I'm out of the house a week, and there you are?"
"He surprised me, Dan."
"You know, Nathan's a good kid."
You got him so screwed up he doesn't know what he wants.
"Deb got her hand up your back, Keith?"
Deb's the best thing Nathan's got going for him right now.
- She's trying to save him.
- What the hell do you think I'm trying to do?
"I've been trying to figure that out all these years, Danny."
"I don't mind you playing Daddy to one of my offspring, but leave the good one alone, would you?"
Hey Peyton.
Missing these?
Those are the keys to the squads equipment cabinet.
I gave them to Jenny yesterday to play with.
She was shaking them like a pom pom.
Maybe she'll be a cheerleader.
Or President.
You gotta think big.
"Alright, you never know."
Whatever makes her happy.
"You know, I think its really amazing how committed to her you are."
"Well, its really not that hard."
"I mean, from the moment I saw her I was totally hooked."
She's just so cute.
And I think about watching her grow up.
I couldn't imagine not being there.
"You know, I bet you're a really great dad."
I don't know.
Some days I wonder.
Hey Nathan.
Hey.
Missed you at practice.
- What are you doing?
- You're sweating.
"I've never met anybody quite like you, Jack."
I wish things were different.
I'm really a pretty likable guy when I'm not a fugitive.
I wish things were different too.
Isn't it funny how people meet?
"I mean, they can come from two totally different worlds... and never even know each other exists."
And then one day they meet and their lives are never the same.
- Are you married?
- No.
Do you have a girlfriend?
"No, I don't have a girlfriend."
And it's true that... you haven't been with a woman in a couple of years?
"It's true, yeah."
"If all this doesn't work out, you'll go back to prison, right?"
Probably.
"So it's conceivable that... you'd never be with a woman ever again, right?"
Right.
What are you doing?
Falling in love with you.
"Natalie, you can't..."
We can't do this.
I can't help it.
We may never have this chance again.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Can't see the road.
There it is.
There's the road.
"Ten more miles, do or die."
What the hell is he swerving all over for?
"- How are you, old Yannis?"
"Thank God, I'm all right."
You?
So am I.
How's Pavlos?
A good question!
He's been very sad ever since your breakup.
At first he used to come here every night and sit alone and miserable at this very table.
Every night!
Getting drunk...
Don't you see him anymore?
- What's his life like nowadays?
- He lives in poverty.
I pleaded he painted more moons on my walls to no avail...
Let it go!
He has this fixation with painting in the penthouse.
- Day and night!
"- So, he works?"
Yes but what's the point?
Who buys paintings these days?
- Perhaps someone now at the exhibition.
- What exhibition?
He is exhibiting his work at a gallery for a week now.
"It's in the papers, didn't you know?"
"No, I didn't."
"I'll go buy a framed picture for the tavern to aid the poor guy, cause... he's in dire straits!"
I can tell you that he's starving.
"No other way of helping him, proud as he is, you know him, Aliki."
"Yes, I know."
"I looked thoroughly, Aliki."
No bracelet.
I'm sorry.
"You know, I have a friend he's been an honest man all his life but it didn't get him anywhere."
So he decided to join forces with the devil.
He said that the devil would watch over him and protect him.
And what happened to him?
"Oh, he's very rich, very prosperous now."
But is he happy?
Supremely.
The race just isn't even when we're born.
Some people a head start.
All you have to do is run a little faster than the next fellow.
With the devil at your side.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Oh, ""S"" is over there."
I didn't get your name.
Clementi Sabourin.
Have my card.
I'm Wilson of Wilson Oil of Canada.
Thank you.
Look me up.
I'll do that.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Check, please, sir."
"Uh, officer."
"Yes, sir?"
I seem to have lost my wallet.
When did you last have it?
I'm sure I had it when I was standing here in line.
Was there anyone near you?
There was a man standing there?
Which direction did he go?
"I think he went out that way, but..."
I'm not sure that he took it.
They've all had incredible training.
"It was intimidating at first, but I know I'm in good company."
I'm learning about composers I never knew-
"Amanda's heart was beating rapidly, and she was speaking really fast."
"She seemed happy, but I could sense that she was troubled."
I'm already a better technical player.
Amanda... is everything all right?
I can never hide anything from you.
But I need to let my mom know I'm home.
Can we get together later?
Of course.
Good.
I guess we need to talk.
She said what?
"""We need to talk. """
What is it?
Nothing.
"No, I missed something."
"Well, when someone says, ""We need to talk,"""
sometimes it's a lead in to a discussion about feelings that have changed.
Feelings?
"Prepare yourself, dude."
She's dumping you.
At least she has the decency to do it in person.
Don't read into it.
Just wait and hear what she has to say.
No.
Not my lucky shirt.
"Josh, you've outgrown it."
I couldn't help but wonder...
Had Amanda already outgrown me?
"Okay, grab hold of the wire and make these babies blink."
"- Well, I mean..."
"- Oh, I think that's Amy."
- Where?
"Jesus Christ, I'm in the back seat and I can fucking see her."
"Oh, right there."
"Okay, fine."
- Congressman.
"- Oh, wow."
"Well, this is freaky."
"Look, I'm not hiding, just so you know."
"Okay, Congressman, time to exit through the gift shop."
"Okay, sir, you're gonna have to come with us."
"Guys, my mom is too ill to be left alone right now."
"I mean, I left her alone right now because she likes to read."
But she can't read right now because she's very sick.
But she might get better.
Or she might not get better.
- She could be buried with a book.
- We know she's not dying.
"- She's a fighter, is the thing."
- Good for her.
"As weird as it feels to still be saying this, the president would like to see you at the White House."
I feel like I'm about to kick it old school and die in office.
Quitting on a high.
Do you think I'm doing the right thing here?
"I mean, this is a good bill."
"Even watered down, I think it's gonna make a difference in people's lives."
"Ma'am, you're the president."
It's not for me to tell you what to do.
Yeah.
Guess I should kill it.
Is the right answer.
I did for a good reason.
But it has gone wrong.
Let Manoj's deal get finished.
I'll give your fair share.
"Only if we are united, we can cheat others."
"If we cheat amongst ourselves, we will not prosper."
Got it?
Don't share this with uncle.
I'll draft a plan for Manoj and let you know.
Let's go to the hospital and then leave.
"In the route from Kanyakumari to Nagercoil, these 3 trees are our mark."
You wait here.
I'll give a missed call while I come close...
You set a scarecrow looking like a human in the middle of the road.
"I'll hit the scarecrow, and act as though I'd hit a man."
Then you have to lie on the road like a dead man.
Definitely he will get scared.
He will try to run away from the spot.
"Then you clear the spot, and leave the place."
The plan is perfect.
"Hey, please..."
"Ashwini, what happened?"
!
What happened?
Tell me!
Ashwini!
What happened?
Where are you?
"Ashwini, where are you?"
Ashwini!
"Ashwini, what happened?"
"He's dead, Manoj."

Did it die already?
"Oh, no, she's just resting."
"Thank you so much for coming, we're really worried about her."
Lizzie is the last gift that my mother got me before...
I'm sorry.
"I just think if she died, it would be like losing my mom all over again."
We really appreciate you being here.
"Cool, do you guys have any food?"
I feel like something hot.
"Um, we have some soup left over."
Does it have any meat or sausage in it?
- No.

"Uh, Lizzie means a great deal to Amy and I, so..."
Bloody hell.
"The only thing left, is forced execution."
"I heard, from Shi Yoon..."
That what you say or what you do...
Not of it is genuine.
And that it's all part of a mission.
"All I want to do is tell you the truth, Mother."
"If you do this, you will be kicked out without compensation."
Don't listen to anything Shi Yoon says.
He said that he will be the shadow who protects this neighborhood.
"But in reality, nothing will change."
"You, as well as Shi Yoon... will lose this fight."
This is... a fight that you can't win.
Do you think so?
"Wow, this guy is really getting on my nerves."
"Why don't you stop, and turn yourselves in?"
Wow...
Here you are...
I learned from you too.
"You can't say you have nothing to do with Park Seon Woo, can you?"
"- Sir, we'll go first."
"- Sir, congratulations!"
"- Oh, sure."
Go ahead!
- Yes.
"Good work, and thank you."
"We will win, no matter what."
That's right.
Let's go.
[Neighborhood Hero]
"If we just catch Park Seon Woo, we can catch the rest of them easily."
Yong Moon Plan.
"You're operating this company, correct?"
Let's get this typed up.
What?
I'm going to miss this.
Are you going somewhere?
I've accepted a job offer back home.
You're going back into advertising?
Head of Morale Ops at the new camp in Virginia.
"They're looking for Camp X grads to teach there, so..."
The Americans will be lucky to have you.
And no more bad guys to shoot you.
I will miss this place.
So visit.
"Could you get those handcuffs off, please?"
_
"Klaus, I'm Duncan Sinclair."
I'm Oliver and Billy's father.
Do you remember me?
Have a seat.
How's Bowmanville suit you?
Little more comfortable than the Russian camp?
Why am I here?
- Did my father arrange this?
"- Now, Klaus,"
"I can't elaborate, for security reasons, but..."
Our families vacationed on Lake Constance when you were a child.
"We couldn't keep you kids out of the water that summer,"
- do you remember?
- No.
This isn't the same breakfast the other prisoners of war receive.
"Well, Klaus, Bowmanville's good, but it's not that good."
I don't want special treatment.
Are you sure...
Hmm.
This one must be very good-looking for you to go to all this trouble.
I hate lipstick.
I can't stand it.
That's not a good color for you.
Did you try the samples I brought home?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.
What do you want to do for dinner?
I don't care about dinner.
I'm upset.
Can't you see that I'm upset?
How should I know?
You're always so relieved when you cancel your dates.
This is not a date.
We're just agreeing to eat at the same table.
"Then why does it matter how you look, unless you think something might happen with this one?"
"Mother, would you stop calling him ""this one."""
It sounds like you're picking out a lobster.
And nothing's going to happen.
He just likes the way I teach.
- You need more color.
- More color than this?
- Yes.
Would you sit down and let me do it?
- All right.
- Don't make me look like a clown.
- You won't look like a clown.
"Here, you have to blend."
- Where's the hairpiece?
- Here.
Do you want me to make you something before I leave?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Ugh.
"Well, that goes beyond stupid."
Agent Gibbs.
"Is Leon coming, too?"
Assault with a deadly weapon.
You left that one out the last we talked.
"Uh, well, I was..."
I was just... just a dumb kid who-who didn't know any better.
"I mean, it wasn't that big of a deal."
You put someone in the hospital.
I'd-I'd say that was a big deal.
What's this got to do with anything?
One: you lied to me.
Two: you have the potential for violence.
"Yeah, when I was 14 years old."
"Look, I-I admit, I had some tough times as a kid, you know?"
And-And I made a mistake.
I lashed out.
"But I learned from it, and I moved on."
It never happened again.
What else don't I know?
"I told you everything, Agent Gibbs."
I didn't do this!
Why can't you just accept that?
"Because a young man is dead, and I can't accept anything yet."
"All right, that's enough."
"Michael, don't say another word."
"You should be focusing your energy on real evidence, real suspects."
Michael is a suspect.
The only person you need to be worried about is Petty Officer Brian Smith.
"UA after the crime, fight with the victim..."
"-Yeah, I'm romping in the fields now."
[KNOCKS]
ROBERTS:
Hey.
"This won't take long, Roberts."
"M.E.'s finding was suicide, right?"
He didn't have doubts?
I read the report on the Santini case.
I talked with Sipowicz and Kelly.
I also read her diary.
That's pretty sad reading.
"I never actually gave her any drugs, right?"
What I read in that diary made me sick.
"Lieutenant, let's remember she was a junkie, huh?"
-lt's not like you can take their word.
-You took control of a weak...
"... suffering,dependentperson."
You beat her.
-You made sexual use of her--
-But I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.
"Which is what I understood this inquiry to be all about, right?"
"I mean, you don't see anything criminal coming out of this, do you?"
-You put in for retirement.
-l need three years for full vesting.
Today!
I don't care what you lose in vesting or in benefits.
I won't have you in this precinct or pass you on.
You fight me...
... I'llturnthepackageover tolad with a recommendation to dismiss.
I'm gone.
Fancy iced me.
Told me he'd smear me if I fought him.
- I know.
-
- Good.
But you'r e secr etly in love with Casey.
[ Telephone ringing ]
What do you need?
"This will sound ridiculous, but I actually need a staple r emover."
Leave me alone.
Hey.
"Hi, there."
"Listen, you have every right to be mad, but bef or e you say anything, can I just speak?"
Sur e.
Her e's the thing --
"I did tell Natalie that I liked you when I met you in the elevator, and I did tell Natalie that I was gonna call you, but then, like a day later, I went out on a date with this woman named Elaine,"
"and then I went out on another date with her, and it's gotten a little serious, which is why I never called you."
"But I wanted to come up her e and tell you that personally, first of all 'cause I thought it was the menschy thing to do, and second of all because I r eally did like you when I met you in the elevator."
Now you should f eel f r ee to yell at me.
Who the hell ar e you?
It's me.
-
- Is this a joke?
-
- No.
-
- It isn't?
-
- No.
I'm not that good with jokes.
You don't have to be good with jokes.
This isn't a joke.
Jennif er didn't put you up to this?
-
"[crusher] hey, Tia."
We got you some cold hotcakes.
She ain't here.
Hope she didn't go looking for Tony without us.
"Yeah, she needs us."
[Tia] Tony?
Crusher?
Muscles?
Rocky?
- Dazzler?
- [ Alfredbleats]
Alfred.
"Alfred, what'sthematterwith me?"
Where am I?
"Alfred, find the earthquakes."
[bleating]
Listen to me.
[bleating] [hoof steps approaching]
[bleating]
[sickle] what kind of place is that?
[victor] that is an underground plutonium processing plant.
Translate that into financial terms.
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.
That's why I like scientists.
"They're always discovering new, expensive things."
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.
I suppose you're going to have Tony
Split an atom bomb or something.
In effect Yes
"Well, I didn't count on killing anybody."
Especially not us.
It will never go that far.
You're Fozzie Bear who's been ripped up and used to smuggle heroin.
A Nazi doctor.
I don't even know what the fuck you are.
This is not about serving yourselves.
This is about serving the president.
"So let's do that, shall we?"
- Tom.
- Tom.
"-  Shut up, Gary."
- Shut... mm-hmm.
"I do the team talks, okay?"
"You're absolutely right, ma'am."
And I agree with everything you just said.
"So get it together, people!"
"Yes, ma'am."
Find Pierce.
Call NASA.
They've got to have a satellite that can pinpoint a moron.
"Yes, ma'am."
"If you want to catch a fugitive, you got to think like a fugitive."
- Where's he going?
"- Uh, to the airport."
Why would he be going to the airport?
"To catch a plane, Dan."
"You know, you could just hit the fucking gas, Jonah."
"Dan, I'm not getting a ticket."
That's the kind of shit that comes back to bite you when you run for office.
"Yeah, that's what's gonna hold you back."
"Okay, new rule in the Cube."
"If your name begins with D, you need to shut the fuck up immediately."
I'm fine because my name begins with an R.
- Not if we shorten it to Dick.
- That's so disgusting.
"Yeah, people really get wound up when they watch this."
- I just laugh.
I think it's funny.
- That's not real vomit.
- It was real.
- It's real.
No.
But it's like...
What I keep saying is if you put crushed graham cracker cookies and ginger ale or ginger cookies or whatever and you hold it in your mouth and spit it out.
"It doesn't matter that it's not real, it's just disgusting."
It's just as vile.
"This woman coming through, do you remember when her line was:"
"""Hell no."" And she did it, ""Hell no."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- No, that's not real."
"- Yes, it is."
- She...
All the takes of her saying that line are on the DVD.
"Ari, your face..."
Right here.
Right here.
"Oh, ashamed but happy."
- Guilty pleasure.
- I think that was the last thing I shot.
That was the...
"Yeah, that was the last thing you shot."
- That was your last day.
- It's like a little private shame that you share with yourself.
"Fine, let's go to Brooklyn."
"Aaron fell down, one of those takes."
"- Oh, he did?"
I have detailed two of my units to General Gómez.
- We are too weak to...
- Are you afraid of a bandit?
I am a soldier.
Please don't forget that.
It would be insane to underestimate a man like Carrasco.
"Without reinforcement, I can't perform my duty."
"Señor Presidente, what about giving me part of the militia?"
- You can't have anyone.
- Why not?
- I need them to fix your mistakes.
- That's enough now.
That's enough.
This won't get us any further.
"That's enough, Silveira."
"- I'll think about it, General."
"- Thank you, General."
Señor Presidente.
"He's a coward, but he knows what he wants."
"And, most of all, he wants power."
"And you don't, dear friend?"
That will be them.
All right.
"There's no need for me to worry, is there?"
You have inspected everything?
- Read this.
- What is it?
What has Carrasco got to do with that village?
- We'll claim that it was him.
- And set the people against him.
I see.
"Silveira, I don't care how you do it, but I want you to get rid of this man, is that clear?"
"Instead, you'll go with Jimmy."
You come with me.
Have a good time.
Sit in the sun.
Take a couple days off.
We'll have a good time.
"When you come back, you'll go back to Karen."
"Please, there's no other way."
No divorce.
We're not animali.
No divorce.
She'll never divorce him.
"She'll kill him, but not divorce him."
You going to pay us?
Just give us the fucking money!
I can't.
I swear.
Let's go.
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
Lions?
"I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!"
Just throw him over the moat.
I'll get the money!
"They must really feed each other to the lions down there, 'cause the guy gave the money right up."
I'll get the money.
We got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track.
They mean business.
"Then, I couldn't believe what happened."
"When we got home, we were all over the newspaper."
At first I didn't even know why we got picked up.
Then I found out the guy we roughed up had a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
I couldn't believe it.
It's just like Polish Hill.
"That's right, Jo."
It's the same killer!
"He killed those girls in '91, and my father."
Now he's killing women I knew and leaving them for me to find.
- You're scaring me.
"- It's scaring me, too."
All the women in my life keep turning up dead.
There is absolutely no connection between Polish Hill and this.
There is absolutely no connection between Polish Hill and this.
"If you print that in your paper, I'm knocking you off this beat."
The tip checked out.
Hardy went to high school with Cabrizzi.
That's two out of three.
I bet we can tie him to Cheryl Putnam.
- You want me to bring him in?
"- No, we couldn't hold him on that."
We can put him under review.
I'll call internal affairs.
- He'll be put under surveillance.
- He is under surveillance.
- Close surveillance?
- It doesn't get any closer.
"Thank you very much, Officer Sacco."
I'd like to call Detective Emily Harper.
"Raise your right hand, please."
Do you swear to tell the truth?
- I do.
- State your name.
Detective Emily Harper.
Are you a member of the Police lnternal Affairs Division?
- Yes.
"Look, Evan, I thought a lot about it."
"Right, I just, with Trend..."
"Don't worry about Trend, he decided to deactivate."
That's convenient.
What about the other guys?
There's always gonna be guys that don't like you.
Not everyone likes me.
That's true.
Thanks.
I think you can't let the way people feel about you determine how you live your life.
You're my little brother.
I garantee you I got your back.
So trust me.
And take this back.
At least think about it.
What you doing now?
I'm heading to the house to celebrate Cappie's release from CRU jail.
I'm not gonna be able to make it.
More movies?
"Actually, no."
I'm going back to Omega Chi.
Are you kidding?
I belong there.
You can't run away 'cause things aren't perfect
So Evan wins?
I thought you said it wasn't a competition.
Are you forgetting?
It's the same Evan Chamber who fought me at Dopplers who humiliated my sister at the carnival.
I don't know what you want me to say.
Alright?
"There're 2 sides to every story, Evan can be a real decent guy."
Are you saying Casey deserved what he did to her?
-Are you serious?
It's the middle of the night.
"-I feel really bad, that's all."
"I haven't been in touch, you know, since that night."
"I think we both got a bit carried away, didn't we?"
"Well, I know."
"It was... like a cheap 1 950s farce with underwear, and husbands and hiding in cupboards, but at least we kept our heads in the end and didn't actually do anything, so...."
"Anyway, top and bottom of it is I just want you to know this..."
Bob and I decided to get back together again.
"Well, that's fantastic."
"Really great, Irene."
I'm thrilled to hear that.
"Well, hopefully great, we'll see."
I just hate to think that that made you feel... in any way....
-Rejected?
"-God, is that what you feel?"
-No.
"No, of course not."
No way.
"-'Cause, you know..."
"I'll always have a soft spot for you, Gil."
-It's just....
-What's happening here?
-Is everything okay?
-Bob?
Of course it's okay.
It's fine.
-Will you stop worrying and go back to bed?
-Wondered where the hell you'd gone.
For goodness sake.
"Look, I'll tell you later."
"Now, let's just leave him in peace."
"Looks like we're clear for now, but we can't stay here too long."
Sam.
"Michael, give him a minute."
"Okay, so, those fake I.D.s..."
Worthless.
Wonderful.
Got another I.D. guy?
None that I trust -- not now.
There's a passport office up in Boca.
We could try to break in --
"Mike, come on."
"That's a crappy idea, and you know it."
Riley's gonna be expecting us to do exactly that.
"Now, I think I know a guy -- he's a friend of Dixon's, but..."
"It's a long shot, so if anybody else has a better idea, let's hear it."
"Okay, then."
"Even if you evade the FBI, ATF, and DEA, a life of crime is tough to explain to the IRS."
That's why many career criminals have a day job.
"It gives them a cover I.D., access to equipment, and a real W-2."
It also makes them easier to find if they won't answer your calls.
"Hey, buddy."
"Aw, Sam!"
What are you doing here?
"Good to see you, too, buddy."
This is my work!
And I'm not your buddy.
"Oh, come on, Dixon."
After all we've been through?
Didn't I get you a cargo plane last time I saw you?
"Oh, yeah."
That was easy to sell.
"I just put it on Craigslist and said, ""ignore the bullet holes."""
Her dad will give them both a lift in I imagine.
"Now, I've actually got some herbal tea here, if you prefer."
-Lemon and ginger?
"-Actually, yes, I will."
Thanks.
And... that was all very lovely tonight.
"Thank you, very much."
It's no problem.
This morning's teacup.
You must be feeling better.
And a whole basket of laundry still waiting to go in.
-You'll be running out of sheets.
-Do you mind?
Thanks.
Yeah.
And I know that Julie's really appreciated you being around these last couple of weeks.
"-I think there's quite a lot of you in her, actually."
"-Oh, dear."
The poor girl.
"No, it's...."
"What I was trying to say earlier on that... now I feel, I suppose, released in a way."
From Phillipa.
It's....
"This is gonna sound so callous, calculated, it's not meant to be."
I know.
It's very hard sometimes.
"You know, when you just wake up one day... and suddenly find you have feelings for someone you never even knew were there."
"You don't plan it or legislate for it, it's just...."
"-Oh, God."
-Do you know what I mean?
I think I do.
"You do, don't you, Alice?"
"Well, I'm not beat, you understand?"
I'm just a little more respectful.
But I am thirsty.
"Thanks a lot, anyway."
Now wait a minute!
"You know, I saw a man do that one time down in Mexico."
He come on a great big water hole about an hour later.
"All that sweet water, he didn't have nothing to carry it away in."
Like to see a man with a nice even disposition.
Come on.
I've tracked you for six weeks through this country.
You know it just like the back of your own hand.
Where are we gonna find water?
"Maybe the, maybe the Times' place."
They never have run dry there.
Or so I'm told.
But you're gonna give out before we get there.
Tyree.
You don't figure I did this.
Possible.
Hasn't been dead half a day.
"Well, what about Silmser?"
You don't think I stabbed him in the back and did this to him.
Let's bury him.
I asked you a question!
Did you murder a man in Texas?
"I did kill a man, but that was long ago and far away and he had a gun in his hand."
"Now, will you take these chains off?"
"Yeah, there was a girl here, too."
She's gone.
They probably took her.
They?
Lovely!
"Wolfie'll check out this tart you've been boning, then."
- Good.
- Maybe Wolfie'll pull her.
- He won't do that because she loves me.
- She loves you?
I'm going to cry!
I mean...
- She loves to fuck me.
- Yeah...
Course she does.
"That evening at the Civic Hall,"
I hoped Neil would enlighten me about what I'd be up to next week.
"He'd never enlightened me about anything before, but you never know."
How was the newspaper?
Did you write anything?
"No, nothing boring like that."
"I'm on the internet most of the day, this afternoon I smashed old desks in a skip and then home at four."
Are we the oldest here?
Possibly.
It's even more shit than I knew it would be.
I honestly don't why you came.
- To see you get blown out by Charlotte.
- Please try not to fuck this up.
"Charlotte asked me so there's a chance, admittedly a very slim chance, that she wants to pull me."
Or maybe she needs a mechanic for her car!
- Good one!
- I'd service her all right.
I'd slide my dipstick in deep!
"Thanks for coming, really appreciate it!"
I'm gonna find Charlotte.
Up to you.
"On the contrary, he sings because he's glad."
He's glad to die.
- The number of legends about swans...
- Dr. Kay.
"They also say swans guide and keep company with the dead, to help them cross the threshold."
That's my favorite...
a very old Celtic legend.
"- Yes, I know it."
- You do?
"- Yes, my wife told me about it."
- Your wife told you about it?
Right.
You mean your ex-wife?
We all live in glass houses.
So I see.
Why don't you finally tell me what I can do for you?
I believe I'm the one who can do something for you.
But you'll see for yourself.
Certain experiences can be very unsettling.
"I'll see what, for God's sake?"
What experiences?
I'm merely pointing out the need to be prepared.
Is that a threat?
"No, it's not a threat."
It's a message.
But I'm not quite sure you're ready to hear it.
How come you know so much about me?
Did you have me checked out?
Did you... was it Ross told you all that stuff?
"""The need to be prepared."" What's that supposed to mean?"
I don't know this Ross person.
I've never met the guy.
It should fetch millions.
Money?
Is that all that it means to you?
Money bought me my title.
This estate.
And now it'll help me go down in history as the discoverer of the Treasure of Atlantis.
"Sorry, co-discoverer."
You think you can buy your way into the history books?
I wouldn't be the first.
Come in.
Anybody.
"Answer me, please?"
"Come in, this is an emergency."
Have a sherry to celebrate.
"I may be forced to work with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it."
"Please, professor, spare me the hypocrisy."
You and I are two of a kind.
"Now, Zavros, he only wants the money to fund his little revolution in Macedonia."
"But you and I share the same dream, to find the Treasure of Atlantis, no matter what it takes, or what the cost."
Go on.
Kelly.
Miss Carson.
"Hey, now, there's no need to be rough with her."
"If she's here, so is MacGyver."
General Zavros is right.
Where is MacGyver?
Answer him.
Tell us where MacGyver is.
I'm not going to tell you anything.
"Kelly, I-I do think you should answer them."
I don't betray my friends.
I'll make her talk.
"You'll lose Haley and Jack, screw this job."
You won't have a life.
I can't reach her.
"Morgan, I'm going to find the security office."
- Morgan!
- Right here.
- Looks like loading dock security.
- Should we evacuate?
"No, no."
We'd have mass panic.
Let's go.
Hello?
- FBI.
- FBI?
- Are these all your security cameras?
"- Yes, sir."
- What's this camera here?
- That's the roof.
East end.
"Morgan, I've got 4 guys on the east end of the roof."
- What's on that side of the roof?
Nothing.
No access doors to the mall?
Not unless you go through the air vents.
"Morgan,it's the air vents."
They're going for the air vents.
Don't move!
Put the devices down and put your hands where I can see them!
Gun!
"Police tonight foiled an apparent robbery attempt at the new usa mall, which presumably have marred an otherwise successful grand opening."
Haley?
"Hey,in here."
Are you OK?
Yes.
Do you recognize him?
I don't.
I think I do.
He's a Haengin soldier we met on your first trip as our leader.
Why do they want me dead?
Even if he had a grudge... there's no way a soldier would attack a troop.
It could become a political issue.
You came back alone?
A bodyguard attacked us.
What?
You pathetic fool!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
- Call in my men!
"- Yes, sir."
What did you find out?
"The Haengin commander we traded with... (Sayong, Yuntabal's tactician) was Baemang."
His superiors caught him... trying to embezzle the gold he was supposed to pay us with.
They kicked him out of the army.
He and his men then became bandits.
Bandits?
"(Kepil, Yuntabal's assistant) You mean she was attacked by bandits?"
Yes.
I should've killed him then and there.
This is serious.
They used to be soldiers so they should be very well trained.
This really is bad.
We don't stand a chance against them.
Now they know our size and location.
At last.
"Now, will you get the luggage off immediately and take it straight to our rooms?"
I do not understand why we weren't met properly.
"Well, I think it's simply wonderful."
It's so unspoiled.
"Eh, it's pretty enough, but it's such a long way to come, such an awful journey."
You'll enjoy bathing and lazing about.
We could have done that in Brixen.
Why you wanted to drag us all this way...
"You'll adore it here, I know."
I can see that you mean to enjoy yourself.
"Oh, well."
"Give me a bath and a bed, and perhaps it'll be better in the morning."
"– Tony, darling?"
– Yes?
My cigarette case.
She makes me feel so undercooked.
I'm so patchy still.
She really is so lucky.
"Oh, dear, that bathing dress is a mistake."
Morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Lovely day.
DOUGLAS:
"Shall I put yours here, darling?"
MARJORIE:
"Yes, so I can get a little bit of sun."
"I feel so dreadfully faded, but I freckle rather than going brown."
Have you ever been to Rhodes before?
No.
"It's lovely, isn't it?"
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Precognition:
The capacity to see the future.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
EZRA:
Josiah.
-Josiah.

Heartwarming family reunion and all.
You understand.
"Oh, of course."

"Honestly, Ezra, you've been as sour as a grape since I arrived."
Perhaps that's because I have a distinctly uneasy feeling...

Why ever for?
"Hey, it's not like we're in competition with each other."
"We're not, Ezra."
I provide beds and baths and food for weary travelers.
"True, and I offer music, gambling and liquor."
"Well, there you are."
"Now, you make sure to secure that real well."

"Yes, ma'am."

Stupid.

How could I be so stupid?

"But tell me, why do you pounce on our poor Chopin?"
"My dear, he's got one foot in the grave."
"No, no."
We shall all be in our graves soon enough.
But Chopin is eternal.
The only permanent thing about him is his cough.
(Duke) Ah.

"- Thank you, my friend."
"Madame Sand, will you delight us with your company on a hunt?"
"I must decline, Your excellency."

"You and your partner were having a beer, trying to unwind, and this jackass..."
"Uh, Joe Penn comes over and starts mouthing off."
"Maybe it was about the Cubs, maybe it was about Chicago's new mayor, I don't know."
"But this Joe Penn crossed a line somehow, and you felt you needed to step in and deal with it."
Or not.
"If I'm anywhere close, just grunt."
Read my report.
"Lee says he and Taggot had been there about an hour, had a couple of beers, were about to leave when this Joe Penn got into a fight with another patron."
He and Taggot stepped in to break it up.
How'd you do?
"Yeah, that's pretty much what Taggot said."
"Hey, Sis."
I'll just be a minute.
"Donny, Steve."
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be out busting bad guys?
The shift doesn't start till 11:00.
"Yeah, but this isn't your station."
Why are you acting weirder than usual?
- I'm not.
"- Yes, you are."
"- Yeah, you really are."
- Way beyond your normal weird.
"Well, I'm just surprised to see you guys here, that's all."
So why are you here?
To wish Sean Dunn good luck.
We talked about this last night.
It's his last day.
He's moving to Tampa.
Is any of this ringing a bell for you?
Right.
Are you saying that my brother is a faggot?
"I'm saying I don't know who sent that postcard, and I don't fucking care!"
None of us cares... about Felix.
We just came for the free booze.
"- Left or right, Paul?"
- Go fuck yourself!
Left or right?
- Left.
- Left it is.
Bastard!
No!
You bastard.
Paul was right.
"We weren't Felix's friends, not properly"
"But I did speak to him on the night of the party and he was gentle, Justin."
"He was vulnerable and lonely, but he had a kind soul."
He wouldn't want this.
You didn't know him at all.
He wouldn't want this cruelty.
I'm sure of it.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll accept part of what you say.
"Felix was flawed... crippled, even."
But we came from the same line.
We were forged in the same fire.
This weakness was not what he was made of.
All this is in his name.
"But if he was watching, he'd be sickened by it."
"We are a proud family, Gemma."
People like you can't understand that.
Shame drove him to do what he did.
And pride demands payment for that slight.
"That's the lens, you see."
That's an optical illusion.
"She stands rightside down on the lens- i mean, she stands upside right- the lens is downside up- who sent for you?"
"I just thought she was standing on her head, that's all."
Will you do me a favor?
Go over there and sit down.
Please?
And just mind your business.
Thank you.

Okay.
Okay.

Mrs. Daley was shot at a distance of 30 feet and she was shot in the back.
Are you with me so far?
"Yes, I think I can grasp that."
"Now,"
Tony...
He's the owner of the deli.
"He said that the killer was ""cool as a cucumber."""
"That's a direct quote, sir."
"So that means that when Mrs. Daley tried to run, that's when he lost his cool."
"See, that's when he panicked and he shot her."
"But he hit her right in the heart, sir, and at the distance of 30 feet while she was running."
"Now, that's hard to do in a panic."
What do you think?
"I think that I had better try and help you because you're going to ask me to, aren't you?"
"You did it again, sir."
You read my mind.

I can't say for sure until I cut.
"Given the petechial hemorrhages, she probably died of asphyxiation."
"No ligature marks-- so, maybe drowning."
What about time of death?
Gray at the roots.

Average growth is half an-inch a month.
So she was alive about two months after her last visit to the hairdresser.

The paper in Dave Stubbs' stomach.
It's an article he wrote for Ethics Today.
"Before he was buried alive, I think he was forced to swallow it."
Who would want to make him eat his own words?
The creep who doesn't need a crutch.
You shouldn't be using that in here.
It's police business.
Tom?
Where are you?
I'll tell you later.
I've gotta go.
sorry.
"Everyone has someone except for me, you know?"
"Okay, well, I thought you weren't ready for that."
"Well, I wasn't, but I..."
I don't know.
- Maybe I am.
"- Well, if we had to verbally abuse some game night guests for you to figure that out, then that is totally okay."
"And, just so you know, if you wanna get out there, all I have to do is put out an APB."
- Let me handle this one.
- I'll probably get involved.
Why don't you get involved with Mark's peen.
"No, 'cause guess what?"
"This is 40, okay?"
"Do you really think, when you take your clothes off, that he's gonna run the other way?"
"No, he's gonna jump on you like an old hound dog."
What if I just wear Spanx during sex?
What do you think?
"Mark, I wanna rock your body all night long in so many different ways."
"Not right now, we're watching ""Happy Feet."""
"- Dave, hit the road."
"- Dave, you gotta go."
- Really?
- You gotta go.
"Ugh, I wish I had somebody to rock my body."
"You will again, man."
You will again.
See you later.
"- Mark, I am so sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry, right?"
The warm banana?
What is that?
"- No, I loved that."
"- And then I snuck into your house, ""Dawson's Creek"" style."
I don't like green cars that much
This is an assault nobody moves!
"Get down, c'mon, lay on the floor"
Lay on the floor give me the car's keys
Don't make a move
Put your head down and don't move
"Let's see.... you, open it for us open it!"
Do it or I'll kill you
Let's go
Faster!
"Come on, open it!"
Open it fast or I'll kill you
What's up now?
"The key, I don't have the second key"
Who has it?
Who has it or I'll kill you
The interventor
- Who is he?
Who is he or I'll kill you
Ramirez
- Who is Ramirez?
", who is Ramirez?"
Who is Ramirez?
You are Ramirez?
", come on here You have to open the locked door"
Did you ring the alarm?
"- No If you ring the alarm I'll kill you, eh?"
"Get out of here, c'mon"
Faster
"Come on, faster"
What are you looking at?
"Come on, lay on the floor"
"Love comes, love goes"
NO BEGGING OR MUSIC PLAYING ALLOWED
It wafts in on the breeze and then it's gone
No one makes a big fuss over love these days
You get along or you slug it out
A day is like a year...
"Miss, take some change out of my pocket."
I can't reach my piggy bank.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
Put the rest back now.
A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
"See, I didn't steal any."
Then reach in again.
Your fiancé isn't as old as he looks either.
What's going on here?
Good thing that sign says you're blind or no one would know.
Mind your own business.
I'm just doing my job.
Better guide your music director back to his chair.
Meet me at 5:00 at the fountain in Friedrichshain Park.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can do anything about it
So here we are.
"Yes, here we are."
So you think we should be organ grinders?
Were you in the war?
And how!
- What's your name?
- Me?
"Biberkopf, Franz."
Welcome to Scabland.
"It was disgusting, but beautifully photographed."
- It was supposed to be disgusting.
- I'm sure it was.
"Mom, all this stuff."
Excuse me.
"All of this equipment, it can't be here."
We won't leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over.
We are not cretins.
She's handling it.
"Right, Mom, you are handling it?"
- This lighting sucks.
- Can we do something about the lighting?
"I don't think so, ma'am."
I don't know.
"It's a community college, we'll have to cope."
Think documentary.
"Mom, please."
People will be showing up here soon.
"Lorelai, I'm perfectly capable of handling this."
No one will be inconvenienced.
Okay.
I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all of this... because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee... and maybe hammer a nail into my head.
"You're not needed here, Lorelai."
Go get your coffee.
Relax.
"You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?"
Maybe an Irish coffee.
I haven't even heard of half these bands.
I love that about this place.
Lane would want to live here.
Who's Slint?
-Yes.
"And you're Brandon Bourne, aren't you?"
"The seventh, or ninth, or something?"
Only the third.
How do you know?
Your wife comes into the store quite often.
Everyone likes her.
"I like her, too."
"Since you know I'm married,"
I suppose you wouldn't consider sitting down with me for your ginger ale?
Sure.
I'm curious about guys like you.
Yeah?
"-John, this reserved?"
"-Always for you, Mr. Bourne."
"One ginger ale, one Scotch over rocks, please."
"Yes, sir."
"What are you curious about, with guys like me?"
"-Well, doesn't your wife dance?"
-Brilliantly.
Yeah.
"She's prettier than I am, she dresses better, and she's probably a lot smarter."
"Everything I can do, chances are she can do better."
"So, what do you want to be sitting here with me for?"
What is it with guys like you?
What goes on in your fuzzy little heads?
"What do you want, my philosophy of marriage?"
"-Well, I'm a reformed character myself."
-Oh.
"No, really."
"But before I reformed,"
I suppose my thinking went something like this.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
We took those photos less than an hour ago.
Why is the size of the haematoma in that scan... three times the size of the one in this man's skull?
It's like the whole mess is healing itself at warp speed.
"The home number was unlisted, but Rickman was in the ER last year... with a badly cut finger, and his wife had a Pap smear."
Dr. Willock.
"Dr. Willock, excellent."
And who's taking care of this fellow now?
"It's not Dr. Stegman, is it?"
No.
Steg isn't in.
I believe Hook.
Hook?
Excellent.
- Do you think so?
"- Yes, indeed."
You say this Peter Rickman is quite well-known?
Yes.
"In fact, here."
"I included this, in case you hadn't seen it."
I see.
"Thank you, Brenda."
"Quick work, and even quicker thinking."
Thank you for this.
"Here, take this, and one of these... and, of course, one of these, for your car window."
Aren't they wonderful?
Aren't they really excellent?
Very nice.
"Jesse, if this works out, the Rickmans are in a position... to give Kingdom Hospital a great deal of help."
"Filthy rich, are they?"
"- I don't know if I'd say that, exactly, but..."
"- No, but just between us?"
I tried to kill a police officer in India by planting a bomb in his car.
"It happened because of a girl and a boy,"
"I got scared of getting lynched there, so I came to Malaysia."
Just a joke!
"It's not a joke, bloody fools!"
It really happened.
"Come on brother-in-law, where's my sister?"
- My son-in-law.
- Son-in-law?
Oh God!
I got wedged!
What if they come to know I chased this girl?
My brother-in-law will break my back.
"They both were in love there, why are these two marrying here?"
"He's no ordinary man, he'll not give up so easily."
Where could he be now?
Can you guide me to this address?
This is the place.
"By the way, you are...?"
I too don't know when will I come.
I don't know what had happened to me.
I don't know why I'm here.
What's going on here?
I invited you.
He's my friend Kalyan from India.
He's my fiance.
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
"Even if you refuse, I'll shake hands with you."
"He's a memory loss patient, he's here for treatment."
He'll stay with us from now.
Okay dear.
"No need to feel sorry, I'm very happy."
Someone will hear us.
That's all I've got to say to you!
Stop it!
I'm sick of it.
"You're the one who keeps following me and makes perverted calls, aren't you?"
That's not me.
I never do things like that!
How can you do things like that?
"And you sent that porn magazine to my company, didn't you!"
?
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.
I wouldn't give this to anyone.
Why do you have it!
?
Nami.
No!
Stop it!
"If I knew your telephone number, I would call you all day."
"And if I'd known where you live, I would've written you a love letter everyday."
What do you want from me?
- The girl in that magazine isn't who I am!
- That's not the you I fell in love with.
Why don't you tear that magazine up then?
Red Porno
You're hopeless.
Why can't you behave normally?
Why do you have to torment me?
"If you get what you want, will you go away?"
This isn't what I want.
This isn't what I hoped would happen.
Will you go out with me tomorrow?
From the department store?
Do you have any idea what this looks like?
Come on.
You know we didn't shoot at them.
- You know that we're legit.
"- Yeah, I do."
"But if you keep shutting me out,"
How am I supposed to back you up?
We'll just--
This stays with me until things die down.
- Or implode.
- What?
"Sir, you're putting yourself in serious danger."
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
So tell me.
We can't.
"Well, I admire your loyalty."
I prized it myself once.
But you need to look at where you're placing it right now.
This has come to my attention.
It checks out.
And I will have to act on it.
"You want me to trust you, okay."
If there's even a remnant of a two-way street left--
If you still trust that I'm trying
To look out for you--then read it.
I want some extra people in the office.
Around the clock for the next 72.
Just in case.
Why?
'cause he stole something dangerous
And it's important that I get it back from him.
What makes you so sure it was him?
"And Lil Wayne be looking at him from the back, he be..."
"""Yeah."
"What you doing on the ground, lil nigga?"""
¶ What you on the ground for ¶
¶ Weezy F baby.
¶ Please say the baby.
¶ Ridin' with your bitch.
¶ Got keys on the lady.
¶ Bitches and strippers.
¶ And strippers and strippers and bitches ¶
¶ Bitches and strippers and money ¶
¶ That's all I talk about.
"""Yeah!"""
"I like Lil Wayne, but we all must concur in this building this evening."
"That man look like a big-ass cricket, don't he?"
It's like he call girls in the club like this.
¶ Come here baby.
¶ I wish I could chirp every girl in the world ¶
¶ Young money yeah
"I'm just saying, man."
"What Wayne has done is he's brought a lot of people together musically, and that's what we need, baby."
'Cause discrimination is the deterioration to our nation.
Huh?
"All I'm saying is you white, I'm Black."
That don't mean we can't sleep together.
It just means the baby gonna look like Barack.
That's all the hell it means.
"If you're Asian, we can make Tiger Woods."
"If you're Spanish, we can make Victor Cruz."
"If you're Indian,"
I guess our children gonna open up the first chains of Subways and KFCs put together.
"And if you're really white, like really white, like..."
I'm sorry.
"She stopped by, my mind was elsewhere."
I didn't pay attention.
What are you waiting for?
Help me look for it.
Here it is.
My husband has a safe in a bank.
The key is in the left drawer of the desk and the contract is in a Bible in the library.
"Well, this is good news."
Isabelle?
You cut your hair.
It suits you!
Your clerk told me I could find you here.
Can I sit down?
I heard about your mother.
"I didn't have a family before, now there's no one left."
It doesn't make a difference.
- And why didn't you tell me?
"- No, I..."
"No, I wasn't going to tell you about it."
And you wanted some time to think... about us.
"Yes, I thought about it."
"I want to carry on, François."
Whether it suits my son or not...
I am entitled to live my life.
But you... you're not afraid of falling out with him?
He'll get over it.
"For the moment, you're the one that matters."
Will you say the same thing in the future?
The mayor of Villedieu will be searched tomorrow.
There will be consequences.
I'll be dragged through the mud.
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
He will not return.
Varun knows everything.
"If he'd come here to catch me, even after seeing me, why didn't he come to me?"
Why should he follow me?
"That simple means, he has no concrete evidence so far."
He won't get any evidence hereafter as well.
But...
The important thing is that he should not reach Vikram at any point.
Vikram.
- Priya.
I guess you can sense that I'm not fine.
"Priya, don't worry."
I am not able to...
My mind is not at peace.
"Tomorrow, everything should go well."
The organ dealer should properly arrange everything.
The transplant for my brother should go well.
"With all these things running in my mind,"
I'm not able to stay normal.
I don't think I can stay alone here.
"If you are with me,"
I'll feel better.
I've been feeling the same way since I dropped you.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I'll come there right away.
I'll be with you till everything ends well.
Okay?
"Thanks, Vikram."
Sir.
- Hey!
Where had you gone?
"Are we ready, Baron of Luxor?"
Everything is set.
It's enough to take out the entire mausoleum itself.
We just need to retile it now.
The time has finally come...
"Tonight, we will be freed from her spell!"
Her rule has been disastorous for the empire
Her desire for peace has held us back
Only domination and subordination exists between us and Terrans.
Coexistence is but a fantasy.
We must take back the future of our race.
Even if that means-
Who's there?
!
Run!
Those moves...
Are you one of us?
!
Seth-chan!
I'll be fine!
Just hurry and tell the Duchess of Kiev!
R-right!
Impertinent girl!
Will Seth-chan be all right?
"So long, girl."
Hurry to the port.
Make the final arrangements before pests arrive.
As you wish.
I know this will not remain forever
"However, it's beautiful"
"Your eyes, hands, and your warm smile"
They're my treasure
Why don't... you and I have a duel?
I will challenge you with my life!
You betray me for the sake of these workers
Have they been treating you well?
I know I owe you righteousness
I can only repay in my next life
But you owe them justice!
You have to repay it today!
Bullshit!
Let them all understand crystal clear
Who is... the master here!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
People!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
"If I die,"
none of you should take any action on my behalf
Think about your families
They are waiting for you at home
Fei
Can you win?
"If both sides get into a fight, there will be a lot of casualties"
It's better I die
Than to have the whole place drowned in blood
Promise me
"If I fall, you have to make them go home"
Let him in
Close the door!
You want to burn me to death?
"She was like-- She was like,"
"""What's next, motherfucker?"
"What's--"""
I'm--
"But, look, it's a few entertainers who got that power, okay?"
"It's like--there's another dude that can do that,"
Chris Brown.
"Yep, y'all gotta give it up for Chris Brown."
"Come on, dog, why y'all ain't clapping, man?"
"Come on, why y'all ain't clapping?"
It's not like he hit y'all.
What the hell?
He's an all-around entertainer.
"He can sing, he can dance, pop-lock, box just a little bit."
"Um, okay, I know he was in a situation with Rihanna."
Okay.
And that's in the past.
"And, folks, you know people's love."
You can't help who you love.
You just can't.
You can't help who you love.
"Some women love their man so much, even whatever situation they are in, they make up excuses for them."
"""Girl, this is a circle of trust."""
"""No, bitch, that's a black eye."
"""Go get that checked out."
"That's terrible."""
"And fellas, I ain't condoning--"
You should not put your hands on a woman.
"You should not do that, okay?"
"If you do that, you should be ashamed of yourself, 'cause that's sick."
Violence isn't funny...
all the time.
"Wouldn't be fair to you, or to us either."
Slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions.
"Besides, it's more of a risk than I want to see you take."
"Believe me, that's my only reason for making this decision."
"If you don't like my way of doing it, do it yourself."
- You can have my share.
"- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?"
"Well, thank you very much."
You'll not leave this town without me.
We'll leave without you.
You'll wait here and like it.
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.
"If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along, smack her down."
Wonder what's happened now.
"Oh, well."
"You know, I know a couple of people used to fool around like that... and they got children now."
"You, uh"
- You still want to go along?
"Not only do I still want to go, I am going."
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
Come on.!
Mush!
Mush!
Come on.!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on!
Mush!
I thought we agreed --
"Listen, sister, if I'm gonna be living in a hut in the Dominican Republic,"
I at least need a decent bottle of scotch.
I believe that's the sound of my scotch arriving.
"Hey, beautiful."
Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry it took so long.
There was construction.
It slowed everything down.
Construction?
Where?
At the entrance to the marina.
What?
Is -- is there a problem?
There's a reason fugitives are so paranoid.
"When you're on the run, even the smallest change in your environment can put you on high alert."
"But, then again, sometimes being paranoid pays off."
Damn it!
That's an earpiece!
"See, this is bad."
Those are agency guys.
We're blown.
"Yep, that's a gun."
My I.D. guy -- he was acting all jumpy.
Kept asking if he could deliver the passports himself.
I should have known.
They'll start searching as soon as they block the marina.
We got to go now.
"Well, we aren't getting out of here by sea."
Coast Guard is incoming.
"Fi, get Mike and Jesse."
I'm on it.
We have a problem.
The Ibani hotel?
They just cancelled our party.
And Jimmy Valenti changed his mind.
Nothing's been signed.
There's really no recourse.
A hundred guests have confirmed and we have no place to put them.
"I understand you're a bachelor, Neil, but for God's sake don't let the place go to seed."
So I've been scrambling to find a backup location.
You must have connections.
Somewhere discreet.
I'll see what I can do.
There's another matter we need to discuss.
This is my biggest party of the year.
We're all going to have to multitask.
"Darling, it's just business."
Is that what you call it?
'Cause to me it looks like blackmail.
"Look, Mommy and Daddy are playing house again."
The dining room table?
Bravo.
Is this gonna take long?
We were kind of in the middle of something.
"I just want a few minutes with your husband, Grace."
Like so many women do.
Coffee?
Mmm.
Love some.
She's never gonna stop.
Ever.
Today it's the SEC shutting down Bastion.
Tomorrow it'll be something else.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
Everything... gone.
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
"It's me, Cyrus."
"John, is that you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's me."
Now I want to return the favor.
What do you think that is?
"No idea, but, you know, we should probably bag it and search for Amanda's prints."
"Abbs, I think we may have found something."
"Me, too."
I found Amanda Kane.
I downloaded the onboard surveillance footage from the last cruise.
I found her wandering through the casino.
The guard's coming back.
"Abby, send me what you've got now."
"Hold on, wait."
It looks like the fiance on land did have a rival at sea.
Amanda met a man on the ship.
The guard's at the door.
"Abby, get out of there now."
Do we have an I.D. on our shipboard Romeo?
"Not yet, but I ran the fingerprints on the lucite tube."
They're Amanda's.
"Guys, check out the body language."
She's not in love.
She's afraid.
Got him.
Our mystery man is Roman stone.
He works here on the ship.
Casino croupier.
Maybe Amanda was tracking an illegal gambling operation.
- Roulette.
It figures.
It's a punk game.
- Sounds like you speak from experience.
Strictly a Texas hold'em gal.
That puts you in the leadoff spot.
I won't bother you anymore.
Bye!
You don't have to leave right off!
You just think over.
Help yourself.
- Thanks.
"Please, be careful with this."
It's fragile.
Would you mind?
- Thanks.
It's nothing special.
"I will show you, don't worry."
I told you I was a land surveyor.
This here is a theodolite.
I look through this every once in a while.
I only need to keep it unnoticed.
Why?
- I don't want them to think I'm some kind of a spy.
Have I shown you the bathroom?
- No.
"It's dilapidated, as you see."
There's no need to repair it now.
You won't have to walk through my room.
"Be sure that you lock yourself when you use the bathroom, they may break in."
I haven't told you...
Do you know that this house is going to be torn down in a month?
Of course I do.
"Why did you insist to live here, then?"
Sentimentality and other things.
I told you.
"When this happens, I'll manage myself somewhere else."
You won't have any troubles with me.
And don't change the subject.
"Then there was the Pender Drug account, and Sheridan Cement."
All first class.
And all the others.
I haven't thought about hours or days off.
I've proved my loyalty and it's about time you gave me an unqualified vote of confidence.
"Now, Larry, either I get that Waterhouse account or you get yourself a new boy."
- You got it.
"I mean it, Larry."
I've got the Waterhouse account?
That's what I wanted to tell you when you came in.
Yesterday you said I couldn't have the account because I was too immature.
"What did I do, age overnight?"
"I just thought it over, and this morning I changed my mind."
"And Darrin, I know you'll do a great job."
- Good luck.
"- Thanks, Larry."
You won't be sorry.
I still don't get it.
What made you change your mind?
"- Oh, it's the boss' prerogative."
- I'll buy that.
"Boy, I can't wait to tell Sam."
I was tempted to tell her myself but I knew that you wanted that pleasure.
"Oh, yeah."
When...
When did you see Samantha?
"Oh, just now."
Down in the parking lot.
There's a great little wife you've got there.
Has your every interest at heart.
She sure has.
It's not the first time either.
"He was arrested 5 years ago-- intimidation, embezzlement."
"He's got his hooks into your sergeant, too, for that matter."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Well, they certainly met in London."
Rather more than that.
They had dinner together after the meeting.
Spencer's taken him very much under his wing.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Excuse me.
[Ring]
Foyle:
Mr. Lane.
Ian:
You've got my boy locked up.
"Well, he ran away."
He was off to London.
He was afraid of you!
He's no criminal.
"Well, assault, drunk and disorderly, skipped bail, did borstal--August to November last year."
That was then.
It hasn't been easy for him living on his own with me.
He lost his mother when he was 9.
She ran off.
It's just been two of us.
"And yes, he mixed with the wrong set and became a cropper with the law."
You people never forget.
Won't let him forget neither.
"It's a bit more than that, isn't it?"
"He was seen at the hotel on the night of the murder, which means he could easily have been the one who took the gun and shot Mrs. Ellis."
He never shot anyone.
Why did he stab him under there?
"Well, according to Shrimpton, Lorton stabs the kid here."
Shrimpton then heroically runs for help.
Lorton then drags the now dead body over to here.
Makes no sense.
It's closer to the street.
Why would you put it in a place that's lit up like the SCG?
"Now, your father was in the diplomatic service, is that right?"
David's told us all about you.
Very proud of his wife's exotic background.
We're not married.
Where exactly was he stationed?
All over.
"Italy, Spain, we ended up in Peru."
"Bloody hell, no way."
Peru?
That's where my brother-in-law was stationed.
Bob!
"Oh, this was many years ago."
"Yeah, ten years ago he was there."
"Bob, you great deaf bastard."
Come here!
"Oh, my phone."
"Oh, excuse me."
"If I was Joe Average instead of Joe Sandilands,"
I wouldn't be voting for us.
"I'd be buying a gun before Davo here bans them,"
I'd be putting a fucking bullet in my head.
"I think you've had enough there, Joe."
"No, Wal, Wal, I've only just begun, brother."
This man here is exactly what this party needs and we need 20 of 'em and we need 'em bloody quickly.
(Mobile phone rings)
But...
What?
Seems like he doesn't like you
Who is your Master?
Shi Zhengzong.
Have you heard about him?
He was nicknamed Thunderstorm
He has good technique and holds high acclaim
Thunderstorm?
Think I lied to you?
If he has good technique n' all that... how did I break his bones three years ago?
You've beaten him up?
I despise these hypocrites who call themselves
The decent school of martial arts
All they know is vanity!
"Don't worry, I won't beat you up"
Because we are good brothers!
Of course!
"Brother Jin, are you okay?"
T omorrow get me some medicine Tianqi and Baiyao
1 0 grams of Tianqi and 50 grams of Baiyao
Please get it from somewhere else!
Why?
I've got money?
Get it quick!
"Tianqi, Baiyao"
Do you need them for cuts?
"Hey, don't you want to do business?"
What are you doing?
"T ell me quick, do you need them for cuts?"
It's not your concern
I'll cut your head off if you don't tell me!
Do you want to?
You see him?
You...
"Anyway, Mitchell, I have in my hand a piece of paper."
Phase two of Find Mitchell AJob Campaign.
"Oh, Annie, Annie, it doesn't matter."
I'm considering other options anyway.
"Mitchell, you're not a quitter."
It says so here in the reference that I wrote.
Check this out.
"""John Mitchell is the finest employee I ever had."
"""He is loyal and dependable and valued by all his co-workers."
"""I recall he did not give the best interview..."""
- Whoa!
"- ""...but I put that down to nerves."""
"What, so I make a habit of screwing up interviews?"
"""But how glad am I that I took a chance on him?"
Very.
"""Because I was rewarded with a pleasant and reliable worker,"
"""who would be an asset to any company."
"""Plus, let's face it, he's easy on the eye."""
I'm just covering all my bases.
Yeah.
You know what?
Maybe I just don't want to be a hospital cleaner any more.
"No, of course you don't."
"This is just the beginning, Mitchell."
"With me in your corner, next year you could be in the canteen."
I'm going to type this up.
What's up?
- Where's Adam?
- He's in the kitchen.
"Well, look around you."
"We're not exactly starving, you know."
"Well, honey, I know we have most of the things we need but just having the things you need isn't everything."
I mean...
I'd like to buy you some things you haven't got.
I've got you.
That's the only thing I really want.
What about that fur coat?
"Oh, Darrin, I haven't heard you talk this way before."
Remember the new account I told you about?
Waterhouse and Company?
The one the agency's been trying to get for years?
Yes.
"Oh, don't tell me you lost it."
"No, we got it all right."
"The trouble is, I will not be handling it."
"Well, did you talk to Larry?"
Larry's the one who told me about it.
"Well, I know how you feel."
But maybe...
"Well, maybe you're just in too much of a hurry to get to the top."
"Remember, you're still young."
"I'm young all right, but I won't always be young."
"If that's Larry, tell him I'm on my way."
Hello.
"Oh, hi, Louise."
"Yeah, sure I'd like to hear some good news."
Larry told you wh...
Darrin's got the Waterhouse account?
"Oh, I can't wait to tell him."
"Oh, well, all right."
"If Larry wants to tell him himself, I understand."
"- No, no."
You're just a reflection.
The real Myka's in Las Vegas on a mission with Pete.
What?
"No, no, I'm not!"
Artie!
See?
That's exactly what I mean.
You just don't do it.
Turn that thing off.
"Artie, if I'm in Vegas with Pete, then how can I be here?"
Just no!
Just don't turn it off!
"Whatever that thing is, it's never getting out of here."
Lewis Carroll's Alice.
"You're so sweet, so innocent, so not true."
This woman was as mad as a hatter.
"And Charles Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, was not writing books."
He was chronicling this young woman's descent into a sociopathic madness in all of his books.
He didn't write these books.
These are Warehouse fabrications...
Brilliant fabrications...
To hide the truth about that mirror.
Here's a report from Warehouse field agents.
The mirror crossed paths with Alice Liddell.
I bet it crossed paths.
When?
- Before the murders.
- Terrifying.
"Yeah, and there's no mention of where the mirror came from."
"Okay, well, where do any of these things come from?"
"Artie, these agents, they trapped her inside of the mirror."
Cavemen are less primitive than you.
I'm not a flight attendant.
"You're not like that, you just got swept away."
I hope you're not back together.
"Shut up, both of you."
I haven't slept a wink in four days.
I'm going to shower and then I have to talk to you.
- About what?
- You can't shower.
- Why not?
- You're in mourning.
It's forbidden!
You can stink as much as you want.
I'm going to shower.
"Give her a break, okay?"
"Why don't you shower, too?"
I promise I won't tell Raziya.
And Dad knew all these years?
"I told you, they only just got tested, he just found out-."
How can that be?
What did...
Mom...
How?
What did she do when...
"I don't know, and it won't help to ask."
I never cease to be amazed at how little I know that loser who calls himself Dad.
And you believe his crap?
"He makes up bullshit to get us off his back forever, blood tests, my ass."
He should get an Oscar for his performances.
"A Pulitzer Prize for a sick mind, the scumbag."
We have to get the house ready tor tomorrow's guests.
I need pictures of Mom.
But that's like the German thinking.
"A German would be like,"
"""That's right."
You cannot drive it when the bedroom is out.
"""There must be a button or else you can't drive."""
"But Americans are like,"
"""Yeah, man, whatever."" It's America."
"""Do what you want - it's America!"""
Did you not look in your wing mirror and notice...
There's a house!
"Oh, it's me."
..that your vehicle was so much bigger?
"It was my first day of filming, 10, 12 hours."
I was exhausted.
All I could think about was I've got to...
"Look ahead, look ahead."
"I was like, ""I gotta drive my house home."""
Did you hit anything?
"Did you wipe anyone out, like a motorcyclist?"
"No, but you know what?"
"""What happened to you?"" ""I got hit by a house on the freeway."""
Here's the craziest thing in America.
You do...
That's a big sentence.
"Yeah, that is a big sentence."
"OK, here's one of the many crazy things in America."
"Because they want to sell these things to senior citizens and senior citizens tend to be not the best drivers, you don't have to have a special licence to buy an RV."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, no special licence."
Two pooping-based questions.
Yes?
"One, when you send down a, you know, a Bismarck..."
I don't like what he shows me.
"I know, but you have to try now."
We need to find him.
You don't understand.
"I have tried myself, but I can get nothing."
Please.
Alright.
Good.
Now concentrate.
Try again.
I saw a river.
Zaddik?
Is there a river nearby?
"Yes, just to the East."
"Alright, let's go."
"McKay, stay here and help Beckett!"
"- Medical research, not really my thing."
- And hunting Wraith?
"I mean, I could stay help Beckett."
Never could get into biology.
This is too much information about the human body.
"One time, when I was an undergrad, I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions, before I had to drop the class."
Really?
Yeah.
"Believe it or not, back then I was a bit of a hypochondriac."
"You know, this does require a certain amount of concentration."
What?
Am I bothering you?
Maybe I'll go get some air.
This must be the river she saw in her vision.
Assuming she's telling the truth.
"Just cos there's another Wraith, doesn't necessarily mean you can trust her."
"- Well, thank you for your time."
- You're leaving and she's coming?
I don't think she came to talk to me.
- I didn't expect her to come today.
- Me neither.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
He had to hurry to the bank.
- Hi.
Good to see you.
"- Hi, Anna."
I didn't think you were coming today.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why haven't you told me yourself?
Why do you keep lying to me?
"Sorry, Anna..."
I didn't want to make you sad.
Did you think I wouldn't be sad if you just died one day?
- No...
- What?
I didn't want you to see me as a dead man before I was.
I wanted us to be together as much as possible before anyone knew.
"If I knew you were dying, I wouldn't spend my time doing other stuff."
And I want you to tell me these things.
I want you to tell me.
"Anna, you mustn't cry now."
"It will hurt   but it will pass, just like everything else."
And now Jacob will be with you.
I don't care about Jacob.
You're my father and you didn't tell me you're dying.
I don't want anyone but you.
"If you don't tell me you're dying, I can't say the things I want to say."
Any of the guys on the team talked about the e-mail or the murder?
"No, not in front of me, anyway."
We got state championship coming up tomorrow.
That what they're focusing on.
"Life goes on, right?"
Not for everybody.
Is Todd Fleming around?
We want to ask him a few questions.
Fleming!
Front and center.
Come on!
Keep it going!
"Look, I don't know anything about what happened, okay?"
None of us do.
If that's why you guys came down here...
We found alligator blood on Coach Nelson's roof.
We think it was a part of your science project.
"What were you doing up there, Todd?"
I wasn't up there.
I...
"Look, even if I was, up there, what does it matter?"
"'Cause it's a murder investigation, smart guy."
Everything matters.
I didn't kill him.
We'll talk about this downtown.
- I'm in the middle of practice.
- Practice can wait.
Am I under arrest or something?
"Look, Todd, do you have any street clothes you can change into?"
We just want to talk to you.
"- Yeah, in, in the locker room."
- Let's go.
"Oh,yeah,I am,but Petty's not."
Stay there.He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me,do not move."
Petty.
- You know me?
- A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well,transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
"Drop the knife.Get on the ground,face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
Aren't you just a peach?
There you go.
Where is he?
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know,it's what,2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible,and I'Il tell you anything you want to know."
"Look, I'm like you, Mom."
Worried sick how Ruby's gonna feel when her teacher dies and her grandmother goes to prison all in the same week.
Tell Ruby I'll call her later.
"Mom, stay away from the District Attorney's family."
Okay?
"This time, the horse comes back, he's got a blond that's like 10 times hotter than the brunette, right?"
"And the bandit's like,"
"""Okay, cowboy, you got one more wish, then you die."""
"And the cowboy's like,"
"""I think I better talk to my horse again."""
"He goes, grabs him by the ears, and he goes,"
"""You dumb lousy animal!"
"I said posse!"""
"Well, I guess what happened is what every reporter dreams of... being in the right place at the right time."
"Or the wrong and the wrong, in this case."
And will the police be questioning you as a witness to the murder?
Revenge killing.
"And, yes, I think so."
Which would be a good reason for us to stop right here.
- We good?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
- Thank you.
"- Appreciate it, Laura."
"- Thanks, guys."
Thanks.
Hey.
"Hey, angel."
That looks great.
What's going on with you?
And don't tell me everything's fine.
There is nothing.
"Look, we know that having a deep pocket means that sometimes you get subjected to extortion."
It happens.
But for them to saddle up a child-- the child of a suicide victim--
Where does it stop?
"Well, at the end of this case,"
I hope it stops there.
You can go... prop.
"Ryan never talked about what he was working on, but I knew it made him very unhappy."
He was very stressed.
"Now, did he ever talk about killing himself?"
No.
Never.
"After he died, that's what Borns Tech told me happened, and I believed them."
Why did you believe them?
"Shock, anger."
I wasn't thinking clearly.
"It was easier to blame Ryan somehow,"
- and I regret that.
- Right.
You weren't thinking clearly.
Hmm.
But clearly well enough to take an enormous settlement from Borns Tech.
I had my son to consider.
You told us that Ryan was unhappy and stressed.
At work.
Not at home.
"I mean, everything okay with you two at home."
Yes.
Pretty much.
Was he unhappy or stressed about anything between the two of you?
No.
It's your last chance to come clean.
"So... I mean, I heard you were having a conversation... so I just basically tuned it out."
"I'm able to do that, like not hear things, so..."
Comparing instruments?
She is such an idiot.
You wouldn't believe some of the things that girl has said to me.
That was so stupid of me.
Crying.
"No, that's okay. I mean..."
"Well, see you later."
See you on the bus.
- You're taking my bus?
"- Yes, because I'm staying at Angela's."
What?
I heard about your dad.
Tough break.
"So, a girl in distress hurls herself on a guy with no life."
"It's probably just a figure of speech,""See you on the bus""."
She probably didn't mean she would actually see me.
"She just means... yes, we'll be on the same bus."
But not like together.
Right?
So you are staying at Angela's house?
- Yes.
What do you care?
- l don't.
So is her dad cooking you all kinds of good food or something?
What about Kyle?
"I mean, they've been umbilically attached for a month."
Kyle was probably her popular- jock phase.
Now she's moving into her awkward but sensitive guy phase.
- Are you saying I'm someone's phase?
- l wish I was.
I'm Amy Juergens.
I thought you got married to Ricky Underwood.
"Yeah, I did."
Then how come your name isn't Amy Underwood?
"Well, actually, the name Underwood, either."
It's totally lame.
"Yeah, it's gross."
Amy Underpants.
Who needs that?
Not you.
Not after being a teen mom and everything.
Not that Yurgens is any better.
"Uh, it's ""Juergens."""
"Yeah, but it's really Yurgens."
Amy Yurgens?
"(IN GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, Yurgens didn't wear underpants and that is how she got pregnant."
(CHUCKLING)
"Hey, maybe I could be friends with you two."
Yeah.
"You know, I've been dying to ask you how you got pregnant."
"You know what sex is, right?"
"Hey, so it looks like your little mentoree made some friends."
Now we don't have to hang out with her.
"Well, that's not very nice."
I thought you said you were sick of hanging out with her.
No.
"Not sick, really."
Just...
"I really think that she should make some friends of her own, some girlfriends, instead of just hanging out with Ethan, her new boyfriend."
"I don't think she should even have a boyfriend, especially Ethan."
You sound like an old married lady.
"And I remind you, you pretty much hung out with Ben the entire time you were pregnant and forgot about Madison and me."
Give me a break.
You told me to get in deep.
I'm in all the way.
"They didn't teach us this one in the academy, thinks I'm Batman or something."
"Yeah, well we found Robin floating in the bay with a third eye."
What do you mean?
The guy who was the manager at the ware house you were working was undercover too.
"Okasake, okasake?"
"Yeah, they thought he was campanela's man."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
Well neither did I. Am I the next on the line?
I don't know that.
I thought we were supposed to look out for each other.
Okasake used to be yakuza.
He pissed off his elders in Honolulu.
"They down his lower teeth, so we made him a deal."
Loyalty.
You know they understand that word.
So do we.
The important thing is you didn't blow your cover.
"Yeah, no thanks to you."
We never had anyone this deep before.
We never had anyone this deep before.
"So you gotta do whatever it takes to stay in, David."
You hear me?
Whatever it takes.
"Ok, OK."
You take care of yourself.
Who sent you?
Who the fuck sent you?
Geahh!
We'll see you later.
"Come on, Mark."
Go!
"Dad, my pocket money!"
"Money, money, money..."
It's all you think about.
I thought you might like this.
Thanks Dad.
"Thanks I'm good, but thanks."
"Come on, sit down."
Stop it!
Come on!
- Morning!
- What do we got?
Dead woman's bag was found in a hotel room.
"No wallet and no phone, so no ID."
Didn't she check in?
Was checked in under the name of Ben Jackinoff.
So I think it's fair to say that's a pseudonym.
No details yet but I've got something to show you.
- Potential murder weapon?
"- Alright, I'll check that in a bit."
- We got a description of a man?
- Fairly general.
Well how was it paid for?
Didn't the hotel take a credit card swipe?
Cash and there is only CCTV on the outside of the building.
But the manager did offer us something useful.
He recalls the woman going outside to take a mobile phone call.
And it's time coded so we can trace it.
"Yeah but without knowing what network she was on, how long is that gonna take?"
Right now it's all I've got.
"Oh, you ungrateful child!"
You don't care about anyone but yourself!
How did you get that way?
You know what losing your father has done to me and yet you take your life and throw it around like it was worthless!
Why?
'Cause I wish I was dead.
Don't you understand that!
?
"I wish I'd died over there, Mom!"
"Well, you didn't die and I'll be damned if I'll stand around and watch you kill yourself."
Enough.
"Enough, Mom."
God.
You guys are so freaking serious.
"Hey, sorry."
- Hey.
So late.
Any word from Justin?
"- Yeah, he got arrested."
Don't ask.
He's fine.
You almost missed grilled cheese night.
"I'm sorry, I've let us all down."
They're out of grass skirts.
They just sold the last one.
These'll be great.
"Today is one of those days where everything you decide really, really, really matters."
You....need something aside from grilled cheese.
"You need someone to say, ""Congratulations!"""
What for?
Your promotion.
How did you know?
Please don't turn me into one of those things that make it harder.
Mr.Cole?
South from downstairs.
"I'm not the ""War""."
"I'm not the ""Committee""."
I would it better.
Mrs.Cole?
Hello Alf.
Heavy rescue.
They want to know how many number in cellar 12.
Alright.
"When the twins got to Dunkirk, they did whatever every other small boats did."
Ferry troops off the beach and onto the big ships waiting in the deeper water.
"They were shelling' and drafin', but they honestly didn't talk about that."
What really seems to have stuck with them are the details.
The little authentic details...
There's a soul Joe with the dog in his kit-bag.
"Umm, the Frenchman that tried to kiss Lilly."
"I wish I could make you understand, how awfully brave they were..."
"Their father's a bully, I think."
A bit of a drunk.
"They're terrified of him, but, they took his boat anyway."
"""The Nancy""."
The Nancy?
"""The Nancy Starling""...after their mother."
The nail on the head!
Hm?
Wonderful.
"Authenticity, optimism and a dog!"
"I imagine, call ups left quite a hole in the ranks."
"So, in the interests of a quick turn around, we'll let you have some of our people."
"Mrs.Cole, Ms.Moore, hmm-umm,"
Miyu
Why are you doing this?
"You broke up with that guy, you should come home"
Why didn't you tell me?
I was planning on going home but thought I'd stay a little longer
Why?
Did you think that coming back home wasn't cool?
You were showing off like this amateur virgin?
Nope.
It's just more fun being here
You're having fun doing this job?
"Yep, it's very fun"
Why?
You won't understand
Why not?
Cause you're a virgin
Thanks for everything.
Now it's my turn to work for you.
There's something I want to do with you the day after tomorrow.
What?
Hold hands and walk together.
"Hello, package delivery for you."
"Sure, okay..."
Just a moment.
Coming.
"That'll be 1,280 yen, cash on delivery."
Thank you very much.
It's the book we ordered online.
Don't you think we're fine after all this time?
"No, just hang in for two more days."
"Well, 38 hours to be precise."
"Please, just be patient."
"What's on your mind, gorgeous?"
"- Oh, just wanted to say hello."
- Really?
That's sweet.
"'Cause the last time we chatted, I believe you threatened to kill me."
"Gee, has something changed since then?"
"You really did out smart us, didn't you?"
Screwed us royally.
"- I'm impressed, Dick."
- I'm like a lion that way.
"I hide in the weeds, bide my time, then i jump out and tear the ass off some dumb buffalo."
Ooh.
"So, Mr. Lion, how are you gonna cash in that ticket?"
I'll think of something.
Don't lose any sleep over it.
"Believe me, honey, i sleep like a baby, 'cause the second you try to cash in that little fucker,"
I'm going to the lottery commission and tell them everything.
"If you did that, I'd rat you out quicker than a frog can take a piss."
Mmm.
- What do you want?
- Halfsies.
Half.
Have you been exercising?
'Cause you look great.
Deal.
Nothing like rekindling an old friendship.
"Hey, that's him."
Wagstaff.
- Wagstaff?
"- Yes, Wagstaff."
Are you sure?
"Light hair, 6'2' lives here."
"What do we do now, sir?"
First we get some sack time.
Then we start all over again.
- Muldoon.
- Sir?
Check the perimeter.
Make sure the outposts are set for the night.
I guess it couldn't have been much worse.
We're still alive.
What happens now?
We keep doing our jobs.
"You got one to go back to, haven't you?"
I guess so.
What are you going to say in your newspaper?
"If I say what I feel, I may be out of a job."
We'll always give you one.
I could do you more good with a typewriter.
It's Sergeant Sooby's.
He didn't make it.
Funny thing.
Fellow takes one of these into battle and by the grace of God he comes out in one piece he carries a strange sense of guilt all the rest of his life.
JAMISON:
Colonel?
"I'd like permission to take my men into ""A"" camp to check our equipment."
"And also, that sergeant who was pretty badly hit was asking for you."
Provo?
Thank you.
Captain Johanson is taking the Mike Force back this afternoon.
You can go in with him.
- Happy to have had you aboard.
- Thanks for the ride.
Why wasn't he on the chopper?
Okay.
Sure.
Thanks.
See that?
"What do you got to say now, huh?"
I'm just glad everyone's away during all of this.
- What if she wins?
- She won't.
What if...
You saw that report.
It's claiming you're an absentee parent.
"I know, I know."
It's gonna make it worse if you and I...
If we don't figure things out.
"Yeah, uh..."
"I think, just for now, we have to put our personal issues aside and just create a united front."
"You know, for Georgie's sake."
Just for Georgie's sake?
"No... for us, too."
Kind of a weird day.
"I guess it's becoming a habit for you, this getting arrested thing."
Come on...
I wasn't arrested after that bar episode.
You and Caleb were such a mess.
Ty... why didn't you call?
"You know, after..."
I picked you up and everything?
"I wanted to, but I decided to give you some time to figure out what it is that you want."
"What I wanted was to talk, but..."
you made it pretty clear that you didn't.
"You kept giving me the cold shoulder, and then, this morning, you do a complete 180."
"You kissed me, Ty."
"it gives me pause, Lutie, to see him."
There's such a lot of recklessness under that crazy charm.
There's a danger in him and a kind of violence.
it's hard for me to keep my hands off.
"Sometimes, when he looks at me as we pass and it's never more than a flick of his eye i feel that he must know something and that he must hate me for it."
i understand Sarah Beth graduated last week with high honors.
Sarah Beth Brewton.
Hazel Sawyer.
BRlCE:
They tell me she'ii be home soon.
"i wonder how Sait Fork will seem to her now, after her years of schooling."
BROCK:
"Pardon me, ma'am."
"I'm, uh, looking for a little sawed-off, freckled, ugly runt of a girl."
I'm looking for a handsome young gentleman.
"Well, you found what you're looking for, but how about me;"
You went and changed on us.
"-Oh, Brock."
"-Hello, Sarah Beth."
Where's Papa;
Papa.
Papa.
"Good to see you, Sarah Beth."
"Oh, I might've known you'd be like this, both of you."
-Like what;
"-Oh, good-looking."
"A couple of years do a lot for a young lady, don't they;"
"Well, what did you expect;"
"Of me, I mean."
"Not as much as we got, eh, Brock;"
"Not half. I don't know, though, looks stuck up to me."
-Probably won't like our town anymore.
So that's the problem?
The only difference is that he got caught.
I sit in that courthouse every day and I see how they're doing him wrong.
"Ora, I'm sorry."
"If you need money, I can arrange a loan."
"I want you to tell my daughter, I want Goni to hear."
Why doesn't Daddy's friend come to visit her?
And why he won't let her daddy direct when he knows the truth about all of this?
Please tell her.
I'm sorry.
My darling.
My love.
Did you work on the adaptation?
"What adaptation, Mommy?"
It's a play I did for the theater and I'm adapting it for the school.
For the prison you're going to.
"No, for the school where I'll be working after I get out."
Plays in the theater are more fun.
Schools are nice too.
Then why not at my school?
Maybe there too.
Will you direct me?
That could be very nice.
I told the school they'd get a draft next week.
So they can see it's suitable for kids.
I'll get it ready.
It's annoying that they have to check everything.
Isn't your word good enough?
Why isn't it good enough?
That's the way it is.
Why?
"I want to hear ""There Were Nights""."
-She must be a very special woman.
-Yes.
"I'm here, Alyssa."
Where are you?
Why don't you answer me?
"-Welcome, Mr. Casey."
-Check him.
"-And who, may I ask, are you?"
-Marek
Thai is Trea.
-Let me guess:
Draconians?
-We are.
"-Well, then I'm certainly not pleased to meet you."
-It's clean where I found this.
"-Whatever your reason is for coming here, understand we have no intention nor interest in keeping you alive."
"-So I'm dead either way, right?"
-Correct.
No one will be spared.
-Why?
-The Earth's position in the solar system provides us with a strategic and tactile advantage.
"-Robert, the human role in the universe is inconsequential."
"-That may be so, but we have a right to exist."
-Only if we allow it.
-And we don't.
"-Well, before you start waving your victory flag, might I suggest examining the contents of the drive you hold in your hand?"
I think you'll find it very consequential.
-Alright.
Take him.
"And Robert,"
Jaelen had something we very much want.
It's a Grey stone that contains crystals.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
I think being on stage at Woodstock was good.
"At that time, I thought we did good."
My opinion of the show was this :
it was obviously fucking chaotic.
You were going off.
"The fucking music was like, sloppier than usual I felt."
"Yeah, that was one of the best show I ever done, personally."
"I connected, I said fuck it and I didn't get tired..."
I broke everything I could and it was an insane show.
Fuck it.
I felt as if the world...
the weight lifted up off me.
I felt just relieved...
But...
"then I heard the tape, it was awful."
"Live, I think, anger becomes a main source of energy to get off of."
The shows become very disorder(impossible a piger?
--dissolved ?
BIZARRE?
)
The lights look amazing...
that's another story.
"Ah, I don't really want to do it, but."
"The one who brought back the Bonheur chocolates, was this boyfriend."
The guy you're spending tomorrow's Valentine's Day with is him.
"That guy smokes, right?"
"What, so you had noticed."
"If that was the case, you should have said something earlier."
This girl.
This girl is...
It's okay!
It's fine to go on like this!
What?
Two-timing is fine.
"If that boyfriend takes off for some place again,"
I'll help Saeko-san pass the time.
It's fine like that.
What's wrong with it?
- What?
I'm totally fine with it.
"Or rather, I don't mind it much."
"If I can be with Saeko-san, and one day, be loved properly, then I'm fine with that."
It's fine even if that's far out in the future.
"So, okay?"
I'm sorry.
"Saeko-san, wait."
"If you feel even a little sorry for me, at least accept this."
But...
- It's fine if you throw it out somewhere nearby.
It's pretty harsh to personally throw out something you made for someone.
"So, if Saeko-san could do it,"
I would be a little saved.
Akamiso is excited to present...
Shitsuren Chocolatier 1
Access...
- Confidential?
"No, no, no."
I don't know anything.
"The last time I talked to her it was just, ""The kid this, the kid that."""
"According to our records, you spoke to her on the 15th."
- Three weeks ago?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that makes sense."
I...
She was going to Vegas.
"Oh, is that right?"
Vegas?
She asked me to go along with her.
It was gonna be her treat.
I couldn't go because I had to work.
We were gonna stay at one of those ritzy new places.
"The, um, Bellage..?"
- The Bellagio?
Right.
- Yeah.
- With the contortionist.
- I've never been.
You've been going through my desk.
It never crossed my mind when I was a younger woman... that I'd be this age and not have kids.
"Somehow in my mind, kids."
"Raising them, making them good people."
That's what I wanted.
"Then I met you, and I realized that I'd be... trading my dreams so that we could live yours."
We sacrificed all of that so we could do good.
We have done good.
I was never prouder when you fought to make hate crimes a capital and federal offense.
I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes.
"We're playing our inaugural round of ""Wild West and Witches,"""
and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.
(spits) Patooie.
"We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon."
It looks ridiculous.
"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
"All right, fine."
Let's just play.
We should go easy on him.
Amy's out with Stuart tonight.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex isn't enough to hold on to a woman?
"Cluck, cluck, cluck."
"What are we, ladies at a quilting bee?"
Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
Sorry.
Creepy Tepee.
Annie Ogly.
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me."
I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here.
(spurs jingling  jangling)
- It's you.
- You are.
Where'd you get money for a ride like this?
We' re doctors at County.
- Where you headed in a hurry?
- Y'all can't just do this.
Just be quiet.
I see you guys brought a lot of pals.
What's the deal?
- Four people shot this morning in a diner.
- What diner?
We were just up at the Sedgwick Y in a pickup game.
Call the gym manager.
Why don't you search the car and let us get the hell out of here?
"All right, go ahead."
"See, that's my boss right now."
Somebody's very sick.
"Look, we' re late for our shift."
"Dealers got shifts now, huh?"
"- We are doctors, damn it."
"- Relax, punk."
"No, wait a minute, I can explain that."
I can explain!
"Get on the ground right now, or I'll put a bullet in your damn head."
Cuff them.
You belong to the Y?
I play ball there twice a week.
Who do you play with?
I don't remember their names.
Some live up the street from Greg.
- You show proof to the arresting officers?
"- Yeah, they took my ID."
I told the arresting officer my ID was in the glove.
Did you ever hear of a place called Magoo's?
"That's why I'm even telling you guys this to begin with, because, you know, when things like this happen, sometimes people talk about them."
"You might hear something at school, or you might see Miles or even me on television, and I just wanted to prepare you for it."
I don't understand.
Why would you be arrested?
"Well, I don't know, and that's just it."
It's possible that some people connected with this project did bad things.
That you didn't know about.
That I did not know about.
- Why would you be arrested?
- l'm not going to be arrested.
I'm not going to be arrested.
"I do not want you to worry about this, all right?"
I'm just trying to prepare you in case people talk about it.
Okay?
"- Yeah, okay."
- Yeah?
Okay?
It's really okay.
I have to leave anyway.
"No, it's ready."
"If I could find the syrup... lf we have it, it's in that cabinet right there."
- Of course.
- [knock on door]
That's Mom.
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
- Are you all ready to go?
"- Yeah, I was, um..."
"- Oh, hi."
"- Hi, Karen."
They're ready.
I was just giving Jessie some waffles.
With a knife.
"All right, I'm gonna tell you something, kiddo."
I woke up last night thinking about it.
I couldn't sleep at all.
"First I thought, ""Who am I gonna talk to?"""
"And then I thought, ""Michelangelo."""
Because you're a good listener.
"I mean that, really."
But it's not an easy thing to talk about.
Because...
Well...
Maybe...
Maybe it was my fault what happened to Bonnie.
And Dorothy.
"Because you see, in a way, Minx wanted them dead."
"But a girl can't help her feelings, can she?"
That's all they were.
Private feelings.
Private thoughts.
I didn't really want it to...
You know.
"What do you think, Michelangelo, honestly?"
Do you think I made a mistake with my career?
"You see when I was born mother decided I was to be something respectable, reliable."
"So you can imagine, when I started playing with dolls, mother started crying day and night."
It was a nightmare.
And that's when I began to dream of being a psychiatrist.
To stop mother from crying.
"And then one day, a man told me I was beautiful, asked me if I wanted to be in a commercial."
"Big hair, big eyelashes, big fur."
Vodka.
It was a big success.
You must be Danny.
"- Killer pipes, man."
Thank you.
Yes.
I went through a choral camp every summer as a kid and I was the first male Annie.
"We are a real odd couple, you and me."
I bet that we're just gonna end up arguing and apologizing to each other over and over again every week.
"In my flashbacks, I let the boys speak for themselves."
Yep.
Feels like it was just yesterday.
"What a crazy, crazy wild time."
"We became room-mates after that, but you know the story."
What does that have to do with anything?
"The reason he needed a new room-mate is because his old room-mate got married and left, and they were never really friends ever again."
Yeah.
And now it's happening to Danny all over.
"Oh, okay..."
You're a mess.
"The poor guy, he feels abandoned, dude."
"Well, I guess I have to make this..."
I'm sorry.
I guess I...
You know what?
Enough monkeying around.
I gotta make this right.
Good luck kiss.
"Now you get out there and you git him, soldier!"
Of course Trent works here.
Candace used to see all this for free.
Now people gotta pay me a buck for it.
Bam!
Capitalism.
I'm so glad to see you meeting your son!
Nim-sai!
Nim-sai...
Don't be too excited.
"Men, come and take care of Sir Ho."
"So, you've seen,"
Sir Ho admitted the accused as his son.
"This may be a deliberate conspiracy, a trap for a nullius filius."
But the witness didn't swear in front of the Bible.
"So, his words won't be accepted by the court."
He swore.
"His hands touched the Bible, but he said nothing."
"Alright, again."
"Your Honour, although such a sad thing happened, the words of the witness said before his death... should be forgotten."
Nuts!
"He did say the truth, how can you deny it?"
"Sorry, law is law."
Not any word should be amended.
"Chan Mon-gut, I can't help you."
"Your Honour, you can!"
You'd better learn again.
"Your dad died, and you don't even shed a tear."
I think I'd better learn from you.
It's all because of you!
My dad had heart disease.
"If you didn't ask him to be witness, he wouldn't have died."
"You, murderer!"
"Your Honour, I am sorry."
"My father died, I can't control my emotion."
What's up?
Damn it!
You pretend crying!
"Oh, man."
# Don't sweat what you might get #
# By seeing the other side as a threat... #
"Oh, you kids!"
# We gotta learn to all get along #
# East side west side #
# It doesn't matter to me #
# We gotta learn to power through and set each other free #
# Don't care what other people wear #
# Or the way they like to style their hair #
"# Neither side is right or wrong, that's why we got to all get along #"
"God, this sucks!"
"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losing her, S-Stan?"
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do about it anyway.
Maybe you should just talk to her.
"You know, a little conversation."
Tell her what you feel.
# Sometimes ya feel like there's a b-b-burnin' inside ya like a-- #
Just stop.
All righty then.
"Uh, Wendy..."
"Hey, Stan."
"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should."
What?
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
"Stan, that's ridiculous."
- It is?
- I would never leave you for Bridon.
- Really?
- No way!
That'd be stupid!
"I shall remember that, sir."
"""...change our vile body, that it may be like His according to the working whereby He can subdue all things to Himself."""
That ends the burial service for those killed in action.
Turn forward and...
"Stand by, all hands."
"I haven't time for assembly, so this serves a second purpose."
Stand by to witness punishment.
All hands to witness punishment.
Two dozen.
- Just for looking at him.
- Stow it!
- Commence the punishment!
- Start the roll!
Keep low.
She'll take off our masts.
She'll lop them off!
Keep down.
Keep down.
"Goss, are you there?"
I'm...
"Boy, where's Mr. Goss?"
"On deck, sir."
For the flogging.
Flogging?
I authorized no flogging.
Twenty-three!
Twenty-four!
"Punishment completed, sir!"
Two dozen lashes!
- Cut him down!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Enjoy yourself?
"All right, I'll be there."
"Help the guy, fatso!"
- Again.
I'm looking for Miss Guadalupe Mendoza.
- Miss Guadalupe Mendoza?
"Yes, she's here."
She was arrested for disturbing the peace and public exposure.
"You know, the community calls and we have to act, sir."
How much is the fine?
It's 200 pesos according to the law.
She has to stay here for 24 hours.
But if you want we can put her in a cell by herself.
"Shut the fuck up, whores!"
Guadalupe Mendoza?
You're going to sleep in the suite tonight.
Shut up!
"Shut up, you rowdy bitches!"
I want to tell you...
I am a Christian now and...
God spoke to me in many different ways.
For instance in a dream.
"Now I ride a cab and I preach to the people, so to speak."
I tell them to get closer to God.
I tell them you can talk to Christ in different ways.
And thanks to God I'm with him now.
What are you going to do now?
Can you come to the living room when you're done?
"Now that it's sold, why don't we use it?"
I'll be in the bedroom.
Get away from the window.
Why are we getting out through here?
- They can see you in daylight.
You've made a new friend.
- Are you the new volunteer?
- He's a lawyer.
He and I are gonna throw a doctor's ass in the slammer.
"Oh, well... see you later."
Bye.
You smell that stink?
Like something's rotting?
Behind the stink of detergent... can't you smell that?
It reeks of death around here.
Why do you think she puts up with it?
She had a kid who died.
That's why.
"All of us in here are going out in body bags, and she knows that."
She thinks that when we see her little darling up there we'll tell him how mommy's doing.
And we'll take care of him.
Make sure he eats his dinner and goes to the potty up in Heaven.
"Volunteer, my ass."
What about you?
"You got a message to send, too?"
"Who you got up there, huh?"
"I'm going soon, so make the most of it."
"Some ""dearly beloved?"""
- Or maybe...
- Excuse me.
Hey!
"Hey, come back."
I didn't mean it like that.
I don't know how to die.
None of us know how to die.
But maybe... somewhere deep inside of us a part of us does know how.
Maybe it's not as terrible as it seems.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Please.
So the guy was choked to death.
"You sure, Doc?"
"Yes, absolutely."
"Not only that, it appears it was done with one hand... someone"
With a very strong right hand.
So you're saying that he was choked
By a guy using just one hand?
Yeah.
"There was severe damage to the larynx, the esophagus."
There's no doubt it was strangulation.
That doesn't make sense.
"Broad daylight, no robbery."
"And if there was an assault, why didn't the dog bark?"
I can't solve the case.
I can only tell you how the young man died.
"Not a single person heard a damn thing,"
And yet there were people all around.
"Hey, Doc."
Is it possible that... that a girl could have strangled him?
"On, the top my head I'd say no."
The hand print on his throat was too large for most women.
And I doubt if any woman would have that much strength.
Why do you ask?
"Oh, hell, I'm grasping at anything, Doc."
"I mean, he was with a girl."
It was her dog.
I hear you got a hold of Kuya?
The two are around here.
150 km north of Marshall Islands.
"Well, then..."
"Yes, as soon as repairs to your arm are completed, we want you to go rescue them."
We need to act sooner than that.
We must hurry so that I can pick up where I left off with...
Left off?
"Yes, that is..."
But if that enemy comes back again...
Don't worry!
Dangaioh can take care of that Mohawk dude!
That's not going be easy.
"Judging from the data sent from Flail, it's in no condition to transform into Dangaioh."
"But we just can't sit here and do nothing, right?"
"Yes, you're right..."
Kuya...
Kuya...
Thanks.
"If you didn't come, they would've taken me away."
"No, I should have been more..."
You should have?
I was no match for them at all...
Sorry...
"If I weren't so slow, we could've transformed."
"I'm the weak link, aren't I?"
No way!
Not once have I thought of you that way.
It's just that...
This is a dangerous mission and it's not for everyone.
If there's a way you could step down...
"Don't get me wrong, that's not what I mean."
Mmm.
Maybe.
Maybe?
[Scoffs]
"Come on, Joel."
I know that guy's in a hurry.
Wants the bread.
He wants to go back to France.
This guy's not gonna hang around and play games.
"Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across."
"What am I, a schmuck?"
What's the hurry?
He could see a couple of shows... visit the top of the Empire State Building.
"Don't jerk me, Weinstock."
I spent a lot of time setting' this one up.
"So what do you want, a badge?"
"This is your first major league game, Sal."
One thing I learned-
"Move calmly, move cautiously."
You'll never be sorry.
Look.
I've been damn careful up to now.
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawling all over you like fleas.
Aah.
"Look, I'm telling you, he'll take the deal somewhere else."
So let him take his 60 kilos of heroin someplace else... and find how easy it is to put together a half a million in cash.
He wouldn't find there's any hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We could make the switch in an hour!
"Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you."
He'll split if we don't move!
This guy's got 'em like that.
Thank you.
Yes.
"Now, just to recap, you've almost killed yourself..."
Right.
"...So far, you've lost a competition that you came up with."
Yes.
I cannot to see what you've got planned next.
It's actually pretty cool.
- Have you ever heard of range anxiety?
- I have.
"That is when you're more than 1 mile from a waffle house, right?"
[ Laughter ] No!
That is not what range anxiety is.
I'm just saying.
Range anxiety is where people who drive electric cars start to get nervous that their car won't have enough battery life to get them to their destination.
Okay.
"So, the other day, I'm watching the movie ""Top Gun,"""
and it hits me.
I know how to end range anxiety forever.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Here's all I need.
"I need a retro-fitted electric British sports car, a power cable, a generator, a pick-up, and..."
Adam Ferrara.
[ Laughter ]
That's Adam Ferrara?
Yep.
No.
"No, no."
[ Laughter ]
Now it's Adam Ferrara.
I thought the best place to conduct my experiment would be an airport runway in Compton.
How dare you tell me to keep it down?
I'm here with my better half here.
Go fuck yourself!
"You can't come into my place where I'm with my friends, drinking, playing pinball, having a fun time, celebrating."
You're not welcome.
Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
I'm not kidding you.
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I hate that man.
MAN:
"Hey, sweetheart."
What?
What are you staring at?
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Thought I smelled gasoline.
That's me.
- You look lost.
- I'm not.
Wanna come hang out?
- You want something to drink?
- Sure.
"All right, sit down."
"NARRATOR: 'When she had first spoken to the lowlife at the bar, 'it was the first time in four days Ashley heard her own voice out loud."
"'She became devastatingly aware of her own desperation, loneliness and torment."
'Quickly she could take no more and went home.'
- (DOGS BARKING)
- Nobody here is in pain.
This is a no-kill shelter.
We have plenty of available foster parents who are able to take care of them for as long as necessary to find a home.
- Do you have any cats?
There is no John Brandeis.
It was just Constantine.
Moving money around.
"We don't know that, Georgie, we"
We don't know Constantine's side.
"He wasn't the only one using the Safe Room, Christos was too."
"No one is who they seem, are they?"
Christos is an addict.
Do you think he's capable of this?
There is no John Brandeis.
You're right!
I have to talk to Christos.
You and I are cut from the same ice
Sincerity made us the perfect heist
Burning all the gold to sapphire skies
But the breeze is cold in paradise
I can feel the whispers in the street
Every night I shiver in my sleep
"No reality, cause it's all a dream"
Was it love?
It was wild Brought me to my knees
"Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things"
"I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy"
Was it love?
It was wild Brought me to my knees
"Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things"
"I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy"
Allo!
Hi!
"Yes, this is Georgina Clios."
I'm here to see Christos.
"He isn't here, I'm afraid."
Yes.
Where are the plans?
"Oh, here they are, sir."
"Will you ever forgive me, sir?"
"- What for, Jeeves?"
"- For hitting you on the head, sir."
"Oh, it's all right now, Jeeves."
Everything's all right.
"Well, dash it!"
Everything's not all right.
"Jeeves, you ingrate."
"Get me out of the rough, will you?"
"I'm afraid you'll need a blacksmith for that, sir."
"We owe a great deal to you, Mr. Wooster, and to your man."
- Not at all.
It was great fun.
"- Well, thanks anyway."
I'll go and see if I can find that blacksmith for you.
- How can I ever thank you for all you've done?
- It isn't thanks I want.
It's eternal devotion and everlasting friendship.
"Do you mean that, or are you still in a daze?"
"I'm in a daze, but a wonderful daze."
"Parsons, orange blossoms, little choirboys— can you face that?"
"Yes, if you promise me you'll never speak to a strange woman again."
What are you doing?
- Sittin' down.
- Amazing.
"Oh, Jeeves, this is a very pleasant spot."
We must spend our honeymoon here.
"Not our honeymoon, sir."
Only yours.
"You see, Trixie, now that this young Tyler has brought more money into the play"
I shall arrange for you to have more to do.
- And you may become a star.
- A real star?
A great star.
Possibly as big as-as a planet.
"Well, where is she?"
Where's Miss Chummy?
"Well, I've called her twice, she's over there with the judge."
"Tell everybody else to go home, I'll attend to her."
Okay.
"Alright, Miss Chummy we'll go through that new number you've been telling me about."
- I brought my own piano player.
"- You wouldn't trust ours, heh?"
"Yes, but he knows all my routines."
"He does, huh?"
Mm-hmm.
[wailing]
"Listen, being that it's a new number today just for the sake of novelty, please try to sing the same notes what he plays."
"- Alright, ahem."
- Music.
[clears throat] [falsetto singing]
What have you got in your mouth?
Firecrackers?
Must you give out with that shrill gargling?
"Well, I'm a dramatic coloratura."
Coloratura?
Music.
[piano music]
* Fluttering chirping birds of spring *
* Come back to your home in the north and sing * [falsetto singing]
What do you think you're doing now?
combat strength.
"Yes, one penis after another."
"General, Guillaume, every month..."
I recieve a limited supply of penicillin from the United States.
And what do you think my priority should be?
To save a sodomite who likes sunflowers... or a wounded American?
- Now please excuse me.
"- General Cork... it's Coronel Eliot, sir."
He says it's urgent.
"Be quick about it, Coronel."
We're at war.
What?
"No, no, that makes no sense."
Let's start over from the beginning.
"Right, first we want a creamy soup."
"But our soup is creamy, like mud."
Tomato soup?
"Yes, I think that's alright."
And don't forget the bleach.
"I don't know, it looks like we'll have to look after her stomach."
Anything else?
"But ""why isn't there any fresh fish in Naples""?"
"Coronel, you don't have to remind me I prohibited fishing."
The Bay of Napoles is mined from here to Sicily.
"But when Mark Cork gives that Renaissance dinner there will be... fish cooked with mayonaise, understand?"
How do you know?
Try the aquarium...
Soldier...
Fish cooked with mayonaise.
My god!
Do you think she'll like that?
- I have no idea.
What?
Did it ever get bad enough with Dad... that you thought about leaving?
Of course I did.
"I wanted to keep the family together, Michael."
Through the good and the bad.
You kids were so cute.
"Well, it's like Lucy said."
Chances are he's probably still in the area.
"There's no recent credit card activity, no car rentals."
"The only blip, Mike, is where he works."
Greenway Worldwide Cargo off of 57 th.
Talked to my A.T.F. buddy.
"There's, some kind of investigation."
"Uh, some link to organized crime."
Great.
U.S. Attorney's office is all over it.
"Left a message, haven't heard back, and that's about it."
"I should, uh- I should go talk to Evelyn."
"Well, you just talked to her, Mike."
"Yeah, but she was a little flustered the last time."
She might have forgotten something.
I thought you had to get those documents to Lucy.
Your fake I.D.
"Yeah, I'll do it later."
"Something I should know, Sam?"
"- About what, Fi?"
- About why Michael's acting this way.
What way?
He seems fine to me.
Tell me about this new client.
"You know, I just remembered, I gotta get Mike some yogurt."
"You know, 'cause if I don't do that, boy, it's just-You know how he is."
Pencil tip and paper should remain 45 degree all the time.
Now your turn.
Show me what you can do.
Not bad!
I'm tired.
Let me sleep for a while.
Do you really want to go?
- Yes.
- I have decided by myself.
I really envy you.
You always know what you want to do!
- Did you know what life I would want?
- Be a soldier!
Isn't it your dream at these years?
What else?
We...
Come on!
Let me show you something.
"Once upon a time, inside this forest, there was two rabbits loving each other!"
But...
there was a wolf in the forest trying to harm them!
"One day, tie little buck deciced to go to somewhere far away, to find the legendary flower of courage."
Because the flower of courage would fill someone up with the power of justice!
So that the little buck can protect the little doe forever!
"Travelling alone, will be faster."
"But travelling together, will make it longer to reach!"
I love you!

Xiaotian!
Yawang!
Take care of yourself!
Wait for me!
Look through her.
"I mean, make her think she's the most exquisite thing your eyes have ever beheld."
- Who her?
- Who cares?
Pick somebody.
"Well, how do I pick?"
- You got eyes?
- I thought we established that.
Make eye contact.
Make her eyes believe that your eyes are interested in her.
- So I have to be interested in her.
"- No, you're overachieving."
You only have to make her think you are.
"So we find, in Fielding's novel, the character Tom Jones is absolutely irresistible to women."
"- Isn't that right, Matthews?"
"- Uh, yeah, that's right."
- What's right?
- What you just said.
- What'd I just say?
"- You weren't listening, either?"
"Matthews, keep your head facing this way."
"Shawn, tell your buddy what I was saying."
"Uh, he was saying, ""Matthews, you're not listening."""
Thank you.
Did either one of you guys do the reading assignment?
- Some of it.
- What did you read?
I read the page you handed us with the reading assignment on it.
- (bell rings)
- Yay!
Yay!
- What?
"He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it."
- That's it.
- What do you mean?
He's gone.
That's it.
I knew it!
I can't fucking believe it.
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.
Fuck.
Are you all right?
It was revenge for Billy Batts and a lot of other things.
And that's that.
There was nothing we could do about it.
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's to match some silencers he had.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him home.
I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.
"Right away, I knew he didn't want them, and I'd be stuck for the money."
"I only bought them because he wanted them, and now he didn't."
What good are these?
None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not paying for it.
I didn't say a thing.
"Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye."
Stop the drugs.
Because my husband doubts my love for him.
And happy...?
I'm happy because the first time
"In a long time, i'm hopeful."
For us.
( music playing over stereo )
Would you dance with me?
"I just want to hold you,"
"Look into your eyes,"
"Be in love with you,"
And feel you being in love with me.
Would you?
The most beautiful song
For the most beautiful woman.
"- You got this, girl."
This is your special... and you're special.
"Ugh, yuck."
"Well, it'll be great."
- You sure about that?
- What did you say to me?
- I asked if you're sure about your performance.
You don't seem that confident.
"- Well, what do you know?"
- I know a lot.
I'm you.
"I just don't want you to get so nervous that you mess up, like that one time in show choir when you auditioned for a solo and they couldn't hear your voice because you had one of those inside farts."
"You know, like one of those farts that's like--"
"- Yeah, I know."
Why are you bringing this up now?
You don't have to be so rude.
- I'm not being rude.
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 1 5 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case, uh... I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
But what?
"But what, Ryan?"
You better speak now.
His ex mentioned that he might have a bit of a bad habit.
What kind of habit?
The kind that requires rubber sheets.
He's a bed wetter?
Yo.
Detective Menendez just called.
"According to the prop master, those two knives went missing on the last day of the shoot."
Ohh.
He's got the studio pulling drive-on logs from that day.
He's gonna send us over a copy so we can see if any of the names connect to one of the New York murders.
"Hey, you okay?"
[Chuckles]
"Damn, what'd you tell her?"
Bed wetter. [Laughs]
[Sighs]
This had better be important.
The masseuse was in the middle of doing things one only dreams of.
I was able to trace the tracker in my dad's watch.
It was purchased by a man named Malcolm McCabe.
Oh.
Born and raised in L.A.
Former Army Special Forces.
Says here he's working overseas.
He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.
"We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything."
"Sure, we could do that."
Or we could just pretend you never found this.
Fine.
But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.
Let's get clear of this god-forsaken place.
Let's go!
We need to drink.Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We have been pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
You're going to leave us here?
"I could make my life a lot easier and return you to jacob moore, if you would prefer."
"Soon as we clear the rocks, boom the main sail!"
Give her everything she can carry.
This ship's mine now.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Get him!
"Take the wheel, boy!"
This one's for me.
You fight like a man with a lot to lose.
But I have nothing to lose.
Which makes me far more dangerous!
"First blood, I think."
"So, the evil island spirit."
"You're going to attack me with a stick, are ya?"
"I have a very, very unfair advantage."
"Oh, well we'll just see about that."
Die!
"Hold the wheel steady, boy!"
While I finish him off.
You see?
I have been living the outdoor life.
"Fresh air, plenty of exercise and nutritious food."
- Tonight?
"- Oh, no, I can't."
I've got to meet my mom at the hospital.
- Want company?
"- No, I'm good."
'Cause we're here for you if you need us.
"He knows that, Brian."
Good.
"I can't count the times I wished you dead, miserable son of a bitch."
Literally can't count the times.
"Let me tell you, I always thought you'd outlive me."
You were always so full of damn life.
Used to piss me off.
"Goddamn sparkle in your eye just like the day I met you, like you were still 21."
I used to imagine you outliving me.
"Standing over my grave, getting cigar ashes on my headstone."
Terrible.
But here we are.
Looks like I'm outliving you.
I spent the last 25 years of my life hating you.
25?
"No, at least 27."
Do I regret it?
Not for a second.
"You and I weren't always nice to each other, but we never, ever lied to each other."
Now who am I supposed to hate?
Probably my mom.
"Can you believe she's still alive, making everybody miserable?"
"God, who sent you these ugly carnations?"
"Stink hands, yeah, figures."
"I'm sorry it didn't work out between us, Frank."
You weren't a bad guy.
Which really is quite bloody strange.
But I'll take a shaving and test it later.
Come here.
I'm glad you're uh... moving on from Anna.
It's about time.
"Whoa, whoa."
That's not what's happening.
I still love her.
But does she still love you?
Course she bloody does.
OK.
"Look, I'm just saying."
Sometimes a broken Rolex is just a watch which won't work anymore.
"Right, Confucius."
MAN:
I am aware that my arrival has been the subject of speculation.
"It's no secret that in this department, in this police force, there have been sins committed."
And that's why I'm here.
And why my predecessor's enjoying an early retirement.
- Now I'm sure I come with a...
- (DOOR OPENS)
With a certain reputation.
But I like to think I'm fighting on the side of the angels.
It's just that I tend to hold a very big stick while I'm doing it.
I want London to be proud of its police force.
And I'll do anything to help make that happen.
(DOOR OPENS)
This is Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Former dancer at the Pleasure Palace.
"Yeah, I know who she is, Doug."
"Why's she next to my victim, Freddie Lau?"
Because she was strangled too.
I didn't think I would care.
"You know, I had a plan."
I wasn't even gonna look at him.
"And when I realized he wasn't coming at all,"
I just got this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.
He doesn't even want to see me.
Ugh!
I just hate that he can make me feel like that.
I know.
That's the worst.
At least when my birth mom balls
"I can tell myself it's 'cause she's a drug addict, right?"
Jealous.
Don't hate.
"I did kinda want to see him, though."
Just once.
Just to know.
"Hey, uh, do you have any plans tonight?"
"Um... no, why?"
Why do you care?
Are you so shallow that you're afraid your social status will be diminished by a big brother who doesn't
Yes.
"No, but really, Jesus and Emma are going to some all-ages show tonight at the Groundspace to see this band that Emma's friend is in."
"Now, Callie wants to come, but because Wyatt's out of town,"
I'm going with her so she doesn't feel like a third wheel.
- So why do you need me?
- We need a ride.
I feel so loved.
Um...
"I don't know, why don't you ride with Emma?"
"We're trying not to be third and fourth wheels, remember?"
- You have to come.
like a shoelace.
That's pretty resourceful.
I know.
"All right, you're good."
I just can't believe he's gone.
Yeah.
And for what?
For trying to save a guy like John Cutler?
"Now, listen to me, all right?"
"Billy saw somebody in danger, and he reacted, all right?"
That's what he did.
And the fact that he knew the kind of man that Cutler was and he still put himself in harm's way?
"He was a hero, Catherine."
Yeah.
(knocks)
I just got off the phone with the lab.
There's something you're both gonna want to see.
What do you got?
"Well, there were no prints on any of the shell casings from our shooter's gun."
But the lab did find traces of blood on one of the slugs from Billy's gun.
Wait a minute.
Billy hit the shooter?
Apparently.
That's my boy.
It must've been a through-and-through.
I bet the slug was imbedded in the cabin wall and our cleaner dug it out.
You run the blood?
"Yeah, we got a match, too."
Our killer's a guy by the name of
Jason Kroll.
He's believed to be a hit man.
"HPD had him as a suspect in two homicide cases last year, but couldn't make anything stick."
"Come on, Tom."
"Wait right there, Tom."
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.
"You got anything in your pockets, Tom?"
"I got some Indian stuff here... some shells in a sheepskin, a little bit of change."
You ready?
"No, upstairs."
"Bill, you stay down here."
I'm going to put you in this one.
I know how you love those hills.
You can see a little bit of them from here.
"Don't close that door until I get over to that window, would you?"
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?
I've nothing to say on that.
Is the Association going to pay for his defense?
"I told you, I have no more to say."
John Coble to see you.
This is Thomas Burke.
He'll be your legal counsel now.
Every boy needs one of those.
Mr. Burke's the man to put an end to all this for you.
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.
They're going to have you come to court very quickly.
Have you ever been tried for anything before?
"Yeah, once."
It was a military trial a long time ago.
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?
Invasion of Mexico.
"Tom, I have to move on with this as quick as I can."
Must have been quite an impression.
You did research on me?
Are you following me?
That day you bought me a drink so now you want chocolates for free?
Disgusting.
You are such a big business tycoon.
- I'd think you'd be able to afford them.
- Afford?
I can even afford a car.
But then how would I enjoy this walk with you?
How will this work if you too keep quiet?
I am already the silent type.
Who comes to a party and...
Personality problem.
Mysterious smile?
And I want to make chocolates.
Have our personalities exchanged?
"You're damn strange, man."
It's hard to figure you out.
That means you are trying to figure me out.
"Actually, yes."
Yes?
I think we should do business together.
- What say?
- No.
But liquor and chocolates get along.
- They do.
- So then?
It'll be difficult to focus.
For you.
Doesn't that sound like a Hindi song?
"""A girl walking in the rain."""
Cardoza photographed it...
But it never showed up in the evidence locker.
Why not?
Paper says it went missing.
"Initials ""a.T."""
Jury tv had gavel-to-gavel coverage of the whole trial.
Uh...
Yeah.
This is from the day enright's lawyer grilled jesse.
"Attorney Ah, detective cardoza..."
"Now, you took the photograph"
"Of this bloody cuff link at the murder scene, correct?"
"Yes, I did."
Ah.
"And would you please read out for the court,"
"Uh, the initials that are engraved on that cuff link?"
"""a.T."""
"Well, those don't appear to be"
"The initials of my client, tony enright, now, do they?"
Was that a yes or a no?
No.
No.
Thank you.
"Um, there-there appears to be"
Blood on this cuff link.
"Now, will you tell us, please, is that the victim's blood"
Or the perpetrator?
I don't know.
"I'm so sorry, I'm..."
Going a little deaf in this ear.
"Could you, uh, repeat that a bit louder?"
I don't know.
This is Mukesh calling.
Sorry.
Who is there ma?
Somebody's got the wrong address.
What are you doing here?
Leave!
My husband can come anytime!
Did he hit you?
What else do you expect?
A trophy?
"My sisters are coming, I need my money."
Are you done?
They rescheduled my appointment for tomorrow.
Breakfast!
"Johnny bhai, I need a favour?"
What?
You will have to go to that lady's house the one that you met with me.
Why don't you go yourself?
My aunt lives in the same colony if she sees me there...
What work do you have with her?
Sleeping through the day begets bad luck my friend!
She says that your due has already been paid to you.
Your lady friend didn't even let me enter the house!
She started shouting and threatening me saying that she will call her husband!
They have given your number to the cops even filed a report against you...
What the hell are you upto?
You will get me into trouble as well
Screwed up my work.
Got me thrown out of the house.
And now she says she will not pay me!
Bitch!
Does she think I am scared of her and her husband!

"Hey, let's see."
"Why are you like that, after one punch?"
After you beat me up last time...
I can't say I won...
I just got lucky when I went in with that punch.
"Anyway, since you gave up first, you have to do me a favor."
Think about it.
Why does my friend have to be accused of murder?
When the real murderer is out there.
Just tell me where his house is.
Please.
You said that you were hiding this secret for your friend's sake.
"You cover for your friend, and you fight really well..."
You're not doing anything bad.
This is for the good of your friend.
Come on.
Where is your friend's house?
Hello.
"Hello, there."
- Are you moving?
- What is this about?
We just got a call.
He said that he is the murder suspect for this case and that he will be coming to the police station at 5 p.m. to turn himself in.
But we got to talking.
"He said that he was persuaded by you, Representative."
By you.
"We wanted to have you there while he confessed, so we came here early."
- Gao Jian
"Oh, it's you!"
How come you're here?
Cause I miss you all!
How is Master!
It ain't good to talk here.
Let's go in
"Brother, try these noodles!"
Go on!
"3rd Bro, we haven't seen each other for a year"
Did you change your profession?
It's a long story!
We're now at the mercy of others
We are at the end of our tethers
Y et there's no end to our insults
You're not much better than us!
That's right!
Ever since the three bastards came 3rd Brother has become the chef
"I'm the servant, and Sister is the housekeeper"
"Hey, looks like you've been doing well"
"You here to do your brothers a good turn, is it"
"Shame on me, I'm not much better than you"
What are you doing now?
"Speak up, chap"
I'm waiting on tables
A waiter?
The noodles are for me!
No wonder Master wrote you off as a useless bum
As the saying goes :
can't change one's nature
"What did you say, kid?"
Nothing!
"Yes, sir."
"And thank you, sir."
In view of the fact that the deposit was so small this procedure is a little unusual.
"Miss Howell, would you please leave my house?"
I have some very important business to discuss with Mrs. Ryan.
"Come into the garden, my dear."
How do you like it?
It's lovely.
All those wonderful flowers.
"Oh, that's nothing,"
I'm going to have some orchids flown in from Hawaii.
But what a beautiful setting.
"You know, a place like this inspires romance, don't you think?"
How long is it since you lost your husband?
Five years.
And you've been without a companion all that time?
I'm doing alright.
I want you to give a party.
Invite all your friends.
We'll celebrate.
Celebrate what?
My making $20.000?
That's nothing.
"Well, there'll be much more in the future."
Future?
I'm going to Europe soon.
Why go to Europe.
I've brought Europe to you.
"You're a fast worker, aren't you?"
In my country I'm considered a slowpoke.
We weren't even formally introduced yet.
I think we know each other pretty well.
In order to keep all of this running smoothly it's important to establish the clear roles and responsibilities for maintenance of the shared drives.
That brings me to the end of the presentation.
I just want to say thank you.
Paulette Murray:
It looks like you answered any questions people might have had.
Did you want to say anything else before we close out?
Beth Cron:
"No, just thank you for attending today and I'd like to hear any comments or questions that you have."
Paulette Murray:
Okay.
Thank you so much Beth.
You did a wonderful job.
I think a lot of people appreciate it.
Looks like you have some applause coming from the crowd.
Actually we do have a question from Walter before we do that.
"""How many files / bytes did the NARA project take on?"" Good question Walter."
Beth Cron:
Yes that is a good question.
"Off the top, I know there are several shared drives at NARA."
"A couple terabytes, I think, each."
I don't have the exact numbers.
But they were getting quite large.
Hence the need for a cleanup project.
I can answer any questions about the shared drive bulletin.
"But if you do have specific questions, it's best to talk with your NARA appraisal archivist, who is more familiar with your agency and can better answer any specific questions you might have."
Paulette Murray:
"Alright, once again thank you Beth for a great presentation."
Thank you to everyone who had questions or participated in the discussion.
"We'll be hosting other upcoming online briefings, so please keep your ears out for the fliers that we send out so that you can register for those."
And please look for updates about other online things we're offering here at NARA.
"We have the new fiscal year 13 online course schedule online, I believe."
I will put that link into the chat box after I'm done.
That's classic thylacine habitat.
And the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around.
So could we put it back?
Yes.
Is that all we would do?
And this is an interesting question.
"Sometimes you might be able to put it back, but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again?"
And I don't think so.
"I think gradually, as we see species all around the world, it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild."
"We'd love to think it is, but we know it isn't."
We need other parallel strategies coming online.
And this one interests me.
"Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos, sanctuaries, even at the museums, had collar marks on the neck."
"They were being kept as pets, and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets, and they say they were wonderful, friendly."
This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep.
A wild animal.
And I'd like to ask the question.
We need to think about this.
"If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then, would the thylacine be extinct now?"
And I'm positive it wouldn't.
We need to think about this in today's world.
"Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them, maybe they won't go extinct?"
"And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that, we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects."
We are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset.
Thank you.

The Inclusive Design Research Centre is focused  on designing for diversity.
"We try to design with, rather than designing for."
We believe that we will have greater designs for diversity and more innovative designs when there are multiple perspectives.
Our research is intended to help everyone.
A 3D printer is a printer that prints stuff - physical stuff.
It will enable everyone to basically have the equivalent of a little factory in their own home.
"Well, my name is Judith Snow."
"It's not really so much how the Institute has helped me, as it is I'm a participant."
Inclusion brings out a lot of value in society.
"This place is all about the structures of that, making inclusion actually work, so nobody's left behind."
Ontario is probably one of the most diverse communities in the world.
We are a world leader in things like accessibility legislation.
"What we're creating here is potentially an economic driver for Ontario, so that the world can come here to receive innovative solutions for designing for diversity, or for digital inclusion."

"If it's a very small molecule, it will move through fairly quickly."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"When it gets to the very end of that tube, there is a flame there, and it's going to burn off this molecule."
"And depending on the intensity of the fire, that is created because the molecule comes out at that time, creates a signal."
"And that allows us to determine not only how much oil was in the plant, but also the specific components that actually make up that oil."

"I know how much material is in those samples, and when it is going to be run."
"And after the sample is run, I get what is called a chromatogram."
"And, simply, it's a graph."
This is the signal strength over time.
"And so, I inject my sample here, and as it goes through, every time"
"I get a peak, that tells me that a compound that is coming to the end of that glass tube."
And so this tells me all the different compounds that were actually in my seed oil.
"Now, as a plant breeder, how do we make sense of this?"
All right.
"What I know is, I know what compound this is at the two-minute time period, four-minute, or six-minute time period."
"Well, let's say I'm trying to create a bio-diesel product that doesn't create as much smoke."
Or maybe doesn't gel up under very cold conditions.
Beth Seaton:
Right.
Win Phippen:
So what I would look for is plants that have very high of this compound and perhaps something low in this compound.
Beth Seaton:
I see.
Win Phippen:
And so I can alter the relationship of these different constituents within the oil.
"So, you have to get your own strategies together before you go to make a major purchase."
"Now, something else that the book talks about."
It talks about price comparrison.
And here we are not necessarily talking about a major purchase.
"This can be, I'm going to the store and I'm having dinner and it normally takes two cans of green beans for my family."
"Well I can buy one can, the small can of green beans for $.99."
"So to buy two of them would be $1.98, right? $.98 X 2."
"But, I can buy a larger can, double the size, for $1.50."
Should I buy two small ones or one large one?
"Obviously, you would buy one large one."
"And we make the assumption, because this is how it used to be, that the bigger the quantity the less per ounce or per pound or whatever an item is."
And let me tell you that is not always true.
They got you to thinking that so now they do just the opposite because if you need two cans of green beans for a meal you will buy the big one when maybe the big one is $2.25 and the two little ones are $.99 each.
You are better off buying the two little ones even though you have to open two cans than you are buying the one big one.
If it is twice the volume.
Okay?
"So, how can I do this?"
And I will tell you what I do this in the grocery store all the time.
"It takes a little longer to buy groceries sometimes, but this is what you need to do."
You need to be able to figure the unit price of an item.
"And if you will look on page 190, there is the example."
"To calculate the unit price of an item, divide the cost by the number of units."
"So, if I am trying to figure out how many ounces are in something."
I mean how much an ounce of something costs.
I look at how many ounces are in the can and then I take the price divided by the number of ounces.
"So, if you look at this it says a 64 ounce product costing $8.32."
So you take $8.32 divided by 64 and it tells you the cost per ounce.
Okay?
"So, you need to use that when you go grocery shopping."
Take a calculator.
Use the calculator on your phone!
But sometimes it is cheaper to buy two little cans of green beans than to buy the one big can.

What does it say to do?
It says check to see if I'm in that base case.
It's the list of length less than two.
Is it one basically?
"In which case, just return a copy the list."
That's the simple case.
"Otherwise, notice what it says to do."
It's says find the mid-point and split the list in half.
"Copy of the back end, sorry, copy of the left side, copy of the right side."
Run merge sort on those.
"By induction, if it does the right thing, I'm going to get back two lists, and I'm going to then merge them together."
Notice what I'm going to do.
"I'm going to print here the list if we go into it, and print of the when we're done and then just return that."
Merge up here.
There's a little more code there.
I'll let you just grok it but you can see it's basically doing what I did over there.
"Setting up two indices for the two sub-list, it's just walking down, finding the smallest element, putting it into a new list."
"When it gets to the end of one of the lists, it skips to the next part, and only one of these two pieces will get called because only one of them is going to have things leftovers."
It's going to add the other pieces in.
"OK, if you look at that then, let's look at what happened when we ran this."
We started off with a call with that list.
"Ah ha, split it in half."
It's going down the left side of this.
"That got split in half, and that got split in half until"
I got to a list of one.
Here's the first list of size one.
There's the second list of size one.
So I merged them.
"It's now in the right order, and that's coming from right there."
"Having done that, it goes back up and picks the second sub-list, which came from there."
"It's a down to base case, merges it."
"When these two merges are done, we're basically at a stage in that branch where we can now merge those two together, which gives us that, and it goes through the rest of it."
"We'll check that return equals, equals null, just like it did."
"In fact, it looks a lot like the stack, actually."
And here I'm going to show you something kind of funny.
If I go take my stack CCPs pop.
"So if you remember what pop did over here, is it took the front most cell off the"
list.
And in the case of the queue that was the popping operation.
And it turns out the D queue operation is exactly the same.
"If we're empty, right, then we want to raise there."
"Otherwise, we take the head's value."
"We move around the head, we delete the old memory."
So it's not actually the top element.
"I should, actually, be a little bit more careful about my copying and pasting here."
I could really call that front.
It's the front-most element on the top.
But it's like the exact same mechanics work to take a cell off the front in that way.
"Well, that's sort of nice."
"And it's like, yeah, well, since I have some code around I want to go try it."
"My stack, also, kind of does some things useful in push that I might be able to use."
"It's not exactly the same because it's adding it to the front, but it is setting up a new cell."
So I'm going to make a new cell and I set its value.
"Then, it's attaching"
looks a little different.
Let's take a look.
"We omitted a cell, copied the value in, now the goal is giving our pointer to the tail, we want to attach onto the tail."
"So we know that it's always going to have a next of null, the new cell."
"So no matter what, it will be the new last cell and it defiantly needs that value that tells us we're at the end of the list."
And then we have to attach it to our tail.
I'm going to write this code first and it's going to be wrong.
So just go along with me in this case.
If the tail's next is the new cell.
"So if I'm wiring in the pointer from the tail onto the cell we have there, and then we want to update the tail to point to the cell."
And it came up again not long ago too.
ST:
"Yes, we have the ""ideologically similar"" media, although I find the phrase unfortunate."

ST:
"I'd like you to tell me about the best experience you have had since the 15th, and the worst experience."
And here we can move on to these things.
JL:
There have been three best moments.
"One when I was streaming with the telephone and I saw there were thousands of people connected to my streaming with my bloody telephone. and I said ""what's happening?"""
"But especially when I turned off the streaming, or the network collapsed or something, and I put down my mobile and looked not through the screen, because I was really stressed out."
I was knackered.
"But I put down the mobile to rest a moment and I thought ""Blimey, something's happening here"""
"I mean, something big is happening here, that's what I thought at that moment."
"And that's actually the headline I used in my chronicle that night, then I changed it, but the URL is still ""something big is happening here""."
Because that's what I felt.
"I didn't know what is was, but it was big."
That was the first big impression I got.
The second moment was when I started to see the cardboards in the square.
When they put cardboard on the ground so everyone could sleep.
And they started to
"""carpet"" the Puerta del Sol, that was the second time that I thought something big was happening."
"I mean, they were carpeting the ground so they could sleep there!"
"It's an image that's fixed, after that came the blue carps, the distribution of the commissions, the infrastructure, the firefighters helping out... the construction of the Medina de Sol."
But the first moment
I realised they were building a city was when I saw the cardobard on the floor.
"And I saw people were going to stay there, lots of people."
ST:
"I remember an image, let's see if I can describe it."
But it turns out that this is not quite the same expected value as this.
But you don't have to worry about it for now.
So why even talk about the standard deviation?
"Well, one, the units work out a little better."
"If let's say all of our data points were measured in meters, right?"
If we were taking a bunch of measurements of length then the units of the variance would be meter squared. right?
Because we're taking meters minus meters.
This would be a meter.
Then you're squaring.
You're getting meters squared.
And that's kind of a strange concept if you say you know the average dispersion from the center is in meter squares.
"Well first, when you take the square root of it you get this-- you get something that's again in meters."
"So you're kind of saying, oh well the standard deviation is x or y meters."
And then we'll learn a little bit it if you can actually model your data as a bell curve or if you assume that your data has a distribution of a bell curve then this tells you some interesting things about where all of the probability of finding someone within one or two standard deviations of the of the mean.
"But anyway, I don't want to go to technical right now."
Let's just calculate a bunch.
Let's calculate.
"Let's see, if I had numbers 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7."
And let's say that this is a population.
So what would its mean be?
So I have 1 plus 2 plus 3.
So it's 3 plus 3 is 6.
6 plus 8 is 14.
14 plus 7 is 21.
So the mean of this population-- you sum up all the data points.
"You get 21 divided by the total number of data points, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
21 divided by 5 which is equal to what?
4.2.
Fair enough.
Now we want to figure out the variance.
And we're assuming that this is the entire population.
So the variance of this population is going to be equal to the sum of the squared differences of each of these numbers from 4.2.
Let's say that this distance between this leg and the book is 1 meter-- or the box.
"Let's say that this distance between the leg and the center of mass is 2 meters, and so this is also 2 meters."
"OK, so we can now set this up as a moment problem."
"So remember, all of the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments."
So what are all of the clockwise moments?
What are all of the things that want to make the table rotate this way or this way?
"Well, the leg is the only thing keeping it from doing that."
So everything else is essentially a clockwise moment.
"So we have this 100 Newtons, and it is 1 meter away."
Its moment arm distance is 1.
"So these are all the clockwise moments, 100 times 1, right?"
"It's 100 Newtons acting downwards in the clockwise direction, clockwise moment, and it's 1 meter away, plus we have the center of mass at the top of the table, which is 20"
"Newtons, plus 20 Newtons, and that is 2 meters away from our designated axis, so 20 times 2."
"And you might say, well, isn't this leg exerting some force?"
"Well, sure it is, but its distance from our designated axis is zero, so its moment of force is zero."
Even if it is exerting a million pounds or a million
"Newtons, its moment of force, or its torque, would be zero because its moment arm distance is zero, so we can ignore it, which makes things simple."
So those were the only clockwise moments.
And what's the counterclockwise moment?
"Well, that's going to be the force exerted by this leg."
That's what's keeping the whole thing from rotating.
So it's the force of the leg times its distance from our axis.
"Well, this is a total of 4 meters, which we've said here, times 4 meters."
And so we can just solve.
"We get 100 plus 40, so we get 140 is equal to the force of the leg times 4."
So what's 140-- 4 goes into 140 35 times?
My math is not so good.
Is that right?
4 times 30 is 120.
120 plus 20.
So the force of the leg is 35 Newtons upwards.
"And since this isn't moving, we know that the downward force right here must be 35 Newtons."
No!
They are going to know.
"Then, no!"
They are going to know.

A really nice algorithm.
"As I said, an example of divide and conquer."
Notice here that it's different than the binary search case.
"We're certainly dividing down, but the combination now actually takes some work."
I'll have to actually figure out how to put them back together.
And that's a general thing you want to keep in mind when you're thinking about designing a divide and conquer kind of algorithm.
"You really want to get the power of dividing things up, but if you end up doing a ton of work at the combination stage, you may not have gained anything."
So you really want to think about that trade off.
"All right, having said that, what's the complexity here?"
"Boy, there's a dumb question, because I've been telling you for the last two lectures the complexity is n log n, but"
let's see if it really is.
What's the complexity here?
"If we think about it, we start off with the problem of size n."
What do we do?
We split it into two problems of size n over 2.
"Those get split each into two problems of size n over 4, and we keep doing that until we get down to a level in this tree where we have only singletons left over."
"Once we're there, we have to do the merge."
Notice what happens here.
We said each of the merge operations was of order n.
But n is different.
Right?
"Down here, I've just got two things to merge, and then"
I've got things of size two to merge and then things of size four to merge.
But notice a trade off.
I have n operations if you like down there of size one.
Up here I have n over two operations of size two.
Up here I've got n over four operations of size four.
So I always have to do a merge of n elements.
How much time does that take?
"Well, we said it, right?"
Where did I put it?
"Right there, order n."

"In the end, the kindergarten emptied and we added caravans."
Here were the sports area and a mini obstacle course
Here was the climbing rope
"Everyone who came to the Mechina knew that by the end of the year, he'll reach the top of the rope."
"In the end, after 5 amazing years in Kiryat Malachi, the Mechina had to move on."
"We came here, to the Shafir area."
We had study partners at the local school.
They told me all the time to check out the Mechina program.
"I came thinking I'd be here for a week or two, and then move on to the army.."
I had no intention to stay..
I wanted to just go straight into the army without thinking too much.
"I didn't even think for a moment about life processes, yeshiva."
Not even for a moment.
"My thinking at the beginning of the year was to come to the Mechina, do my psychometric tests, and then immediately apply for the Atuda program, without any thoughts of staying"
I came to the Mechina
And I see great guys great Rabbis who love us for who we are.
You see the warmth here.
I saw that this Mechina is more special than the other Mechinot I saw.
Gili was a Platoon Commander in the Tank Corp.
They were called to go to Ramallah.
They asked Gili and his platoon to enter the junction in order to attract the gunfire away from the infantry.
This is what saved them.
They told him it was enough but he insisted on going in again.
One bullet penetrated the earpiece on his helmet and killed him.
"About a year after Gil was killed, a major donor of the Mechina, Sandy Kolb asked us if we would agree that the Beit Midrash be named after Gili."
This is how we got to know Rav Boaz and Naftali Kendler.
Their self-sacrifice is close in my heart to the self-sacrifice exhibited by Gil to his soldiers.
"And I would ask her, I would say,"
"""Man, why are you saying this?"
There are people that are listening in.
"I mean, I got 30, 40 thousand peopel listening to me at one time."
"You mean to tell me that there's nobody listening to the ideas I'm trying to convey and you know, things I'm trying to do,"" and, no."
"No, she said."
So...
"I mean, and now that all this--"
"It's not the first time this kind of shit has happened, so I kind of gotten closer to mywife because of that man."
"Even though she didn't believe what I was doing, she still stood by me."
"She still, you know, accepted the fact that I was in another room while she was attending to whatever she was attending to and it just puts life into perspective that I don't want to end up like"

"Open mic, not in my office."
I'm talking about when I was outside my office work.
"I'm talking about when I spent time in here, you know what I mean?"
"I've been spending a lot of time in the chatroom here outside of the show, you knwo what I'm saying?"
"So, I mean that's time away from my wife."
"I mean, look, you know, my traditional office hourse are my traditional office hours, but when I'm at home at, you know, 8, 9 PM, 3 AM, early in the morning,"
"I mean, you know... she's here, she's here now."
You know what I mean and you know she's...
"I just feel bad that I sat here and neglected her unconditional companionship and instead, being politcally, but not really political, but I guess romantic in another direction, you know aht I mean?"
"So, I think I'm gonna spend a lot more time with her, man, and not only that, my family, my family that I've discussed, you know what I mean?"
"So, in my personal opinion, it's over man."
There's nothing I can do.
"There's nothing I can do, I've done everything."
The world is the way it is.
"I've got a few years left, a few good years left,"
"I've got some pretty good years left in me, so might as well-- like I said,"
"And then I want to add this 2p minus 1 here, so plus 2p minus 1."
And what do I get?
These cancel out.
These cancel with that.
And these guys cancel out.
So there's a total of p squared possible A's where the determinant of A is divisible by p.
"Now, we're very close, but this isn't what they're asking."
They want the total members where the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"So all we have to do here is take our total membership, which is p to the third, and subtract from that the members whose determinants are divisible by p."
And we just figured that out.
We subtract p squared.
And now we'll get the number of A's where determinant of A not divisible by p.
"Now let's see if that's one of the choices, and it is."
"D, p cubed minus p squared."
Mary Shelly wrote Frankenstein.
"If there is one monster that you know by name, you may think its Frankenstein."
"Of course, if you remember the book, Frankenstein is actually the name of the individual who brings the creature to life."
The monster is unnamed entirely.
Not every memory is 100 percent reliable.
"For example, the most common image of Mary Shelley shows her as a mature woman."
"While you read the book, it might be worth bearing in mind that she was only eighteen years old when she began writing it."
"Also, there are two introductions to the book in most of the available editions these days, one written in 1818, one written in 1831, both nominally by Mary Shelley."
"Some people feel that the first one was written by her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley."
"But since he died in 1822, the 1831 preface is certainly hers."
These are not random additions to the novel.
I ask you to read those before you read the text itself.
"Finally, as you read the book, you might be wanting to keep in mind that the book is constructed with different narrative voices, speaking to us, through each other."
Are all of those voices equally trustworthy?
Is every narrator truly reliable?

And that jumping to the front in the end are just a matter of updating that cursor position from zero to the size and whatnot.
The operation where things get a little more bogged down is on this insert where I need to insert a position.
"If I insert the X, Y, Z into the middle there and you can see it kind of chopping those characters down, making that space to insert those things in the middle."
"Similarly, doing delete operations, if I jump to the beginning I start doing deletes here."
"It has to copy all those characters over and deduct that length, right, so that the vectors do that work for us on remove that."
"That means that if the vector's very large, which is not a typical in a word processor situation, you could have you PhD theses which has hundreds of pages, if you go back to the beginning and you start deleting characters you'd hate to think it was just taking this massive shuffle time to get the work done."

"So seeing what's actually happening, right, it's like just mostly kind of moving that stuff back and forth, and then having the vector do the big work, right, of inserting and deleting those characters, and doing all the copying to get the thing done."

It's different every day.
I think it's gone really really well.
It's nice to see that there's a lot of people on our side.
I think it's very good that we had an MP with us.
Stephen Lloyd (off camera):
"""I think a really good piece of campaigning from the MS Society."""
It's really nice that there's several different news people here.
Well I hope it's made people aware of what the problems are that people like us have.
I'm a bit more positive now than what I was earlier on.
I think today more than anything I felt proud; proud of what we're doing a proud of people with MS.
Anchor:
Students at Western illinois are trying to get drunk drivers off the road.
The university's emergency medical services hosted it's 16th annual Mock DUI project.
College volunteers show people what a drunk driving accident looks like.
"With prom and graduation right around the corner, officers say it's important to stop drunk driving."
Officer:
The numbers related to DUI accidents and fatalities is pretty staggering.
Everybody has somebody that they know or a loved one that knows someone that has been involved in a DUI accident or been killed in a vehicle accident of this nature.
Anchor:
"Local hospitals, police and fire departments help set up the event."
All emergency officials respond to the accident as if it was real.
"Cubs fans sing ""Go, Cubs, go"""
"White Sox fans chant ""Go, go, White Sox"""
"Both sets of fans say ""Go, CTA"""
It's the best way to get to both ballparks.
Whether it's U.S. Cellular Field on the South Side or Wrigley Field to the north the Red Line connects fans to their favorite ballpark without the hassle and expense of driving and parking.

"""It takes you all the way from north Chicago to south Chicago"""
And this is like the average that you're used to taking before you learned any of the statistics stuff.
You add up all the data points and you divide by the number there are.
The sample is the same thing.
We just use a slightly different terminology.
The mean of a sample-- and I'll do it in a different color-- just write it as x with a line on top.
And that's equal to the sum of all the data points in the sample.
So each of the xi in the sample.
But we're serving the sample is something
less than a population.
So you start with the first one still.
And then you go to the lower case n where we assume that
lowercase n is less than the big N.
If this was the same thing then we're actually taking the average or we're taking the mean of the entire population.
And then you divide by the number of data points you added.
You get to n.
"Then we said OK, how far-- this give us the central tendency."
It's one measure of the central tendency.
But what if we wanted to know how good of an indicator this is for the population or for the sample?
"Or, on average, how far are the data points from this mean?"
And that's where we came up with the concept of variance.
And I'll arbitrarily switch colors again.
Variance.
And in a population the variable or the notation for variance is the sigma squared.
This means variance.
And that is equal to-- you take each of the data points.
You find the difference between that and the mean that you calculate up there.
You square it so you get the squared difference.
And then you essentially take the average of all of these.
You take the average of all of these squared distances.
So that's-- so you take the sum from i is equal to 1 to n and you divide it by n.
That's the variance.
And then the variance of a sample mean-- and this was a
"Convicted, that's correct."
JG:
"You write in the preface,"
"""It had been and is my view that it was the racism in Middlesex County, fueled by biased, inflammatory publicity in the local press before and throughout the trial, fanned by the documented government lawlessness, that made it possible for the white jury to convict Assata on the uncorroborated, contradictory, and generally incredible testimony of trooper Harper, the only other witness to the events on the turnpike."""
"There was one other state trooper, Harper, who survived the confrontation and who was the main witness against Assata."
LH:
"Yeah, but Harper ran away during the shootout, came back, and his story was conflicted and contradictory."
And—
"Yeah, it all comes down to tapping buttons."
Which brings us to our next accessory.
Probably the stupidest thing ever invented: the Speedboard.
What is it?
It's a piece of fucking plastic!
You attach your controller.
You get it?
In case you don't want to hold the controller with your hands?
"In case you enjoy playing on the floor, or behind a table?"
Then this is for you.
It's embarrassing.
What's the point?
To put the speed at your fingers?
Why in the ass would I need that?
"If I'm playing a game that involves having to tap the buttons like crazy,"
"I'm probably gonna get a turbo controller,"
like the NES Max or NES Advantage.
How could they even sell such a thing?
"Even though it's made by a third-party company, it was actually licensed by Nintendo."
It's like covering a turd in ice cream sprinkles.
"Next up, oh boy, the Konami LaserScope."
Now I just wanna go on record by saying I fuckin' love Konami.
But this thing reeks of ass!
"It's essentially yet another form of the Zapper, but it's voice-controlled."
- Why do you think it appeared to you?
"I believe the demonic can appear as an apparition... ...much like a ghost, in an attempt to excite our fear."
"- Did it excite your fear, Father?"
- It scared the hell out of me.
"So this night, when you began to prepare Emily's exorcism... ...was it your first encounter with this demon ghost?"
- Yes.
- Have you seen it again?
I've seen it ever since.
No further questions at this time.
"Redirect, Your Honor."
"Father Moore, after you received the bishop's authorization... ...when did you proceed with an exorcism?"
October 31st.
On Halloween.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?
Halloween tradition is based on legends throughout history... ...that indicate a real increase in spiritual activity on that night... ...and I thought we could use the occasion to draw them into the open.
"- The demons, you mean?"
- Yes.
Father Moore... ...can you identify this?
It's my tape recorder.
I used it to record the exorcism.
Inside is the tape I made that night.
Why would you make such a tape?
Ever since the technology has been available... ...exorcists have used tape recorders to authenticate the ritual... ...and provide a record for review.
I offer into evidence this cassette recorder and audiotape...
Objection.
The people were not aware of the existence of this tape... ...until last night.
- Neither were we.
This tape is new evidence that came into our possession yesterday.
We provided counsel for the people with a transcript of its contents.
You mean this tape was not given to you by your client?
"No, Your Honor."
"We received it from a reluctant witness... ...Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also be called to testify to its authenticity."
A pile of elephant dung is about this big.
Okay?
So that's what's going off in here.
We are deeply indebted to dung beetles. &amp;gt;
Believe me.
And to fungi.
What's going off here is respiration.
So that's energy.
"You know, you all use it up every day."
"You're using up somewhere between oh 3500 and 5000 calories a day, depending on whether you're on a sports team or not."
And so that's what's going off out here.
And this is coming off of every level here.
Okay?
So you can think of this as what's left over and this is the flow of all that ATP driven stuff on the planet surface.
Now how does that look in space?
"Well if you look at tons of carbon fixed per hectare per year, where green is a lot and yellow is a little, you can see that the forests are really important."
Okay?
"And the closer you get to the equator and the wetter it gets, the more efficient the forests are at fixing carbon."
This is for the terrestrial part of the world.
"If you could put the reefs in, they would be fixing carbon, and they would be withdrawing it on kind of a different timescale."
"Because the tropical forests, although they fix a lot of carbon, don't actually cleanse the atmosphere of CO2, at least not at equilibrium."
Why not?
Student:
As they're &amp;gt; they're actually they're also respiring.
Prof:
"They are respiring, yes."
What happens to a tree when it dies?
Student:
It releases a lot of carbon.
Prof:
"It releases a lot of carbon, right?"
So in fact you could grow up a big forest but you only get the carbon benefit the first time you grow it up; after that it goes into an equilibrium where the trees are falling down and the logs are rotting and they're releasing carbon back into the atmosphere.

I thank you for your faith and devotion to the gospel.
I thank you for the love and care you show one to another.
I thank you for the service you provide in your wards and branches and in your stakes and districts.
It is such service that enables the Lord to accomplish many of His purposes here upon the earth.

"But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience."
"By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?"
"Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand."
Raise your hand.
Did your hand go up?
"Now bring it out, bring it out."
Anybody else?
"I see, I see one way in the back."
"You sir, that's three."
And anybody on this side here?
"OK, over there on the aisle."
"Would the four of you please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage."
Let's give them a nice round of applause.
That can be nice but then you only have what's on that island.
By opening up the borders for others you become more innovative and you get more unexpected creative solutions.
"As a result, you become better at what you do."
We made the Muse app firstly because we enjoyed it and also because there wasn't an app like it.
"Besides being a fun app, it also gives a better perspective on art history."
"Old paintings from for instance the 17th century consist of many details, which can overwhelm spectators."
We're not used too looking at images in that way anymore.
"By focussing on the small parts and making your own image, you create a better view of the overall picture."
After we won the competition we contacted Open Culture Data... ...to see if we can use the basis we made for other museums as well.
These other musea have their own needs and different data.
"Also, we made MuseApp from our own perspective... ...but by using the data and wishes of other organisations we can perhaps use it in other ways."
We've learned a lot by organizing our own app competition.
Getting a result of 27 entries like we did takes a lot of work and energy.
"You need to let developers know what you're doing, but you also need to know what they want."
Sustainability is also an important issue for app competitions.
"We've given out these four prizes, but what happens to an app when the competition is over?"
I heard everything.

- I would say definitely and the most important is to throw.
"Beyond that your personal religious beliefs on throwing checked or not or changing or not, are less important, but not swallowing it the really important thing."
"- OK, at least we can agree on that much."
The rest of it is just a quite good practice.
Use formatters.
A lot of people seem to be afraid of these.
I ended up using them all the time.
They're easy to write.
"If you look at the whole API for, was is Java text format, there's a whole lot of stuff there."
"But, with Web Objects, you usually don't care."
"You're formatting one value of an input, and you're...you're parsing one value of an input or you're formatting it into a string."
"You don't need to get too carried with writing fancy, fancy formatters."
It's good because it keeps the views separate from the model and the controller.
"Rather than using a formatter, you can often just do it in a WO component."
The thing is that this is a little bit smaller than a WO component.
It's easier to reuse across a bunch of WO components.
It promotes reuse because of that.
The code's not tied to one specific page.
Yes?
- This is going to get ugly
A lot of the formatters aren't thread‑safe.
I think all the ones I rate are thread‑safe.
"But, I know some of the Java timestamp formatters, and some of the other ones aren't thread safe."
"The best practice is probably to cache them in a session if you're not going to get multiple requests, unless of course, you're using a long response page in which case then you've got a different problem."
"The best practice is, it depends but think about thread safety."
- Yes.
None of the Java formats are as thread‑safe.
- Sorry.
It's actually not that costly to pick a formatter.
Just don't try to share a formatter between threads.
You're asking for trouble.
"There's no doubt, I put the date and time into the session as seen from the slides to hold the time zone in them?"
The team travels a lot and their on the road for quite sometime how do the students keep up with their school work?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's difficult and I think golf is probably as challenging as any of the sports.
Because you know when we play on the road the first day is typically a 36 hole round.
That's 10 hours of being on the golf course your completely wiped out.
And it's tough to keep up you but know they have the computers they...they stay with them and they work on projects together a lot of times their in class together.
So they can try and help each other out as far as assignments and tests and things like that so you know typically
I've had good students on the team and this year is no exception.
We have great kids that work hard and they do their best in the classroom.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This Friday the team goes on the road to compete in the Pinehurst Intercollegiate Tournament.
What do you expect to come out?
Do you expect to come out with a victory?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well that's a very difficult field.
I mean there's I think 3 Bit Ten Schools there.
UNC Wilmington's ranked 52 a lot of good mid-major schools are there.
And so you know I think that we have our work cut out for us in terms of winning the tournament.
"But, you know our schedules very demanding and I think that pays off for us in the...in the Summit League at the end."
So you know I expect us to...to continue to improve
I'm not going to put any predictions on how we finish.
"But, obviously Pinehurst is a great place to be the golf course is a great challenge for us."
The kids will really get a great experience out of being at Pinehurst.
[Nick Spinozzi]
How much of an advantage would you say the team has when it competes in the Beu Mussatto Invitational?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I think playing on home course is a big advantage.
Because the golf course is very challenging it's got some holes on it you really need to play a few times and get some experience on it.
The greens are very challenging difficult a lot of slope so it is a big advantage.
Althought we have some very difficult schools coming.
Oakland in our conference is doing very well this year.
Wisconsin Greenbay has a great team.
This is a subspace of L2 from -1 to 1.
"And it is a subspace spanned by polynomials of degrees of 0, 1, 2 to up to N-1."
"There is a self-evident naive basis, mainly sk is equal to tk, k going from 0 to N-1."
This naive basis is not orthonormal and can be quite badly behaved when N becomes large.
"Our goal will be to approximate vector x, which is sin t over this sub-space, so sin t does not belong to P3, so we have to find the orthonormal projection of sin t over this sub-space P3."
"From the basis s k, we can build an orthonormal basis using something called the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure that you're probably familiar with from linear algebra."
"So, you take the original set s k and you derive the orthonormal set u k using an algorithmic procedure which is given in steps below."
"At each step k, you first derive p k as s k minus the projection on to the previous orthonormal set."
"And then, you renormalize p k into u k by simply dividing by its norm."
"Let us see the Gram-Schmidt procedure on a set of two vectors s 0, s 1."
"So, they are obviously not orthonormal to each other."
"So first, we normalize s 0 into p 0 divided by its norms, that gives you u 0, which is of length 1, it's the blue vector."
"Then, we compute the projection of s 1 onto the subspace, using u 0, so that's u0 inner product with s 1 times u 0."
"Then, we subtract this from s 1: that gives us p 1."
"And finally, we normalize p1 into u1 which is the blue vector."
"Now, we have two vectors that span the same space and are orthogonal to each other."

"But even so, even so I mean the fact of choosing, of selecting and deciding on one was the result of being very careful about not using my sense of beauty or my belief in some esthetics of some kind."
"In other words, finding some object of complete indifference as far as esthetics are concerned and that indifference is very difficult because there is always some detail in any object that will attract you esthetically."
"Meaning, that you find it beautiful or even ugly which is the same thing."
Ugly or beautiful is the same thing when it comes to choosing an object in the form of a Readymade.
"By Readymade, also the idea of it was being made by either manufactured or made by another person can be a Readymade, too, you see."
I even remember signing a big painting in a restaurant for the pleasure of calling it Readymade.
"You see, and of course it was not manufactured."
[Laughing]
"So, of course I couldn't take the painting with me because it was attached to the wall."
But this explains that the difficulty is to make people understand that was not through an attraction or the beauty of the object that I would call it Readymade.
"That's why I made so few because after a certain while, anything becomes beautiful."
"You know, it takes 40 years sometimes"

You'll have one per week and a final.
You'll have deadlines for these
like in a real class.
And you must do these.
Apart from getting a certificate you'll learn.
Finally.
I want you to know how I've structured the class.
I think this is true of most courses or classes.
Its highly recommended to mimic the real world or face to face classes on some dimensions.
"So one of the dimensions is, I will release material one week at a time."
You will not be able to get into the ten week class and do the whole class in a week.
Why am I doing that?
For two reasons.
"One, I genuinely believe that you need time to understand new stuff and practice assignments."
Problems within the videos.
"And if you understand the stuff, you are better off, you can go to the next step."
Luckily Finance builds on stuff.
"So you have to know the first week to know the second week, and so on."
"Well, the second reason is probably more important of releasing one stuff, one week at a time."
"So synchronous, I mean not at a point in time, but for a week."
The second reason is that learning happens from each other.
"So when I do these classes live, all assignments are on a group, and they evaluate each other, not everybody gets the same grade."
"So, this I can't mimic online, but you can."
Join the forums and
learn from each other.
"In fact, I believe you learn far more that way than you'll"
learn from my videos.
And I actually hope that's the case.
Now content and materials is important.
The main material you will get from me is the video.
"For every week there would be approximately two week, two hours worth of video broken up into pieces."
Because Finance is so applied you'll have many opportunities to pause the videos whether I ask you to pause or not.
What's all this for?

"Because, right now, on the planet Earth, there are 16 million direct descendants of Genghis Khan, meaning that every day is the birthday of 43,000 of them."
"So, good news, Genghis Khan."
"Your empire might be gone, but your progeny lives on, and on, and on, and on."
HAPPY BlRTHDAY!
"Best wishes, John Green."
"Unfortunately for the Mongols, those guys weren't always working together, because Genghis Khan failed to create a single political unit out of his conquests."
"Instead, after Genghis' death, the Mongols were left with 4 really important empires called the Khanates: the Yuan Dynasty in China, the Ilkhanate in Persia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, and the Khanate of the Golden Horde in Russia."
"If you remember all the way back to the Hellenistic period, this is similar to what happened to another good general who wasn't much for administration,"
Alexander the Great.
"Also, neither of them ever conquered India."
"The Mongols succeeded, primarily, because of their military skill."
"Genghis Khan's army, which never numbered more than 130,000, was built on speed and archery, just like this guy."
"Mongol mounted archers were like super-fast tanks, compared to the foot soldiers and knights they were up against."
"""But, wait,"" all the military history nerds are saying,"
"""Once people knew the Mongols were coming,"
"""why didn't they just hole up in castles and forts?"
"""It's not like the Mongols had flying horses."""
EXCEPT THEY DlD.
They didn't?
"Stan, why are you always making history boring?!"
"So the Mongols apparently didn't have flying horses, but they were uncommonly adaptable."
"So even though they'd never seen a castle before they started raiding, they became experts at siege warfare by interrogating prisoners."
"And, they also adopted gunpowder, probably introducing it to Europeans, and they even built ships so they could attack Japan."
"That might have worked, too, except there happened to be a typhoon."
"Also, people were terrified of the Mongols."
"Often, cities would surrender the moment the Mongols arrived, just to escape slaughter."
"We just got an announcement, for those on the phone, about a film Jurassic Park is being played, I guess somewhere in this building, I don't know."
"But , um, the nice thing is, if the developer has written the application properly, and it works well with voice over, any edit box you get to, you can turn Quick Navigation off and you have this whole facility of being able to move by line, character, word, cut, copy and paste."
If you hold down Option and hit left and right arrow you'll move by word.
"You can do Command X to cut text, Command C to copy, Command V to paste--just like Control X, C, and V will do it in Windows."
It's really wonderful.
"So, yeah, any edit box is going to work."
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav again?
[coordinator]
"Um, sorry, question from the phone, would you repeat the question?"
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav?
[panelist]
I didn't hear the question.
[coordinator]
We can't hear the question.
It's something to do with quick nav.
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn it off and on?
[coordinator]
How do you turn QuickNav off and on?
[panelist]
Great question.
"On the keyboard, you hold the left and right... ok, you hit the left and right arrow keys together. ..."
"It just said ""quick nav on."""
"And I'm going to hit them together again, [software speaks]"
"""Quick nav off."""
It's a toggle.
"And the great thing about that is you can turn Quick Nav on, quickly move to the edit box, then turn Quick Nav off and, just, start, you know, typing away."
"Or If the edit box isn't selected, and you want to edit, you can actually, if you move to with Quick Nav ... if you press the up and down arrow keys at the same time to go into the edit box, it will automatically turn Quick Nav off for you."
Good point.
[Other panelist]
But what about a kid who wasn't identified early or who wasn't targeted for medication therapy or one on one attention?
"This is the story of a teenager who slipped through the cracks, an object lesson in missed signals."
"On the edges of Boston in this neighborhood known as Hyde Park, many families are scratching to make a living."
"One family, the Dunnings, is raising four kids here."
Adam is their second son.
"He was just a good little kid, very well liked."
"Always, neighbors and teachers, and CCD teachers, and coaches would always tell me, what a well mannered son you have."
His mother realized early on that Adam had a problem.
Adam and I would read together every night.
And he couldn't identify words that he should have been familiar with.
"When he started second grade, I knew that there was a building block that was kind of beginning to crumble."
"The school teachers kept saying he's just lazy, you know."
And his personality carried him through.
"Adams a good kid he's just, you know, we'll worry about him"
later.
"Finally, by the fifth grade, Adam's problems in school were obvious to his teachers."
He was given a battery of tests.
But school officials assured the
Dunnings their son was average and would do just fine.
"I think the problem with the initial testing was that when you do an IQ test, you've got 12 sub tests."
And half of them are language based and half of them or not.
So you end up getting scores that get added together.
And Adam's scores added together come up as average.
"But Adam, struggling with even the most basic reading, writing, and spelling tasks had the feeling he wasn't even average."
"I felt embarrassed at some times, like when I couldn't pronounce words and then other kids would pronounce the word for me."
"Say hurry up, you don't know how to read."
I got comments like that all the time.
By now his parents began to really worry about Adam.
They asked the school for more tests.
And by the end of seventh grade the school had a bombshell for the
Dunnings.
They told us that Adam was reading on a third grade level.
There's an not a decade long period.
Where you have health care expenditures less than the growth in GDP or equal to the growth in GDP.
"And you can see in almost every year, here it's almost two%."
"Here it's almost three%, it is three percent 1990s last and we'll talk about this in a second."
An d you can see in this period 2-1/2%.
"Overall, 2.4 percent for 40 years.You're on, you're on, those of who have understood the idea of compound interest."
"That makes a grow, grow, grow."
"But I do wanted, draw your attention."
"There is one year there, one year, one decade, the 1990s where it only grew 1.3 percent above GDP."
What was happening do you think in the 1990s that did that?
"Could, empower, that's right."
So 1993 he takes office in January.
He attends to introduce health care reform and get
National Health Coverage and what happens?
"It was defeated, that's right."
"Lots of reasons why it was defeated and we'll talk about that on the first session of the ACA why, what some of the differences are but it was defeated."
One of the reasons it was defeated was.
The passed Congress.
"Yes, that's correct."
But that means it wasn't a coalition.
Who pulled out of the coalition?
Businesses.
And they pulled out because they thought they could get a better deal somewhere else and the thought was the manage care companies came to them and said we can hold your cost down.
You don't need the government.
And the way they were going to do it was with manage care and then what happened.
So one thing that happened is that reduce choice and
Americans rebelled because at that time the main mechanism that manage can control the cost was to reduce what they paid doctors but also restrict choices of the population.
"There was a line going around in the 1990s, one 800 just say no."
That's what happened.
Men's care company gave you an 800 number if you didn't like their decisions and all that happened at the other 800 number just say no.
And the consequence was.
Manage care was able to control cost for a short period of time and we'll see about five years but then towards the end of the 90s cost went up.
That's all going to be possible in just a few months.
"Now, we have the Sony Bravia over to my right just to simulate the Google TV living room experience."
"And for the sake of all of your eyes, we'll be projecting Google TV back on the screen behind me."
Let's see if we can get it started.
There we go.
"So, everyone clear on everything?"
We're going to get started with the demo.
You notice here I'm watching TV as if I normally would in my living room.
I can change channels;
I can do all the same things I usually would.
"With one button, I can press the search button and bring down this box."
"And for up here, I can type in any URL."
So let's go straight to YouTube.
"In just a few seconds, YouTube.com is going to be loading."
"Now, you notice this transition between TV and web was completely seamless."
"I didn't need to change my input channel, I didn't need to use a different remote; the web just became an extension of my TV."
So I'm here on YouTube and I can do any of the same things I could do in my computer.
So let's search for something to watch.
The Salt's video trailer came out just a couple of months ago; let's see if we can find that here.
"Again, just like on my computer, now"
I can see it and I can go click on the link and watch the video.
"Now, one of the great things about YouTube is that as camera technology has improved, more and more people are uploading high resolution video."
This means that it makes a great experience when you navigate into full screen.
So let's try that now.
"So, the video is rendering and we're actually"
"going to be using hardware acceleration in the Google TV devices to make this rendering happen very, very fast."
Let's see if this actually is rendering.
All right.
"Well, let"
"me show you another example of YouTube, oh, this is what happened; the play button was not started."
Minor details when you're watching a video.
There we go.
Martin:
The sun would shine
"Can we act in a group, can we pull together?"
Ole:
"Yes, if we don't lift as a mass but as a Community"
"How do you see these ""occupied movement""?"
Is that community or is that mass?
Ole:
"Uhhhmmm .... they have a characteristic of the mass .. spontaneity, right? they are not organized .. but at the same time they are... directed at a goal and driven by an idealism and it moves them out of the mass concept"
Martin:
"And as you see it, the ideal and the goal is what?"
Ole:
"To prevent that resources are wasted and that human selfishness will shape government policies and in any way, the whole human living conditions"
"The mass never act normative, if it does, it is directed"
Martin:
It will be overruled?
Ole:
"Yes, as Hitler led the masses.."
Old:
But if the mass really follow standards that are freely chosen by the individual it's no longer a mass.. but something different.. movement
Martin:
But don't you see it as a movement?
Ole:
"Yes I do, also because they recruit to many different groups in society, right and to many age groups which is also extremely interesting"
Martin:
"Yes, but now as a global Prime Minister, you can do what you want, but"
You're also allowed to put some of these philosophical considerations on the line
Anything we could do in there?
I had another guest who suggested that we should teach philosophy right from the early grades
Ole:
"Well, I would say that it is well worthwhile to ask the question .. ""who am I""?"
Martin:
(Music) (Music)
"Oo, I've got wine coolers!"
"Over here, baby."
Oh!

Make sure everybody has Zimas!
"don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease"
I be in my house trying to think about what I'm gonna eat because I'm fuckin' starving and somebody knocks on my fucking door with his little dawg
"looking like ducks man they pissing me off cuz they knocking hard waking up my mother waking up my daughter now they got my exploding why the f*ck they knocking 8 o'clock in the morning that sh*t ain't funny so i walk to the door carrying a potato on the left hand carrying a potato nigga I'm trying to make burrito i know that's what you thinking get your mind right not your mind left don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease"
"As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion."
"And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century."
It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage.
"Now, I won't use mirrors, but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater."
So let the story begin.
"On a dark and stormy night -- really! -- it was the 10th of July, 1856."
"Lightning lit the sky, and a baby was born."
"His name was Nikola,"
Nikola Tesla.
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.
Let me show you.
"Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?"
Nikola Tesla:
"The result is 118,236."
Marco Tempest:
Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.
"When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind."
Tree.
Chair.
Girl.
"They were hallucinations, which vanished the moment he touched them."
Probably a form of synesthesia.
But it was something he later turned to his advantage.
"But I think, for obvious reasons, we can just skip that particular punchline and instead, silently ponder why"
Megan made the poor decisions that she made.
"Joking aside, it should now be burnt indelibly into your brains that I am the best man."
"But I hear some of you asking, ""Why would Bayley, somebody so obviously filled with bitter jealousy and feelings of inadequesy, pick somebody as awesome as David to be his best man?"" The truth is, I am as stumped as you."
"Don't get me wrong, I am Bayley's best friend in the whole wide world - closer to a brother, really."
"But Bayley, he is just my ..."
"I don't know... what is closer than a stranger, but still shy of pal...?"
"""Casual work acquaintance""?"
"No, I would need a job for that to be the case... ah well, we'll come back to that."
After all...
I can't ignore his lovely bride!
Heh heh heh...
"Megan, I actually want to use this time to appologize for the way we have treated you."
"To be mocked about your height for so many years by me, my brothers, friends, family, strangers on the street, well, it simply isn't fair to you."
"And to know that you've actually looked up to me all this time, metaphorically speaking, of course..."
"Well, I'm sorry for all of it."
I will try and be more respectful from here on out.
"That's a lovely dress, by the way."
Does it come in an adult size?
"Darn it, I didn't even make it a full 10 seconds into my resolution."
"Here, to make it up to you, I will now improvise a touching poem, just for the two of you."
"Now if you notice that I am still scrolling down my speech, understand that I am simply doing that for continuity."
"Ugh, starting is always the hard part."
"I dunno, uhh... roses."
Roses are... red!
Violets are... violet?
"No, I know there is something better."
"Come on David, you can do this."
"Roses are red, Violets are blue,"
"Today we learn what they already knew, This beautiful couple makes their official debut, Put themselves up for their familiar review,"

- Yeah.
"On the very rare occasions when you expect it and it won't hurt and you're dealing with it some other way, then, yeah, just comment it."
But don't leave an empty block like that.
"The problem is, though, if you don't have that in there then you have to say,"
"""OK, this method throws parse exception."""
Then all the methods that call that have to throw parse exception.
You end up making changes all over your code.
It's a real irritation of Java checked exceptions.
"The best practice for this, instead of swallowing the exception, convert it to unchecked and re throw it."
- Or throw it.
Or throw the original.
"- Yeah, but if it's checked then you have to declare it all the time."
- Yes.
- As opposed to... nobody likes to do that.
Nobody is going to do that.
Nobody is going to make that many changes in their code.
This forward exception has a little bit of a private API call that you can use there if you want to stick with that.
"Pierre is shaking his head going no, and I agree with Pierre because I don't do that."

I did it the nice way and Anyo got cranky at me.
There's actually a class called Exception Converter.
"In the notes to the slide there's a URL for it, and it's a much nicer thing to do."
"- Well, you run that exception?"
"- Yes, but the problem of throwing in a run time exception is you lose the original stack trace."
"- You chain it, you chain it."
- Not if you put parentheses E.
- Yes.
Actually parentheses E plus exclusion as to what in this level why it's being thrown.
"- Chain, chain, chain always chain."
- No.
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad

"Over the next 14 weeks together we will learn how in nearly 15,000 years humans went from hunting and gathering..."
"""Mr. Green, is this going to be on the test?"""
"Yeah, about the test."
"The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world."
And it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship.
"You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football and while scrolling through your Tweeter feed."
The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages whether you will be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric and whether you be able to place your life and your community in a broader context.
The test will last your entire life and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that when taken together make your life yours and everything...everything will be on it.
"I know right, so pay attention!"
"In a mere 15,000 year humans went from hunting and gathering to creating such improbabilities as the airplane, the internet, and the 99 cent double cheeseburger."
"So in the comments please tell me that you go right now, find fashion designers on Linkedln, on Facebook, and you turn them into your happy clients."

"So I'm very happy to be here at Mozilla with Brendan Eich, the CTO of Mozilla, and the designer of JavaScript."
So u could tell us how that language came to be.
[Brendan]
Sure.
So I can say more about how I got ready to make JavaScript.
It was when I wrote Netscape.
"I didn't have much time to do that, and I had to have the skills already."
And I've been just seated writing programming language implementations for my entire carreer.
When I got into Computer Science it was for Physics.
First studying theory of formal languages and automata theory.
"Regular languages, regular expressions."
This was the early 80ties and I loved the cleverness of the theory and rather direct way of implementing theories as algorithms.
"So you can make a parser or a lexer , semi-automatically or automatically."
"It was strange to me, and it was useful too."
I think every practicer in programs should take some time to invent a language at some point.
"There's often a need you have that no typical language is perfect for, or you have some leasure time and you can use that."
It's educational and can often solve your problem in a better way than any other language.
"And so, I encourage that."
"I did that myself and there is something that helped me to get ready to write JavaScript because when I got into Netscape and the heat of the moment was there, with Java looming."
Questions about if we needed two languages: a scripting language versus a big language as Java.
I had to go fast.
I had to have all sort... in my muscles I had to have some practice already on the way.
[Wes]
So in this class we will learn a lot of the things he have just mentioned. in various points.
"Regular Expressions,"
But there are 100's and 1000's of you taking this class currently.
"Your talking to each other is going to be more powerful, a learning tool."
"So say, for example, I make an error, and actually I have made errors in the videos, but I don't try to fix them and, you know, cut out that clip, simply because we all make mistakes."
"I correct them in real time with you, and usually they're small."
And I guarantee you they will be small.
"But is you find something don't say, Oh, you know, Suwarth Gottum made a mistake."
"Well, you make mistakes, I make mistakes."
Your attitude should be sorting out what that mistake is.
Finally.
This class is about ambiguity and learning.
And I would encourage you to take that attitude towards it.
Okay?
"One last thing, which I feel compelled to talk about because I have prepared most of the class, and I want it to share with you."
Why did I say yes to it?
Why did I choose to do something online?
The first reason is I believe education should be accessible to all.
Why do I believe that?
Because I believe education almost is like a right.
It's almost like a right to breathe.
"I do have strong views about it, but I genuinely believe that education makes you become empowered."
The most valuable investment you could ever make is education.
What do I mean by that?
"Remember, if you want electricity, which is good, you're willing to burn coal."
"However burning coal leads to some problems, some costs on society, and on you too."
Education is an investment that
largely gives your benefits.
Why wouldn't you want to do that?
Why wouldn't you to make an investment in yourself.
"My goal, in this investment, is to empower you not to be dependent on a coach like me or any other person."
"But to take this class and say, I can do it too, and that's the beauty of education."
I'll make couple more points and then we'll see each other in about a week.
This has been a real challenge for me as a teacher.
"Fan: ""and back"""
The Red Line stops just outside the ballparks 35th Street is the stop for U.S. Cellular.
Addison is the stop for Wrigley.
What could be more convenient and fun than a train full of like-minded fans?
How about a bus full of fans?
The #152 Addison bus drops fans just feet from the friendly confines... ...as does the #22 Clark and #8 Halsted.
The #35 35th street and 39 Pershing buses offer front door service to U.S. Cellular.
The CTA once again has commemorative fare cards and posters for this year's Crosstown series.
The posters have become sought-after souvenirs ever since they were first introduced in 1998
"This year's poster features the unsung heroes of the ballpark, the hot dog vendors."
Let's be frank.
Grilled meat and cold beverages are as much a part of the ball park experience as the game itself.
"""Exactly."
"It's part of the atmosphere, its part of the environment."""
Steve Musgrave is an illustrator who has created twelve Crosstown series posters for the CTA.
The 2010 poster is a whimsical departure from past depictions of ball players.
"""I appreciate the fact the CTA was open to doing something a little more playful than a baseball player- so it's a hot dog vendor."""
"Steve's first CTA gig was a series of baseball-themed paintings that adorn the Addison ""L"" station"
"Now, his posters adorn countless walls in and across Chicago. "" I really enjoy it, it's a lot of fun..."
"Some people collect them and some go out of their way to pick them up, which is nice to see."""
"""I'm a big fan of earlier 20th century European poster design kind of a streamlined or deco look."""
"""Every time I design them I picture them on some kid's wall, what I would have done with them as a kid."""
And how does he decide whether to put Cubs versus Sox ... or Sox versus Cubs?
"""Whoever hosts the games first gets the top billing."""
"Prior to each game of the series, CTA employees distribute the posters as long as supplies last."
"The commemorative farecards are available for purchase in CTA vending machines across the system, throughout the month of June or while supplies last."

The correct answer is:
"When evil is legal, become a criminal."
"When oppression is enacted as ""law,"" become a law-breaker."
When those violently victimizing the innocent have badges become a cop-killer. so the next time you hear of a police officer being killed in the line of duty take a moment to consider the very real possibility that maybe in that case the law enforcer was the bad guy and the cop killer was the good guy.
"As it happens, that has been the case more often than not throughout human history."
Stephen:
Come with me in the airplane and you are
looking at the instrument panel and you are flying in the clouds.
You can't see a thing.
Imagine.
"Now you are born deaf, profoundly deaf."
"If you have never heard anything in your life, how is it that you can fly airplanes?"
How is it that you can hear people teach you how to talk?
I am that person.
Announcer:
"""The guy just blew me away."" ""One of the best speeches I have ever heard."""
"""He's funny, poignant and he's lived it."""
That's what people are saying about Stephen Hopson.
A passionate and entertaining speaker.
His message about overcoming adversity comes from his heart and his own experience.
"Deaf since birth, Stephen never let his disability become an obstacle to achieving his dreams and reaching his goals."
"In February of 2006, Stephen became the world's first instrument rated deaf pilot."
A dream which began in childhood.
Stephen:
"When I was 4 years old, I begged my mother to take me to the airport so I could watch planes take off and land."
Did you ever do that?
"OK, so you know what I am talking about."
"Remember, I am 4 years old!"
My mother would park her car by the fence and I would be so eager because I wanted to be a pilot.
I would hop out of the car and I would run up to the fence and I would put my fingers on the wires of the fence and I would wait for a plane to come out.
"The minute a plane came out, I would put my head on the hood of her car, like this... and then I would wait for an airplane to take off."
"And as soon as that plane took off, the car would vibrate."
Taking apart my syringe.
"I'm going to add this in here, and then I want to turn my stopcock to open it up to the patient."
I can shut off this side port so it doesn't leak out.
And then the patient's head should be elevated a little bit.
You don't want them flat.
"So let's make sure, either raise the head of the bed or the patient can be raised up with some pillows."
Make sure they're not flat.
Okay.
So now I'm ready and I can take my feeding and pour it in here.
Okay?
And then you just want this slightly higher than the patient so that it'll go in but not too fast.
Okay?
"All right, and then I would give whatever my feeding amount was slowly and then after that, I would turn my stopcock again to shut it off so it's off here so it won't leak and then I can come back and do it again."
"Now, once I've been feeding the patient and I'm doing it, if this was my first time, after I check for placement, that's all I had to do."
"If I'm coming back four hours later, to give another bolus feed, I would need to check for residual first, tube placement, check for placement, check residual and then give the feeding."
"I may need to follow it with water per my order, to make sure the line is flushed and also to give the patient free water."
"If the patient's on continuous drip, meaning that they get a continuous feeding over 24 hours, we're going to use a special pump that is designed to be used with the feeding tubes."
And there's a special bag and seth (phonetic) that fits in this special type of pump.
All right?
So we're going to use a special feeding bag.
All right.
And then I'm going to pour my required amount of feeding into the bag.
Close the top.
Okay.
Now this is similar to an IV.
"It has a drip chamber, kind of like an IV does, but to get this IV to run, we have to do something special, to get this tubing to flush."
This part here is stretchy tubing.
And I need to stretch it flat and that allows the drip chamber to fill.
All right?
Okay.
"And then I put, prime my line, just like an IV line, until I get a drop to come out."
There we go.
And there's a real reason why professionally produced narrative is so successful.
"You know, just watch the Oscars and get a sense of how important it is to society."
"My view is that--you asked the question, if"
I may answer it at the wrong order.
"The right way to answer the question is, What does the future look like?"
"And then, How does everybody's models adapt to that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Well, we know what the future looks like. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, let's say it, because I think people are often, are a little confused about it."
The fact of the matter is that mobile devices are going to be the majority of the way that people get information.
And the argument is relatively simple.
You already have them.
They're called your phones.
"And over the next five or 10 years, these phones, if you just-- a simple Moore's Law calculation--will have the capacity to do much of the entertainment and communication and so forth that you use in other media."
And you're seeing that today.
So you have a business model issue.
But there's not a question of how people are going to spend their time.
So let's go through what these devices look
like.
"They've got a GPS on them, so they know where you are."
"They're personal, so they know what you've seen and they don't show you the same thing over and over again, like my television."
You know?
The same show over and over again?
Show it just once.
"It's highly, highly personal."
It can do excerpts.
"And, of course, it's also summary form."
So the combination of all of that means a huge change in the business model.
And I don't think we know exactly how that'll monetize.
What we do know is those products are getting built.
And so the challenge and the opportunity is to figure out how to make money in that.
"But, you won't get there by suing your end users."
You won't get there by preventing this technology from happening.
Classic New England clam chowder.
Five ingredients...
"Potatoes, cream, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;onion, pork, clams.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"All of those things at the end of the day, they sound easy, and that's &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what makes it a hard dish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"To me, the most intimidating dish is the one I'm well-known for. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's like a work of art.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
You seriously have to follow every step religiously.
Any idea?
Your notorious beef Wellington?
It's exactly that.
"It scares the hell out of me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's so intimidating,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it takes years&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of practice.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Felix, out of Joe, Graham,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and my dish,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what dish are you gonna choose?"
I choose...
The theme of today's elimination test is our most intimidating dishes. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We gave Felix&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the choice of one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of those three dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that give us the most anxiety.
The dish that Felix chose was...
A stunning risotto.
All right.
"My whole stomach sinks, and I feel a little nauseous, because I've only made risotto once in my life, and it was not very good."
"Risotto's not intimidating to me because I've made it before, and I'm comfortable doing it in a short period of time."
- Felix.
- Yes.
"For winning the mystery box challenge, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- you don't have to cook it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Yeah! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're safe.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Go enjoy your safety &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;up in our gallery.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
[Applause]
Thank you.
What an amazing position to be in.
"At least one of you will be eliminated &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the back of this risotto,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; so make sure it's not you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;All of you&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;have got 45 minutes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to make a stunning risotto. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your 45 minutes starts from...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Now.
Off you go.
"(Announcer) As Felix enjoys the safety of the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; lounge, the remaining home cooks must now choose the necessary ingredients to make one stunning risotto dish."
Butter.
I need butter.
"(Announcer) At the end of the challenge, at least one more person will be sent home."
Is there butter in here?
"Now we've sampled, we've interleaved this, we've decided how to sample."
"Now the big thing we got to do is simply construct our matrix a, and then solve a large under-determined system, and by the way"
last time in class.
"We solved the large under number of systems in four ways, okay?"
"And we found out by the way that zero inverse looked like, a lot like the"
"l2 optimization, so really we're going to solve it in three ways today."
"Alright, so"
let's come back to our code.
And we first do this.
"Alright, the first thing I'm going to do, is going to take the discrete cosine transform, of the indentity matrix."
"I'm going to map out for every point that's On in the signal, suppose I have a point."
"I figure out, if I have, if I have this signal of 5000 points and I have one point on, I find okay, what would that correspond to?What, how would I discreet cosign transform that point?"
What if the next point were on?
How would I discreet cosign transform that?
"So in some sense, I build up my basis, my way of transforming, so, so essentially right?"
"What's going to happen here, is i'm building up this."
"So I this big matrix that gets me from the signal space to the Fourier space, okay?"
"Okay, and so if I have, if I think about sampling, if I sample with one, zero, zero, zero, zeroes, zero one, zero, I can start thinking about how, what's the connection between these two?"
Okay.
"Yeah, exactly, 5,000 delta functions, as it were."
And seeing what the response is.
"And then what I would do with this, is say, okay great, I've done that."
"And now what I'm going to do, is I'm going to take the 500 that matter."
"In ot her words, I have said, let's sample at 500 different points."
"Well, how would those 500 different points, essentially generate cosined [UNKNOWN]"
DCT components.
There it is.
And that's my matrix a.
This is equivalent to my times psi [UNKNOWN].
This one will take a little meditation time.
Meditate upon it.
Maybe burn some incense.
"Let's say that I have a 5-Newton force, and its moment arm distance is 4."
The distance is equal to 4.
That's enough for that side.
And let's say I have a I'm going to switch colors.
"Actually, no, I'm going to keep it all the same color and then we'll use colors to differentiate between clockwise and counterclockwise so I don't bungle everything up again."
So let's say I have a 10-Newton force here.
"And, of course, these vectors aren't proportional to actually what I drew."
50 Newtons would be huge if these were the actual vectors.
And let's say that that moment arm distance is 3.
Let me do a couple more.
And let's say I have a moment arm distance of 8.
"I have a clockwise force of 20 Newtons, And let's say at a distance of 10 again, so distance is equal to 10, I have my mystery force."
It's going to act in a counterclockwise direction and
I want to know what it needs to be.
"So whenever you do any of these moment of force problems, and you say, well, what does the force need to be in order for this see saw to not rotate?"
"You just say, well, all the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments, So clockwise moments equal counterclockwise."
I'll do them in different colors.
So what are all the clockwise moments?
"Well, clockwise is this direction, right?"
That's the way a clock goes.
"So this is clockwise, that is clockwise."
I want to go in this direction.
And so this is clockwise.
What are all the clockwise moments?
It's 10 Newtons times its moment arm distance 10.
"So 10 times 10 plus 5 Newtons times this moment arm distance 4, plus 5 times 4, plus 20 Newtons times its moment arm distance of 8, plus 20 times 8, and that's going to equal the counterclockwise moments, and so the leftover ones are counterclockwise."
"So we have 50 Newtons acting downward here, and that's counterclockwise, and it's at a distance of 8 from the moment arm, so 50 times 8."
"Let's see, we don't have any other counterclockwise on that side."
"This is counterclockwise, right?"
"We have 10 Newtons acting in the counterclockwise direction, and its moment arm distance is 3, plus 10 times 3, and we're assuming our mystery force, which is at a distance of 10, is also counterclockwise, plus force times 10."
And now we simplify.
And I'll just go to a neutral color because this is just math now.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
Welcome to Boston Aikikai.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TACClOLl:
Here we are in Chinatown.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
The dojo itself started in July 2010.
"So, when the group started then, we were in the basement of the community center in Roslindale."
"Then, we moved to Chinatown, where we've been for the past two years."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;PARKER:
"But no matter what, you know how there's a saying, ""home is where the heart is?"" That's like what I feel about our dojo."
"It doesn't matter, like, where we are -- it's the people in it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;EBATA:"
"For the new dojo, it means more time."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TAClOLl:
Keep learning with Vu Ha Sensei and the rest of the students.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
People who enjoy or love aikido or martial arts can come together in their own space and kind of... be with other people who have the same kind of passion or enjoyment of that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;GONGVATANA:
"I think at some point, you know, there's not going to be any more dust and we won't have to wear a mask while practicing."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TAWA:
Just to train every day.
That's something that I've wanted to do for a long time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
"Now we have an opportunity to have our own space, which is what we're trying to work on."
"This is our project, getting this new space."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;PERRlNS:
"I like having a dedicated space, where we have the freedom to practice outside of scheduled classes."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
"Boston Aikikai is made up of members: we might have a nice space and all, but the dojo is the people who come and practice."
Then we released the video showing the slaying of two Reuters journalists and 18 other people in Baghdad.
"And that application was canceled for what judges, two judges involved tell us is for political reasons."
So it really is important to have a diverse funding base that is built around the interests of people and not organizations that are busy in power plays.
"I'm sorry, and your first question was...?"
"If you see your example, you're setting an example that more media put more resources into investigative reporting from war zones."
You mention the example of Sy Hersh and the My Lai Massacre.
"I spoke to Sy Hersh about this last year and, while many people have heard of the My Lai Massacre as the sort of archetypical example of abuse exposed in Viet Nam, what people probably don't know is that Sy Hersh couldn't get that story out, that he wrote, submitted it to the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc. and it was not accepted."
Rachel and Clare Wallmeyer are identical twins.
"They were beautiful, bright, straight A students."
"Then, when they were 14, suddenly their perfect world collapsed."
"Kilo by kilo, the twins began wasting away."
"And for the next 20 years, they'd struggled with a deadly disease."
One that affects thousands of Australian teenagers - Anorexia.
Now the twins are 34 and they are literally just skin and bones.
"They still live together, still share everything including, tragically, a death wish."
"Quite simply, they've given up on life."
"Thank goodness, not everyone has given up on them."
"Identical twins, Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer are running out of time."
Their lives have been ruined by anorexia and now they are literally starving themselves to death.
"""We are living, solely, [for] anorexia."
It's a horror.
"We live to die."""
"""It's been a constant pain to wake up everyday and not being able to get out of bed."
We're so tired.
"Everything's a struggle and there's no point."""
Rachel and Clare run to lose weight.
"This obsessive training is all part of their illness, an illness they've been fighting for 20 years."
Interviewer:
"""Rachel, how much do you weigh?"""
Rachel:
"""About 32 and a half kilos."""
Interviewer:
They used to dream  about cacao beans all night and talk about them all day.
"You had only to mention the word ""cacao""  to an Oompa-Loompa and he would start dribbling  at the mouth."""
Listen closely:
"""The cacao bean,""  Mr Wonka continued,"
"""which grows on the cacao tree, is the thing that all chocolate is made from."""
"Roald Dahl knew,  and it was in the book, the great book  ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
Remember the Oompa Loompas.
This is an elf with a cacao pod but the sculpture is 3000 years old.
It is intrinsic to the magic of chocolate.
"In Mexico, this is where the great cuisine was innovated, it was always served as a drink,  but today we have blenders."
It makes it so much easier.
"You can upgrade your smoothie, your protein shake  by adding a dash of raw cacao and bringing forth the magic and wonder, just as they did in Ancient Mexico."
"On the Mexican 100 peso note,  if you look closely, right there next to Xochipilli are actual cacao recipes, iconically represented."
"We've innovated and brought forth now  an entirely new cuisine, brought to the greatest chefs  in the world, revive some of the great additives  of chocolate, creating these wonderful  and delightful recipes."
"The one question that I get more than any other, after all of this is:"
Is it possible to o.d. on chocolate? and the answer is:
Yes.
Thank you so much.
I am David Wolfe.
Have the best day ever.
We continue our Education in America series this morning with one man who is turning the learning process upside down.
"In his series of really simple videos, it's being called revolutionary, as CBS News correspondent"
John Blackstone reports:
It would be music to the ears of any educator what ten-year old Megan Tsern has to say about her favorite teacher.
He makes math really easy in a really kind of conversational way.
He is Salman Khan.
Negative seven dollars?
It's like saying that
I own seven dollars!
"Khan is the voice and the brain behind the Khan Academy, the free educational website that some believe is leading a revolution in teaching!"
"There's no nonsense, no defocusing on the material."
It really is what it is.
(music)
Charlie says that helping youth learn skills is a source of pride and inspiration.
"Maybe not so much for his grandson, Andrew."
But for other local champs like Billy Bugenig it just might be.
I worked with him on some ranches when I was growing up.
He taught me a lot.
He always knew the way the cattle were going to move.
I learned a lot by watching him.
I met Charlie at a really young age when I was just learning how to rope.
You knew that every time you went and you roped with Charlie you had a chance to win.
When I started team roping and stuff when
"I got into high school, he was always there to help and he was always someone that I looked up to because he knew how to do everything."
And I always enjoyed and still to this day would rope with Charlie any time or anywhere he wanted to.
Champs.
"Those kids, I tell you."
They're good.
"Ya, he still should have a good shot."
He's always able to catch something.
What we're gonna do is to look at the difference between cooking with the regular old-fashioned range and an induction cooktop.
So what we're gonna do today is focus on what happens when you cook it on a regular conventional range.
"What we've got is a GE (if you want to show that, Honey)"
We've got a GE range that's maybe three years old.
"And it has this glass cooktop, which we're told is about as efficient as the old-fashioned kind with the radiant elements."
"So I'm just going to pull our Lodge cast iron skillet out of the cabinet, put it on this main eye that we use, and I'm going to set it on a range from zero to (I guess) an imputed 10 because it's like 2-4-6-8-high,"
I'm going to set it on 8.
And you can see here what's happening here is as the element heats up it's going to heat up that skillet.
But it heats it up very slowly.
"Now I'm going to get some olive oil, which we use when we're cooking our eggs."
"What we're cooking is a frled egg for Amanda and a scrambled egg for me, with a little bit of veggies and some cheese in it."
We'll get that ready for Amanda's egg.
[Cabinet door closes]
"Oh, and I didn't notice when I turned it on; it's probably been on now for maybe 15-20 seconds (Note: actually about 45 seconds)"
What's 0.5 times 0.03?
"I'll do it down here just because multiplying decimals seems to be a problem for a lot of people, including myself, many times."
"So what you do, you just multiply the numbers."
5 times 03 or 5 times 3 is 15.
"And then, how many points do we have behind the decimal?"
How many digits behind the decimal?
Let's see.
"We have 1, 2, 3."
"So 1, 2, 3."
We have to add the 0 because we need three spaces behind the decimal point.
So we get the force is equal to 0.015 kilogram meters per second squared.
And this is a Newton.
So the force is equal to 0.015 Newtons.
Let's do another problem.
"And this one's going to be-- and actually, I think you'll find most of the difficult Newton's laws problems or force problems, they're just some combination of making sure you get the units right when we're talking about in one dimension."
"The difficult part is usually getting the units right or just the math, just the algebra."
So if you have trouble with this it's usually because you have to just brush up a little bit on the algebra.
The physics itself is just force equals mass times acceleration as we will see in this problem.
"So let's say that when I apply some force, some particular force, I use this little 0 here."
So I call that force F sub 0.
So this means a particular force.
This is some value.
"When I apply that force to some mass, let's call that m sub 0, I get some acceleration."
I get acceleration a sub 0.
We could've put numbers here.
"We could've said, well, if I apply a force of 10 Newtons to a mass of-- I don't know-- to a mass of let's say 2 kilograms, I have an acceleration of 5 meters per second squared."
But I'm just doing this because this could be any relationship.
"And let's say the problem tells us that when I put another mass with this first mass, so let's say that, you know-- let me draw this diagram."
"So here's my mass, m sub 0."
"When I apply a force of f sub 0 to it, I get an acceleration of a sub 0."
Now the problem tell us when I add another mass-- so let's says I stack it up and we're like in an ice skating ring or something.
"And I stack another mass up here, and let's call this mass m1."
She said that Father Moore had suggested she stop taking the drug.
"And what, in your medical opinion... ...was the result of Father Moore's suggestion?"
I believe Father Moore's suggestion killed her.
"Objection, Your Honor!"
The witness is asserting outrageous conclusions based on pure hearsay.
"Technically correct, but I'll allow it as part of his expert opinion testimony."
"Thank you, Dr. Mueller."
Your witness.
You said you observed a possible epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.
Doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
"Yes, that's also possible."
"Would Father Moore's advice to stop taking Gambutrol be good advice... ...if Emily were, in fact, not epileptic?"
Of course.
But that's not the case here.
She was epileptic.
Really.
When Emily saw objects move on their own... ...and felt an invisible presence on top of her... ...was she experiencing symptoms typical of epilepsy?
"Not typical, no."
Are they typical indications of any other conditions?
"- Say, for example, psychosis?"
"- Yes, I would say that's correct."
But isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
"- Yes, in my..."
- So aren't you selectively choosing... ...what parts of Emily's experiences fit your epilepsy diagnosis... ...while ignoring those which indicate something else?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.
No further questions.
We have to work fast.
They're only giving me an hour with you tonight.
Listen.
"Before we get started, there's something I have to tell you... ...something I should've said to you before I let you take the case."
The embarrassing thing here was that I was prepped to answer this question.
"Well I think just to, I'm sure there are bigger ideas than this, just to stick with the subject I would hope that even though I don't see this in purely generational terms, I would hope that parents begin to realize that handing your kids constantly inundating them with new technologies and giving them motivation to be interrupted all the time and to inundate themselves with information has to be balanced by encouraging them to be attentive, to read, to back away from the technology and to back away from there friends sometimes, and like you said collaboration and conversation is great, but there is a role in the world for solitude and I think that we should encourage our kids and ourselves to practice that as well."
Peter Norvig:
Ok (People Clapping)
So thank you to Nicholas Carr for sharing your incite and vision with us tonight.
This meeting from the common
"Perez, thank you for your kind words as well as sharing my latest Old Spice commercial with your readers"
Receiving accolades from you was truly an honour
"If I were to create a metaphor of blogs using mountains, your blog would be the mighty Everest, sitting on top of a skyscraper"
"And that skyscraper would be sitting on top of one of those rolling library ladders used to reach really, really high shelves"
"And on top of that wildly high ladder mountain, would be the mightiest of falcons, wearing an oxygen mask and flying at an impossibly high altitude"
And this falcon would represent your generous and flattering comments about me and on that falcon's head would be a top hat because top hats are for gentlemen
"Gentlemen like you, Perez."
I thank you.

Okay.
So you've talked a little bit about the benefit to the students.
Tell me a little bit about the actual scientific research program that you're doing with this grant.
Win Phippen:
Okay.
"As you know, here in illinois, we produce a lot of corn and soybeans during the summer months."
"But the rest of the year, the fields set empty."
"And so, some researchers over at the USDA over in Peoria have come across this crop that allows us to plant in the late fall, after corn comes out."
And it actually grows throughout the winter months.
"It gives us field coverage, so we don't get a lot of erosion in the fields during the winter months."
Beth Seaton:
"So it's good for the field, too?"
Win Phippen:
It's excellent.
So not only is off-season production but it also gives benefits back to the field for growing corn and soybeans.
Beth Seaton:
So when do you harvest this pennycress?
Win Phippen:
"We plant it in late fall, and then, sometime, in late May, typically, by the first of June, is when you would harvest this plant."
"And that allows you to then plant your soybeans right behind it, and there is no impact, then, on the soybeans."
So they can get a full season of soybeans.
"But what they are benefitting is, they have produced all that pennycress."
And why pennycress is being looked at...
"As you can see, it's a fairly oil-seed crop."
It has a lot of oil.
It's about 40 percent oil.
And so the intent of this is simply to help displace a lot of petroleum-based products.
"And that could be fuel, so this simply could be crushed, to get out the oil, to make a bio-diesel product."
"Or you can take this seed and add it to, let's say, plastics, and other, sort of, petroleum-based products. it's not going to alleviate us completely from the dependency on foreign oil, but it is certainly a step in the right direction."
Beth Seaton:
It sounds like an exciting research program for Western.
Win Phippen:
"One day I was recommended a book written by an American (then was not none), named ""the shack"" (the refuge)."
I do not regret not having it published.
"Has been very successful, lots of publicity, and ..."
Q: don't you regret?
A: absolutely not.
"Q: does not earn much money, you don't have an actual team, you're not popular, sell little, why continue?"
"A: because my definition of success is different, our success is guaranteed because in Christ are blessed."
"Many colleagues have started at the same time our and have already given up, because they have earned as they wanted."
"Of course, I want to give the best to my family, but what about the great success, I believe that we have already."
"Because when we see God's hand at work, I am the first to be blessed and happy, I and my whole team."
Q:
So you believe that God will rejoice at what you are doing?
A:
Yes.
"Many times when I lose myself moods,"
"I know that God is happy to me, and therefore makes me feel its presence in continuation."
"Q: isn't always of great comfort, however your economic life, with your wife, but God there is always arguing."
Q:
"If one day you Strait lacked necessary, what would you do?"
"What would you think about the project ""harvest time"""
Rimangeresti you all?
A:
"No, absolutely not."
"Would not ever, because it is always a great joy to know that God is with me."
"We try to remain simpler as possible, we do not use branded clothing and other luxury items, since it would be so far from our reality."
"We don't need these things to have joy, we have the Lord and we are already super pleased."
"Look, I'm not preaching a false moralism, we are truly thankful for what God has given us!"
"And in the little things, like an outing at mcdonald 's, we're more than happy."
"Q: what message do you want to leave it to those who want to sell Christian books with only the intent to earn a lot of money, success and fame?"
A: do you want to earn money?
Go to sell chewing gum!
"Who or what do you aggrapperesti then in moments of crisis, eh?"
That appeal attracts people all over the world.
Economic growth in Asia is due to millions of families wanting to give their children a better life.
"The TV series ""Home to the Village"" shows the cruelty of urbanization."
It's not fun to move from a rural community to a tenement house.
In China rice growers get silicosis working in stone processing plants.
"Becoming an industrial worker is not a beautiful thing, you'll agree."
We build dams that flood valleys.
But what is the alternative?
"It's living in the countryside and having six kids, of whom two die."
"The population doubles in a generation, there's war and misery."
But the path of development that's available is not pretty.
And of course we have the impending climate threat.
The US ambassador made a statement in a Swedish national paper that:
"""The climate issue cannot be solved without regulating India and China."""
Scandalous!
He's crazy.
"China emits 3 tons of CO2 per capita, the US 21 tons."
He shouldn't talk until the US cuts emissions to 10 tons per capita.
The United States needs to halve its energy consumption.
Where does your great dedication come from?
It's really fun to work with what I do.
My interest in the world developed into curiosity as to why this shouldn't work.
Why is Malaysia free from malaria?
"Why does Singapore, a tropical marsh on the equator have the world's best health?"
They did welfare investments.
"They had children's health centers, got rid of drugs..."
They created good social development.
People tend to say I paint the world in excessively rosy colors.
But I don't.
Ten million children die each year in the world.
But you have to see the improvements even if huge problems remain.
You have to see the risk of climate change and still say that not many people are dying of it yet.
"I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification."
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
"You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow."
And that's pretty cool.
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
(Laughter)
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
"You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic."
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
"A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens."
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
(Laughter)
"A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,"
"Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms."
"And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail."
The algae are more efficient. &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well you're getting at it.
"They are more efficient, but they're more efficient in a particular sense that makes a big difference to rates."
Okay?
This is the difference--this is a still photo and this is a movie.
Okay?
So there's--that's the difference.
It's a difference in rate.
Yes?
Student:
Algae reproduce a lot faster.
Prof:
"That's basically it, yes."
"A single celled alga can probably have two generations per day and-- at least one per day--and maybe even in a warm estuary three per day, whereas a grass is probably going to be lucky to get through two or three generations per season."
Okay?
So there's a difference of perhaps a hundredfold in the rate.
"And the things that are eating them have a much, much longer lifespan."
"So down here what's going on is that the algae, there are not so many of them, but they're cranking over like crazy, and they're getting harvested"
like crazy by all of the planktivores in the ocean.
"So the krill, the copepods, everything that eats algae, is grazing them, and that's keeping the algae at a fairly low level."
They're a long away from their own carrying capacity.
They're in exponential growth rate almost all the time.
"So they're booming along, and it doesn't take so much standing crop to maintain a lot more biomass because they are turning over and reproducing and multiplying so quickly."
So that is why you see this dramatic shift.
"Okay, so that's a bit of the overall description of the world's ecosystems."
Now let's take a look at cycles of matter.
Okay?
"The main compartments are oceans, fresh water,"
"land and atmosphere, and they are exchanging materials all the time."
You're already familiar with the upwelling patterns;
I've mentioned that when I was discussing the Coriolis force.
Elisabeth:
"Then he's in a bit of a pickle, isn't he?"
Joy:
Let's leave his pickly out of this.
[laughter]
David:
"I've been fortunate enough that the people I've been in relationships with have been respectful and also we talk about it, we communicate if you openly communicate about what's going on then it gives a space to work it out."
That's what's important.
Elisabeth:
Thank you for being as candid as you have been today.
I know a lot of people feel the same way you feel.
"All right, thanks to David Jay."
"If you want to learn more about asexuality,"
David will be seen in an upcoming segment on 20/20.
We'll be right back.
"Well, when we took that break, Brian, you mentioned that you had some special guests once, that you met the..."
We were with the 130 at the time
"We were supporting the Antarctic ... and the astronauts, the navy was the recover for them, like the mercury astronauts, primarily."
"But the Air Force, we train crews and we were all over the world, and I ended up ... in which I'd been to a couple of times."
"We covered between South America and Africa and then we had them in Singapore, we had them in..."
I'd been to Greenland a couple times and I didn't want to go to Antarctica.
"I had a choice of either going with the astronaut recovery or that, so I volunteered, and we..."
"There was another guy, too, who did most of..."
"And then, at the last minute, we'd bring in the guys that would take the other airplanes."
So I was down to... in Florida for probably a month.
And we take the
Air Force paramedics out.
We take a dummy capsule a couple hundred miles out.
We'd go find it and dress these guys - put their scuba gear and stuff on them - and they'd jump out and then I'd sit in the tailgate of the back of the truck of the one-thirty.
With the flotation collar that went around it.
"Too small, little one man or two man rafts"
"There'd be tools, and a medical kit, and food and stuff."
Those would be things like...
Our release engineer at the time had the keys to the server room where the Mozilla machines operated.
"These are small details but they were really important at the time and we knew that if he could do it he would help us keep Mozilla operating and we knew that Chofmann was running the engineering organisation and we knew that he would be helpful as it turned out, we needed him."
And Marcia had the keys to the closet that was our single supply of Mozilla t-shirts.
Which I bought with my own money.
"Oh, no."
"That was later, nevermind."
The ones I bought later.
But she had that key and she had access to some other things.
"So we would sit and think how many machines do we need, how many employees do we need."
"If we have one employee, is it Leef who runs the build machines?"
"If we have one employee, is it Brendan?"
Who is he?
And what's the best way to keep Mozilla operating?
But when it came to it I was the only one who was fired and so the rest of the Mozilla folks were left and Chofmann provided a haven for us to try and continue to be effective as well.
So this was this first era.
"So after I was fired there were a bunch of people still at Netscape, working on Netscape navigator."
As part of that we finally managed to ship our first product as Mozilla.
Mozilla 1.0 we called it.
And this had been a long time in coming.
That was in 2002.
We started Mozilla in 1998 and expected to have a product very shortly afterwards.
"But it turned out, when we got into it that the technology was pretty old."
Brendan made the decision to really build the new technology base.
That technology base is Gecko.
It cost us years to get the rendering engine to a point where we could really build a good application on it and ship it.
We finally did that in 2002.
It was Mozilla 1.0 and it was technically a good product.
It was technically a shockingly good product.
"Across the open source space, where people knew it they were retelling us they were really shocked to how good a product it was."
But it was not a consumer product.
"It was really built by developers, for developers."
"This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday, but it had a certain familiarity to it."
"And I said, ""Well, what exactly is the process?"""
"And they said, ""The band is applied to the tail, tightly."
"And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly."
Blood flow is slowly retarded; a week later the parts in question fall off.
"""Great -- got it."""
"OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it."
"I also call PETA, just for fun, and they don't like it -- but they confirm it."
"OK, that's basically how you do it."
So the next day I go out.
"And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built, and we go about the business of animal husbandry."
Melanie is the wife of Albert.
Albert is the shepherd in question.
"Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left."
"Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up."
Alright.
Great.
"Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around."
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.
"Being an apprentice, you know, you do that."
"Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife."
"And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know."
"And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very -- it was, it was impressive."
"In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb, and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding."
"A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp."
"And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip."
"Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?"
"He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder, and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward, and then his head dips down, obscuring my view, but what I hear is a slurping sound, and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding."
Can we roll the video?
No I'm kidding -- we don't -- (Laughter)
I thought it best to talk in pictures.
"So, I do something now I've never ever done on a ""Dirty Jobs"" shoot, ever."
Now Mister Morton is happy and Pearl and the cat are too.
"They're the subjects of the sentence and what the predicate says, they do."
Are you a hardworking artist?
I think I'm a hardworker but at the sametime I'm lazy.
"I usually wake up, get rest, watch tv, do nothing."
Then in few hours I can work more than enough and finish everything.
I can't say that it's racked my brain
"Well there must be something, it's all done by yourself, but I'm sure it's also improvised."
There's not a certain subject nor story.
These are not message giving drawings.
Usually there's a main subject.
"Not in all, but some of them"
"Some are very simple ideas, and some are about very personal things that even I might be embarresed to tell."
I usually think how to deformate an idea onto the drawing.
"For example it can be read from this side, and if we look at it from this side, it can be something completely different."
I try to take an idea in this way as well.
"while trying to draw for example a house or a castle, there are several technics, academical or perspective..."
"For example, here the castle can symbolise a room but I don't think what symbolizes the room."
I have fun when it becomes something different with the free angle.
It's like I make some rules and actually I play a game.
Colors.. .
I have my own color restrictions and I don't pay attention to do them at the same time or to let them be in an harmony.
"As I said before, between the years 2007 and 2008,"
"I've been in a period of searching and all these pictures came out afterall, which made me really happy."
"If a pshycologist would come and see these drawings, he or she might evaluate, analyse and say something about them."
"And the result might show the truth about me, but I don't think about it too much,"
"I only try to keep myself in a positive way, self-enclosed."
Since few years I've been reading William S. Burroughs and interested in Beat Literature...
"Lately he has written the book called ""My Education"" where he talks about his dreams."
"I read it sometimes, it became one of my favorites..."
The name of this exhibition comes likely from there.
"Actually there are less handwritings than my past works, and signutares are bigger."
So whatever that number divided by 2.
"So the pulley itself, the acceleration of the pulley is half of this number, which is 1.59 meters per second squared to the right."
"I know this was a fairly difficult problem and the key realizations though, I think that you had to discover or realize in order to be able to do this was a couple of things."
"One, that the acceleration of this pulley is half the acceleration of the block, or the acceleration of the block is double the acceleration of the pulley."
You have to realize that.
And then you just have to work out the net horizontal forces and realize well the only thing pulling on this block is friction going backwards and tension of the rope to the right.
And that same tension of the rope is constant throughout this wire or through this rope.
"And on this pulley, and this might not be something that you had already realized about pulleys, but now you will, is that since the rope essentially goes around the pulley, it's pulling twice on the pulley."
"And the tension's constant, so it's pulling with a tension of"
T on the top and the bottom.
"And if you realized those things, then it's just a"
little bit of algebra to get the acceleration of the block and the acceleration of the pulley.
"Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse you too much."
I would call this a five star problem if you would see this type of problem on physics competitions.
"So if you know how to do this, you're doing well, at least as far as tension and ropes and friction are concerned."
I'll see you in the next video.

"So, if you look at this graph."
This is how much health care is growing projected based upon the growth in the past and you can see sixteen percent in 27 going up in nearly 50 percent in 75 years.
Now we're not going to get the 50%.
We have a major crisis before we got there but you can see what impact the growth of Medicare and Medicaid are having.
Medicaid roughly and this is before healthcare reform.
But Medicare huge increase over that time and will get a wide that it is shortly 2009 and 2010.
Just one year.
"That's the year, the year for which we have the latest data that arise 300 billion, 200 billion, 100 billion, 50, billion, 25 billion."
"Now this is all health care spending, not just government."
"So, we got a tag 200 billion, 200 billion."
"You guys are a little more pessimistic, I already, I must have scared you, it's a 100 billion."
A 100 billion dollars change in one year.
"Now again, you are not used to thinking about billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars but a 100 billion dollars, that's how much it's costing us to expand health care to everyone."
Per year.
"So, if we could hold health, healthcare inflation and zero for one year, we could pay for the expansion in the healthcare system."
Think about $100 billion in almost any other context that you know of.
Right?
It's a huge amount of money.
"It's $300 for every woman, man, woman, and child in the United States."
We're talking about the payroll tax and all of that.
That's less than this level of inflation.
Benefit to a family of four of changing that payroll tax is less than just one year increased in health care cost.
"Here, you have from 1960, 147 this is for the per cap of spending so it's controlled for the growth and the population."
1968 was spending $147.
Now it is true this is nominal so.
"Up to, in 2009, $8000 per person."
"Again, a phenomenal and then if you look over the decade of the 2000s, you can see going from 5200 to 8000."
60 percent increase in spending.
This is the change in.
"Each decade comparing in the green bar, the growth in the GDP and the growth in the health care, NHE stands for National Health Expenditures, right?"
"First thing you can see is every year, every decade."
Healthcare expenditures exceed the growth and GDP.

Hi My name is Colleen Hall-Patton and I am your teacher/faciliator for this semester.
I thought that you should probably have some idea who you're dealing with not all of these are going to be video recordings but we will start with this so you at least have some idea who I am.
A little bit of background about me to begin with is I have a PH.D. in Sociology from UNLV in 2004 took me ten years to do that so those of you on the long track on this I empathize.
A Bachelors and Masters Degree in Anthropology and so I take kind of a more world view of things and across cultural sort of view on stuff.
I have been teaching Women's Studies at UNLV since 1999 while I was still a graduate student and I think in Women's Studies especially it is important to know the placement of where you are or a person is in various hierarchies.
So here's mine.
I am came of age in the 1970's at kind of the height of optimism on changes on the second women's movement.
I am married had been for 35 years.
Which I don't think I am old enough to be married that long but there it is.
Two kids who are both young adults. and I had a 25 year career in Information Technology and switched over to teaching full time in 2003.
So that's kind of a background of where we are on this.
"In terms of the class, the class is organized in modules 1 for each week and our book has 13 chapters so we've got 13 chapters over 15 weeks."
"In this we have a life time of experience doing gender, race, class, ability even though we may not recognize that we do and of course our experiences are all unique."
Recommendations for this class is stay on top of the work.
"Do the work for the week in the week, contribute to the discussions that's going to our primary place of talking to each other."
I will be in out of them as well.
You learn through participation.
You learn from the other students.
To find out why Sarah Lee is suddenly tongue tied in class the school's resource teacher takes her to see speech and language specialist Donna
Orloff.
I'm going to read a sentence to you.
Orloff starts by testing Sarah Lee's basic language skills.
Look at some pictures and you can start up here at A.
"Lion, horse, mouse."
She has very good language for single words.
"She knows a lot of labels, a lot of nouns."
And she uses them and she understands them.
But there are other words that were associated-- not the direct label-- but associated with the pictures.
And that posed difficulty for her.
Perfect.
Point to swine.
So we get to swine.
She had no idea what swine is.
She's heard it.
She's heard it from reading Charlotte's Web.
But she doesn't have that rich storage system that enables her to tap the vocabulary and to retrieve the words that she needs.
"Our brains are basically a very complex storage and retrieval system where every piece of information that comes in to you, you put it someplace so that you can refer to it later on."
"If you see a Saint Bernard walking down the street, your retrieval system goes to your storage system, pulls out all of the note cards that it has on dogs, go through it until it finds Saint Bernard, and says, oh"
"look, there's a Saint Bernard."
All this happens in a millisecond.
And then you take that card and put it back where it belongs so when you need it next time you can find it.
The problem with these kids is that the storage and retrieval systems are very complicated and generally very confused.
So they will go and take the card out and then put it back in the wrong place.
"That ability to make mental connections, to go from one file drawer to the next also affects the way kids think abstractly."
"A student talking about a trip says, it's still up in the air."
Probably he's talking about a trip going around the world.
This is the child who only sees the picture of the pig is the pig.
The picture of the train is the train.
"If it's up in the air, he's got to be on an airplane."
"Language is never that one to one, rigid, concrete correlation."
Google are among the big donors that have allowed the Khan Academy to add nearly a dozen software engineers.
It's really smartly done on the computer.
And I love being on the computer!
"With more than 2,000,000 users a month, many others seem to love Khan's lesssons, too!"
"I've already taught 70,000,000 lessons!"
And he will be happy to teach millions more.

"Mountainview, California."
We launched our own Open Culture Data competition in June 2012... ...after the succes of winning the Apps for the Netherlands competition.
We set up our own competition with three goals for developers.
"Firstly, use Open Culture Data to increase the audience reach and use of this data - online, offline and on site."
"Secondly, connect different datasets."
"Many of are separated, even though they have related information."
"Thirdly, make innovative new apps or websites with Open Culture Data."
There were four awards for the developers... ...three Open Culture Data prizes and one special Dutch National Archives prize.
"We promoted... ...the competition during two large-scale hackathons in June and October, and a smaller one in December... ...and by giving presentations at developer gatherings and at conferences."
"The competition closed on December 31, 2012."
And on 1 January it turned out 27 apps were submitted for the competition.
The Open Culture Data award ceremony took place in January.
The jury consisting of a mix of heritage professionals and copyright specialists chose the four winners.
The winner was the Muse app by No strings.
It's an iPad app in which you can rearrange parts of paintings to make a new artwork.
The second prize went to Histagram by Richard Jong of Frontwise.
On this website you can personalize press photos of the Dutch National Archives and send them to friends.
Bronze was won by SimMuseum by Hay Kranen.
In this game you are a museum director and can trade artworks with other museums.
The Dutch National Archives award was won by Tijdbalk.nl from Arjan den Boer.
With this app you can make your own timeline by combining different data sources on the same subject.
My drive to use open source and open cultural data is that it forces you to think outside the box.
You open up to the unexpected by letting others in on your projects.
If you work closed source you stay on your own island.
"As the market for short stories disappeared, the market for science fiction novels began to grow and so there was this change of the short story as the"
"Epitome of science fiction, to the novel as the epitome of science fiction."
The Martian Chronicles is a hinge.
It's the first great science fiction novel.
"Although science fiction writers thought of it as fantasy, and were annoyed that Bradbury got this agilation to leap from the ghetto into the general consciousness, and it was, in fact, a book that got read as a book."
It was not just a fix up.
"It was, in fact, a composite novel."
We can see that if we take a look at the ways in which the stories changed from their original publication to the publication in the novel.
Bradbury bridges the publishing history from before the 1950's to after the 1950's.
"The Martian Chronicles is not only a wonderful work of literature, it is a milestone in the development of American culture."
The Valley of Tanayiku
"In Cou, 'Tanayiku' means ""A Place without Sorrow""."
"So, what does happiness mean in this Sans Souci?"
The happiest part for me is to work together with my people from the same tribe.
It's such a delight!
There was no way for me to co-work with my people before when I was working in other places
What are we working for?
For Tanayiku.
For all the community.
"It's such a pleasure, such a delight!"
That's it.
"Oh, I'm almost crying......"
The happiest thing for me is to get all of us together.
"Recovering from the typhoon disaster gradually,"
This is what makes me so happy.
Also I've learnt a lot from this place.
"For example, the interpersonal relationship"
"And also the working attitude, which is very important"
"Whenever I help my customers, I feel very happy."
"Although sometimes they complain to us, we still try our best to reply to their complaint nicely."
I have to work with pleasure everyday.
Because sometimes the visitors want to take a picture with me.
"A food that's archetypically connected with winning the golden ticket, that's connected with prosperity."
"I was taken on a rocket ride across the universe in a voyage of discovery  that has brought me right to you at this present moment, right now."
"This food is filled  with legends and lore, which I summarized along with scientific data and recipe information and all kinds of great stuff in my book ""Naked chocolate,"" which became the sourcebook  or a reference book for people who are interested in raw chocolate, because all the chocolate we've ever had has been processed through high heat and machines."
"And we thought,  maybe we should just eat it cold processed -- is there a difference."
And that's we're gonna explore here as we delve into the astonishing truth about the world's greatest food.
Chocolate comes from the Mayan lands  and ancient Mayan farms.
Chocolate is a Mayan word.
"The word ""cacao"" is one of the oldest words in use in the world today."
"Some people estimate that  that word is 15,000 years old."
The oldest word in the world.
It was brought to the West  and brought to you by Hernando Cortez.
He was the conqueror of Mexico.
"It all happened by an accident, because Montezuma,  who was the leader of Mexico at that time, was in a state of civil war in Mexico City."
"And when Cortez showed up there  in 1521, there was -- they believe that"
Cuauhtémoc himself had come to the great city.
"Christopher Columbus,  when he first spotted cacao he thought it was almond."
And this was money for them.
This is what their currency was.
Today we use coins.
Then they used cacao.
It was their money.
And he saw -- somebody dropped some cacao beans on a little boat.
And they all jumped for it.
Columbus wrote that these people  are crazy about almond.
Montezuma was known to drink  50 cups of chocolate a day.
It was always consumed as a drink.
"And there you see the cup that Montezuma was known to drink out of, or one that's similar to that."
"Anyway, how do you turn this bean,  this nut, into a drink?"
"Well, you'll have to break it open, and eventually get all of those cacao beans into a beverage,  which we'll see later."
"But before we do that, we've gotta look at where  the chocolate comes from."
This is the chocolate tree.
"And yes, money does grow on trees."
But rats have incredible survival skills.
They can chew through cinder blocks... squeeze through spaces the size of a quarter... survive a fall of 50 feet... swim over a mile... and tread water for three days.
"One pair can potentially produce 15,000 descendants a year!"
Rats don't have many friends... possibly because they go where we go.
Rats are bad for the health.
"In the last 1,000 years, diseases carried by rats have killed more people than all of the world's wars and revolutions combined."
And there's every chance rats will survive
long after we've been wiped off the face of the planet.
Nuclear holocaust.
But rats can survive.
Eniwetok Atoll.
A string of tiny islands in the Pacific Ocean.
It was a tropical paradise for rats.
Until the U.S. military arrived.
"Between 1946 and 1958, 40 nuclear bombs were detonated on Eniwetok Atoll."
The largest explosion carved a mile-wide crater in the coral reef.
MAN:
It is now 30 seconds to zero time.
Put on goggles or turn away.
"Minus ten seconds, niner, eight, seven, six, fiver, four, three, two, one, T zero."
NARRATOR:
The destructive power of the test was roughly 800 times larger than the explosion in Hiroshima.
It seemed the island was wiped clean of life...
but not of rats.
"Shielded from the blast inside cable tunnels or under concrete, they emerged into the apocalypse."
"Two years later, scientists found the rat population had not only survived... but thrived."
They'd scavenged food on the beach and supplemented their diet with a little cannibalism.
"The rats appear healthy, normal animals."
But nobody's quite sure what mutations may have been caused by exposure to so much radiation.
All life needs water.
Southern Africa is ravaged by droughts.
Most fish die.
You gotta miss me though
Let's turn his room into a gym
We ain't putting no gym in my media room.
Who's media room?
Our media room
"Okay, US health care cost."
"In 2010 which is the last year for which we have reliable data, we're two years behind on these data."
"We spent, the United States spent 2.6 trillion dollars on health care."
"Now, I have gone through lots and lots and"
lots and lots of places and talked about this spending and one of the things I have noticed is no matter where.
I go.
People have a very poor grasp of the word trillion.
And how big this number is.
So we have a few mechanisms to put this in context for you.
It's great for cocktail parties or frat parties or any place else you need to talk to someone and raise irrelevant topics and just show how smart you are so here is the first question for your audience response thing.
"If you convert health care spending, that 2.6 trillion dollars, how many years ago is 2.6 trillion seconds."
"40 percent said 80,000."
"Twenty, 100,000, 28%, you guys got it right."
"It's 80,000 years ago, 2.6 trillion."
Do you know how long ago that is?
"When was the first human that left the African continent, modern human that left the African continent to explore the rest of the world?"
"They didn't go out to explore, they went out looking for food that was 60,000 years ago."
This is before human being migrated out of the African continent and we're measuring this in seconds.
"So, how big is a trillion."
"Well, a million seconds [inaudible] actually it's about twelve days ago."
"One billion seconds is the year I graduated college, you guys can figure that out for yourself, okay? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it, there you go. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [laugh]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I got to fix that slide."
"A trillion in seconds is 30,000 PC, 2.6 is around 80,000, alright?"
Just a huge number.
"Now, I know seconds is not what you think about and 80,000 years ago is a little too much at some ways."
"So, we're going to the moon."
"Single dollar bills, nice, crisp bills gotten right after the federal reserve and printed them, stacked up."
"You can see a 100 million crisp bills is pretty [inaudible], 6.8 miles. $One bills, right?"
The clocks are set at different times and moving at different speeds.
So the clocks are totally out of sync with each other and the child is generally out of sync with his environment.
"But the law of averages will tell you, if you take three clocks, set them at different times, and move them to different speeds, eventually-- bingo, bingo, bingo-- there will come a time when the three of them are all telling the same time."
"And when the clocks are in sync, there's this incredible forward movement on the part of the child-- for a day or week or a month if you're lucky, this incredible forward movement and progress."
And then the clocks get out of sync again.
The moment of truth called demystification.
You are like a wonderful car like a Mercedes or a Jaguar.
"But it has a very small gas tank so that when you try to think or do a lot of work, it runs out of fuel pretty easily."
"Demystification, I think, may be the most important movement in this field in the last 10 years."
And that is explaining to the child what the problem is.
"If you have a child with diabetes, one of the first things you do is explain to the child this is what diabetes is."
These are the foods you can eat.
This is what's happening to your body when you don't eat the proper food.
And explain line and verse.
"Yet when a child has a learning problem, we try to protect the child from it."
"I've had parents say to me, he doesn't know he has a learning problem."
"Indeed, he does."
"And sometimes a child takes great comfort in the diagnosis, in knowing"
I'm not the only person that has it.
I'm not stupid like the kids tell me in the school bus.
I'm not lazy like the teacher tells me every day.
There's really a name for this.
The second problem you have is what we call a graphomotor problem.
You don't have very good control over the very little muscles at the ends of your fingers.
And you know what you do because of that?
You try to get rid of them.
You know how you get rid of them?
By putting your thumb over these two fingers.
And you bear down real hard.
And you end up writing with your wrists.
And that's too slow.
And then you know what happens?
"So this is linear, order n and n is this sum of the element, or sorry, the number of elements in each list."
I said I was going to back my way into this.
That gives me a way to merge things.
So here's what merge sort would do.
"Merge sort takes this idea of divide and conquer, and it does the following: it says let's divide the list in half."
There's the divide and conquer.
And let's keep dividing each of those lists in half until we get down to something that's really easy to sort.
What's the simplest thing to sort?
"A list of size one, right?"
So continue until we have singleton lists.
"Once I got a list of size one they're sorted, and then combine them."
Combine them by doing emerge the sub-lists.
"And again, you see that flavor."
"I'm going to just keep dividing it up until I get something really easy, and then I'm going to combine."
"And this is different than binary search now, the combine is going to have to do some work."
"So, I'm giving you a piece of code that does this, and I'm going to come back to it in the second, but it's up there."
But what I'd like to do is to try you sort sort of a little simulation of how this would work.
"And I was going to originally make the TAs come up here and do it, but I don't have enough t a's to do a full merge sort."
"So I'm hoping, so I also have these really high-tech props."
I spent tons and tons of department money on them as you can see.
I hope you can see this because I'm going to try and simulate what a merge sort does.
"I've got eight things I want to sort here, and those initially start out here at top level."
The first step is divide them in half.
All right?
"I'm not sure how to mark it here, remember I need to come back there."
I'm not yet done.
What do I do?
Divide them in half again.
"You know, if I had like shells and peas here I could make some more money."
What do I do?
I divide them in half one more time.
"Let me cluster them because really what I have, sorry, separate them out."
"And then he bids for one million, and of course no one bid, any bids for five hundred thousand, four hundred, three hundred.."
Let's start two-fifty.
Someone put their hand up - two-fifty.
"And that's when he started - two-fifty two-fifty, we've got two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, anyone two-seventy-five!"
We've got two-seventy-five!!
"Three-hundred, three-hundred, wawawawawawa..!!"
[laughter].
"And even I was a monk, even I started getting excited."
[laughter].
"And you can see just how they do this, just the way they speak, they suddenly raise their voice and started speaking very quickly, and you do get excited."
"And how emotions can be generated, when you see how those emotions can be generated, you can actually sometimes be in power over other people's emotions."
"Just by acting slowly, and by speaking softly you can calm people down."
One of the first times I saw this and it was very impressive was the former abbot and Spiritual Director of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia
Ajahn Jagaro.
I was with him when he was a monk just learning his trade in Thailand.
Because we do learn a trade - this is a training which we go through.
And we were having our morning meal when a Thai lady ran into our dining hall.
"She ran in, and she's obviously very upset, because they don't usually do this - interfering in a monk's meal."
"And she was saying something in Thai, and I actually caught it after a while, she said ""Suchin is dead!"
Suchin is dead!
She shot herself!
"She's committed suicide!""."
"And I got really quite excited too because I knew that lady, she had cancer, we've been going to see her, talking to her, counselling her."
She was a close disciple of the monastery.
"And that morning she had shot herself, and this was her best friend who found her body."
"She came in to the monastery just straight away, completely distraught having found her best friend committed suicide."
You can understand what she felt like.
"And I understood that, and I looked to Ajahn Jagaro who was the head monk at that time to see what he would do."
He understood what she'd said and he put his head down and carried on eating.
And this
"lady - ""She shot herself!"
"She killed herself!"" - and the monk just carried on eating as if nothing had happened."
"They have free weights, they have machines."
The exercise machines are awesome.
I'm involved in the U.R.I. marching band.
I definitely love being at the football games and really channeling the school spirit.
You have the football team here.
The games are so much fun to go to.
Alot of students get into it.
We have a real close team.
The basketball is great.
My favorite sport is college basketball.
Lots of great rivalries.
You kind of just really get into it because everyones energy is high.
It really gives me that sense of school spirit.
I really feel like I've
learned alot and gotten alot of life lessons from all of the activities outside of my classes sometimes.
You're gonna gain a really great education.
"I think it's a really great option, especially financially."
They really focus on making sure that you get the bang for your buck.
I feel like I'm getting a good deal.
Get the most out of your college career because it goes by quick.
The education I'm getting here is great.
They prepare us well for the real world.
"Wow, I really have gotten alot out of the University."
I love U.R.I.
"For this question, we do a little recap of our packet protocol."
If we look at this wave form here you have the clock at the top.
"We have the valid signals that says, we are transmitting data."
"And then, the valid signal goes low the"
last cycle of the packet we are sending out a parity.
"In the second packet here, packet 2, you can see that while we're transmitting a packet, we can suspend that packet by asserting the suspensd signal."
"And therefore, the data transmissions will be delayed and the packet will not transmit until the suspensd signal goes again low."
This is a waveform.
"Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore"
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
"Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance"
"Another heartache, another failed romance"
"On and on, does anybody know what we are living for"
"I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now"
"I'll soon be turning, round the corner now"
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on [guitar solo]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
"I can fly, my friends"
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show (show must go on)
"I'll top the bill, I'll overkill"
I've got to find the will to carry on
On with the
Show (show must go on) The show must go on
"So in this last module, since we're talking about the writing process."
"I want to make sure to just give a few last tips for the very final draft,"
It feels really nice to just be able to watch from above what everyone's cooking style is.
It looks like Tali's never made risotto before.
"It looks like Dave Mack has never made risotto before, as well as Scott."
"He's not using a classic technique, and there's reasons why techniques are developed."
I'm gonna make a poblano risotto for them today.
I'm gonna add a little scallop on top and see where we go from there.
"Hello, Helene. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What do you think?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, I think it's actually done."
The texture is telling me that it's really close.
- Did you taste that rice?
- Yes.
That taste cooked to you?
"Well, it's getting there."
- Monti.
"- Yes, sir, chef."
"One, two, three, four pans going."
What are you doing?
"I am gonna make risotto with green and yellow beans, white asparagus, and sun-dried tomato. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Not keeping things simple?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I'm gonna see how things turn out, and I'm gonna go from there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Last 15 minutes."
Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"So, with 15 minutes left, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we should certainly be adding&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the first consommes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to our final risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"The rice should be toasted, the onions should be wilted."
"You're starting to see the rice swell a little bit, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;gaining volume... working it,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;working it, working it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Who do you think's gonna be doing something delicious? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think that Frank'll do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a good risotto,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;because I think&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;he's eaten it before.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Dave Mack?
"- He's got a pot like this, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;where it's literally, like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;just making this porridge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Right.
- I think Tali &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is kind of really&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;out of his comfort zone.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;His technique is off.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"He put cranberries in there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, there's certain things&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that never go&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in a bloody risotto."
Cranberry's one of them.
He doesn't know when to stop. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He doesn't know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when to stop.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I mean, I'm seriously concerned. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He is in hot water.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Five minutes to go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
That's what I was talking about.
To block somebody in a training session on purpose or tease somebody....
I never did that.
"And I think that, because of me, we have nowdays clear rules in this respect..."
That one treats another fair no matter if someone has the fastest or slowest car.
Everyone tries to respect each other and let them their freedoms.
"Things in Formula 1 have changed a lot after 1994, also due to the death of Ayrton Senna."
When you look now at yourself...
What are the special things about Michael Schumacher?
"Considering the beginning of your career where you were considered unapproachable, overambitious, gifted with steady nerves and an intuition about how to act in critical moments..."
There is a good example.
A German sport journalist described it like this:
In order to describe the characteristics of Michael Schumacher there is one key moment!
"It was in Austria 2003, Schumacher is about to win and makes a pit stop."
"While he was standing in the pit, flames are blazing."
"The astonishing thing is that the remains calm, with an even temper."
"Not like that he would jump out of the car, as we might do it... but one recognizes that he moves the helmet slightly to the right and observes in the mirror what is Happening."
"He sees the flames and although everything is over quickly, he drives out of the pit and wins the race."
And I think in this situation you can see what makes the difference between very good racing drivers and champions...
The ability to be mentally ahead in criticial situations.
That they take their time and analyse without any emotion and only after that make their decision without beeing hectic.
Did he describe it correctly?
...
Not bad ...
But I did not say that money is a bad thing
"I respect every religion ... ... as servile, as it is."
Oh. .. yes ... you do not know ...
"Only calm down, stop splashing with your the spinal cord."
MONEY IS GOD
And you believe religion is Christianity Buddhism and shamanism0:
"00:00:23,501 --&amp;gt; 0:00:00:25,001 not ... but certainly not ..."
And you are not stupid ...
This is very important.
"Every time I put up a problem and you're reading it, please recognize that this is an opportunity for you to learn the stuff by doing the problem first and then starting the video and doing it together with me."
"This is my main advice to you, take every opportunity to do the problems in the videos."
"So you have lot of testing, self-testing opportunities."
"Having said that, video is the main resource."
What do
I mean by that?
I am not going to give you Powerpoint versions of the video.
"To me,"
"Powerpoint is great, but it also makes you go to sleep."
"Online learning, has huge advantages."
"You can make your own class notes, and I encourage you to, from the video."
"But be an active listener, not lay sitting back having a coffee."
And you can do that too [laugh].
"You know, I am too."
Of course I can possibly watch.
"But I would encourage you to make, be an active participant in the video and hopefully if"
I am interesting enough right?
"But I will provide you very few notes, and these are"
largely geared towards stuff that you need to know at one place.
So two or three of these.
"Review of Statistics, some notes on how to use Excel or a Financial calculator, and some formulas put together to."
"But I must emphasis, don't go by the how to do things."
"First understand what the heck is going on, and why."
Another resource I'll give you is there are many textbooks written on Finance.
Finance took off in the late 50s.
"And for the next 30 years, there were a lot of really great breakthroughs."
And those breakthroughs from the fundamentals and great textbooks are available.
"And I'll give you some, I'll give you references."
"But there is one textbook which you may want to look at, which is free on the web, written by a colleague who allows you to read the stuff free not download."
And so on.
"So please when you use this textbook, don't try to download the stuff."
And thank you for joining us today on Spotlight.

"Well, let's go write out the answer together in the interpreter."
"I'm going to start by defining my function small_words, and it takes a list of words as input."
I definitely want to iterate over each one.
"The problem definition said that we want those involving at most 3 letters, so those are the small words that we yield."
Now I'm going to add some debugging to see if I've gotten the right answer.
I'm going to use one of these list comprehensions because I love them so much.
There's an old wood bridge.

It was released last August 22th!
In this video I'd like to talk about the power of creating and comparing alternatives.
And to do that I'm going to share some research that Steven Dow did as a postdoctoral scholar with me at Stanford University.
"When you're designing, does it make more sense to go for quality and try to come up with the best possible design?"
Or does it make more sense to go for quantity first as a path to try and learn and understand?
"There's a story that Bayles and Orland tell about an art teacher who divides the class in half, and he tells one half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded exclusively on the quality of the very best thing that you make."""
"He tells the other half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded on the quantity of things that you make."
"Doesn't matter how good it is; all that matters is how much that you make."""
"And what this teacher found was that while the quantity group was busily churning our piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the quality group sat around theorizing, and at the end of the day they had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and piles of dead clay."
So this gives us some intuition that rapidly producing many alternatives has a lot of value.
"And to explore this further, Steven and I had people create egg drop devices."
But the PAL-V is not the only flying car - or driving plane if you prefer - coming on to the market.
The US-based firm Terrafugia have just carried out successful tests on their own street-legal plane called the Transition.
"Terrafugia say around 100 orders have already been placed for the car, which will cost roughly the same as its European cousin."

MATT FARAH:
It's impossible to ignore the parallels between being in the desert and driving a race car.
"The feeling of isolation, your having total control over every aspect of the experience, and if something goes wrong, there's nothing there to save you."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
Inde Motorsports Park is certainly remote enough out in the Arizona desert.
"The front straight doubles as a runway, so it's long, wide, and unforgiving."
"Rest of the two-mile circuit is bumpy, dusty, tight, and blind."
And the AVI Racing Corvette GT1 is probably the fastest track car I've ever driven.
"Or if not, it's certainly the loudest."
"In-car audio not, so much."
"I have no idea if you can hear me or not, this is by far the"
loudest car I've ever driven.
"AVl's Wayne McKeen, after putting tens of thousands into a C6 Corvette CO6 to go racing, had a revelation-- if you want to build a Corvette for the track, why start with a Corvette that's meant for the street."
That's like buying a casino when all you needed was a card table.
WAYNE MCKEEN:
I love Corvettes.
The geometry and the engineering that's went into the Corvette for a track car is unbelievable.
And we needed a stiff chassis to complement the geometry of the Corvette.
This car is a tube-frame GT1 Corvette race car.
"Essentially, a Corvette stock car, with a completely rebuilt, redesigned two-frame chassis that's extremely stuff."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"The body of this car is made out of-- this current car-- is made out of fiberglass the production cars will be out of carbon fiber and Kevlar as an option, which saves about 80 pounds to the weight of the whole vehicle."
"And the chassis itself, dry weight is about 23-30 the way it sits."
"So, getting a stock zero 6 down under 3,000 pounds for a race car is extremely tough."
But the corpses around me piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit

To the green bushes so far and near
"For to hang tent and pegs, a man needs two legs"
No more waltzing Matilda for me [instrumental]
"So they collected the cripples, the wounded, the maimed"
And they shipped us back home to Australia
"The legless, the armless, the blind, and insane"
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As they carried us down the gangway
"But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared"
Then they turned their faces away
And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
"And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march"
Reliving the dreams of past glory
And I see the old men all twisted and torn
The forgotten heroes from a forgotten war
"And the young people ask me, ""What are they marching for?"""
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
"Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi."
"Goodbye, Martin Luther King."
"Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood."
Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food.

look what they've done.

"Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues."
"A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti, which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change."
"In Venezuela, one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal."
"And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done."
"And of course, ""The Vagina Monologues"" we know about."
"And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues."
"So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?"
"What I need to say to the planners of the world, the governments, the strategists is, ""You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake."
"It needs to be the yeast."""
"Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there."
"And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen."
"So, what is it that we require?"
What is it that we need?
"We need to break down our vision of what planners are, of what the correct way of a path is."

"So to start talking about Greywater, there was a really excellent report that came out last year looking at the--can Greywater can really meet our needs and it's a non-potable source of water."
"So if we look at how it can meet our irrigations needs, we can find that it actually matches up really well."
So there's two charts.
If you just look at shower and
"laundry water, these are--have average per capita use in California."
"And then you look at the outdoor use for landscaping, there's a really good match."
"So we can just take all that water instead off sending it to the sewer plant which often, you know, doesn't treat it properly, often it does, but not always."
"We can use that to irrigate outside, things that don't need potable water."
"And another thing to of note is, you know, how much water is this?"
"Like, you know, each household Greywater system like does it really--will it really impact California water?"
And if we look at--this is millions of gallons per day of savings.
"If people take that water and irrigate outside, you can look at just from washing machines, how many millions of gallons you'd save, showers and washers and then all Greywater."
And I wanted to point you to one number that 10% column.
"If just 10% of people--and this is just Southern California--re-use their Greywater to irrigate plants outside, that would off-set the need for a medium sized desalinization plant."

What we're hoping is that the Higgs boson gives us a new tool to answer these questions.
"That is, one era ends, another one begins."
"It is as if we'd been in one room for all of our lives, doing physics, and the Higgs is a door into the next room."
And it'll be very interesting to see what's inside.
"Of course, I believe."
"Especially during the period of recession, my faith has grown even more."
Human actions can only be successful with the help of God .
Let's see.
We have this graph over here with t is the independent variable on the horizontal axis and d is the dependent variable on the vertical axis.
And then they have a table here.
Looks like this table corresponds to this graph.
"When t equals 1, d is 40, when t is equal to 2, d is 80."
So these points correspond to points on this line.
"And then they explain to us, you are buying a gym membership."
The membership costs $40 per month.
"In the graph and table above, d is the total number of dollars that you pay for your gym membership, so that's d right over there, and t is the time in months that you keep the membership."
"Write an equation for the amount of money d that you pay for your gym membership, if you keep the membership for t months."
And you see that here.
"If you're one month, you pay $40, two months you pay another $40, you pay $80."
You see that in the graph right over here.
"If you have 0 months, you pay nothing."
"Then one month, $40, the next month another $40 getting you to $80."
"So if I were to write this as an equation, the dependent variable here is the amount that I pay in dollars."
So that is going to depend on the time.
And how is it going to depend on the time in months?
Well I'm going to pay $40 per month times the number of months.
"So I can either write it as 40 with a little asterisk sign, which is Shift 8-- and then I put t there-- or I could literally put just a t right over there."
"And I think that's right, because if my time is 0 according to this table and according to this graph,"
"But that's the same thing as s squared over s squared, plus a squared over s squared."
"So it's s squared plus a squared, over s squared, y is equal to minus e to the minus st, times this whole thing, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
"And now, this right here, since we're doing everything with respect to dt, this is just a constant, right?"
So we can say a constant times the antiderivative is equal to this.
This is as good a time as any to evaluate the boundaries.
Right?
"If this had a t here, I would have to somehow get them back on the other side."
"Because the t's are involved in evaluating the boundaries, since we're doing our definite integral or improper integral."
So let's evaluate the boundaries now.
"And we could've kept them along with us the whole time, right?"
And just factored out this term right here.
But anyway.
So let's evaluate this from 0 to infinity.
And this should simplify things.
"So the right-hand side of this equation, when I evaluate it at infinity, what is e to the minus infinity?"
"Well, that is 0."
We've established that multiple times.
"And now it approaches 0 from the negative side, but it's still going to be 0, or it approaches 0."
What's sine of infinity?
"Well, sine just keeps oscillating, between negative 1 and plus 1, and so does cosine."
Right?
So this is bounded.
So this thing is going to overpower these.
"And if you're curious, you can graph it."
This kind of forms an envelope around these oscillations.
"So the limit, as this approaches infinity, is going to be equal to 0."
"And that makes sense, right?"
These are bounded between 0 and negative 1.
And this approaches 0 very quickly.
So it's 0 times something bounded between 1 and negative 1.
"Another way to view it is the largest value this could equal is 1 times whatever coefficient's on it, and then this is going to 0."
So it's like 0 times 1.
I asked people to join us on the board and it slowly started to grow.

I want your help.
We need money-it's honest.
We need money.
"But,I""m not going to ask you for alot."
I 'm just asking you to give $10.
"If everyone would donate $10,together we can raise alot of money."
"We can raise $5,000."
What will we do with that money?Go shopping?NO:) We will be able to give 8 children 8 weeks of free therapy.
We have hooked up with frendo a new company.

Taking just a few seconds to cool freshly laid eggs could add weeks to thier shelf life according to a Purdue University study.
The rapid cooling process uses liquid carbon dioxide to stabilize the protein in eggs thus extending their shelf life.
You can cool eggs many different ways.
"Traditional cooling of eggs, which would be the eggs you would find in the grocery store those are typically just cooled under ambient conditions where the eggs are put into a carton, they're about 105°F. and then they cool over time."
It takes about 10-14 days for those eggs to cool to refrigeration temperature.
The egg cooling system that we've developed here based on using carbon dioxide as a liquid that we can spray and create a cold snow.
This snow is about -107°C.
(negative).
This snow can be circulated around the eggs and we're able to then rapidly cool eggs.
Instead of taking 10-14 days we can do it in the range of seconds of treatment time.
Eggs cooled under current methods lose the AA grade in about six weeks.
Keener's study shows that this rapid cooling process can significantly increase this time period.
"So typically your eggs at the grocery store, those are traditionally cooled where they are just allowed to cool under ambient conditions."
The shelf life on those eggs is usually 4-6 weeks.

"So, the celebrities and all the movie stars and music people, they look amazing, right?"
"They have beautiful skin, white straight teeth, and gorgeous hair."
What do they use?
"Well, I know what they use."
"That's right, some of the companies and I, we've worked together and found out exactly what these celebrities and movie stars and all these famous people are using and I have some of those products to share with you today."
"So what I have is iLike, so if it's good enough for the queen, I say it's good enough for me and you."
"Queen Latifah, Rich Carrot Mask, that is what she uses."
"It is a great mask for anti-aging, to give you antioxidants."
"I mean, if you know how good carrots are for you internally, just imagine what those carotenes are doing for your skin on external, so the iLike Rich Carrot Mask works good enough for Queen Latifah;"
I think we can try it.
And Epicuren's Skincare...
Kate Bosworth loves herself some X-Treme Cream SPF45.
"This is one of my favorites, and I'm gonna keep using this in the wintertime, because, when I go to the park, even though it's winter, we still need to wear sunscreen, okay?"
"I know some of you are thinking, ""Oh, believe me, I don't need it where I live,"" but, most likely, you do."
"Even if it's cloudy out, there's still rays that are getting through, so wear sunscreen."
I'm always gonna preach that.
"And I love this as well, this is off my bathroom counter."
"Again, Epicuren Kukui Coconut After Bath Moisturizer."
This is loved by Gwen Stafani and we all know that she looks amazing.
"This is a body product, so a lot of body products are just hydating/nourishing-type products."
"Well, this, the difference is Epicuren's After Bath has anti-aging ingredients in it, so you're putting on anti-aging moisturizer on your body, which, those of us know, our arms, our shoulders, our neck, our décolleté probably could use some of that."
"And, Kim Cattrall, she loves Epicuren."
"She, you can quote her on this, she uses Epicuren Skin Regime at least once a week, a full Epicuren Skin Regime."
"I have the Ultra Rose in my hand, and this is an amazing moisturizer, super-super hydrating, as well."
Love Epicuren.

least square you minimize this.
Whether it's the two or the one norm.
"So really that corresponds to, the only thing I really gotta minimize is this."
"This stuff is always the same, so if I can minimize that some, that's all I care about."
"So there's this thing called fminsearch In Matlab, which allows you to just give it an expression, and it will try to minimize, and you give it some initial values, to try to say, hey, try these and then go find me a minimum solution."
'Kay?
"So that's what we're going to use, fminsearch."
All right.
"So, we come into here and here's how it works."
"We want the coefficients, using an L2 fit, the coefficients meaning a and b."
"And want to call the fminsearch, command."
"And want to call a function called line, L2 fit."
"And well we've gotta pass it, or the initial guesses for the values of A and B. I'll just pick one."
"And I'. gonna pass it the data X and Y. The box here is for tolerence settings, just allow you to make it, get more accurate fi, or less accurate fit. the default is ten minus six."
"It's gonna try to get you the minimum, and once it gets, it's, it's an iteration routine, and once you get down to 10-6, it stops, 'kay?"
"So, ther e you go, that's how you do it."
"You send in your, you send in your data, you send in your initial guess for A and B, and what is gonna come out are two numbers, A and B. That, it thinks, so the minimum, give you the minimum values for those things."
"Okay, now we can do this without one by simply changing two:1."
"So we're gonna do two this, we're gonna first call F and then search, and use, yeah, two, minimization, and then we're gonna call F and search."
A one immunization.
"Now, it turns out, it's kinda like the cooking show today."
"Where,"
"like, you know, oh, you put it in the oven for 50 minutes and, you know, all of a sudden, right at that point, they pop one out."
"It's all planned as if, as if it wasn't spontaneous."
"Okay, so we're not going spontaneous today."
"We're going to go get these , they're sitting right there."
"There's one of them and let me get the other one, and then we'll talk about them."
"Where is it L2 fit, okay."
Alright.
"So what are they, what are these subroutines."
"Well, here they are."

"We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?"
"Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one."
"And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle."
(Laughter)
Why?
Why?
Why do you want to do that?
Why do we all want to do that?
I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
(Laughter)
"It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are."
So we're going to go straight into this.
Can I have the lights off for a moment?
"I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution."
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
"One very young, one a little more mature."
"This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park."
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?
"Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it."
"This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building?"
No.
"It turns out that what we want for, what we'll call the common denominator, it turns out to be the least common multiple of two and three."
Well what's the least common multiple of two and three?
Well that's the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three.
Well the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three is six.
So let's convert both of these fractions to something over six.
So one half is equal to what over six.
You should know this from the equivalent fractions module.
"Well if I eat one half of a pizza with six pieces, I would have eaten three pieces, right?"
That make sense.
"One is one half of two, three is one half of six."
"Similarly, if I eat one third of a pizza with six pieces, it's the same thing as two over six."
So one half plus one third is the same thing as three over six plus two over six.
Notice I didn't do anything crazy.
All I did is I re-write both of these fractions with different denominators.
"I essentially changed the number of pieces in the pie, if that helps at all."
Now that we're at this point then the problem becomes very easy.
"We just add the numerators, three plus two is five, and we keep the denominators the same."
Three over six plus two over six equals five over six.
And subtraction is the same thing.
"One half minus one third, well that's the same thing as three over six minus two over six."
Well that equals one over six.
Let's do a bunch more problems and hopefully you'll start to get it.
"And always remember you can re-watch the presentation, or you can pause it and try to do the problems yourself, because I think sometimes I talk fast."
Let me throw you a curve ball.
What's one tenth minus one?
"Well, one doesn't even look like a fraction."
But you can write it as a fraction.
Well that's the same thing as one tenth minus-- how could we write one so it has the denominator of ten?
Right.
"It's the same thing as ten over ten, right? ten over ten is one."
"So one tenth minus ten over ten is the same thing as one minus ten-- remember, we only subtract the numerators, and we keep the denominator ten, and that equals negative nine over ten. one tenth minus one is equal to negative nine over ten."
Let's do another one.
"Because, if they were down at the South Atlantic, it'd take a while for somebody to get to them."
And so we'd throw that out 150 ft above the deck and you try to wrap it around
"like, here's the capsule, and the wind is -"
"They'd put two small ones, the capsule, and then the other two."
"And they're tied together, so they'd wrap right around."
"And then then you'd drop your paramedics, and those guys were good."
They were experts in nine fields.
"They're paramedics, mechanics, parachute guys, anything."
Great bunch.
So we did this for a while and really got it down.
They'd mark spots like you do in the side window and they guided you in.
"I'd be on hot mike in the back, and they'd be looking out seeing the thing."
"The capsule, and the logger?"
Yep.
They'd see the capsule and the logger because they'd nod their head one way and you'd go one degree
"left, two degrees right."
"And then they'd jump, just like that."
And it didn't make any difference what the wind was doing.
"One night, them seas had to have been ten feet high and blowing the top right off them."
Middle of the night.
"And we went up to 20,000 feet so a couple million candle [?] out the back end."
Flares.
And then we'd go back down.
But then the astronauts show up and so we flew to Houston twice for a weekend two different times out in Houston.
And we went out there because they had different equipment.
And they also wanted to see who was going to pick them up.
If they got in trouble...
"So they get on the plane, and it's funny because all I had was a stack of wood pallets with a piece of plywood on it and the flight [?] around a couple power cords so they could have - they call it [?] - search and"
"locator ... anyway, they were just improving on this to find the capsule."
"That was back in the early 60s, you know, sort of primitive."
"So, they're on the plane, and I never gave it a thought."
"You meet them, and you're working with them and they go out and fly with us and they'd see what I was doing in the cabin and they were offering advice on what it was like and the scuba guys and the whole bunch, we all worked together."
"Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""The River Wild."""
"Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" together."
"And Anne Hathaway and Julia Roberts were in ""Valentines Day."""
We're going to do this as a little bit of a quiz so I'm going to mark each of these edges as something that you need to visit.
You need to visit all of them.
I strongly suggest that you actually check them off as you go because it's really easy to do one twice or forget one by accident.
"So this is what I want you to do, I want you to go through and start at Meryl Streep and move along the green lines here at the movies and each time you visit a movie, check it off as you go."
So the right answer in this quiz is to have all the edges checked off and none of them checked off twice.
"It's really easy to mess that up, so be very careful."
"And then when you're done, I want you to mark the little bubble corresponding to which actor you end up with at the end of your path."
You can follow any path that you want--you just have to make sure that you visit each of the movies once.
All right!
I'd like you to actually go and do this and check off the actor that you end up with.

We are going to end here and remind everyone to come back  to the basic practice.
Because I know we have been stimulated.
Don't let that pull you from who you are.
"I think we have touched that, the truth of who you are and your practice in the present moment."
"Don't let anything tempt you and lose that, even if it is about teaching  and education and all that."
"We just come back to our breath,  our steps, basic things that will..."
"Actually all the things that we need  are already in us and with the practice, we can trust that."
"With the mother and... as parents too, the teenagers."
I work with a lot of teens and the mindfulness has helped me a lot to really call out what it is that is really happening in present moment.
You only can do that calmly  if you've done your own homework.
So there is nothing that  you cannot solve or deal with.
"Mindfulness is just an energy, is not a technique, an energy we can cultivate."
"Just in present moment, you can recognize and call out to the teenagers to the students, what it is, what is happening."
"But calmly, with a lot of love  and compassion, miracles happen."
We all have experienced that  wherever arena we are in.
"So that encourages you for the next hour, or as we eat lunch."
"Don't think about this,  let it go."
"Come back to your steps, come back to your dinner."
"What it is that you are looking for, it is already in there."
"I think we all know that already, that's why we're here,to actually cultivate that."
"So we learn the teaching mind,  a teacher's mind which is... more things, more pieces of paper."
"We just let go, come back."
"So, we'll end here  with three sounds of the bell for us to really enjoy this moment and to let this happiness and what we touched here for the sharings, giving us a lot of energy."
"We let that dissipate  into all the teachers, all the students, all the young ones, all the parents  out there, all doing their best."

May we end here?
Can I teach you a song?
"I'll sing the first line, okay?"
And zero ends three.
[sound].
"And now the problem is, we've changed which path is the shortest one."
"We added ten to the top path and only five to the bottom path and as a result, they've reversed."
So now the bottom path ST is actually the shorter one.
"So if you run Dijkstra on this graph, it's going to come with the path ST even though that's not in fact the shortest path in the original network, the one that we actually care about."
"Okay, so that's why you can't just naively reduce shortest path with negative edge lengths to shortest paths with non-negative edge"
lengths.
"Moreover on this very same, super simple thre e node graph, You know, we can try to run, running dikes for shortest path algorithm."
It's perfectly well defined.
It will produce some output.
But it's actually going to be wrong.
"It is not going to compute shortest path distances, correctly in this graph."
So let me show you why.
Unless of course initialization will work as it always does.
So it's gonna start by saying the shortest path distance from S to itself is zero via the empty path.
"And then, what's it going to do next?"
"It's going to say well we need to enlarge the set capital X by one vertex and there are two crossing edges, it's the"
XV edge and the ST edge.
And what's it going to do.
It's going to use the
Dijkstra Greedy score.
"So the score of this upper edge is going to be one, and the score of this bottom edge."
Is going to be negative two.
"'Cause remember, you take the previously computed shortest path [inaudible] of the tail, that's zero in both cases."
And then you add the edge lengths.
"So the edge lengths are one and minus two, so the scores are one and minus two."
Which of these is smaller?
"Well evidently, the ST arc has the smaller score minus two."
So what is Dijkstra's algorithm gonna do?
"It's going to say yes, let's go for this edge ST."
Let's bring T into the set capital X. T is now part of the conquered territory.
"In Gregorio Marañón or in Castelar, I don't know."
"That moment, when the people were crying and hugging."

"Just over a month had gone by and these people were still getting emotional over little things like that, to meet in a square again coming from different parts of the city."
"They were very emotional moments, and nobody, whether they're for or against what was happening, can deny that there have been moments of emotion. sharing things that don't usually happen in politics."
"They don't usually happen, but that's politics too."
Empathy is pure politics.
Those were three emotional moments that I experienced.
"And the worst, probably what happened in Barcelona."
"I mean what happened at the gates of the Parlament, violence as an answer to whatever, but in the end violent outbreaks of tension."
That somehow fractured part of the message that we were sending out.
That was a very sensitive moment.
But it also consolidated the movement.
"Because people went out to the street to prove that that was just an isolated episode and not what we're about, that is not what defines us."
But it was a complicated episode.
Another bad moment...
ST:
I'd like you to find something that you experienced.
"That you witnessed or that affected you, that made you feel bad."
In my case it's obvious.
There were maybe two.
"The violence on the 5th in the Ministery of Interior, or the 4th of august which was the first contact and not very violent, but for me very surprising."
And afterwards undoubtedly on the 17th I took that video and got home trembling.
I experienced that and it was terrible.
I don't know if you...
JL:
I wasn't there that day.
ST:
"It doesn't have to be in that sense, I don't know."
Frustrating.
"Or if you don't remember, I'm happy for you."
JL:
"After all, the poison that doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
I have a friend.
He had another friend.
They become business associates together.
And they decided to expand their business into European expansion.
My friend was responsible for it.
"While my friend was busy with the European expansion, he was hit by the news that his friend has committed a massive financial fraud, and ran away."
"And, we are talking massive, we are talking mega dollars, because the business was dealing with those kinds of sums."
"My friend was investigated, suspected, but anyway, at the end of the story, although the investigations proved that my friend was innocent, and in fact, he was a victim, it destroyed his life in the country where he lived, and he had to leave."
"In the other country, where he went maybe about 2-3 months later,  he was hit by another crisis that hit him in a very personal way."
Something that only his wife and I know.
"Nobody else knows, not even his family."
"You'd say, by that time, he should be finished."
He's done.
Two major crisis in your life almost instantly.
But he managed to stand up again.
He managed to rise again.
"Right now, he is facing another crisis, another major disappointment."
"But I look at his face, and I see a defined man."
I see a man who refuses to give up.
I see a man who's still trying to build up his life.
He reminds me of a story.
And this is where I want to end this.
My time is almost done.
"Of a man who enters into a fight, one of those ancient fights, there were no rings at the time, they used to fight in the open."
And he gets beaten up in his face and he falls flat on the ground.
He rises up again and is hit again.
"Every time he rises up, he is hit again, third, fourth time, he's down on the ground. trying to rise up, he thinks in his head,"
"""If I'm able to stand up again, it's because I refuse to stay down."
"And if I do stand up, and I'm hit again and I'm never able to rise up at least it will happen while I was fighting."
"At least it will happen while I was on my feet."""
"The Chinese have a saying, and I want to say this to myself to you guys, and to Yemen."
We won't stand for tyranny!
O king: and it's too late to apologize.
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late!
"We've paid your foolish tax, read the acts, and they just won't do."
"We want to make it clear, we believe this much is true: all men were created with certain unalienable rights!"
"Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!"
It's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
It's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
Halfway across the globe and we're standing on new ground...

In this session we値l be talking about Renaissance and the landscape that incorporated the time roughly from the 14th to the 17th century.
We値l be talking about Italy and the Italian philosophies and different design styles and how they set a pattern for the rest of northern Europe which became known as the Northern Renaissance.
The Renaissance was a cultural movement.
It began in Italy in the late Middle Ages and then spread to the rest of Europe.
The ideas from the Renaissance have disseminated from around the 15th century across Europe.
"It was really this resurgence in classicism and it was a time of development of linear perspective, artists and rendering techniques, realistic type paintings and gradual educational reform."
The tortoise and the hare are racing to see who can run 100 feet in the shortest amount of time.
"However, we need those two bubbles to keep the rope, the wire, the cable... whatever it is... in a fixed position."
"So, here is the crane's arm with a hook."
Let's attach it back to the cabin.
Congratulations again.
We have made the crane.
The crane will look much better and have much more use if we put the crane on a base.
"So, let's make a base."
Inflate a balloon
leaving about three inch flat tail.
Twist a chain of four about...two inch size bubbles.
Lock both ends of the chain of the first four bubbles in one lock twist.
The rest of the balloon we split aah...to make four about seven inch size bubbles.
Twist the fifth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the fifth bubble between the first and the second bubbles.
Twist the sixth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the sixth bubble between the second and the third bubble.
Twist the seventh seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh bubble between the third and the fourth bubble.
If you properly measured previous bubbles then the rest of the balloon is the eighth seven inch bubble.
It's OK if we make eighth bubble of different size.
Lock the free end of the eighth bubble between the fourth and the first bubble.
Congratulations.
We have made the base for the crane.
Our next step is obvious.
We attach the crane tower to the base.
There are four ends at the bottom of the tower.
We tie each end to the appropriate spot between bubbles of the base.
"Again, if you made a different size eighth bubble of the base, then you want to place the eighth bubble of the base on the front or on the back side of the crane."
"Congratulations, we have made the crane on the base."
Let's just fix all bubbles in proper positions.
The structure of crane base allowed us to convert the crane to sort of a mobile crane.
Simply adjust position of the sides of the base to make two wheels mobile crane.
"For example, I can do something,"
I can cut my hair short to minimize my shampoo consumption.
"I can reduce my footprint by, for example, taking the elevator."
"Because when you take the elevator, you can be five time less bad"
"Because it takes, for a vegetarian, five times more energy to lift somebody by taking the stairs, than taking the elevator."
"In calories, it's five times more energy intensive than taking the elevator."
"So, whenever you want to protect the environment, take the elevator, because it takes so much less energy when you have an elevator, because you use calories so much."
"We can do a lot, for example, never drink sparkling water."
Because it's three litres of carbon dioxides.
"We can do a lot; we call it ""sustainability""."
"When I ask you, ""How is your relationship with your girlfriend?"
What would you say?
Sustainable.
(Laughter)
"Then, I am really sorry for you."
(Laughter)
"So, this is not about minimizing being bad; it's about being good."
We talk about reducing carbon dioxide emissions; but two thirds of all the carbon is in soil?
"Not in oil, not in coal, two thirds of all the carbon is in top soil."
"So, we want to be carbon neutral, but why don't we make a footprint which is beneficial, instead of carbon neutral?"
"People try to be ""less bad""."
"You will say, ""Oh yes! 'm 90% bad, 80% bad,"
"I make all zeroes carbon neutral""."
"For example, Europe has a goal to be carbon neutral in 2050."
You can only be carbon neutral when you don't exist.
This is the only way.
"Just by thinking, you are not carbon neutral."
"So how could you say, ""My biggest goal is to be carbon neutral?"""
"Out of all the environmental disasters,"
"- Seveso, Bhopal, The Love Canal, Chernobyl - the generated feeling is, ""it's better we're not here""."
"And when you are in, say, Amazon, we think, ""We are a pain for the planet""."
This is why we try to be less bad.
The blood of your children is valuable.
It's going to unite us in our path.
But our Country is one.

"Hi, I'm Robbie Shoepepper, and I am a student assistant here at the Alden Library Learning Commons."
"I provide services such as renting out laptops, renting out peripherals for your computer, and giving you you're key for your study room."
This is also a great place for your technology questions and troubleshooting.
I hope you come to the desk and have a nice day.
So far i have made a number of videos discussing Jehovah's Witnesses and their anti-blood doctrine.
And inevitably whenever i make one of these videos about blood Jehovah's Witness will challenge me and say something along the lines of
"Look Brian, we're just doing what the Bible plainly and clearly teaches."
It plainly says don't take blood.
"And if the Bible says don't take blood, we're not going to take blood."
It's as simple as that.
Now... what i like to do to challenge this overly simplistic reading of the scriptures.
"And i would like to start in Matthew chapter 5, starting in verse 27."
"We're Jesus says ""you have heard it said, do not commit adultery,"
"but i'll tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfuly has already committed adultery with her in his heart."""
"Jesus goes on and say ""if your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and trow it away."""
So do you apply that overly simplistic reading of the scriptures to this verse in Mathew chapter 25?
if you would look at a woman lustfuly would you gauge your eye out and then you throw away? well i'm guessing that you as a Jehovah's Witness wouldn't do that because
i know a lot of Jehovah's Witnesses and i never met a single one who has only one eye.
"Now, it's interestant to me that you properly apply the rules of scripture interpretation"
"to this in Matthew chapter 5, but you offer this overly simplistic view"
"Twenty-two, (dancing like),"
"Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah)!"
"Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah, yeah)!"
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene."
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping."
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), you look like bad news,"
"I gotta have you, I gotta have you!"
"We all have brushes called ""being ourselves"""
"Look, with just a little bravery you can change it into any color"
Let's draw our hopes
How far does this sky continue?
The world we know is so narrow
"When we hear somebody's voice asking for help, we decide to pretend we didn't hear it"
By fighting we reaffirm the worth of our existence and then find doubt in our hearts
"Finding differences to not be ""individualities"" but ""enemies"", we become stubborn and push others away"
Our relationships with people became dominating and not something that ties together
Hold my hands and listen to my voice
"The world becomes colorful, you don't have to hate since you can bond beautifully"
"There are no useless lives, let's accept each other"
The infinitely extending canvas becomes dyed in hope
"We all have brushes called ""being ourselves"""
"Look, with just a little bravery you can change it into any color"
Let's draw our hopes
[music begins]
"Empty spaces, what are we living for"
"Abandoned places, I guess we know the score"
"On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for"
"Another hero, another mindless crime"
"Behind the curtain, in the pantomime"
"You're better off with a nine-to-five job."""
80% of the people fail within the first year.
"Go back home."" That's what they told me."
Announcer:
"Stephen disregarded those discouraging words and when he once again found himself in the vice-president's office, he acted on his intuition."
Stephen:
"I looked at him in the eye and I said, ""Sir, if you don't hire me,"""
"""you'll never know what I can do for this firm."""
Announcer:
"Stephen got the job, but with one final condition."
"Stephen: he said, ""We'll train you for three months, we'll give you a little salary."""
"""At the end of three months, you have to take a 250 question examination."
"If you fail by one point, YOU'RE OUT!"""
Announcer:
"Stephen passed that exam and over the next four years he achieved national recognition,"""
"""earning a six figure salary as his personal sales increased by over 1,700%."""
"But there was something more, a broader goal and purpose for his life which came to him with instant clarity on a vacation trip to the ocean."
Stephen:
"I had to get away for a while, remember I was a stock broker at the time, and I had to get away."
"It was a lot of pressure, I just needed a little bit of sun and a little bit of water, and a little bit of sand."
"I needed a little bit of a tan, too (laughter)."
"So I went away, and there I was on the beach, and it was a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous day."
I was reading a book and then it happened.
Out of the clear blue my eyes flew open.
It was a revelation.
I just knew that my life purpose was to become a speaker and an author.
Announcer:
"Since that decisive moment on that beach, Stephen has shared his inspiring story through the medium of television and radio as an author and has spoken to hundreds of organizations of all ages, all across America and has never looked back, except to remember the people who helped to encourage him along the way."
People like his fifth grade teacher.
Stephen: ...and then Mrs. Jordan made a grand entrance into my life.
She was a larger-than- life woman with salt and pepper hair and eyes that I swore twinkled.
"Have you ever had someone in your life that you wanted to be so much a part of, people who are that powerful?"
Net short term effect on the state's budget?
Zero or worse.
It is not about the budget.
It is really not.
"It is not about the budget in Wisconsin, it is not about the budget in Florida, it's not about the budget in Ohio, it is not about the budget in Michigan."
"But what Michiganders know, and what Michiganders have been trying to get the rest of the country to pay attention to, is that what these Republicans are doing in the states, is not just 'not about the budget'."
It's about something way worse than that.
Stay with me for a moment here.
There is more to this.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Why are these people in Michigan so loud?
Why are these people in Michigan so mad?
"Not just because they haven't won yet, like the protesters in Wisconsin have, it's because Michigan Republicans are telling them, that they are about to lose their right to elect local government."
The governor's just going to take care of that from now on.
"See, the governor knows best."
"This whole democracy thing, turns out, it's very inefficient."
And haven't you heard?
There's a crisis.
"Big government conservatism gets really, really, really astonishingly big."
That's next.
"The Michigan House has already passed, and the Michigan Senate is about to pass a bill that sounds like it is out of a dystopian leftist novel from the future."
"If you think that Republican governors around the country are using fiscal crisis as a pretext, to do stuff they wouldn't otherwise want to do, this is something I don't think I every would have believed Republicans even wanted to do."
But this is what they're proposing.
"This hasn't really gotten much national attention, but please just check this out."
"Governor Rick Snyder's budget in Michigan is expected to cut aid to cities and towns, so much, that a lot of cities and towns in Michigan are expected to be in dire financial straights."
But the growth arc is not going to be in power level.
It's going to be in something else.
So that's just one way to look at characters.
It's not the only way.
But it is one way to view your characters.
"Almost every good character... they may move along this but almost every good character is going to start of with a little smidge of this, and a little smidge that."
"And so, I will add under the ""aspire to be,"" which is kind of the same concept, but: they are an expert at something."
In other words they have a superpower.
And their superpower might not be something we normally think of.
A great example of this is going to be Sam from Lord of the Rings.
"He is superhumanly loyal, would you not say?"
He has one attribute.
Everything else about him is basically goofy and befuddled.
The midget in the world of giants.
And yet he has this one super quality that all of us would love to have.
And because of that he consistently polls as people's favorite character from Lord of the Rings.
"In fact there is a lot of discussion that he probably is the hero of the whole story, is Sam."
And that is because Sam has this blend down really well.
"Yes, he's kind of a fool in a lot of ways, but he has this one thing that is defining about him."
"And it's something that, when you look, you say ""yeah, I wish I could be Sam, for that moment."""
"So, an expert at something."
The other one I'll add up here is that they are proactive.
Have we talked about proactivity?
Did I do anything about this?
"I think I talked about it in the first week, or maybe the second."
Keep in mind that you don't need to do all of these.
And there are a few more I'll throw up here.
These are all tools in your toolbox that you can use to increase the level of sympathetic... the sympathetic nature of a given character.
If you can combine them all - great.
"In fact, pretty much everything up here are things that you should try to put in almost every character."
"But it doesn't mean you can't have one that leaves out one of them or two of them, or something like this."
These are the ways that we make people sympathetic.
"Our first speaker is Jack Miller from OlSE,"
"Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, who has been involved for many years teaching holistic education and more recently,  mindfulness in particular."
"But let me just say, more complete  biographies of each our speakers, you will find it in your booklet."
"So, you can read that in your leisure time."
Here are some interesting things about them that are not necessarily  in their biographies.
Jack.
"(Jack Miller) Thank you Richard,  it is an honor to be here."
I believe this retreat  could have tremendous influence on education in North America.
"And I have worked in Ontario  for 40 years and this could also have huge impact  on this province, the education."
"So, thank you for coming."
We were asked to share a little bit  about personal story.
I am a child of the 1960s.
"As a young American, I was facing the dilemma of the Vietnam war."
"The more I read about that war, I felt  it was wrong for America to be involved."
So I had the choice when I was drafted that I went to Canada.
"The stress of that time, was when I began my spiritual practice."
"So, in 1969, I started doing yoga and I could feel the effects immediately."
"So I got interested in the philosophy  behind the yoga, and I started reading on Eastern thought."
"Then in 1974, I started  doing Vipassana meditation."
I have been doing those things since those years.
"When I was doing the meditation, one of the things about the experience of meditation is that you begin to experience interconnectedness which Thay calls interbeing."
You experience it at deeper level  than just intellectually.
So this is what eventually lead me to holistic education.
Because holistic education  is about interconnectedness.
"And unfortunately, our education system is very fragmented."
"We break things into courses, into pieces, into little bits of information."
"This basically causes suffering, this fragmentation."
"So, holistic education is an attempt  to have a curriculum that is connected."
So I wrote a book called The Holistic Curriculum which is about that.
"There is a school in Toronto, it is originally called Whole Child School now called the Equinox Holistic School."
We have some teachers here from that school.
I was delighted to run into Kyle.
"Exactly, so there's just nothing there."
"These guys are grass finishing, they go literally from here..."
In fact 12 of these are going to go to slaughter tomorrow.
"So they go directly from here, right to the abattoir."
What do you do in the winter?
Cause obviously the pasture isn't available in the winter.
At least in most of the continental US.
"Yeah, what happens is, with this grazing management, we're able to stockpile grass, just by not allowing them to graze late in the season, into the winter."
"The average farm in our area feeds hay 120 days a winter, we feed hay only 40 days a winter."
"We've greatly reduce the amount of hay we have to feed, which is less hay we have to make,"
less hay we have to feed.
How do you do that?
"By controlling the grazing with moving the animals everyday to a new paddock, and allowing rest periods to deny access to certain pastures late in the season so that it just stands on the stalk going into the winter."
It's OK to eat that fresh.
"Absolutely, even when it frosts, and it turns brown it's still better than hay."
So that's what we do going into the winter.
"You are able to cut it down to two thirds, the amount of hay that they require?"
"Yes, yes."
And this is something that most typical beef producers could do if they chose to.
Everyone of them.
Relatively easily.
From Florida to...
"What's interesting is, it doesn't have anything to do with latitude, because the average farmer in Florida feeds hay for 120 days a year."
"In illinois, 120 days a year."
"In Saskatchewan, 120 days a year."
It's part of the job description.
Cattle farmer: feed hay 120 days a year.
"If you can manage the grazing so that you can get that hay out, it greatly affects your bottom line because that's all mechanically harvested, stored..."
"When they're in the hay feeding season, whatever the time that is, is it necessary to supplement with grains or anything like that?"
That's what many beef raisers will tell you.
"And vigorously so, and deny that there's any other way that is possible or practical."
I wonder if you could address that?
"Pale skin shows through, where the intensely itchy animal's rubbed off 80% of its hair."
"These ghosts are sick, starving, and fatally anemic."
But the ticks live on.
Females remain dormant in the ground for weeks.
"In Africa, some species survive without food for much, much longer."
"In harsh environments, big mammals are few and far between."
So a tick finds a shady tree and heads underground to wait... and wait.
Ticks are ultimate survivors because they can sit waiting for a blood meal for ten years!
"We've seen ten of nature's toughest animals-- battling adversity for days, months, and years."
"But only the tick can survive without food for a decade, which is why it's number 1!"
even as I put it in my last incarnation:
"""Everybody's got something to lose except for me and my monkey"""
Hi!
How can we survive without overusing nature's resources?
It's of vital importance here to maintain a balance.
"This is what we examine in this unit, focusing on fishing-- trying to find the best strategy that serves both humans and nature."
"On the way there, we encounter some fundamental concepts of differential equations and in the larger fleet of simulation."

THE CONCUBlNE  Concubine to the King Korean movie - 2012
"Once again, I am so sorry."
That one doesn't know front from back.
"It would have been nice to have your son join us, as well."
"No, not at all."
He isn't my son at all.
"At $60 the value of our option is $10, but we paid $10 for it."
"That's our break even, but then we make money after that."
This is from the perspective of the holder.
This is from the perspective of the holder of the call option.
This is the holder of the call option.
What would it look like if you're the writer of the call option?
If your the person selling the right to buy the stock.
"If this person right over here, if the holder has the right to buy at $50, someone must be selling them that right."
Someone must be agreeing to say hey I will essentially sell that to you at that price.
If you're the writer of the foot ... we have the holder in green.
The holder in green.
What if you're the writer?
You're essentially the counter party on that option.
You're the person agreeing to uphold that option.
"If the option never gets exercised, then the writer doesn't have to loose any money."
"If the option does get exercise, then all of a sudden, the writer starts to loose money."
"If the writer doesn't own the stock, and let's say the stock is at $60, this guy, the holder, can exercise his option to buy at $50."
The writer would then have to go buy the stock on the market for $60 and sell it for $50.
They would loose $10.
The writers payoff would look something like this.
Once again it's the mirror image of the payoff of the holder.
"If you think about the profit of the writer, if the option is never exercised, then the holder gets to keep the $10 that they were paid ... that they sold the right for."
"If the option is exercised, and they start to"
"loose money, and their break even once again is at $60."
"Anything below that, then they start to loose more and more money."
Once again these are the mirror images of each other.
If you were to add up these two line it would be break even.
These parties are the ones who are exchanging money between.
If this guys makes $10 this guys loosing $10 or vice versa.
Dr. Christopher R. Austin:
"Thanks, and it's great to be here."
I just want to make a couple of points.
"Since they couldn't pay me, I had no money to move,"
"I had to always go on foot, sometimes covering large distances."
Then I had two options:
Or I ate ...
Or paying service.
More often than not I ate!
"Therefore, the Ministry is not a choice, but it is something that is interlaced with your destiny and discover gradually that you grow up with God."
You can not escape.
"Then, I dedicated myself, and many more."
"I sweated, I cried, I gave blood for this Ministry."
"I asked for help, several times I've been betrayed, because well ... they are seen as a small anonymous preacher."
And then ...who wants to stand on the side of a poor failed?
"But in the end, you realize that from the evidence there is so much more and you don't stop, I can say that Gap was my life in these 12 years."
"It was what God used to form my character, and if I were to go back, confront all that I faced ...be called a beggar, a dreamer,"
"I'd never done anything, that I was a poor dumb because I was moving away from those ministries that would give me a lot."
I would do it all again.
Without thinking twice.
"Because I was granted the honour and grace to see lives reclamation, preparing Ministers fans who are not afraid of nothing, not even death."
"Then, Gap has been a passionate dedication of my heart."
Q:
Gap doesn't give you any financial support?
A:
No.
Q: are you working now?
"A: look, seeing the need that have the Gap, I always preferred full-time work.For this I've tried so far work .... but Gap does not remunerarmi, and I will soon find a job according to my education."
"The fact is that we always need a hand, this resource is our needs: we need more people possible, capable and with a real call. to help us."
"There are many cases of suicide in universities: people who have a desperate need, and what I need is not being able to do more."
It's always a drama to fail to muster enough people to do more.
"Q: you're invited to preach in other countries, travel a lot?"
A:
I've never traveled in my life.
"I preached a lot in Fortaleza, and I helped in the formation of leaders in these 10 years as a mentor."
"What do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the world greatest husband"
"Please, I was there when you were flirting with exgirlfriend, and neglected to tell her you were married."
I was there when you were trying to hook up with that waitress the day before you got engaged.
"And I was definitely there when you were hooking with that nasty ass stripper at ""Boobies, Boobies, Boobies""."
That wasn't me that was you!
"Yeah, I know, but I told her my name was Turk"
"The point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife,'cause you were trying to hang out with me"
"You know, maybe it's time you start acting like a real husband"
Stop acting like some sort of crazy cowboy
A cowboy?
"I don't know, it just came to me"
"You know I'm right, Turk"
When your pride 's at stake* you can't help but have questions
Just tell me how did you know what was bothering her?
"Tell me now, so we don't have to talk anymore, never."
"How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?"
"A lot of time, the answer is about sacrifice"
"I was thinking, you'd rather just stay in tonight."
"You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?"
You are trying to smile?
You're so damned cute.
"Sometimes, sacrifice is only wearing a new uni when you are not at work"
"Okay, how about this one,Three blue-jays fly into a bar &amp;amp; they say, ""we just want to wet out beaks*"
"No, sorry Dan, you tell one"
"Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride..."

"But ulitmately, big or small, sacrifices is about doing something you really don't want to do"

Really
"I mean, you guys need your space"
Thanks man
Thirteenth year back at Western and I coached a couple years right out of college so it's nice to be hear in Macomb and at Western.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you were the team was picked to finish 8th in the Summit League
Pre-Season Polling.
You think the team will exceed these early expectations with such a young roster?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's kind of hard to tell you know the...the ranking system is based on the Fall results and you know we have a very young team very inexperienced team to start the year and I think that we'll play much bettter this Spring just having known who's going to be playing and a little more experience under our belts.
So I look forward to the competition
I'm not sure about exceeding expectations but were obviously are going to do our best.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now the team finished 10th tied with 11 place with Boise State in the Pat Hicks Thunderbird Invitational how do you think the team did there?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well you know it's the first...first term of the year we've been playing in February now for I think this is our 8th year and you never know what to expect there.
But we really had some bright...bright spots in that tournament.
Andrew Godfrey played very well.
Kurt Slattery who's a transfer this semester he played very well too.
And some of the young guys did fine.
Konrad Deka had 72 in the last round.
So we had some bright spots the finish wasn't as high as what we'd hoped but we try not to take those things into consideration to highly at this point in the year.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you have know returning seniors on the team.
In your coaching career have you had to deal with anything like that before with such a young roster that doesn't get to play that hasn't played that much?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I don't I think it's more than just no seniors on the team.
We lost a lot of experience too.
So a lot of the players that we have this is their first collegiate experience.
It's different to not have seniors is one thing.
But to be going into the season knowing that you really didn't have anybody that have played the golf courses.
That really wasn't us to playing at the Division One level.
Those things are you know there's no substitute for experience.
I expect us to be a lot better just because of those things.
[Nick Spinozzi]
"Of course, the House of Representatives is very difficult there."
We're going to try to do more briefings and increase the bipartisan support for the program.
We have had some very encouraging republican interest shown recently in response to a lobby day that we did in
"February, and we'll keep working the Senate very aggressively."
"So, Bob thanks very much for those comments, and we'll have to watch closely for that $24 million set-aside for multi-family housing."
We'll watch how that plays out.
We just don't have the details right now.
Bob:
Right.
I'm aware.
Brad:
"So, I think that brings us to the end."
We have not received any further questions or comments.
We've had several people who have inquired about talking points for the member letter for the Senate.
"We'll be reaching out to you in the next several days, and yes we will send talking points out."
"That will be a very quick turn-around, and we do appreciate your help with that."
"We will have the audio portion on the NASCSP website no later than the end of the week, and we will have the slides available as well."
"Many, many thanks to our two guests who joined us today, Steve Capanna from the White House, and"
Elyse Wasch with Senator Jack Reed.
Senator Reed a great champion and she is the Senator's Legislative
"Director, and thanks to my colleague Arley Johnson, Director of Government Relations, and to Mark"
Schmeissing for your excellent presentation on CSBG.
And thanks also to Alice Gaston for her help in putting the webinar together.
"And thank you, our audience, for your patience for staying with us for almost 90 minutes."
We hope this was useful.
"We welcome your comments, and we'll take a survey of everyone who was on the line, and we apologize again for any audio difficulties at the beginning."
"Technology is always a work in progress, and we'll see that the next time around we don't encounter those problems."
Thank you for joining us.
Please let us know what you think of this presentation and enjoy the rest of your day.
Good afternoon.
Welcome back.

Holly Rae who?
"Oh, you know, just the fifth Dame that hasn't been around very much recently.."
Sorry about that guys
Hi!
So this week we are discussing women and comedy.
"And you'd probably be forgiven for thinking that there aren't that many women in the comedy scene,"
Man:
"But that's just because women are biologically more funny than women, everyone knows that..."
"For example, on the sculptures, there are 3 crescents, swastika, latin cross, inverted cross or moon and stars of the Turkish flag"
"When retouching or drawing onto them, it gives you the impression of supernatural things."
I'm not trying to give a message or
I don't have a political stance.
"That swastika is standing there actually for ignoring that, it becomes a figure in the picture or a character in the story."
It's the same with the signature.
For me there are 2 types of signature.
Signutare seems like artist's ownership in the work.
I don't believe that signutare is important.
I think the artist is like a screw.
The actual important thing is the artwork itself.
Artwork is like a gun or a toy.
"As I said before, the big signatures that I make, are like symbols and for ignoring this behaviour."
I use the handwritings in the same way
"For example, if there's an empty part in the picture, the handwriting might come right there, I write my name etc."
"If there's not a catchy sentence or word,"
I can simply wirte my name there.
It can be offensive for someone but at them same time it's pretty.
I will do the thing that I want to do with the painting here in this room.
"I will make copies, put them onto the wall, there will be a small video..."
"There's a video that I made, it will be here etc..."
"I collect images from google and make collages with these images,"
I will put them here as well.
These were going to be big sculptures.
"I actually wanted them to be bigger, but still, they are still a reference."
"When we went to see Derya with the paintings,"
she recommended us to show them to Christina and Nesrin.
One night we went to meet them at Galata with paintings.
"They got surprised actually, because normally people do this representation with pdf files or books."
"It was a nice evening though, we liked eachother and we decided to do the exhibition right on that evening."
"I will attend to an exhibition soon, in Koln."
"It's not ready yet, I'm on process"
I need super computers.
"So, what does Google do here?"
What does--why do we do this?
"Well, partly, at the end of the day, it's paradoxical."
We want to give people time back.
We want them to get you to an answer quickly.
"We want you to be more productive so that you can get back and give us the things that, that--the things that you enjoy, which"
I would argue or relay around people in society and culture and the things that all of us appreciate so much.
"So in our case, a new definition of Google would have--we're trying very hard to get you something fast."
"Never underestimate the importance of fast, quick, quick, quick."
We want it there.
We want it now.
We want to help you right now.
Speed matters because your time matters.
We make hundreds of improvements to search every year.
You see them gradually all over and over again.
The accuracy gets better.
The index gets much bigger.
You'll see some of the facilities in a sec now that we've done around translation and other kinds of annotation.
"We have one of the largest infrastructures now which we just introduced, which is internally known as Caffeine, which basically allow us to handle even greater, greater indexes and many more information."
"Now, what are we going to do with search?"
"Ultimately, search is a personal activity."
"So, ultimately, where search goes is it searches not just the web, but literally all of your information, your email--the things that you care about."
"This is with your permission, I might add."
"This is personal search for you and only you because ultimately, search is about finding what you want right now."
"And the next step of search, of course, is doing this automatically."
"So when I walk down the street of Berlin, I love history, what I want is I want the computer--my smartphone to be doing searches constantly."
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
This occurred here.
"Preached in many churches can say, but only on the outskirts of Fortaleza."
"Probably the major ministries do not know me, to tell the truth I am alone, like a drop in the middle of the desert."
"I'm just a man who does what he believes God has put in my heart, and I do not care about what others say."
"I don't care that God knows my heart, this is the most important thing."
Q: the big ministries missionaries know Gap?
A:
"No, I think not, I can't guarantee it."
Sometimes we try to establish contacts but ...
"Q: can't you feel kinda saddened because nobody pays you for what you do, for your sacrifices?"
A:
No.
Q: why don't we have been called to become famous.
The word says that we cannot be more than our master.
One of the things that most are horrified me is this idea of the Ministry set up blindly ...
"Watch, the helmsman's not you ..."
But the rower!
What obeys.
"Are not entered in the missions looking for earnings, but conscious of the sacrifices."
Got It?
"Usually we say that no one can be sure to be a servant of God if he has not first explored the depths of the disenchantment of oneself and the world, because the treasures that gives the world not a blessing but a priming."
There is one thing that happens sometimes ...
"God gave us the grace to spread the word about Gap for Fortaleza, but few have heard of me."
I see it as a gift in many ways because there is something in us that ...
It is difficult to explain.
The Bible doesn't say that to get something from Christ we need to deal with him.
It is he who tells us what is our call.
We trust in him then!
"There is a phrase that says ""join in the boat with God and return to port with him."" In short, don't you dare even to start without him, we do ours that ""dying"" expressed by Christ on the cross, dying to our dreams, and everything that we thought they needed ..."
I wish to remain clear that God has never abused my will.
"It was always patient, as in fix I've often complained."
"But I felt in these 12 years as say the Scriptures, that his goodness is perfect and good, I only had to align my heart closer to Her to figure it out."
"I don't know where I will go, whether I'll live a humble life."
We are reaching out to friends and  communities who are doing the same.
This is not new.
"It's a really broad area, it covers a lot."
I do not think we could cover it all in 6 days.
I think you know.
What is special here is that we are face-to-face.
"We get to hear from a real living being and from our heart,  not on a website or something."
You'll have time also afterwards  to approach our wonderful friends.
So this is the living Dharma as they will speak from their experience.
The panel is a way of reaching out and connecting and collaborating with others.
"We are doing similar things, bringing and helping education,  improving the purpose of education and creating techniques  and methods to help teachers, students as well as their parents and the whole overall."
So we can just start with the classrooms and it will touch everything.
"That is the core  of our teacher's teachings, interbeing."
"When you touch one student, one teacher, naturally you will have to deal  with all the other issues."
So we have here today our panel  that represents a very diverse area and they will share  their personal journey and how they have come  to the point here.
"Without any further ado,  I introduce brother Richard here, a wonderful friend in our community."
He will be introducing each member.
Richard Brady is also  a retired math teacher and he has inspired many people.
Having him to come up here is a gift.
I met his student  who came to Plum Village.
After many years he came and  we asked him:
"""Why are you here?"""
"He said; ""I used to take a class."
"My math teacher is Richard Brady."""
"So you can see, just one student's experience in a class, how later on in life,  he confronted suffering and he remembered the teaching and came to learn more about the practice."
There are many stories like that  but I won't hold up the panel here.
Thank you for being with us.
(Richard Brady) Thank you brother.
It is my honor to introduce some old and new friends to you.
It is a privilege to hear from them this afternoon.
"Each will speak for  about 8 minutes, not very long, but we want to leave some time  for questions and answers at the end."
"So, just focus on them and if there is any questions that come up afterwards, be ready to ask them."
So it's an open invitation.
"And, you know, when we—Cuba is accused of harboring terrorists."
"And when we look at the role of the United States and the United States government vis-à-vis Cuba, the United States government and the ClA have encouraged, trained, sent individuals to not only disrupt the Cuban economy by killing tourists, placing bombs in restaurants and hotels, but to assassinate Fidel Castro, and individuals who admitted that they were involved in the downing of a Cuban airliner in 1973."
I'm talking about Posada Carriles.
"Here was a man who made the open admission, trained by the ClA, harbored by the United States."
"When he was found in the United States, did the United States prosecute him for those crimes?"
No.
"They, on a pretext, prosecuted him for lying to the FBl, all right? and acquitted him of that."
AG:
"I wanted to go back to Assata Shakur when she was here, when she was imprisoned."
"This is a clip of a documentary, Eyes On the Rainbow:"
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"In this, Assata Shakur talks about her experience in prison."
AS:
"*Prisons are big business in the United States,*"
"*and the building, running and supplying of prisons has become the fastest-growing industry in the country.*"
"*Factories are moving into the prisons, and prisoners are forced to work for slave wages.*"
*This super-exploitation of human beings has meant the institutionalization of a new form of slavery.*
"*Those who cannot find work on the streets are forced to work in prison.*"""
AG:
That was Assata Shakur in the film Eyes On the Rainbow:
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"Lennox Hinds, you went to court to change the prison conditions that Assata Shakur was in after she was arrested."
Describe what happened to her after she was arrested.
"I mean, she was near death."
LH:
She was near death.
She was chained to her hospital bed.
"After she recovered, she was placed in an all-male prison."
She was under 24-hour surveillance by male prison guards who were watching and monitoring her very personal needs during that time period.
"We went into federal court and challenged the conditions of her confinement, where she was kept in solitary confinement for two years."
We won that case.
He's lazy.
And they gave kind of behavioral descriptions to something that wasn't behavioral at all.
"To be told over and over again, you're not quite cutting the mustard, it breaks down your self esteem."
And you have to go somewhere else to get your self esteem built up.
And kids get into trouble.
And they go looking for things that are more exciting than being told every day that you're dumb.
I think there's a huge payback for not providing kids with what they need.
"Just as the experts could have predicted, Adam turned to drugs and alcohol."
"When I drink, it's just to forget about everything."
"If I'm really having a tough time, I can't take this anymore, I just have to go drink some beers to let it all just get away."
There's been a lot of evidence of drug use.
"Continuously money being stolen, no matter where it was."
"We're kind of guilty of overlooking it, thinking, well, you know, so he needs some money."
"But when he gets into the thousands, you know, we've let it go too far."
And it got there.
"Then, one night, the phone call every parent dreads."
We get a phone call from the state police.
I thought he's getting ready to tell us that somebody been killed.
"I thought about, how do you plan a funeral for a kid who doesn't seem to want to be part of your family anymore, doesn't want to be a kid?"
Adam was safe but in deep trouble.
The police claimed that he had crashed a stolen car.
"The next morning, Terry took his 15-year-old son to the psychiatric ward at Boston Medical Center and had him committed."
I've had my son hospitalized to give him some attention.
"I mean, he could have been killed that night."
And he was out that night because he skipped school that day and didn't want to come home.
So he was out that night.
"I mean, how many more chances does he have?"
"After years of academic failure, Adam's slow, downward spiral was turning into every parent's nightmare, a teenager too far gone to rescue."
His parents will soon be confronted by that terrible prospect.
"But right now, the story of another young boy sending alarming signals that he is headed for trouble."
"His parents, desperate for help, can feel him slipping away."
"10-year-old Nathan Suggs lives in rural Bear Creek, North Carolina where he"
It's designed for other people too.
We should think about everyone living in our city.
"We need more things designed for everyone."" Babies, children, young people and old people are living in our city."
Some people are physically challenged.
We sometimes care about only ourselves but we should care about those people too.
"As a person living in this city, I want to make everyone happy."
It's important for us to think about things from other people's points of view.
That's the thing I learned in this class.
Let's work together to have a better life in our city.
Hey guys.
Welcome to another episode of Drive Clean.
"I'm Larry from ammonyc.com, where we're obsessed with driving and protecting cars."
"Now, on today's episode, we're going to be working on a 1958"
Porsche Speedster.
"Now, the paint is totally wrecked, so we're going to restore it."
That's all coming up today on this episode of Drive Clean.
[MUSlC PLAYlNG]
"Before we get started, I want to thank all you guys for the emails and comments I received since the first episode."
"They've been spectacular, and I'm really grateful for them."
"But the cool part is I've actually kept track of everything you suggested, and we're going to try to incorporate them into the upcoming episodes."
"So for today, we're going to restore this 1958 Porsche Speedster."
"Now, I think the problem was they washed it improperly, and nobody took care of it, didn't put a cover on it and left outside, so the paint is totally wrecked."
"Now, the first question you want to ask yourself is whether you want to clean, protect, or restore the paint."
"Now, obviously, in this condition, it's so bad, we're going to need to restore the paint."
"Now, the second question is what year is the car and has it been repainted?"
"Now, this particular car is a 1958, but it's been repainted in modern times."
"So now I know there's clear coat on it, I can approach it differently."
"Now, the third question is a little bit more complicated."
It's deciding whether the paint is hard or soft.
We're going to talk about how to figure that out in the upcoming steps.
"So this episode is going to be a little bit more complicated, because we're really going to geek out."
And it is really helpful for me as a teacher.
"I read once somewhere, that we make more decisions  during the course of our work day than any other professions  except surgeons."
No wonder we are so exhausted  at the end of the day.
"So, taking that time for me  with my students at the start of the classes  is tremendously helpful."
I also do deep relaxation with them.
"I actually only want to do it  once every two weeks because of training, we have so much  that we need to go through, but they put together a petition  that said ""We want deep relaxation at least once a week""."
"Beginning anew is another practice  that you are going to learn about, and I use that to mediate conflict and  also I use it with my students when I want one-on-one conference with them."
"So, we have a clean slate with each other and also own up for any unskillfulness I've had."
That is the authenticity piece.
"Naming, when you yourself  as a teacher have been unskillful,"
I think it is really powerful.
"The practice of loving kindness, often times, I also start the class with that."
"I'm really happy... (Bell) to be here and hear more questions about integrating practice into classroom, you can feel free to find me anytime."
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Meena."
"Our third speaker is Michele Chaban,  also from the University of Toronto."
"She is co-founder and co-director of the Inter-professional Applied  Mindfulness Meditation Certificate, which has five different strands,  it is a very large program."
She is the one who got it going.
"Michele, why don't you share with us?"
"(Michele Chaban) Good afternoon everybody, I'd like to begin with offering a blessing to you, for those of you who are teachers formally and for the rest of us  who teach informally."
May you be well.
May you be healthy.
May you be whole everyday.
May you be happy.
May you be supported  from within and above you.
"And may you continue  with your good work, because together we will change the world."
I am so pleased to be here  with you today.
"I guess we have been asked to speak  a little bit about ourselves,so here I go."
I used to be a model for Elizabeth Art  in Canada and it was a wonderful life.
"And one day, a drunk-driver ran into me  and took my legs and my arms away from me."
"And in years that ensued,  I lost my ability to talk and walk."
I kept my mind andI lost my body.
And science didn't have the resources to be able to help heal me and I waited.
"So, let's take the extreme case scenario, you are doing a regular job and you know 40 years from now, you are going to retire."
"My point there is, you have more control on that, but sometimes people don't."
People have jobs where they are dependent on their employer on how many years they work?
"But forgiven, I mean you won't go to a financial advisor and say, how many years do I retire?"
"The person will give you an answer but [laugh] , you know, will charge you a lot money for giving the answer, right?"
"So the 40 is also information that you should know, 10,000 is the information you should know and now the eight%."
I'm going to violate the assumption that I said make at the back of your mind.
"But to be fair, I never said assume is not there."
"I said, I know it's there, keep it in the back of your mind, but for convenience's sake, ignore it."
And that is risk.
"So, let me ask you this, who determines the eight%?"
"And if you can answer that, you have arrived."
And the answer is simply nobody.
"If, if anybody knew what the interest rate was in the future for the next 40 years or something, you know, they would, they would be omnipresent."
They would know the future.
We are wanting to be like that.
But I think the beauty of
life is nobody knows.
"And in fact, one of the most profound developments in Finance in recent years, I, I should recent say last 40, 50 years that gets challenged because it's a good idea."
"Bad ideas don't get challenged, right?"
Good ideas get challenged.
"So, the notion there is that nobody in a good market should be able to tell the future because everything we know is already in the marketplace, right?"
That's why I said competitive markets at the beginning are extremely important to what we do.
"So, quick question."
Who determines the eight%?.
And the answer is you.
And this is where I have to bring in risk a little bit.
Why?
"Because eight percent let me tell you, if you get over the next 40 years, may the force be with you."
[laugh].
Because it is not going to be easy.
"You have to take risks to get high rates of return, and with risk comes volatility."
"From then on we danced together, no matter where or when; waiting for the underground or the bus stop."
"And we are still like that today after 10 years that when we are going to a dance, we just walk faster"
We just want to arrive and start dancing!
"Unconventional, without prejudice and full of life energy; Lindy Hop is more than just a dance!"
John:
"Hi, I'm John Green."
"This is Crash Course World History and, today, we're going to discuss, wait for it, the Mongols!"
(wild galloping music)
So you probably have a picture of the Mongols in your head.
"Yes, that's the picture."
"Brutal, bloodthirsty, swarthy, humorously mustachioed warriors riding the plains, wearing fur, eating meat directly off the bone, saying, ""Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar."""
"In short, we imagine the Mongol Empire as stereotypically barbarian, and that's not entirely wrong."
"But, if you've been reading recent World History textbooks,"
"like we here at Crash Course have, you might have a different view of the Mongols, one that emphasizes the amazing speed and success of their conquests."
How they conquered more land in 25 years than the Romans did in 400.
How they controlled more than 11 million contiguous square miles.
"And, you may even have read that the Mongols basically created nations"
"like Russia, and even Korea."
One historian has even claimed that the Mongols smashed the feudal system and created international law.
"Renowned for their religious tolerance, the Mongols, in this view, created the first great free trade zone,"
like a crazy medieval Eurasian NAFTA.
"And, that's not entirely wrong either."
"Stupid truth, always resisting simplicity."
(upbeat lively music playing)
So remember herders?
"We talked about them, back in Episode 1, as an alternative to hunting and gathering or agriculture."
Here are the key things to remember.
1.
Nomads aren't Jack Kerouac.
They don't go on random road trips.
They migrate according to climate conditions so they can feed their flocks.
2.
"Andfor real man, this is it."
You know.
"I've talked about how I faked rage when it came out to these stupid memes that I wanted to be popular and that sort of thing, man."
Don't get it wrong.
"The rage as it pertained to the political and the social components and the capitalist components, they were genuine."
They were 100% genuine.
"As a matter of fact,"
"I was a pretty livid guy back in the conservative days, man and believe it or not, I had health problems during that time."
"I had a lot of health problems that that .... that were inspired or transpired because of me thinking about all these subject, you know."
"And believe it or not,"
"I found that utilizing this show as a way to exert all that angst that I had was comfortable and if somebody listened, that's fine."
"If they didn't, you know, it's good."
"I mean, it didn't really-- I didn't really do it for the money."
"I mean, if I did it for the money,"
I would be -- I would've put out books and shit.
"I would've done that shit, but... anyway..."
"It is necessary, are you kidding me?"
It is necessary.
"No, the show's not gonna be back this fall."
"No, no, no."
"Fuck no, I am not going to fucking continue to fucking have a venue for these idiots to, you know, I don't know, to do whatever it is that gets them off or whatever whatever it is that sustains the continuity of these sons of bitches as it relates to their goddamn trollin'."
"Well, I'm just not gonna do it anymore."
"I'm done here, man."
"I see we got a whole bunch of people here so I'll stay in here for a few more minutes, but it's over man."
"I mean, like I said, I'll come into this room and not to mention, the people that I have talked to about making actual businesses with, I am not joking, you know what I mean?"
I'm not joking about that whatsoever.
"I am sincere when I say that you know, I want to make businesses."
"I want us to make money, you know."
And ...
I'm sincere when I say that man.
But I got a lot on my plate on top of all this stupid online ridiculous bullshit.
"You know, a lot of people depend on me for a lot of shit and I know it seems that"
(Voice effects)
(Music)
Like this.
(Music)
"So, loosely defined, that is what's possible with the human voice."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
(Applause)
Could you answer some questions about the socia webs?
"Yes,of course"
Where are you from?
I'm from Holland.
Does technology influences your daily life?
"If, in everything that surrounds me."
Do you think that technology is important to survive or could you live without it?
"Not survive without it, it has become a necessity."
What kind of technology do you use?
"Mobile phone, tablet, gaming consoles, computer, and music player etc."
Do you dependent on some technology?
"If, to communicate with other people"
Do you know use social networks?
"Yes, are very simple to use"
How do you think the world has changed thanks to technology ?
"Technology has completely changed the way of life of the people, how they work, how they speak, and its needs changed."
Is all thanks for your time.
"Ellen Langer, as we move increasingly towards an information society away from muscle power increasingly to brain power, how to think how to learn."
"Yet, you've introduced the concept of ""mindfulness"" that really challenges what is the most effective way of learning."
"Walk us through what the basic principles of what ""mindfulness"" are."
"I think the best way to understand it is to realize that all that we've learned and the way that we've learned how to learn teach us to search for ""certainty."""
Because then you think you know it.
"Uh huh -- but ""certainty"" leads to ""mindlessness."""
"That once you know something so well, that you don't have to look at it again, you don't know it all... because things are constantly changing."
"And essentially mindfulness is the act of drawing the distinctions, noticing the novelty."
You're violating copyright.
I also encourage you to look at the other textbooks and don't worry about which edition it is.
The fundamentals are the same.
"So choose a reference for yourself, but please recognize I'm not following any specific textbook, page by page."
"If I were, this class wouldn't be very useful you know."
So I am doing the
"Essence of Finance at an introductory level, but you need to have some references and there are several options."
So make a choice soon.
Finally the material that is kind of come second in importance to the videos is all the assignments and I've talked enough about them.
But I would encourage you again to do the assignments.
Try them even before looking at the video.
"You k now, that's a, that's a kind of a challenge to try to understand what's going on."
Test yourself all the time.
"I'm going to now, talking about this thing, I'm going to move over to how do we evaluate."
Why are we evaluating you?
"Because we will give you a certificate, and the certificate has to have some criteria, right?"
I'm not a big fan of grading.
"In fact, I feel that's the least enjoyable part of my life, and partly because it's kind of boring, but also because who am I, You know."
"I mean you are learning, you should be able to grade yourself, and so on."
But the world is complex so lets talk about evaluation for a second.
"It'll be pass, fail."
So how do I determine pass or fail?
"You'll get a certificate if you pass, you will not get a certificate."
So my grading philosophy is very simple.
"It's not mine, it's borrowed from my reading of grading in particular."
"And basically the notion here is, do you know enough?"
Rather than do you get 100%.
So in each assignment.
You have to get 70%.
"If you don't get 70 percent on any one assignment, you cannot get a certificate."
"Similarly you have to get 70 percent on the final, which is in the last week."
"You don't have an assignment in the last week, but you have a final."
"Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state?"
"You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing, you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry."
"You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"""
"I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye, dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers."
"I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day."
"""And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively, it might be time to think about it."
"Because, dude, you know, four years."""
"You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin, thoughts are bouncing around."
"And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn't change, in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally."
"And now, when I talk about the show,"
I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.
"I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong, some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not."
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.
"As a group, they're the happiest people I know."
"And I don't want to start whistling ""Look for the Union Label,"" and all that happy worker crap."
I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work.
I swear to God --
I did it with them.
They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.
And I see it over and over and over again.
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows.
Follow your passion -- we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?
Probably the worst advice I ever got.
(Laughter)
"You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?"
"I mean, that's all I heard growing up."
"I didn't know what to do with my life, but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out."
"I can give you 30 examples, right now --"
"Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine."
Why?
"I have a speech prepared, but..."
I don't know if it's for the toast.
I didn't know I was gonna lead the toast.
[laughter]
Be prepared next time!
[laughter]
Bring your walking legs.
[laughter mixed with gasps]
Okay.
Now this is something uhh...
"I didn't know I was gonna give a speech today, but"
"I happen to type at 30,000 words per minute, so... in the time that I was up there I quickly whipped something up for you, Bayley and Megan."
"I promise you, it will be the most touching thing you've ever heard in your entire life."
[laughter]
More touching than the vows?
Yes.
[laughter]
Fornication such as this...!
Wait... [hesitant laughter]
"For an occasion such as this, it is very important to recognize the people that put their time and effort into making this a reality."
"So thank you... me, for working to make sure that this thing went off with out a hitch... power issues aside."
I wasn't a part of that.
"And thank you, me, for almost making it right on time for the rehersal."
"And thank you, me, most of all for taking time away from myself to recognize the efforts of the little people - Megan, this isn't a dig at you, don't worry, those are coming later, but instead I mean all the people that weren't me and still gave their (less important) time and energy to... decorating..."
"This means to clap, monkeys."
[applause and laughter] feeding us all... [applause]
"and finally, thanks to you for having me here, which lets face it, was  the most important thing to happen today."
"Now, as many of you already know, my name is David Sprague."
"And, as many of you have felt strangely compelled to point out, some of you doing so cruelly within ear shot of the groom, I am the best man here today."
"Don't get me wrong, I understand that I am great, but come on people; this is supposed to be Bayley's special day."
"He has had to hear just how great I am every single day since well before he even met me, so can we please just give him one day free of constant reminders that I am better than him?"
"For those of you that haven't been to a wedding, this is normally the part of the best man speech where I would point out that the groom is actually the best man here because the bride is marrying him instead of the person titled ""best man"", me."
That's just people trying to increase available calories.
But one revolution leads to another.
"And pretty soon you have this, as far as the eye can see."
"Many historian also argue that without agriculture we wouldn't have the bad things that come with complex civilization, like patriarchy, inequality, war, and, unfortunately, famine."
"And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser."
"Without it, humans would never have changed the environment so much, building dams, and clearing forests, and more recently drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer."
"Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean that that was the right choice?"
"Maybe so, and maybe not."
"But regardless, we can't unmake that choice."
And that's one of the reasons why I think it is so important to study history.
"History reminds us that revolutions are not event, so much as they are processes."
"That for tens of thousands of years, people have been making decisions that irrevocably shaped the world that we live in today."
"Just as today we are making subtle, irrevocable decisions that people in the future will remember as revolutions."
"Next week, we are gonna journey to the Indus River...very fragile our globe."

This is a place
That I call my home.
"8's Head, here we go.."
"Okay, number off from bow when you're ready, nice and loud"
Number off
Easy.

That'll do.
Easy
"Where are we at, guys?"
"Rich, you ready?"
"When x is equal to 0, why is equal to 0."
So the y intercept is 0.
So we know that this has a form y is equal to mx where m is a slope.
Let's figure out the slope.
Slope is equal to change in y for a given change in x or change in y over change in x.
"So when we increase x by 1, how much are we increase-- or decrease y by?"
Well then y increases by 2.
"So we could say that equals y changes by 2, by plus 2 when x changes by plus 1."
"So we get the slope is equal to 2, so the equation of this"
line is y is equal to 2x.
Which is choice B.
Next problem.
Which point lies on the line defined by 3x plus 6y is equal to 2?
Well the best thing to do is just probably to substitute these numbers in for x and y and see which one works.
"Changes to Rumble, Urgot, Cho'Gath, and the Tribunal, covered in this episode of the Patch Preview."
"Welcome, summoners."
"I'm Phreak and I'm here with Morello, Lead Champion Designer."
Together we'll be discussing some gameplay changes coming into the next update for League of Legends.
"While this video does not cover every single change, it will explain the thought process behind some of our decisions."
Rumble seemingly came out of nowhere and was suddenly an overpowered champion.
"In this patch, we'll be lowering the damage amplification from being in the Danger Zone as well as reducing the damage of Flamespitter."
"What's the story here, Morello?"
"We over-buffed Rumble in the Jayce patch, but no one really saw that change because we didn't do any other balance changes with that patch."
Basically we did a bug-fix that made Flamespitter more reliable so you'd get full damage out of the spell more often.
The damage on Flamespitter was extremely high and was balanced for when it was broken.
We're bringing the damage value to something that's much more reasonable for the way it behaves now.
"We really like the Danger Zone gameplay, but we had to re-evaluate the numbers on it."
"You'll still feel good for using Danger Zone effectively, but not 30% stronger good."
Last patch we gave Urgot a whole slew of nerfs aimed at his ability ranges and damages.
"This patch, we're reverting the damage change on Acid Hunter, meaning its base damage is going back up and the attack damage ratio is going back down."
Why are we reverting this change?
Our goal when balancing champions to let them shine in their own special niche.
"I'm on the, on the, on the course forums or in whatever social media hangouts you're using."
"And, if you haven't joined a group yet to work with and discuss the questions with,"
I strongly advise you to do that.
The only one I want to look up from
Assignment one is question eight because this one has a little bit of mathematics in it.
It relates to that proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
And you'll recall from a lecture that a key part of that was taking this number N that you get by multiplying the first
little n primes together and adding one.
"And at the time, I actually mentioned that this number is not always prime, well, how do you prove that?"
"Well, you prove it by exhibiting a sequence of prime numbers for which it's not prime."
"So, you start by looking at the primes and you sort of say, well, two x three + one, in that case, you get seven."
Then seven is a prime.
"So, let's go one more, two x three x five + one, you get 31."
That's also a prime.
"Well, let's do another one, two x three x5 x seven + one, that's 211."
That's also a prime.
"Well, at this point, you might beginning to lose heart, but if you keep going just a couple more until you get two x three x five x seven x eleven x thirteen + one, then in that case you get 30,031, which is equal to 59 x 509, which is not prime."
"And so now, we've exhibited a number of this form."
Let me put parenthesis in here.
Just to separate things out.
Oops.
"You don't actually need them, because of the conventions that multiplication dominates over addition."
But let's put them in anyway.
"And in this case you check one, two, three, four, five, the first six primes, add one, you get a composite number."
"That shows that this number is not always prime, okay?"
And that takes care of assignment one.
First we'll deal with the controversial bit.
This car belongs to Ferrari.
And I'm probably not supposed to be driving it.
But I'm not going to dwell on that.
"Someone kind of subcontracted it to me, let's say."
What happens when we have different denominators?
"Well, hopefully it won't be too difficult."
Let's say I have one fourth plus one half.
Let's go back to that original pie example.
Let me draw that pie.
"So this first one fourth right here, let's just color it in, that's this one fourth of the pie."
And now I'm going to eat another one half of the pie.
So I'm going to eat one half of the pie.
So this one half.
I'll eat this whole one half of the pie.
So what does that equal?
"Well, there's a couple of ways we could think about it."
"First we could just re-write one half. one half of the pie, that's actually the same thing as two fourths, right?"
There's one fourth here and then another one fourth here.
"So one half is the same thing as two over four, and we know that from the equivalent fractions module."
"So we know that one fourth plus one half, this is the same thing as saying one fourth plus two fourths, right?"
"And all I did here is I changed the one half to a two fourths, by essentially multiplying the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by two."
And you can do that to any fraction.
"As long as you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, you can multiply by anything."
That makes sense because one half times one is equal to one half.
You know that.
"Well another way of writing one is one half times two over two. two over two is the same thing as one, and that equals two over four."
The reason why I picked two is because I wanted to get the same denominator here.
I hope I'm not completely confusing you.
"Well, let's just finish up this problem."
"So we have one fourth plus two fourths, so we know that we just add the numerators, three, and the denominators are the same, three fourths."
"And if we look at the picture, true enough, we have eaten three fourths of this pie."
Let's do another one.
Let's do one half plus one third.
"Well once again, we want to get both denominators to be the same, but you can't just multiply one of them to get -- there's nothing I can multiply three by to get two, or there's no, at least, integer I can multiply three by to get two."
And there's nothing I can multiply two by to get three.
So I have to multiply both of them so they equal each other.
The film begins as a proper horror film with this mysterious ghostly ship coming through the mists.
"And the score cycles through all of it's motifs; there is a suspense score, and there is a mysterious music track."
"And then, The extra-diagetic music goes away and we start to listen to what's on the set of this dock."
And that's where things start to get interesting.
So let's watch and listen to how Robson and Lewton set up sound at the beginning of Ghost Ship.
[music]
It's the beginning of our score.
[music]
And now we hear the harpsichord and the blind man off screen.
What we see are these knives.
So that violent motif is set up right away.
And there's a distance between what we see and what we hear. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [music]
"Me, give me some time to blow the man down. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Good luck. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Thank you, sir."
"Being a sailor, you'll need luck."
"A young sailor, too. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Now so, the blind man cannot see, but he hears very well."
Speaker:[inaudible] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And he seems to speak the truth.
"He knows that a hero is an officer by the sound of his bag, that will come in a moment."
"And he also knows that this is a bad ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; You've got a blind man's tricks for telling what men are like, but ships [inaudible]. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; So, it begins with this foreboding of a man who cannot see but hears, and as our hero walks up the plank listen."
"Blow the Man Down, the song reappears."
Now Blow the Man Down is an interesting song.
It's a song about beating a sailor who's been insubordinate and it's also a song about ships on rough seas.
There's a song of great foreboding and terror.
"And yet it's introduced gently here as though it's just a man singing about a, a quaint song about going out to sea."
"Now, things get even stranger and more interesting when we are introduced to Finn."
So listen to how the music works at this moment.
Speaker:[music]
I'm the third officer.
Where can I find the Captain? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; There's our knife again.
Gestures with the knife.
"Now watch when we cut around, and listen to the music."
[music]
"Hear that as that smoke comes in, we get the mysterium theme."
I am doing my best.
Please don't be long.
Your absence makes it even more unbearable.
- I'll be on my way soon.
- When is your flight?
"Okay, dear."
See you tomorrow.
"- I love you, my love."
- Me too.
I love you too.
Your grandma is saying hello.
- Vural?
- I've heard.
Thank you.
They won't rob our truck I hope.
He said the park is open 7/24.
"It not only has audio, video and images, but for the first time, it's a broadcasting medium that can except a whole lot of text."
"So, there's a whole lot of stuff typically going on at once."
Its also a great interruption system.
"It's feeding us messages, alerts, our access notices, tweets, Facebook updates all the time and again that's one of its powers as a medium, but it's also very distracting."
"And finally, and due to many of those, its encouraging a constant multitasking, constant juggling of visual stimuli as well as actual jobs."
So I think it's all those things combined.
PETER NORVlG:
"Now one of things that stuck me, you cite Maryanne Wolfe, whose an expert in this area, and she says 'the web returns us to the time of scritura continua', which is like the Latin script where there are no spaces in between words and supposedly its an additional cognitive task to be able to separate that out into spaces and so deciding not to click on a link is this additional cognitive blow."
"Now ironically, that paragraph had a footnote at the end of it."
And looking up that footnote took me about twenty to thirty times longer than it would've taken if I would've had that book online and really got me out of the flow and I got really distracted.
(Laughter)
"And I also wanted to say that from what I know of the task of word segmentation, it's really not that difficult."
That Chinese and Japanese don't have spaces between words; they have no problem doing that.
I have a little example from my text book where I have a ten line program that does word segmentation with ninety percent accuracy.
So that not really so bad and maybe hyperlinks are so bad either.
"And maybe, its that we have to train ourselves that"
How much commercial relationship do we have?
There's the point of maintaining our values and doing things in a way that represents our values and be where people are.
There's often no easy answer.
In the past we had voted we will go where people are.
That's how we have impact.
We could be an open source project.
We were a very successful open source project in 1999 where we had thousands of people already contributing to Mozilla.
We were irrelevant to the marketplace.
We were irrelevant to consumers' lives and irrelevant to citizen's lives.
And we changed that with Firefox by consciously deciding to go where people are.
"We even did a commercial relationship with Google and Yahoo, which of course turned out after the fact to be what sustains us going forward."
But we did those commercial relationships because we wanted their searchs and we thought that they would be good.
"Now, after the fact, it turns out they generated the money that allows us to grow."
So sustainability is also an important piece.
How do you build those relationships in a way that have Mozilla values in them?
We've done that before and we'll continue to do that.
And now I'm trying to think about...
Do we wanna have questions?
Has everybody asked the questions they have?
I can keep talking or we can go on to questions.
"I do wanna close at the end, but go ahead."
[Question]
So we knew that... so we shipped Firefox 4...
"Firefox 1, in November 2004 and we had a goal of, I don't know, 10 million downloads in 30 days, which we past in 10 days."
So we knew by December that the amount of money we would be getting was beyond our expectations.
We didn't know how far it would go.
"So we had been hoping to be able to generate enough revenue to sustain those 10 people, or 12 people."
"At the time, we didn't even know how to sustain those."
"By January 1st, we knew that we would be able to do that."
The response to Firefox 1 was sort of the stuff of dreams.
"Now, it turns out, those were also stressful times."
What happened?
He's probably not going to be real happy with you.
"So, you know, just, keep, keep that kind of thing in mind."
"You're dealing with, with people's emotions."
"Another thing another aspect of, for consideration, with respect to risk acceptance is benchmarking."
"So, there's got to be, a, an explicit acknowledgement by top management with respect to what, what level of risk the organization is willing to accept."
"Now, you guys all work for organizations with, with a, with a few exceptions for which this sort of thing should be happening."
How many of you are aware of what management has specified as being the risk tolerance of your organization?
Not even one?
[LAUGH]
Okay.
"So, I mean, that's, that's kind of scary."
That's kind of scary.
"Cuz if you don't know what the risk tolerance is, how can you put a framework in place, that's going to achieve managements expectations?"
"You're shooting in the dark, right?"
"And you know, you're not going to fix it over night, but just something to, to be aware of."
[INAUDlBLE]
They have no tolerance.
"They, they were all went through it out."
"A fool proof, a fool proof system."
Towards somewhere else.
Sorry.
[INAUDlBLE]
"Somewhere, somewhere else, I'm serious."
They work somewhere else.
What has been mandated Yeah.
"Because that's what where, that."
Before you cannot possibly accomplish.
"No, but they announced it publicly."
You can't fail.
"How much did they announced that can't fail, control?"
"Yeah. , I mean, you know, realistically, you're probably, you know, it's easy for me to say, you know, go work somewhere else."
"But, if you think about the fact that everything about your job, both the tangible and intangible rewards can ultimately be tied to how well you achieve management's objectives."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"My name is Marianne Thieme and I'm a Member of Parliaments for the Party for the Animals in the Netherlands, and our party is the very first in the world to champion the rights of non-humans in a national parliament."
"However, there are other problems in the world aside from animal welfare."
So tonight I am going to tell you some very hard truths about what we are doing to our planet.
And I am so pleased that you are ready to face up to these realities ...
"If you look at the ten hottest years ever measured, they have all occurred in the last fourteen years."
The world is heating up fast and we have ourselves to blame.
Global warming is real and we humans are almost certainly the cause.
"Global warming, that's the world's greatest current concern."
Everyone finds themselves in its grip.
From scientists to politicians to the
Secretary General of the UN and even Leonardo di Caprio.
We face a convergence of crises.
Industrial civilisation has caused irreparable damage.
"By the middle of the century, there may be 150 million environmental refugees."
"Not only is it the 11th hour, it's 11.59."
"But, it's that other film, made by Nobel Prize Winner Al Gore, which has truly succeeded in putting this global problem on the map."
An Inconvenient Truth was a real wake-up call to the world!
This was a great achievement for Al Gore.
"However, he forgot something rather important."
The consequences of global warming are enormous.
The climate researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have estimated that by the year 2100 one to three billion people will be in dire need of fresh water.
Hunger will increase throughout large parts of the globe.
"So, it should come as no surprise that global warming is currently our foremost concern."
Everyone who has seen Al Gore's film knows that our Earth is in bad shape.
Greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced.
This is on the agenda of every world leader.
The causes of global warming must be dealt with now.
And so together we must identify the greatest emitters of greenhouse gasses in our society.
What do you think?
What are the sources of greenhouse gasses?
We discovered it last year at WOWODC.
It's basically telling Oracle to work in the 8I mode.
You lose all your 10G features.
"OK, next one I'll go through pretty quickly."
"Awake from insertion, it's the EO constructor."
If any of you have ever tried to use the actual Java constructer in your enterprise objects you probably quickly discovered that wasn't really a good thing to do.
"If you want to do your initialization in awakeFromlnsertion, it's the place to set defaults for your enterprise objects."
The little known fact that I want to point out today is that it can get called more than once.
"Two cases have been pointed out recently, Java client and nested editing context can result in this getting called more than once."
In order to protect yourself the best practice is to check to make sure a value is null before you set the default.
"If not, then probably something else has been done with that object and you don't want to go back to the default."
- There is also the init method you can override if you're using Wonder which checks whether it's a temporary global ID or not.
If you deleted an object from an editing context and do an undo on the editing context it gets reinserted.
"- Oh, that's another good point, yeah."
- You want to set up the default values there.
Use in it or check whether the global id is a temporary global ID or a non temporary.
"- OK, now a few quick Java ones, exception handling."
Don't do this.
How many times have I seen code...
I thought somebody would like that.
Don't write code like that.
Just don't do it.
"I've seen so many people do that and it's just,"
"""Oh, it will never happen."
"Don't worry about it."""
"Sooner or later, yeah, it does happen."
- What if you expect it and it won't hurt?
- Whatever you want to do in the privacy of your own application is fine with me.
- He's right.
That does occasionally happen.
"For me when that happens I always put a comment in that catch, and explain why I'm doing that."
Because someone is going to come back behind you and wonder... they'll think you're a bad programmer.
- And where else can you be found on the Internet?
Twitter? facebook?
"- Well, my Facebook account already died, but"
"I am always on Twitter. @FioreAlvarez, you find me there all the time."
"- Do you have some anecdote in your blogger - twitter experience, that you could highlight?"
"- Well, something really funny always happens to us because to every event we go, we devirtualize with the people."
"And it is really funny, because you are talking for 20-30 min. with a person, and suddenly you say, Hi I am Fiori Alvarez and the person gets surprised - ""really? so nice!"
"I follow you""."
"So, the relationship becomes so personal that you end up being a friend of a lot of people but, real friends, real solid friendships, as in 2.0 as in ????"
- Thank you Fiorela
"Now, given all this I will now draw a number of pie charts."
I want you to select the one that most closely resembles the distribution over here.
"Just for clarity, party A is depicted in red and party B in blue."
Please select exactly one of those pie charts.
"Basically, there are four methods for conducting a risk analysis."
"And, some of them come out of various guidelines."
ISO has this 13335 standard.
I don't know how many of you are you familiar with that one.
"You know, the one you hear a most about is, you know, 17799 which has now evolved into 27001."
"But, 13335 is guidelines for management of IT security."
"And, these four options that I'm going to talk about are, are, are out of that standard."

This video gives a live demonstration of the recursive constructs in sequel that we introduced in the previous video.
"As a reminder, recursion has been introduced intosequal as part of the with statement where we can set up relations that are defined by queries that themselves refer to the relation being defined, and finally we have a query that can involve the recursively defined relations as well as other relations or other tables in the database."
The typical expression within a with statement for a recursively defined relation would be to have a base query that doesn't depend on R and then a recursive query that does depend on R. We gave three examples in the introductory video and those are the same examples that we'll be demonstrated shortly.
The first one was to compute ancestors when we have only a parent relation and the family tree could be arbitrarily deep.
"And Mozilla has been blessed with all three: immense effort, tremendous skill and this luck that things appear."
"So, Mitch appeared and he essentially arm wrestled AOL for that seed money."
We look at the 2 million dollars and we thought that we could support maybe 10 people for two years.
"Because we had set down as mozilla.org and thought that to be effective as a project, the minimum number of people we needed was 10."
Running the machines was one person.
"You know, we keep the project alive but we couldn't be successful."
And Mitch had pitched a little bit of other money and IBM and Sun were our first commercial partners and they pitched in some money and started maybe with 12 or 13 employees.
What that meant was:
"Johnny Stenback and D Baron, that was the platform team."
"One person on Firefox for the front-end team, one person on Thunderbird, one release engineer,"
"Chofmann as an engineering manager,"
"Mick did the ultimate sacrifice and ran our systems for us, for a year or two before we were able to get him back into a role that really fit him better, we had one person helping us on sustainability,"
"Brendan as Brendan, and me trying to be successful."
And that was it.
And that seemed like a lot to us.
[Question]
"That's right, I forgot Asa"
How can I forget Asa?
[Question]
And project management.
And still.
"From that day till now, phenomenal."
"Whenever I have a problem with my browser, Asa is always able to figure out what it is."
So that's it.
No one else can ever do that.
[Question]
"All of a sudden, we had our own independence."
"It was pretty scary, 10 people is not really enough, there was no ongoing financial sustainability that we knew of, it was a gamble, but we had our own independence and we could make a product."
We made phenomenal changes in that period.
It was our second set of phenomenal changes.
"When we were founded we made up an organisation that was revolutionary, as Chofmann described."
How do you work with a company?
"We're saying that it's a negative emotion because it does, and I've seen it many times, actually stop a person's growth for weeks, for years."
"You're disabled for the time that you're grieving, until there usually comes a time when you transcend that, you go through it, past it."
"And the quicker that happens, the better.."
I would say.
And certainly if you look in the Buddhist texts the grief was never encouraged by the Buddha.
"He would always actually say that the wise person is beyond that grief, could understand the nature of life and death, and in that understanding could let that nature be."
And never fight battles which you can't win.
"There's a famous Buddhist story, it's in the Dhammapada, I'll just go on with this, it's a man who cried for the moon."
"A man who lost his only son, and would go to the cremation ground every evening to cry and cry and cry, and his family let him cry for a while."
"But when he was crying overmuch they wanted to find some way of overcoming his grief which was going on far too long, ruining his health and his business as I've seen happen."
"They hired an actor and the actor went to the cremation ground also, and the actor was crying more than the father who'd lost his son."
"When they met together, these two men crying their eyes out, the actor crying more, the actor asked, ""what are you crying for?"" He said, ""I've"
lost my son.
"He's dead..""."
"""What are you crying for,"" said the father to the actor."
"""I'm crying for the moon""."
"""What do you mean, crying for the moon?"" ""It's my birthday last week, and my father asked me - what do you want?"
And I said I want the moon please.
"And my father wouldn't get it for me, and I'm so upset.. I'm crying for the moon."" And the father said,"
"""You're stupid."
You're crazy!
Why are you crying for?
"No-one can give you the moon!"""
"""You call me crazy,"" said the actor, ""You're crying for your dead son."
At least you can see the moon!
"Where is your dead son?"" [laughter]."
"And at that, this is a story, an old story, in the Buddhist texts, at that, the man realised what he was doing, he was crying for something you can never get."
Grieving for something which you can't change.
"And that was enough for him to stop his grief, go back to work, and move on with his life."
"The story of the man who cried for the moon, in the Dhammapada."
"But as for John Howard, yeah we respect him, but we crack jokes about him."
People crack jokes about everybody in Australia.

This is a video about how Vi Hart creates her videos.
He is filming a video about how I actually make my videos but I am filming  a video about How I make a video about how I make a video...
She's famous for being YouTube's most popular Mathemusician and a Khan Academy employee.
"If you haven't seen any of her videos, go to  youtube.com/vihart and watch a few of them."
Vi aims to make videos that show math is cool and  she's doing a great job of achieving her goal.
"For example, ever since seeing her videos about plants and the Fibonacci spirals and Sponge Bob's pineapple when I watch an episode of Sponge Bob or see a pine cone,"
I've become aware of patterns I never seen before...
"Vi Hart has been featured in newspapers including the New York Times, on the YouTube home page several times, and on the YouTube channel ""The VlogBrothers"" from Hank and John Green."
"""Nerd fighters, Click here watch a Vi Hart video  and your whole life will be changed"""
"Well, who am I?"
"Well, I am Ethan Bresnick"
I am a student and short filmmaker.
"Although math is not my thing, making films is and I want to show you how Vi Hart makes her videos."
"Vi starts by writing a script, first."
"If you are interested in how she writes scripts, click on the link in the description below to  view an example of her script writing."
It takes Vi anywhere from a few hours to a  day to write a script for a doodling video
Videos that require research take up to a week or even a month!
"But sometimes it takes a few weeks, as in the  case of her ""What Was Up with Pythagoras?"" video, to make sure that nothing was embarrassingly wrong."
Vi spent several months researching and scripting her plant series of videos.
"For you tech geeks out there, Vi uses Microsoft Word on her work computer and Open Office on her home."
"Next, she shoots her videos."
"""Filming time!"""
Shooting is one of the shortest parts in her process.
"While she usually shoots her videos alone from start to finish, sometimes she offers supporting roles to a few of Khan Academy's interns and employees."
They are eager to help out.
We are just going to do the old switcheroo
You can finish out writing this 100 times.
Keep going!
"It kinda like, you smear it on the back of my hand."

"And near the ha nd, the garage is going to be low ends contracted."
"So, the garage is going to be even narrower than it really is."
"So, in the ladder frame we obtain the following picture and the two seem to be in conflict."
"In the picture on the left, the"
ladder is in the garage.
"In the picture on the right, there is no way the ladder could be in the garage cuz the garage is even shorter than its rest length which is as it is shorter than a ladder as we see at the top."
"You can make the puzzle sharper by saying, imagine that at the instant over here on the frame on the left where the ladder is inside the garage, I closed both doors."
What happens then?
Now
I have a ladder in the garage.
"Well, now it's not ambiguous."
The doors are closed.
"So, let's resolve this issue. there is, as always no real paradox."
There's only confusion.
"And the confusion, as I said, is always to do with simultaneity."
"And,"
I'll solve this problem twice.
"The first time, algebraically, using Lorentz"
Transformation.
"And then, I'll demonstrate, graphically how this solution works and along the way, play with space time diagrams, and what we can or cannot read off of them."
But I want to convince you that Lorentz Transformations are useful.
"So, to use Lorentz Transformations, what we do is, we have to be very careful that we're not talking about wishy-washy things, we want to be very specific about what are the things we're talking about."
"And the things we talk about are events, things that happened."
"And they happened a particular place, at a particular time."
"So what are the things we know? in order to use coordinates, I'm going to set up my usual space time diagram if you want, or my coordinates."
I'm going to have the black coordinates presenting the garage because
I'm thinking of the garage as at rest.
And the latter is moving to the right and its coordinates as seen by the garage are t prime and x prime.
I have to pick an origin for each of these.
"So I will pick the left end of the garage, remember the"
ladder is moving to the right.
So the left end of the garage is going to be the origin for coordinates on the garage.
Andrew Jackson
"Andrew Jackson originally known as Andrew Jackson, Jr. (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American politician. He was a General in the War of 1812. He later became the seventh president of the United States of America. He was the first Democrat and is on the twenty dollar bill. His nickname was ""Old Hickory"". He forced many Native Americans to leave their homeland so white people could live there, and many died. This was called the Trail of Tears."
Early life.
As a boy Andrew Jackson was a messenger for the Continental Army. The British caught him and mistreated him.
He was the first U.S. president who was not born into a rich family. He was not a rich man and did not have a college education. He moved to Tennessee and became a politician.
Military.
"During the War of 1812, he became a general and won the Battle of New Orleans which made him very famous. He joined the war because of childhood trauma that he had endured during the Revolutionary War; both his mother and his brother died during the war, and Jackson blamed the British and wanted to avenge his late loved ones."
Marriage.
"In 1791, he fell in love with Rachel Donelson Robards. They went through a marriage ceremony. However, the marriage was not legal because she had not been granted a divorce from her first husband. Therefore, they married legally three years later. They had no children, but they adopted several. He became rich and owned a large plantation."
Politics.
"In the 1790s Jackson was a member of the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, and the Supreme Court of Tennessee. In 1823 he returned to the Senate."
Andrew Jackson reorganized the Democratic Party and was its leader.
"In 1828, he defeated John Quincy Adams in the Presidential Election of 1828, he became president on March 4, 1829, and four years later he was re-elected to a second term as president. In the Nullification Crisis of 1832-1833, South Carolina declared secession from the United States. Jackson threatened war, and then compromised."
"In January 1835, Jackson was almost assassinated when an unemployed painter wanted to shoot him but both his guns jammed. He is the first president to have had an attempted assassination."
"During his presidency, he signed the Indian Removal Act which allowed the U.S. government to violently force the Native Americans to move from their land and go west. Many Native Americans were killed and the path they walked to get to the west was called the Trail of Tears."
Andrew Jackson was against the national bank of the United States because he felt that banks and their banknotes were for rich and powerful people and did not serve the interests of the common man. The national bank expired during Jackson's presidency. Jackson chose not to continue the bank.
"On March 4, 1837, Andrew Jackson finished his second term. After that, vice-president Martin Van Buren was elected president and continued many of the things Jackson did. Jackson was a big influence on other Democrats during the 1800s."
Legacy.
"Jackson's legacy among historians is mixed, going downhill, and heavily debated. Some have liked him because he was against aristocrats, bankers, businessmen, the British Empire, cities, and paper money, and in favor of ordinary country people. Some have disliked him for the same reasons and because he was in favor of war and against Indians."
Pillow
A pillow is a soft cushion that a person puts under their head when they are sleeping in a bed.
"A pillow is made from two pieces of cloth that are sewn together and stuffed with a soft material, such as feathers, duck down, or synthetic batting (man made soft stuffing). Pillows are usually rectangular. Pillows are covered with a fabric sheet called a pillowcase. The pillowcase protects the pillow from getting dirty."
"The word ""pillow"" comes from Middle English ""pilwe"", from Old English ""pyle"" (akin to Old High German ""pfuliwi"") and from Latin ""pulvinus"". The word ""pillow"" was first known to be used before the 12th century."
History.
"There is no clear inventor of the pillow. Millions of years ago, animals learned to use pillows. An early example is monkeys resting their heads on their arm. Many animals, including birds, use wood and stone nests as pillows. Many domesticated animals have also learned to make use of human-made pillows and cushions. They also rest on members of their own and other species for the same reason."
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.
"In ancient Mesopotamia, people slept on stone pillows. Pillows were a status symbol. Early pillows were rectangular and had grooves shaped for the head. Pillows showed the wealth of a person — the more a person owned the wealthier they were."
"Anicent Egyptians used pillows as a solution to back, neck and shoulder pain. They also prevented insects from crawling in their hair, mouth or nose at night. Anicent Egyptian pillows were made out of wood and stone and looked like stands. These pillows were mostly used for the deceased."

The university's intercollegiate athletics teams are known as the Ospreys, and are currently members of the Atlantic Sun Conference in NCAA Division I."
History.
"The university was founded in 1969 after midway between downtown Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches were set aside for the campus, of which were donated by the Skinner family of Jacksonville. Construction on classrooms and buildings began in 1971 and UNF opened in the fall of 1972 with an initial enrollment of 2,027 juniors, seniors and graduate students, supported by 117 faculty and more than 150 staff. Originally, like the other Florida state institutions opened around this time, UNF was designated as a ""senior"" college, meaning that it would enroll only upperclassmen and graduate students."

Water treatment
Water treatment is treating water to make it suitable to be used. Providing drinking water is one of the main uses of water treatment.
Many factories also need very clean water to make steam or to make high quality products. Some of this water has to be made very pure with almost no other chemicals dissolved in it.
Treating sewage so that it does not cause harm to the environment is another use of water treatment.
Which type of water is generally used in the treatment of water?
"Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used, reverse osmosis or distillation. Both methods require more energy than water treatment of local surface waters, and are usually only used in coastal areas or where water such as groundwater has high salinity."

How is water treated to make it drinkable?
"Filtration - The clear water on top passes through filters composed of sand, gravel and charcoal to remove dissolved particles such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses and chemicals. Disinfection - Chlorine or chloramine is added to kill parasites, bacteria, viruses and germs.Apr 14, 2016"
What is the difference between water treatment and water purification?
"Also known as water purification, water treatment is the process of removing potentially harmful impurities from drinking water. Unlike water filtration, water treatment systems can get rid of all unseen materials by chemically treating the water with iodine or chlorine. ...Nov 4, 2019"

Ted Marchibroda
"Theodore ""Ted"" Joseph Marchibroda (March 15, 1931 – January 16, 2016) was a former American football quarterback and head coach in the National Football League."
He started playing as quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He then played for the Arizona Cardinals when they were in Chicago.
He was a head coach for the Indianapolis Colts from 1975-1979 when they were in Baltimore. He returned to the Colts as a head coach in Indianapolis from 1992-1995. He was an offensive coodinator on several teams. Marchibroda was signed by the new Baltimore Ravens from 1996 to 1998 as their head coach. Marchibroda has since retired from coaching.

Art Modell was the owner of the Cleveland Browns from 1961 to 1995. Due to the team's financial and field troubles, Modell moved the team from Cleveland to Baltimore in a highly criticized move in 1995. However, Modell agreed to let the Browns' history stay. An expansion franchise, the ""reactivated"" Cleveland Browns, would begin play in 1999. With the new Baltimore Ravens, Modell won Super Bowl XXXV. He sold the team to Steve Biscotti before the 2004 NFL season."

Scuttled by PBS.
"The movie was approved for national broadcast in 1985, but that decision was rejected a year later. Many people believe that was censorship. B.J.Bullert commented that the PBS/KQED decision ""robbed a national public television audience"" . He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power."
Critics.
"B.J. Bullert, in his book ""Public Television: Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film"" protested what he viewed as censorship. He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the movie is widely accepted. Nat Katzman, former KQED station manager, disagreed. He is quoted in Bullert's book, saying ""It's more difficult to say (""Dark Circle"") falsified anything, but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda, not journalism""."
Point of view.
"The movie is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power. It is also about problems at the regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). However, there are numerous points in the movie in which the voices heard are those of the workers. We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management, and the lawyer for the NRC."

"Johnston's music career started in Austin in the 1980s. He made cassette tapes of songs he performed on a chord organ and gave many of them out for free to people he met. He started playing concerts and became very popular with music fans in Texas. Johnston appeared on MTV, and became even more popular when Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain wore a T-shirt with the cover art of one of Johnston's CDs."
"Johnston released one CD on Atlantic Records, a major record label (a big company that helps make CDs and sells them around the world) called ""Fun"" in 1994. However, he was not able to make any more CDs with Atlantic Records because not enough people bought ""Fun"". However, Johnston still writes songs, and his drawings appear on the covers of his CDs. His latest CD is ""Is and Always Was"", which came out in 2009."
"In 2010, movie director David Miller announced that he was writing the script for a new movie about Johnston that would be very different from ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston""."
"Johnston died of a suspected heart attack at his home in Waller, Texas on September 11, 2019. He was 58."

Treepie
"The treepies are a type of bird. They are a member of the crow family (""Corvidae""). There are four different genus of treepie. They are ""Dendrocitta"", ""Crypsirina"", ""Temnurus"" and ""Platysmurus"". There are 11 species of treepie."
"Treepies are similar to magpies. They have long tails. Most treepies are black, white, gray or brown. They are found in Southeast Asia. They live in tropical forests. They spend a lot of time in the tops of trees. They do not come to feed on the ground very often."
Velcro
"Velcro is a brandname and trademark owned by the Velcro Companies for ""hook-and-loop fasteners"". Hook-and-loop fasteners have a ""hook"" side, which is a piece of fabric covered with tiny hooks, and a ""loop"" side, which is covered with even smaller and ""hairier"" loops. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. When they are separated, they make a special ""ripping"" sound."
Creation.
"The person who invented hook-and-loop was a scientist named George de Mestral. During a hunting vacation in Switzerland, de Mestral came home one evening and tried to remove the burrs stuck to his dog's fur. He was very surprised to see how hard the burrs were to remove. That night he studied the burrs under a microscope and noticed that each burr was covered with hundreds of small hooks acting like grasping hands. De Mestral decided that this burr could be made to close fabric instead of buttons and zippers. By copying the hook pattern hat he saw on burrs, he made hook-and-loop!"
Vocabulary.
"George de Mestral created the Velcro trademark by combining the French words for velvet (""velour"") and hook (""crochet"")."
Mamane
"Māmane (Hawaiian language) is a shrub of Hawai'i in the ""Sophora"" genus. It is suitable for gardens."
"It is highly polymorphic, growing as a shrub or tree, and able to reach a height of in tree form. It is grow fast in every island of Hawaiian archipelago, so botanists describe many local forms including ""S.unifoliolata"""
"Hawaiian honeycreeper visits mamane sucking nectar,"
"If mamane were to disappear from Hawai'i it would take with it the palila bird, which is also endangered due to the lack of enough māmane trees. ""Loxoides bauilleui"", palila, feeds on unripe seeds of the māmane"
Mortality rate
Mortality rate is a measurement. It measures the number of deaths in a population.

A Man for All Seasons
A Man for All Seasons is a play by Robert Bolt about the life of Sir Thomas More that was first put on in 1960. It was made into a movie in 1966 that won the Best Picture Academy Award that year. It was also made into a TV movie in 1988.
Composite number
"A composite number (or simply a ""composite"") is a natural number, that can be found by multiplying prime numbers."
"For example, the number ""9"" can be found by multiplying ""3"" by ""3"". Another example is the number ""12"", which is obtained by multiplying ""3"", ""2"" and ""2""."
All natural numbers (greater than 1) can be put in one of the two classes below:
Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
"The Fundamental theorem of arithmetic (also called the unique factorization theorem) is a theorem of number theory. The theorem says that ""every"" positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers (or the integer is itself a prime number). The theorem also says that there is only one way to write the number. If two people found two different ways to write the number, the only thing that can be different is the order in which the primes are written. For example, we can write:"
"and if somebody else finds ""another"" way to write 6936 or 1200 as product of prime numbers, we can put those prime numbers in the right order and find out that it is the same as what we have here. Finding the prime numbers is called factorization."
This theorem can be used in cryptography.
Proof.
"The first person who proved the theorem was Euclid. The first detailed and correct proof was in the ""Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"" by Carl Friedrich Gauß."
"Some people may think that the theorem is true everywhere. However, the theorem is ""not"" true in more general number systems, like . This was first mentioned by Ernst Kummer in 1843, in his work on Fermat's last theorem. For more information about that: read ."
"The proof consists of two parts: ""first"" we show that every number can be written as a product of primes; ""second"" we show that if we write a number as a product of primes for a second time, then the two lists of prime numbers must be the same."
First part of the proof.
"We show that if ""not"" every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes, we end up in some kind of impossibility. So after that we conclude that it ""must"" be true that every number can be written as a product of primes."
"So, now see what happens when somebody says that he/she knows a positive integer, greater than 1, which can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. In that case we ask him/her to mention ""all"" the numbers, greater than 1, that can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. One of these numbers must be the ""smallest"": let's call it ""n"". Of course, this number ""n"" cannot be 1. Further, it cannot be a prime number, because a prime number is a 'product' of a single prime: itself. So it ""must"" be a product of numbers. Thus-"
"where both ""a"" and ""b"" are positive integers that are of course smaller than ""n"". But: ""n"" was the ""smallest"" number that can not be written as a product of primes. So it must be possible to write ""a"" and ""b"" as products of primes, because they are both smaller than ""n"". But then the product"
"can be written as a product of primes as well. This is an impossibility because we said that ""n"" can not be written as a product of primes."
We have now shown the impossibility which exists if the first part of the theorem would not be true. In this way we have now proven the first part of the theorem.
Second part of the proof.
Now we have to prove that there is only one way to write a positive number greater than 1 as a product of prime numbers.
"After some time, the tadpoles begin to grow legs: first the hind legs and then the front legs. Then they are called froglets. Soon after, froglets grow lungs and begin to breathe air and lose their tails. The tail disappears because the cells in the tail gently die. Each tadpole's mouth changes from small to as wide as its head. Its intestines become shorter. They grow larger, and eventually become adults."
Species.
"How fast or slow the eggs hatch and how fast or slow the tadpole becomes a froglet is different in different frogs. Some tadpoles take months to become frogs. Some stay tadpoles all winter and do not become frogs until the next spring, or even three years later. Some frogs lay their eggs in bodies of water that are only there in the spring and dry up in the summer, so the tadpoles must become frogs in only a few weeks."
Zeulenroda-Triebes
Zeulenroda-Triebes is a German town in the rural district of Greiz in Thuringia.
"It has about 18,000 inhabitants. Most famous sight of the town is the beautiful town hall."
Harry Nilsson
"Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 - January 15, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter."
"Nilsson was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City. His paternal grandparents were Swedish."
"""Without her"" is one of his early hits. This number is nowadays considered one of his standards as Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears did later an jazzy cover on their album. His biggest hits were during the late 1960s and the 1970s. His songs include ""Me And My Arrow"", ""Coconut"", ""Cuddly Toy"", ""Spaceman"", and ""One"". ""One"" was also a hit for the band Three Dog Night. Nilsson's two most famous songs were ""Without You"" and ""Everybody's Talkin'"". These songs were written by other people. ""Without You"" has been re-recorded many times by other singers. It was written by Peter Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger. ""Everybody's Talkin'"" was used in the 1969 movie ""Midnight Cowboy"". The song was written by Fred Neil."
"Nilsson recorded a tribute to The Beatles on his first album. He used lines from fifteen of their songs in one cover version of ""You Can't Do That"". Derek Taylor, who worked for the Beatles, sent them copies of the album, and Nilsson became a friend of the band. He later shared a house with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. They worked together on each other's music."
"Nilsson also wrote a cartoon movie named ""The Point!"". It was broadcast on ABC. It was about tolerance and diversity. ""The Point!"" was later turned into a musical. One production of the musical starred former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones. The Monkees had recorded two of Nilsson's songs, ""Cuddly Toy"" and ""Daddy's Song"", after they met him through producer Chip Douglas."
"Nilsson died of heart failure in Agoura Hills, California."
"The movie ""You've Got Mail"" uses several of Nilsson's songs in its soundtrack."
Acoustic guitar
"An acoustic guitar is a string instrument. It has six strings which pass from tuning pegs over the instrument's neck which is marked with lines called frets. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum (""pick""), to make them sound. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles."
How the guitar became a popular instrument.
"The acoustic guitar came from Spain (an instrument with six strings), created by Antonio Torres Jurado. But at the beginning, the guitar was different with what we see the guitar now. In the 16th to 17th centuries, the guitar became popular in Europe. In the 18th century, the guitar changed to be similar to how it is now. But before the 19th century, many people thought the guitar could not be same as a piano or violin. They thought it could not play classical music. But at the beginning of 19th century, a famous guitar player, Fernando Sor, made the guitar become more popular and he made more people like playing the guitar. Before the 20th century, people played the acoustic guitar. In the 20th century, a musician in United States, Leo Fender, invented the electric guitar."
Guitar and ukulele compared.
"The guitar and the ukulele are similar in shape and other ways, but they are also different. The ukulele looking like a small guitar. But the guitar has six strings, and the ukulele has just four strings. The six strings in a guitar are tuned: E, B, G, D, A, and E; the four strings in a ukulele are tuned: G, C, E, and A. Also, the ukulele comes from Hawaii, and the guitar comes from Spain."
Flipper
"A flipper is a special kind of limb that is flattened like a paddle for moving through water. Many animals that live in water, such as whales and seals have flippers. The flipper of a fish is called a fin."
It can also be an item worn on the foot to help people swim more easily.
Coral fungi
"Coral fungi or clavarioid fungi, are mushrooms that are usually shaped like coral, but can also be shaped like forks, worms or clubs. They are rubbery and at times are brightly coloured."
"Originally, such fungi were put in the genus ""Clavaria"", and called ""clavarioid"", which means ""Clavaria""-like. It is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related. Since they are often studied as a group, we keep the informal (non-taxonomic) name of ""clavarioid fungi"", and it is frequently used in research papers."
Habitat.
"After 1869, the northern Japanese island was known as Hokkaido. Regional subdivisions were established. Nemuro Province was one of the new entities which were created in 1869."
"In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan including Nemuro Province were reformed in the 1870s."
"In 1882, Nemuro and the other ten provinces of Hokkaido were reorganized as Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture."
Queen Letizia of Spain
"Queen Letizia of Spain (""Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano"", born 15 September 1972), is the wife of Felipe VI of Spain, former Prince of Asturias, the heir apparent to the Spanish throne. Before her marriage to the prince, she worked as a journalist for several mass media companies. These included the Austrian newspaper ""La Nueva España"", ""ABC"" and EFE. She also presented the news on television. In 2000, she received the Larra Prize for her work as the best journalist under 30 years of age."
"In 1998, she married Alfonso Guerrero. The next year they divorced. Later she met the Prince Felipe at a dinner party. They married on May 22, 2004. Their daughter Leonor was born in October 2005. She is the second in the line of succession for the Spanish Crown. Sofía, her second daughter, was born in April 2007."
"Since her second wedding, she has had the title of Princess of Asturias. She accompanies her husband on official travel wherever she can. She very much likes fashion. People and the press are always noticing what she is wearing."
"Following the abdication of her father-in-law in June 2014, her husband succeeded to the Spanish throne as Felipe VI with Letizia as his queen."
Gianfrancesco Straparola
"Giovanni Francesco ""Gianfrancesco"" Straparola, also known as Zoan or Zuan Francesco Straparola da Caravaggio (c. 1480 – c. 1557) was a writer from Caravaggio, Italy. His principal work is ""Le piacevoli notti"", a collection of 75 stories. Modelled on Decamerone, it has participants of a 13-night party in the island of Murano, near Venice, tell each other stories that vary from the bawdy to the fantastic."
Among the tales are:
Oshima Province

Diamonds and Toads
"""Diamonds and Toads"" () is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 called ""Contes de ma mêre l'oye"" (). The volume was intended for the king's niece, and included four other tales by Perrault. It was first published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight prose fairy tales by Perrault. ""Le Doie Pizzelle"" () is a similar tale in Giambattista Basile's ""Pentamerone"" (1550-53). Other versions of Perrault's tale exist, including one collected in Hesse by the Brothers Grimm. Iona and Peter Opie write, ""The theme of this tale is one of the most popular in the world, that of the proud and the privileged being brought low, and the meek and down-trodden being raised above them."" Christopher Betts believes the tale was intended for a young audience, ""old enough to appreciate that the unkind sister is 'rude' ... but not enough to object to the scarcely disguised nannyish advice."""
Story.
"A widow has two daughters. The elder is ugly, selfish and rude. The younger is beautiful, kind and polite. The younger is sent to fetch water from a spring. An old woman dressed in rags (a fairy in disguise) asks for a drink of water. The girl politely gives her one. In thanks, the fairy causes diamonds and roses to drop from the girl's mouth whenever she speaks. At home, her mother is amazed. She sends her elder daughter to the spring. The girl meets a grandly-dressed lady (the fairy) who asks for a drink of water. The girl responds rudely. The fairy causes snakes and toads to drop from her mouth. At home, her mother is furious. She blames the younger sister. The girl runs into the woods. She meets a prince who falls in love and marries her. The elder sister dies after running away from home. A rhyming moral tells the reader that politeness and gentle words are worth more than jewels. They may bring unexpected rewards."

"Newly popular, Laney is surprised to be nominated for Prom Queen. Taylor has also been nominated. Zack and Laney begin to fall in love for real. Taylor is upset when her new boyfriend Brock breaks up with her, as he is leaving to be on another television show. Dean begins to show an interest in Laney, to annoy Zack and Douglas and make it more difficult for Zack and Douglas to win the bet. Dean tries to invite Laney to prom, but she says no. After arguing with Zack and Douglas, Dean tells Laney about the bet. She make Zack and Douglas admit that it was a bet in front of the other students. Angry and upset, Laney refuses to see Zack again."
"Laney will not talk with Zack so he takes his sister to the prom, while Douglas took Bonnie to the prom and Donald took Mindy to the prom. Taylor arrives alone, and thinks Zack will be her boyfriend again. Laney does not want to go to prom but her father Wayne (Kevin Pollak) encourages her to go after Dean shows up at her house in a tuxedo and again invites to be his prom date."
"At the prom the school's DJ (Usher Raymond), organizes a big dance. Mac meets Jesse and they become friends. In the bathroom Dean boasts that he has booked a hotel room and will take Laney there to have sex. Jesse overhears, and tries to tell Mac and they also warn Zack, Douglas and Donald.

Making the movie.
"R. Lee Fleming, Jr. is credited as the only screenwriter for the movie. M. Night Shyamalan also rewrote the movie script, but was not credited. Fleming said Shyamalan wrote the line ""Am I a bet?""."
"Director Robert Iscove wanted his movie to be like the old movies of John Hughes, but different and for the teenagers of the 1990s."
"He knew that Cook was not ugly and that audiences would have to accept the idea and pretend: ""You either go along with it or you don't go along with it."" He compared it to how Clark Kent changes into Superman. Instead of making a real change from ugly to pretty, he said it was more important to find an actress who could show the different changes in her personality and feelings."
"Filming took place in various places in California. The highschool scenes were shot at Torrance High School, where Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Beverly Hills, 90210 had also filmed."
"Iscove was also a choreographer before he was a director and wanted to include dancing in the movie. He wanted show his bosses the Weinsteins, that musical numbers could work in modern movies. The dance scene was choreographed by Adam Shankman, who later become known as a judge on the television series So You Think You Can Dance. Shankman also worked with Owen Wilson on his dance scenes."
Music.
"The song ""Kiss Me"" was used as the main theme song for the movie. The success of the movie helped ""Kiss Me"" become more popular, and gain widespread mainstream attention and success in the music charts. ""Kiss Me"" climbed to No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 list, and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 weeks."
"The movie was released in Italy with the title ""Kiss Me""."

Agnivansha
Agnivanshi is a person who belongs to the Fire Dynasty of the Rajputs.
Origin.
"According to Bhavishya Purana, When Parshurama destroyed all the Kshatriyas in the land, the Brahmin priests, headed by Sage Vasishtha, kindled a sacrificial fire at Mount Abu and prayed that they be granted protection by being given some warriors. In answer to their prayer, four heroes came out of the sacrificial fire-pit and these were the ancestors of the chief Rajput Clans - the Parmaras, the Pratiharas, the Chauhanas and the Chalukyas."
The Four Agnivanshi clans are :
Parmar
Parmar are one of the four Agnivanshi Clans of the Rajputs. They are said to have been born out of a Sacrificial Fire-pit.
"The name Parmar means ‘one that strikes the enemy’, from Sanskrit ""para"" meaning ‘enemy’ + ""mara"" meaning ‘strike’."
"There are numerous variants of the name, including Pramar, Pavar, Powar, Pawar, Panwar, and Ponwar."

Nuuk
"Nuuk (Danish: Godthaab or Godthåb) is the capital of Greenland. It is around the mouth of island Nuup Kangerlua (Danish: ""Godthåbsfjorden"") on the west coast of Greenland, about 240 km (150 mi) south of the Arctic Circle. The city has a population of 15,047 people."
"It was founded in 1728 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede. Egede named the city Godthåb which means ""Good Hope"". Today, the people of Nuuk are mainly Inuit and Danes."
Nuuk is the location of the University of Greenland.
Lumberjack
"A lumberjack is a person who cuts down trees to be made into lumber. Lumberjacks used to cut with axes, but now lumberjacks use chainsaws."
Muhammad
"Muhammad ( – 8 June 632) was an Arab religious, political and social leader. He founded the religion of Islam."
"Born in Mecca, Muhammad's parents died in his childhood and he grew as an orphan. At the age of six, his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib took care of him, though he died just two years later. In young life, Muhammad accompanied his uncle Abu Talib on trade trips. In 610 AD, at the age of forty, while Muhammad was praying, he reportedly met Gabriel and received the first revelation of the Quran. At first, Muhammad preached these revelations to his close friends and family. He started preaching monotheism publicly where he received opposition from the Meccan polytheists. The polytheists boycotted Muhammad for three years, in which Muhammad could barely eat or drink. He was attacked with stones, ridiculed while praying, and eventually forced to leave his hometown of Mecca."
"While Muhammad was traveling towards Medina, he came across Taif and preached there where polytheists threw stones, causing Muhammad to bleed and almost collapse. After reaching Medina with Abu Bakr, the Medinan Muslims helped Muhammad and made a mosque there."
"He is believed to be a descendant of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, and the last of all prophets (""the seal of the prophets""). He is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow."
Life.
Childhood.
"Muhammad was born about 570 AD in Mecca. His father, whose name was Abdullah, died six months before Muhammad's birth. His mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. So, his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, took care of him after the death of Amina but he too died two years later when Muhammad was nine. After his grandfather's death, his uncle Abu Talib took care of him and was a support to him for many years of his adult life."
Beginning of the prophethood.
"In 610 AD, when Muhammad was forty years old, he went for a walk to the mountain of Hira near Mecca. According to Muslims, the angel Jibrail (Gabriel) spoke with him in a cave on the mountain. The story says that when Muhammad first saw the angel Gabriel, he fainted because Gabriel was so large. This is what Jibrail said to Muhammad:"
"""Read... in the name of God Who made man from a drop of blood... God is Most Rewarding... He Who taught man to write with pen... and taught man what he knew not."""
"Muhammad went back home to his wife Khadijah and told her what had happened. New revelations came to him commanding him to preach what was being sent ""down"" from God. When Muhammad first started teaching, many of the people of Mecca, who worshipped idols, did not like the things that Muhammad said. But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages. These people were the first of the followers of Islam. Leaders of Mecca punished and tortured the followers of Islam. Some followers of Islam were executed. Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam."
The Hijrah.
"After Muhammad finished in Mecca, he took his message to Medina, where some people learned about him and his followers. They welcomed him into their city, and Muhammad wanted them to convert to Islam. They agreed, and many of his followers went to Medina. This movement from Mecca to Medina is called the ""Hijrah"". The Hijra was also the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Mecca safely."
"As Muhammad stayed in Mecca, his uncle Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep. According to history, they did not see him leave Mecca. The men went into his house and found his cousin, Ali. Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend, Abu Bakr."
His stay in Medina.
"Muhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina. Some people welcomed Muhammad to their homes. He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house. Also, the first mosque of Medina, a small place for prayer, was built in the back of this house."
The people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with the teachings and rules set by Muhammad. This tribe told their allies in Mecca to sell all the things and homes that Muslims of Mecca left behind. The Muslims and those from Mecca were advised to fight for their property. Muhammad told them not to do that.
Muslims were called all over Medina to gather at a mosque that Muhammad prayed in. They were told to fight against the people of Mecca who burned down their homes and stole their property.
The wars.
"The Quraysh pagans of Mecca heard about this, and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims. They met in Badr, but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl, one of the pagan leaders, was also killed."
"But, the Muslims lost the second battle at Uhud. One year after the fight at Badr, the army of Mecca had outside help. Muslim archers failed to listen to Muhammad's instructions and Khalid ibn al-Walid cleverly took advantage of that. Hamza, Muhammad's last uncle, was killed when a slave from Mecca threw a spear into his chest. Muhammad himself was injured."

Giro d'Italia
"The Giro d'Italia, or Tour of Italy, is a famous bicycle race held in Italy, every spring. It is one of the most famous, and best paid bicycle races. The first race was in 1909. It started because the editor of a newspaper called ""La Gazzetta dello Sport"" wanted more people to read his newspaper. He planned a race similar to the Tour de France, which had started in 1903."
"The leader of the race wears a pink jersey called the ""maglia rosa"". This is because pink is the colour of ""La Gazzetta dello Sport"". For many years, the leader of the mountain climbing competition wore a green jersey (called the ""maglia verde""), but a change in the sponsor for that competition led to a jersey change in 2012. The mountains leader now wears a blue jersey (called the ""maglia azzurra""). Similarly, the leader of the sprinters' competition wore a mauve jersey (called the ""maglia ciclamino"") for many years. However, a sponsorship change in 2010 also led to a jersey change. The sprints leader now wears a red jersey (called ""maglia rosso passione""). The leader of the young riders' competition, for riders under age 25, wears a white jersey (called the ""maglia bianca""). This is the same as the young riders' competition in the Tour de France."

"The 1934 edition was held in a period of dispute between China and Japan, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Inclusion of people from this region in the games caused controversy between the two member nations, which resulted in the break-up of the Far Eastern Athletic Association. In September 1937, Japan invaded China with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and started the Second Sino-Japanese War (which later became part of World War II), thus the planned games in 1938 were cancelled."

During World War II, he led bands in the U.S. Army. While he was traveling in France during World War II, Glenn Miller's airplane disappeared over the English Channel."
Early life and career.
"Miller was born in Clarinda, Iowa. His parents were Mattie Lou (née Cavender) and Lewis Elmer Miller. In 1915, Miller's family moved to Grant City, Missouri, and he started playing in the town orchestra. At first, he played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916. In 1918, the Miller family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where Miller went to high school. During his senior year, he started a band with some classmates. They played ""dance band music"". By the time Miller graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician."
"In 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, but he spent most of his time away from school. He played auditions and gigs. He did not do well in school. He dropped out of school, and decided to start a career as a professional musician. He later studied under Joseph Schillinger and composed ""Moonlight Serenade"". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. While playing with this band, Miller wrote several musical arrangements and also co-wrote his first composition, ""Room 1411"", with Benny Goodman. In 1928, he married Helen Burger in New York City. At first, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when another trombone player joined, Miller was given fewer solos. At this point, he decided he should mainly be a composer. In the late 1920s, he wrote and published a songbook."
"In the early 1930s, Miller was a trombonist, arranger, and composer in The Dorsey Brothers. Miller composed the songs ""Annie's Cousin Fannie"", ""Dese Dem Dose"", ""Harlem Chapel Chimes"", and ""Tomorrow's Another Day"" in 1934 and 1935.

Success from 1938 to 1942.
"Miller was discouraged and returned to New York. He realized that the band needed to have a ""sound"" that was different from other bands. He decided to make the clarinet and tenor saxophone play the melody together, while three other saxophones played harmony. Miller hired a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. This was unique because it did not rely on repeated motifs, like other bands."
"Miller had a staff who wrote and arranged songs for the band. They were Jerry Gray, Bill Finegan, Billy May, and George Williams."

Kona coffee
"Kona Coffee is one of the kinds of coffee that is made in Kona, Hawaii. And it is famous for being the second most expensive coffee in the world following the Blue Mountains. It is too rare and accounts for only less than 0.1% of all coffee production all over the world."
History.
"In 1825, the person who was one of the royal family of Hawaii went to Britain with the king of Hawaii and brought coffee plants on the way home. Those plants spread to many regions of Hawaii. In 1828, coffee plants were planted in the Kona region. After that, many farms were made there. But, because of pest damage and the price decline of coffee, most farmers quit their jobs. In this situation, Japanese immigrants moved to the Kona region and started to grow coffee to pay their land cost by coffee. This is the beginning of kona coffee. Now, Kona coffee is drunk at the dinner party in White House because this is the only coffee that is grown in America and the quality is quite high."
Distribution.
"Kona is one of the districts of Hawaii, and it is located western. Also,it is the only place which grows coffee in the U.S. states. It has a good natural environment for growing coffee thanks to some volcanoes that give soil many nutrients. Also, the unique oceanic climate of the Kona region, which is cooler and rains a lot more than that of flat ground, is good for growing coffee. Furthermore, there is a terroir that is called “ Kona coffee belt” that is around 32 km long and 3.2 wide area. In this territory, there are many farms and shops that sell Kona coffee directly from the farms and as much as 900,000 kg of coffee beans are harvested annually."
Kona blends and Flavor coffee.
"There are some blended Kona coffees that are made by mixing some kinds of coffee beans because 100% Kona coffee is quite expensive because of labor and land cost. In the Hawaii-grow coffee law, blended coffee that accounted for 10% of Kona coffee beans can be called Kona blended coffee. The coffees that have extra flavor like macadamia nut, vanilla and so on are also famous. Those flavor coffees are made by adding flavor during roasting."
Taste.
"This coffee has a less bitter taste and softly sourness. Because of its great sourness, this coffee is called “Queen of sourness”. You can feel the sweet and fresh smell like tropical fruits. Also Kona coffee is graded 5 stages according to the size of the beans. The bigger beans are graded better and those coffee beans have better taste. The biggest coffee beans are called “extra fancy” and there are only 15 % of Kona coffee. Following “fancy”, “No 1”, “select”, “prime”. Other coffee beans are called “ Hawaiian coffee”.

"The Couesnon, the Sée and the Sélune form part of the complex water system of the bay of Mont Saint-Michel. On one side, the tide brings lots of sediment. This causes large sandbars within the river. On the other side, the three rivers bring the sediment back to sea."
"In the 20th century, the Couesnon was made into a canal. This to reduced the erosion of its banks. In 1969, a dam was built. These changes, and the causeway linking Mont Saint-Michel to the mainland, have made mudflats. The French built a bridge to replace the causeway. It was finished in 2013. This helped to remove the silt."
"During spring tides, a tidal bore — a wave caused by the tide rising — can be seen going up the river."
The Couesnon flows through the following departments and towns:
Hydrology and water quality.
"In the summer, the water flow is typically in the range of . The pH has been measured at 8.26 (Hogan, 2006). The temperature of the water is 19 degrees Celsius in summer, in the area of the mouth. Water turbidity is moderate with a Secchi disc reading of 14 centimetres. Electrical conductivity at the mouth is high."

Schwarzschild radius
"The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes erroneously referred to as the gravitational radius), is the radius of a sphere that has certain properties: if all the mass of an object is compressed within this sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. An example of an object smaller than its Schwarzschild radius is a black hole. Once a stellar remnant collapses below this radius, light can no longer escape and the object is no longer visible. It is a characteristic radius associated with every quantity of mass. The ""Schwarzschild radius"" was named after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild who calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916."
This radius can be calculated using the equation:
formula_1
"where the gravitational constant G is N⋅m2/kg2, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light which is 299,792,458 m/s."
Derivation.
"The Schwarzschild radius is found within the Schwarzschild metric, and originally was used to describe the gravitational field around a black hole, given the assumptions that it is spherical, non-rotating, without a magnetic field, and that the cosmological constant is zero; (it describes the path of a particle moving through this spacetime) however, this radius can be calculated for any object."

But, by 11th king's reign, Goguryeo had succeeded in taking control over Liaoong. Until the 24th king's period, it had had its golden age, expanding the range of the nation and driving away all the attacks from ouside. The most famous king was King Gwanggaeto the Great ()."
"However, when it was under the control of 27th king, Youngryou (), Goguryeo was becoming a vassal of the Tang Dynasty. Because of this, the king was killed by Yoen Gaesomoon () and a new king, Bojang () succeeded. After Yoen Gaesomoon died, the people did not cooperate with the nation well and while its control got weak, it was destroyed by the allied forces of Tang and Silla."

2017 Atlantic hurricane season
"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active since 2012. It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. It was an extremely active and tragic season. With a damage total of at least $282.16 billion (USD), it was the costliest season on record. With over 3,300 deaths, 2017 was the deadliest season since 2005. More than 99.7% of the season's damage was due to Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Nate, was the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history. Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate had their names retired due to their high damage costs and loss of life. Featuring 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, the 2017 season is the fifth active season."
"Tropical Storm Arlene in April was the first storm of the season that formed on April 19. This was the third consecutive season in which storms form before the official start of the hurricane season. In late August, Hurricane Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the first Category 4 hurricane since Charley in 2004. It also tied the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record along with the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the United States. In early September, Hurricane Irma became the first Category 5 hurricane to impact the northern Leeward Islands on record. It later hit the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane. Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. In late September, Hurricane Maria became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island of Dominica on record; and later it made landfall in Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. Most of the deaths from this season occurred from Maria, and caused a human crisis in Puerto Rico. In early October, Hurricane Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico while also becoming the fourth hurricane of the year to make landfall in the contiguous United States. Slightly over a week later, Hurricane Ophelia became the easternmost major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on record, and later impacted most of Northern Europe as an extratropical cyclone. The season ended with Tropical Storm Rina, which became post-tropical on November 9."
Storm names.
"The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2017. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2023 season. This was the same list used in the 2011 season, with the exception of Irma which replaced Irene. Irma was previously used in 1978, and it's only used once as an Atlantic hurricane during this season."
Retirement.
"On April 11, 2018, the names ""Harvey"", ""Irma"", ""Maria"", and ""Nate"" were retired by the World Meteorological Organization due to the very expensive amount of damage and significant number of deaths they caused. They will not be used again for a future Atlantic hurricane. The names will be replaced with ""Harold"", ""Idalia"", ""Margot"", and ""Nigel"" for the 2023 season, respectively."

The recency effect is normally said to be caused by short-term memory. (STM) The STM of a person can store a small amount of information for a short time. The amount of information is normally two to four items. The last few items of a list being normally still in the STM of a person when the items are being recalled. This theory explains why the recency effect is generally larger than the primacy effect. It takes more effort to get the first items from long-term memory (LTM) than to get the items from STM. This is affected by the STM of the person being affected by a distraction.
"Newer research has shown that the recency effect can exist without STM. For instance, Bjork and Whitten showed that even when STM was distracted there can be a long-term recency effect. During their study, they had the people do something to affect their STM during the entire test. These test showed that there was still some recency effect . Some psychologists think that the recency effect is based on a theory of temporal context. Temporal context means ""the context of time"". Theories in this field are vague and still developing. The general idea is that context is connected to each item on the list. During recall, This contect will help the person remember the item. The later the item in the list, the more similar the context of the item is to context of the test."
Link to models of memory.
Earlier research showed that the serial position effect was connected to single way that memory is stored such as LTM (primacy) and STM (recency). Research on people with brain damage that affected their LTM has showed a recency effect but not a primacy effect. This gives good evidence for this.
"On the other hand, the serial position effect is also supported by dual-store or multi-store models of memory. For instance, research on the serial position effect supports the multi-store model of memory by Atkinson and Shieffrin. Research about the long-term recency effect may show evidence for theories of the working memory model."

Lifestyle.
"Turkish culture is a diverse culture, with some European influence."
"Different parts of Turkey have similar but not exactly the same lifestyles. Central Turkey and Northern Turkey are somewhat more conservative and religious. Western Turkey and Southern Turkey, especially coastal cities are more liberal and secular. Eastern Turkey and Southeastern Turkey are made up of mostly Kurds–most of them are conservative and religious. Cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in major cities of Turkey are overwhelmingly liberal and secular. Cities like Hatay and Mardin, where different religions coexist, and Eskişehir, which is the prominent college town of the country, also have cosmopolitan characteristics."
"Collectivism is dominant in society rather than individualism. This is seen in everything from a civilian's worldview to the socio-political and socio-economic order of the country. People care a lot about what others think of them or their related ones. Sociologist Şerif Mardin, who argues that there is neighborhood watch in Turkish society, states that ""There is no tolerance for deviations from norms in the Turkish tradition, a watching oppression is applied against individuals in this situation and this is not new."""
Traditions.
"The circumcision of boys in Turkey is very common, with over 98% of men being circumcised. This is due to religious and cultural traditions and the circumcisions are celebrated with ceremonies known as Sünnet Düğünü or at a Mevlüd ceremony."

The third largest city is the coastal city of İzmir which is the main port of the country. Turkey is divided into 81 provinces. Each province has its own little government but they can only make decisions about small things: the government in Ankara decides important issues. The provinces are in 7 regions. Each province is divided into districts. There are 973 districts altogether. The biggest Main City at the European Side of Turkey is Edirne in East Thrace.
Education.
Turkey's literacy rate is currently 98.3%. People in Turkey have to go to school for 12 years.
Istanbul University was the first university in Turkey. It was established in 1453. Ankara University was the first university that was started after Turkey became a republic. It was established in 1946.
"There were 6065 high schools in Turkey in 2002 according to Ministry of National Education. In 2011, there were 166 universities in Turkey."

Thomm
Thomm is a village near Trier (at the Moselle River) in Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany.
"Thomm is famous for an old Celtic stone, called ""Hinkelstein"" near the village and a big Celtic grave."
In further times there was a slate minor industry near Thomm.
"Thomm is also famous for its cider, an apple-wine."
The FIA European Hill Climb Championship came to Thomm until 2011 and the FIA World Rally Championship until 2015.
Moselle
"The Moselle River (German: ""Mosel"") is a river which flows through France and Luxembourg, then becomes part of the Rhine River after it flows into Germany. It is long."
"Important cities at the Moselle river are Metz, Thionville, Trier, Bernkastel-Kues and Koblenz."
"The valley of the Moselle river is famous for the wine of Elbling, Riesling, and Müller-Thurgau - grapes in the wine growing region Moselle-Saar-Ruwer."
This frog moves around at night but it does sometimes move during the day. It can climb trees but it spends most of its time on the ground.
The female frog lays 5 to 60 eggs at a time in bodies of water at least 4 inches deep. The eggs sometimes stick to twigs or other things underwater. The tadpoles are about 45 mm long. They are black or yellow-brown in color with a white or near-white belly.
Edible frog
"The edible frog (""Pelophylax"" kl. ""esculentus"") is a species of frogs. It lives in Europe. It is also known as water frog or green frog. However, green frog is usually given to the North American frog ""Lithobates clamitans"". The Edible frog is used as a food source to people in France."
Texas toad
"The Texas toad (""Bufo speciosus"") is a species of toads. They are very small only reaching three inches. They live in the United States in the state of Texas. But they are also found in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Mexico."
"French Cathedral, Berlin"
"(German for: French Cathedral) is the colloquial naming for the ""French Church of Friedrichstadt"" (, ) in Berlin on the Gendarmenmarkt across from the Deutscher Dom (""German Cathedral""), formerly a church of German-speaking congregants."
"The first parts of the actual ""French Church"" were built from 1701 to 1705 for the Huguenot (Calvinist) community. At that time, Huguenots made up about 25% of Berlin's population. The ""French Church"" was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot temple in Charenton-Saint-Maurice, France."
"In 1785 Carl von Gontard modified the church and built - wall to wall next to it - the domed tower, which - together with the French-speaking congregants - earned the church its naming. The domed tower is technically no part of the church, there is no access between church and tower, because both buildings have different owners. The tower, similar to that of Deutscher Dom, was simply built to give the Gendarmenmarkt a symmetric design."
The church is not a cathedral in the strict sense of the word because it has never been the seat of a bishop.
"The domed tower, which is a viewing platform open to visitors, provides a panoramic view of Berlin. A restaurant is located in the basement underneath the prayer hall. The tower also contains the Huguenot museum of Berlin."
Cane toad
"The cane toad (""Bufo marinus"") is a species of toad. They are also known as the giant neotropical toad and the marine toad."
"Cane toads are terrestrial amphibians. This means that they only go back to the water to lay their eggs. They live in Central America and South America. However, they have been introduced to Oceania and the Caribbean."
In Australia.
"Nearly 80 years ago, a group of 102 cane toads were sent to Queensland to catch sugar beetles."
"Cane-growers were concerned about the damage insect larvae were doing to crops. The insects were native to Australia, but bad for the valuable cane crops."
"The first cane toads were brought into Queensland by Reginald Mungomery, an entomologist. Before 1935, Australia had no toads. The entire continent, full of various frog species, had no toads. Tough and always moving into new areas, the cane toads started reproducing and expanding outwards every wet season. This ""invasion front"" moved around 10 km a year until the 1960s, when it began speeding up significantly."
"Cane toads are rapidly adapting to dry climates, a huge change from their origins in the South American rainforest. They have poison gland in their skin."
Their predators.
"In their native habitat, a number of fish and reptiles prey on the tadpoles and the adult toad."
"These include the broad-snouted caiman (""Caiman latirostris""), the banded cat-eyed snake (""Leptodeira annulata""), eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the black rat (""Rattus rattus"") and the Asian water monitor (""Varanus salvator"")."
"They have far fewer predators in Australia but, as time passes, some of the local animals will adapt their behaviour. Already some Australian crows have learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the ""Didelphis"" genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad."
In popular culture.
"A cane toad is one of the non-human characters in Dave Barry's 1999 novel ""Big Trouble"" and in the 2002 movie based on the novel."
Parotoid gland
Famous piano trios.
"Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals were world famous musicians who played and recorded piano trios in the early 20th century."
"During the second half of the 20th century the Beaux Arts Trio were the best known group. Today there are many young musicians who play piano trios, including three Japanese sisters called the Fujita Piano Trio who play a lot of their music all from memory."
Franz Grillparzer
"Franz Grillparzer (born Vienna, 15 January 1791 – died Vienna, 21 January 1872) was an Austrian dramatist and poet. His dramas include three plays (a “trilogy”) called ""Das Goldene Vliess"" (""The Golden Fleece"")."
Works.
"Two other famous plays are ""Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen"" (""The Waves of the Sea and of Love"") and ""Der Traum, ein Leben"" (""The Dream, a Life""). Although he said he was not interested in prose his short story ""Der arme Spielmann"" (""The poor minstrel"") is probably the best known of his works and one of the best short stories of the 19th century. Grillparzer wrote the funeral speech for Beethoven's funeral in 1827."
Legacy
An Austrian pastry is named after him: the Grillparzertorte.
Pastry
"Pastry is the dough from which some baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products. It is made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and/or eggs. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches and pasties."
"Pastry is also the name given to various kinds of baked products. Small cakes, tarts and other sweet or savoury baked products are called ""pastries."""
Greek food such as Spanakopita are made from pastries.
Johann Georg Albrechtsberger
"Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (born 3 February 1736 in Klosterneuburg near Vienna; died 7 March 1809 in Vienna) was an Austrian composer, organist, music theorist and music teacher. He is most known today because he was Beethoven’s teacher for a time."
Life.
"From the age of seven, Albrechtsberger was a choirboy. He had lessons in organ and music theory. As an adult, he had several jobs in churches in small towns. He became Kapellmeister at St Stephen’s Church, Vienna in 1793. This was the best job for a church musician in the empire."
Writing music.
"Albrechtsberger wrote hundreds of compositions. He wrote most of them before he got the job in Vienna. He wrote in a classical style. Albrechsberger enjoyed doing things with music which were not normally done. He would ask string players to tune their strings in different ways (called “scordatura”). He would also write slow movements with muted strings. As well as classical sonatas he wrote lots of fugues. Several people, including Mozart, thought of him as the greatest organist in the world."
Teaching.
Albrechtsberger was a very important music teacher. Joseph Haydn thought he was the best teacher in Vienna. He was very interested in contrapuntal music of the Baroque period. He copied many fugues by Bach and other composers.
"When Beethoven was a young man, he had some composition lessons from Joseph Haydn. When Haydn was going to travel to England for several months, he asked Albrechtsberger to teach Beethoven while he was gone. These lessons took place from 1793 to 1795. A few years later, Albrechtsberger said about Beethoven that “he learned absolutely nothing and will never accomplish anything decent”. Beethoven said that Albrechtsberger was a “musical pedant”. However, Beethoven still studied Albrechtsberger’s books on music theory. The string quartets which Beethoven wrote near the end of his life show the influence of Albrechtsberger."
Fidelio
"Fidelio is an opera in two acts by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is Beethoven's only opera. The German libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner based on a French story. The opera tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard called ""Fidelio"", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison."
"""Fidelio"" is an example of a “rescue opera”, a type of opera which was popular at the time. The hero (or heroine) has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover. It was written at the time of the French Revolution. At this time, ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone, and this led to wars all over Europe. The famous Prisoners’ Chorus is a song for freedom, just like the last movement of his Ninth Symphony."
"Beethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it. The first time it was performed (in 1805) it was a three-act opera called ""Leonore"". There were a lot of French military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised. In 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture (now known as ""Overture: Leonore No. 3""). But arguments between Beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances. Eight years later Beethoven revised his opera again. This time it was called ""Fidelio"", and it was a great success. It has remained a famous opera ever since."
Plot.
"The setting is a Spanish state prison, a few miles from Seville, in the late 18th century."

Webster-Hayne debate
"The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs. The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's ""Second Reply to Hayne"" (1830) was widely seen as ""the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."""
"Webster described the US government as ""made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people"". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words ""government of the people, by the people, for the people"" in his Gettysburg Address."
Point Hicks
"Point Hicks, once called Cape Everard, is a coastal headland on the east coast of Victoria, Australia. It is now a part of the Croajingolong National Park."
Name.
"Point Hicks is where, on 19 April 1770, the continent of Australia was first sighted by the men on Captain Cook's ""Endeavour"" voyage. Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land, and Cook named the point after him. Hickes spelt his name with an ""e"", Cook wrote both ""Hicks"" and ""Hickes"" in different places. The spelling ""Hicks"" is now in use for the point."
"When George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point. It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages, and the name fell into disuse."
"The point came to be known as Cape Everard. The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the ""Beagle"" in 1843. It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home, but his maps do not use the name."
"The first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he thought of the name, he may have named it after William Everard, commissioner of crown lands."
The name Cape Everard was used until 1970. There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw. The actual latitude and longitude he gave () is a location many miles out to sea.
"Point Hicks was renamed as part of Cook's bicentenary. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970 (this was the 200th anniversary; Cook's 19 April was by nautical time, i.e. not adjusted for the International Date Line)."
Lighthouse.
"A lighthouse was built on the point in 1887/8 and started operation in 1890. It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses. It was connected to mains electricity in 1965, and then to solar power recently. The keepers' cottages are today used as holiday houses. With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australia's mainland. Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds, from a height of 56 metres above sea level."
Hobo spider
"A Hobo Spider is a spider like funnel-web spiders. Their bite is very bad and could send you to the hospital. It can be found in North America, Europe and Central Asia."
Fethullah Gülen
"Muhammed Fethullah Gülen (born 27 April 1941), better known as Fethullah Gülen, is a Turkish preacher, author, educator and Muslim scholar. He lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania (USA)."
"Gülen teaches a moderate version of Sunni / Hanafi Islam, deriving from that of Said Nursi's teachings and modernizing them. Gülen condemns terrorism, supports communication between people of different religions, and has initiated such dialogue with the Vatican and some Jewish organisations. Until 2013 he was an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who later blamed him for the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt. He operates a worldwide organisation called the Gülen Movement also known as FETÖ."
Teachings.
"Fethullah Gülen's attitude towards hijab has changed over time. In the past, Gülen, who regarded the unwinding of even a strand of women's hair as a great sin, suggested that women should cover their whole body by using veils and gloves. In his last speeches, Gülen evaluated the headscarf as a füruat (minor details)."
"For Fethullah Gülen, to allow views opposed to belief in creation is a devastating delusion and evolution, a Darwin fallacy."
"According to Gülene, the creation of Adam as the first human and Eve from Adam's file bone are miracle creations that should not be addressed in the context of cause-effect relationship."
"Supercells impacted Illinois with large hail and strong winds, and possible tornadoes. Hail up to 4-5"" in diameter fell and made damage as well as the winds. Tornadoes were als possible."
Iowa.
"A squall line of severe thunderstorms impacted the area also with large hail and strong winds. Hail up to 3-4"" in diameter fell there along with strong winds. Tornadoes were unlikely but possible."
Indiana.
"supercells and squall lines impacted Indiana with numerous reports of large hail and strong winds. An EF0 tornado dropped down in Indiana along with hail up to 2-3"" in diameter and damaging winds."
Ohio.
"An EF1 tornado in a supercell dropped down in Ohio and did some damage. In that severe thunderstorm with the tornado, strong winds were a problem along with hail up to 1-2"" in diameter."
Pennsylvania.
"An EF2 tornado in a supercell dropped down in south-central PA. The tornado did damage along with hail up to 1/2 to 1"" in diameter."
Tennessee.
"An EF3 tornado destroyed much of the area where the tornado dropped down. Along with the tornado there were strong winds and 1/4 to 1/2"" in diameter hail"
New Jersey.
Severe thunderstorms impacted the state. the severe thunderstorms produced 1/10 to 1/4 inch in diameter hail and strong winds. Tornadoes were unlikely but possible.
Maryland.
A possible tornado did some damage to an area where the tornado possibly dropped down. Otherwise hail and wind were a problem.
Snow and sleet.
"Snow fell acros much of New York State to even NYC and Northern New Jersey. New York City and Northern New Jersey just saw a few snowflakes and sleet flakes, while places north of NYC saw heavy sleet, and New York State saw a general 1-2"" of snow. Some places saw as much as 4-5"" of snow."

"36 Crazyfists is an American heavy metal band from Anchorage, Alaska. 36 Crazyfists has four members in the band; the current band members are Brock Lindow, Steve Holt, Mick Whitney, and Kyle Baltus. The name of the band comes from the Jackie Chan movie, ""Jackie Chan And The 36 Crazy Fists"". The band now originates in Portland, Oregon."
Sound effect
"A sound effect or audio effect is a sound used for movies, television, apps, music, or other types of media. There are lots of sound effects that we hear everyday. One of the techniques used to make a sound is banging or hitting a wall, a table, or desk."
WWE Over the Limit
"Over the Limit was a professional wrestling event that was held yearly by WWE, and aired live only on pay-per-view (PPV). The first one was held in 2010, taking the place of Judgment Day in the May slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. The last event took place on May 20, 2012 at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was replaced by WWE Battleground in 2013."
"As is the case with most lower level PPV's made by WWE, the event was held only in arenas in the United States. Championship bouts were scheduled on every card, with the lower level title matches on the undercard and the top level featured on the main card. Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigns its performers to either Raw or SmackDown which cause matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show."
Osamu Tezuka
"Osamu Tezuka (, Tezuka Osamu, November 3, 1928 – February 9, 1989) was a famous Japanese cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer and Doctor of Medicine, although he never practiced medicine. He was born in Osaka Prefecture. He created ""Astro Boy"", ""Kimba the White Lion"" and ""Black Jack"". He is often credited as the ""Father of Anime"", and is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who was a major inspiration for Tezuka."
"Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well received manga series including the children mangas Astro Boy, Princess Knight and Kimba the White Lion, and the adult oriented series Black Jack, Phoenix, and Buddha, all of which won several awards."
"Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Phoenix, which were never released."
"She joined up in September 1918, two months before the end of the war. She served as a waitress in the officers' mess at RAF Marham and also at Narborough airfield. She was the last living British veteran following the death of Claude Choules."
Later years.
"She was West Norfolk's oldest resident, the second oldest person in Norfolk and one of the 30 oldest people in Britain."
"She had a son and two daughters, as well as four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren."
"Florence Green died in her sleep two weeks before her 111th birthday in a care home in King's Lynn, Norfolk."
John Babcock
"John Henry Foster ""Jack"" Babcock (July 23, 1900 – February 18, 2010) was the last living Canadian veteran who fought in the First World War. He became an American citizen in 1946."
"Born on July 23, 1900, Mr. John ""Jack"" Babcock grew up on a farm near Kingston, Ontario as part of a family of 13 children. When he was quite young, his father died in a tree-cutting accident. Despite this devastating loss, Mr. Babcock went on to bravely serve his country in the First World War before moving to the United States where he settled in Spokane, Washington."
"He was 15 years old when he joined the 146th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in Sydenham (near Kingston), Ontario. A few months later, he arrived in England. He was transferred to reserve battalions and ended up with the Boys Battalion in 1917, waiting until he turned 18 to go to the front lines. The war ended first. Mr. Babcock would later move to the United States, where he served in the United States Army from 1921 to 1924. Mr. Babcock married Dorothy after losing his first wife, Elsie, in the late 1970s."
"Mr. Babcock read voraciously and, in recent years, completed his high school degree via correspondence courses. He had also taken local college courses. He could recite the alphabet backwards without hesitation and spell out his name in Morse code. He enjoyed travelling with his wife and taking daily walks to keep in good shape. He took up flying lessons and became a pilot when he was 65!"
"In April 2008, the Minister of Veterans Affairs awarded Mr. Babcock a Minister of Veterans Affairs Commendation. Later that year, a small ceremony was held in May at Mr. Babcock's home, where his Canadian citizenship was reinstated. Another accolade came in September 2008 when the Royal Canadian Regiment Association honored Mr. Babcock with the honorary title of regimental patriarch. This was the first time the title of regimental patriarch was given in Canada."
Frank Buckles
Frank Woodruff Buckles (born Wood Buckles'; 1 February 1901 – 27 February 2011) was the last living American veteran who fought in World War I.
Early life and career.
"Buckles was born in Bethany, Missouri. He enlisted in the U.S. Army at the beginning of America's involvement in World War I in April 1917. Only 16 years old at the time, Buckles was asked by his recruiter to show a birth certificate. Later Buckles said of that event, ""“I was just 16 and didn’t look a day older. I confess to you that I lied to more than one recruiter. I gave them my solemn word that I was 18, but I’d left my birth certificate back home in the family Bible. They’d take one look at me and laugh and tell me to go home before my mother noticed I was gone. Somehow I got the idea that telling an even bigger whopper was the way to go. So I told the next recruiter that I was 21 and darned if he didn’t sign me up on the spot! I enlisted in the Army on the 14th of August 1917."""""
"Before being accepted into the United States Army, he was turned down by the Marine Corps due to his slight weight."
"In 1917, Buckles was sent to Europe on the RMS Carpathia, which had rescued RMS Titanic survivors five years earlier. During the war Buckles served in England and France, driving ambulances and motorcycles for the Army's 1st Fort Riley Casualty Detachment."
"After the Armistice in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. Following his discharge in 1919, he attended the dedication of the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of those Americans who died in World War I. While there, he met General John ""Black Jack"" Pershing, commander of all U.S. forces in France during the war."
"In the 1940s Buckles worked for a shipping company in Manila, Philippines. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942 and spent the next three and a half years in the Los Baños prison camp."
"He became malnourished, with a weight below 100 lb, and developed beriberi, yet led his fellow inmates in calisthenics. He was rescued on February 23, 1945."
He died on 27 February 2011 at 110 years old.
Józef Kowalski
"Józef Kowalski (2 February 1900? – 7 December 2013) was the last Polish veteran who served just after World War I, and believed to be the oldest living military veteran in the world, following the death of Gertrude Noone."
He fought in the Polish-Soviet War which was linked to World War I and lasted from 1919 to 1921.
"He lived in Tursk, near Sulęcin, in a care home. He died on 7 December 2013, just 8 weeks and one day before his claimed 114th birthday, and claimed to be the oldest living man for around a half-year after 116-year-old Japaneseman Jiroemon Kimura's death in early-summer of 2013 (although the GRG and the Guinness World Records never verified him as the oldest living man)."
Stanley Lucas
"Stanley Lucas (15 January 1900 - 21 June 2010) was a British supercentenarian. He was the oldest living man in Europe at the time of his death. He was also the third-oldest man in the world. Lucas was born at Morwenstow UK and had two brothers and two sisters. In 1908 his family moved to Marhamchurch where Lucas lived until 1948. Lucas married Ivy Nancekivell in 1926 and took over the family farm. Lucas was a breeder of Devon cattle and Devon longwool sheep and started a dairy farm in the early 1940s. In 1948 he moved to live with his family at Poughill, where he continued to live after Ivy's death in 1963. Lucas was a member of Bude Town Council from 1959 to 1970, as well as vice chairman. His daughter said, ""He has worked hard in his working life and was a teetotaller and non-smoker and since he has been elderly has been well cared for"". He died on 21 June 2010 in Bude, England at the age of 110."
Abiu
"The Abiu is a tropical tree from South America. The tree grows to heights between and . It produces edible fruit. When they are ripe, the fruits are yellow."
"Sabae, Fukui"
"is a city located in Fukui Prefecture, Japan."
History.
"In 1889, the municipal system was introduced. 1 city - Fukui, 9 towns and 168 villages were established."
"Sabae was one of 9 towns. It had administrated 10 villages. These villages are: Funatsu Village, Shin-Yokoe Village, Shinmei Village, Tachimachi Village, Yoshikawa Village, Yutaka Village, Nakagawa Village, Katakami Village, Kitanakayama Village, Kawada Village."
In 1948 Funatsu Village and Shin-Yokoe Village became a part of Sabae Town. Since then Sabae Town was gradually growing until it became Sabae City.
"Gozaemon Masunaga, the ""ancestor of domestic eyeglasses,"" started  manufacturing eyewear frames in Fukui around 1905. At that time, most people in Sabae were working in the farming industry. Farming was challenging in winter, since the Fukui region experiences a lot of snow.  Masunaga started this industry because the eyeglass industry does not depend on the season. He invited craftsmen from Osaka to try to spread the industry as a side business of a farmer in Fukui. At that time, education and the development of printing technology were spreading so people started to read prints such as newspapers. The demand for eyewear has expanded. In 1935, the eyewear industry spread to Sabae and Fukui. The industry succeeded in manufacturing the titanium-based eyewear frames in 1981 for the first time in the world. After that, a large military factory was converted to an eyewear factory after the end of World War II made Sabae’s eyeglasses industry famous."
Edo period.
"From the beginning Sabae was ruled by Manabe Clan. The Sabae area used to be the gate town of Jōshō Temple. In the Edo period, the West-Sabae Jin'ya (administrative headquarter for a small province) was under the direct control of the Shogunate. At that time, Sabae was the gate town until 1871. In meantime Sabae Jin'ya became Sabae Han (historical term for the estate of a daimyo in the Edo period) (1720-1871)"
"Manabe Akikatsu (1804-1884) is known as the most famous Sabae's feudal lord, who in 1856 opened Kyōyōkei - a place where the lords can relax. Kyōyōkei was the foundation of the current Nishiyama Park."
"When Sabae became Han there was a plan to build a castle. However, the Sabae Castle was never built. There were many problems such as financial difficulties and the occurrence of famine. Instead, Manabe Akikatsu took the money that was meant for the castle and gave it to the villages that were suffering from famine."
Demography.
"According to Japanese census data,"
Culture.
Former Uryu Residence.
"It is the oldest residence in Fukui Prefecture. Originally located on the east side of the former Hokuriku Expressway, but it was relocated to northeastern corner of the Shinmeisha (Shintō Shrine) in 1975."
Jōshō Temple.
Buddthist temple which building stared in 1208. Shisoku Gate of this temple is a cultural property.
Nishiyama Park.
"Nishiyama Park is considered to be one of 100 historical parks in Japan. There is also a zoo, which is famous for having Red Pandas, an adventure forest and Japanese garden."
Economy.
Sabae is one of the largest manufacturer of eyeglass frames in Japan.
Eyeglasses.
"Sabae eyewear is produced in Sabae City, one of the world's three largest eyewear production areas. Fukui Prefecture, particularly Fukui City and Sabae City, manufactures high quality frames that account for 95% of all Japanese eyewear frames sold both nationally and internationally. About 4000 people are involved in the local industry, and it takes about half a year to a year to manufacture one pair of eyewear. Sabae eyewear is manufactured with the technology of titanium."
"The technology is also used in producing medical and electronic equipment. There are more than 5,000 stores in Japan that sell Sabae eyeglasses, and the average price is 35,000 yen excluding lenses now."
Process.
More than 200 steps are required to complete one eyeglasses frame. However these processes can be divided into 9 processes.
Population.
"The inhabitants of this city are known, in French, as ""Tullistes""."
"With a population of 14,325, Tulle has a population density of inhabitants/km2."
Evolution of the population in Tulle
"Tulle forms, together with other 7 ""communes"", the urban area of Tulle with a population of 21,108 inhabitants (2013) and an area of . This urban area is the centre of the metropolitan area of Tulle, formed by 25 ""communes"", with a population of 30,970 inhabitants (2013) and an area of ."
Administration.
"Tulle is the prefecture of the Corrèze department, the capital of the ""arrondissement"" of Tulle and the administrative centre () of the canton of Tulle."
"It is part of the intercommunality ""Tulle Agglo"" ()."
Twinned and partner towns.
Tulle is twinned with:
English grammar
"English grammar is the grammar of the English language. Grammar is the rules about how to speak and write in a language. English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French."
Dialect grammar.
"Dialects of English vary not only in pronunciation but in grammar. For example, people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say, ""I didn't do anything"", while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English might say, ""I didn't do nothing"". London working class version: ""I ain't done nuffink!"" The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live."
"Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using ""proper English"", they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. The models for ""spoken"" English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English."
Word endings.
"English makes few changes to its word endings. These are called ('suffixes'): plurals and possessives (""John's"") are the most common. English verbs drop most endings except one: I love, you love, they love, but ""she loves"". That final 's' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walked, walking."
Word order.
"Word order is the other big difference. In English, adjectives usually come before the noun. Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns. For example, in English, a person may say ""I like fast cars"", but in Spanish, it is ""Me gustan los coches rápidos"" [coches = cars; rápidos = fast]. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, main verbs often come near the end of sentences, but in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: ""the cat sat on the mat""."
Parts of speech.
"Grammar studies the different parts of language. The parts of language are called ""parts of speech."" The parts of speech are nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections."
Nouns.
"A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. They can be a single thing such as an apple. They can also be plural such as a box of apples. There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun, which is a name. For instance, Johnny Appleseed."
Pronouns.
"Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. We often use them to avoid repeating the nouns that they refer to. An example is the word ""it."" In the sentence ""I like the ball; it is blue,"" you have to look at what comes before ""it"" to know that ""it"" is talking about the ball. The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent."
There are different types of pronouns in English language. The most important ones are:
Verbs.
"The basic verb form is called the infinitive. The infinitive for existence is ""to be"". A famous example is the speech of Hamlet: to be or not to be?"
Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses.
Adjectives.
"Words that tell you about nouns are called adjectives. When an adjective is used, you learn more about the noun. An example would be the words ""red"" and ""juicy"" in the phrase ""the red apple is juicy."" They do not have any endings. Even if the noun they talk about is plural, they stay the same. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
"The first pharaoh was Narmer, though he did not use the term. The Egyptians believed their pharaoh was the god Horus. Pharaohs had several wives but only one wife was queen."
Gilligan's Island
"Gilligan's Island is a 1964 American television series. The series is about seven people (two crew members and five tourists) who take a 3-hour sightseeing tour from a marina in Hawaii. This occurs on the boat, S.S. ""Minnow"". An unexpected storm sends the boat to an uncharted island. Now, the passengers of the boat have to live on the island and try to find a way home. Most of the episodes involved the characters trying to survive a problem or trying to contact help."
Diaper
A diaper (or nappy) is a piece of clothing. It is worn by those who cannot control their urine or feces.
Diapers can be made of cloth (usually cotton) that can be washed and used again. They can also be disposable (put in the garbage after they are used up). Disposable diapers are usually made of plastic or man-made (artificial) fibers and contain chemicals that are very absorbent.
Diapers that can be washed must be folded in intricate ways (like origami) before being put on. With the disposable you must constantly buy new ones.
"Viewed as unpleasant by some, diapers are mostly used by children from birth until the child has learned to use a toilet. They are also used by older people. There are adult diapers for people with medical problems."
"In the United Kingdom, Australia and several other countries, a diaper is called a nappy."
"Sometimes adults who do not have medical problems also wear diapers. This can be for different reasons. Sometimes it is because they have a profession where they cannot always get to a bathroom, like astronauts. Some adults wear diapers for fun. This is usually a form of sexual pleasure, or for emotional reasons. These people are often called ""diaper-lovers"" or ""adult-babies."" The scientific term for liking to wear diapers is ""Diaper Fetishists."""
Mork &amp; Mindy
"Mork and Mindy is an American television sitcom which ran from 1978 to 1982. It stars Robin Williams and Pam Dawber as the title characters. The series was made by Garry Marshall. Comedian Jonathan Winters has a recurring role in the series. ""Mork and Mindy"" is a spin-off from Marshall's other popular TV series, ""Happy Days"". The plot of the series is that alien named Mork from a planet called Ork who travels to Earth and becomes friends with a woman named Mindy in Boulder, Colorado."

American Samoa
"American Samoa (; , ; also ' or ') is a territory of the United States. It is part of the Samoan Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean."
"In 1899, Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan group of islands. The U.S. got the smaller group of islands on the east side. These islands had a good harbor near the capital city, Pago Pago. The western islands were run by Germany and then by New Zealand and are now the independent country Samoa."
"Officially, American Samoa is an ""unorganized"" territory. This means that the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act. But the people who live in American Samoa rule themselves. Their constitution became effective on July 1, 1967."
"The capital of American Samoa is Pago Pago, but the seat of government is Fagatogo."
Citizenship.
"People who are born in American Samoa are called U.S. nationals, not U.S. citizens. This means they have some of the same rights as citizens but not all of them. Unlike people who are not Americans at all, American Samoans can go to any other part of the United States they want and live there for as long as they want. But they are not allowed to vote, to be on juries in court, to run for office, or to hold any job that the employee has to be a citizen to hold. For contrast, someone born in Puerto Rico or Guam is a citizen, so if they move to a state, they are allowed to vote in that state and in all federal elections."
"Some American Samoans like that they are not American citizens and others do not. Some American Samoans say that being nationals and not citizens makes it easier for them to keep the fa'a Samoa, the Samoan way of life. In 2019, three American Samoans living in Utah sued the U.S. government to say they are citizens. The judge agreed with them. The judge said that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that anyone born in any part of the United States is a citizen, and that should mean American Samoans too. But the next day, he said they should not register to vote until after an appeal judge has seen the case."
"In 2016, the United States Supreme Court decided they did not want to look at a case about whether American Samoans are citizens."

Exponentiation
"In mathematics, exponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It can be thought of as repeated multiplication, just as multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition."
"In general, given two numbers formula_1 and formula_2, the exponentiation of formula_1 and formula_2 can be written as formula_5, and read as ""formula_1 raised to the power of formula_2"", or ""formula_1 to the formula_2th power"". Other methods of mathematical notation have been used in the past. When the upper index cannot be written, people can write powers using the ^ or ** signs, so that 2^4 or 2**4 means formula_10."
"Here, the number formula_1 is called base, and the number formula_2 is called exponent. For example, in formula_10, 2 is the base and 4 is the exponent."
"To calculate formula_10, one simply multiply 4 copies of 2. So formula_15, and the result is formula_16. The equation could be read out loud as ""2 raised to the power of 4 equals 16."""
More examples of exponentiation are:
"If the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square, because the area of a square is calculated using formula_20. So"
"Similarly, if the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube, because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_23. So"
"If the exponent is equal to -1, then the power is simply the reciprocal of the base. So"
"If the exponent is an integer less than 0, then the power is the reciprocal raised to the opposite exponent. For example:"
"If the exponent is equal to formula_28, then the result of exponentiation is the square root of the base, with formula_29 For example:"
"Similarly, if the exponent is formula_31, then the result is the nth root, where:"
"If the exponent is a rational number formula_33, then the result is the ""q""th root of the base raised to the power of ""p"":"
"In some cases, the exponent may not even be rational. To raise a base ""a"" to an irrational ""x""th power, we use an infinite sequence of rational numbers (""xn""), whose limit is x:"
like this:
There are some rules which make the calculation of exponents easier:
"It is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrices. In this case, the matrix must be square. For example, formula_44."
Commutativity.
"Both addition and multiplication are commutative. For example, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, and 2 · 3 is the same as 3 · 2. Although exponentiation is repeated multiplication, it is not commutative. For example, 2³=8, but 3²=9."
Inverse Operations.
"Addition has one inverse operation: subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: division."
But exponentiation has two inverse operations: The root and the logarithm. This is the case because the exponentiation is not commutative. You can see this in this example:

Père Goriot
"Le Père Goriot (, ""Old Goriot"" or ""Father Goriot"") is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850). It is in the ""Scènes de la vie privée"" section of his novel sequence ""La Comédie humaine"". It is set in Paris in 1819. It follows the lives of three characters: the elderly Goriot, a mysterious criminal named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac."
The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration. It brought major changes to French society. The struggle by individuals to reach a higher social status is a major theme in the book. Balzac analyzes through Goriot and others the nature of family and marriage that provides a pessimistic view of them.
Publication.
"In the first book edition, the novel had seven chapters:"
"The character Eugène de Rastignac had appeared as an old man in Balzac's earlier philosophical fantasy novel ""La Peau de chagrin"". While writing the first version of ""Le Père Goriot"", Balzac named the character ""Massiac"", but he decided to use the same character from ""La Peau de chagrin"". Other characters were changed in a similar way."
Legacy.
"""Le Père Goriot"" is widely considered Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist Félicien Marceau's remark: ""We are all children of ""Le Père Goriot""."""
"In his book ""Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World"", Martin Kanes calls it ""the keystone of the ""Comédie humaine"". It is the central text of Anthony Pugh's study ""Balzac's Recurring Characters"". Entire chapters have been written about the detail of the Maison Vauquer."
"Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, ""Goriot"" is one of the novels of ""La Comédie humaine"" that can safely be read in English for what it is."""
"According to the editor of the Norton Critical Edition, Peter Brooks, the book is now seen as ""the most endurable and popular of Balzac's myriad works"" and a ""classic of the [18th]-century European novel""."
"A well-known line of this book by Balzac is when Vautrin tells Eugene, ""In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline."""
"This has been reworked by Mario Puzo in the novel ""The Godfather"" (1969) and its movie adaptation (1972) as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""."
It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute.
Laryngeal consonant
"Laryngeal consonants are consonants that are articulated (made) in the larynx. Laryngeal consonants include pharyngeal consonants, glottal consonants, and for some languages uvular consonants."
Used People
"Used People is a 1992 romantic comedy movie. Beeban Kidron directed it based on the 1988 play ""The Grandma Plays"" by Todd Graff. It stars Shirley MacLaine, Marcello Mastroianni, Bob Dishy, Kathy Bates, Marcia Gay Harden, Jessica Tandy, Doris Roberts, Sylvia Sidney. It was distributed by 20th Century Fox."
Co-articulated consonant
"A co-articulated consonant is a consonant sound made at two places of articulation at the same time. They are similar to consonants with secondary articulation but are not the same. For example, [gb] is a co-articulated consonant and [gʷ] is not."

"On May 21, 1982, RKO General lost the license to broadcast and Channel 7 was taken over by New England Television on May 22. The channel was renamed WNEV-TV. New England Television bought a radio station known as WHDH in 1989, and in January, 1990, channel 7 was renamed WHDH-TV. On January 2, 1995, Channel 7 stopped showing CBS programs and began showing NBC programs. Before then, NBC programs were shown on WBZ-TV, Channel 4, which now shows CBS programs. The reason for this switch is because WBZ-TV's owners merged with the CBS network."
"In 1993, the station was sold to Sunbeam Television. In July, 2010, Channel 7 officially dropped the -TV from its name, becoming just WHDH."
"In 2017, the station stopped carrying NBC programming, losing the affiliation to WBTS-CD, and became an independent television station."
Lawrence Welk
"Lawrence Welk (March 11, 1903 – May 17, 1992) was an American musician, accordionist, bandleader, and television impresario, who hosted ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" from 1955 to 1982. His style came to be known as ""champagne music""."
"In 1996, Welk was ranked #43 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time."
Early life.
"Welk was born in Strasburg, North Dakota. Most people there spoke German, but also knew English. His parents were Ludwig and Christiana (Schwahn) Welk, who were ethnic Germans from Russia. They emigrated to America in 1892 from Selz, Kutschurgan District, in the German-speaking area north of Odessa (now Odessa, Ukraine, but then in southwestern Russia). In North Dakota, the family lived on a homestead."
"Welk decided on a career in music and got his father to buy him an accordion from a mail order for $400 (equivalent to $ in ) He promised his father that he would work on the farm until he was 21, to pay his father back for the accordion. Any other money he earned during that time, by doing farmwork or performing, would go to his family."
Early career.
"On his 21st birthday, Welk left the family's farm to start his career in music. During the 1920s, he performed with the Luke Witkowski, Lincoln Boulds, and George T. Kelly bands before he started his own orchestra. He led big bands in North Dakota and eastern South Dakota. These included the Hotsy Totsy Boys and later the Honolulu Fruit Gum Orchestra. His band also played for radio station WNAX in Yankton, South Dakota. In 1927, he graduated from the MacPhail School of Music in Minneapolis, Minnesota."
"During the 1930s, Welk led a traveling big band that played dance tunes and ""sweet"" music. At first, the band traveled around the country by car. They were too poor to rent rooms, so they usually slept and changed clothes in their cars. At an engagement at the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, a dancer said that Welk's band's sound was as ""light and bubbly as champagne,"" which is where the term ""Champagne Music"" came from. Welk described his band's sound, saying ""We still play music with the champagne style, which means light and rhythmic. We place the stress on melody; the chords are played pretty much the way the composer wrote them. We play with a steady beat so that dancers can follow it."""
"Welk's big band performed across the country but mostly at ballrooms and hotels in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. In the early 1940s, the band started to play at the Trianon Ballroom in Chicago, where they played for 10 years. His orchestra also played at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City during the late 1940s. Welk recorded a version of Spade Cooley's ""Shame on You"" with Western artist Red Foley in 1945. The record (Decca 18698) was #4 on Billboard's September 15 ""Most Played Juke Box Folk Records"" listing. From 1949 through 1951, the band had its own national radio program on ABC."
Recordings.
"Sometimes, Welk's band made recordings in Richmond, Indiana and in Grafton, Wisconsin for the Gennett and Paramount companies. In November, 1928, he recorded for Gennett and in 1931, he recorded for Paramount. These records are very rare."
"From 1938 to 1940, he recorded in New York and Chicago for the Vocalion label. He started with Decca in 1941, and recorded for Mercury and Coral before starting with Dot in the early 1950s."
"In 1966, his orchestra recorded an album on the Ranwood Records label, with Jazz saxophonist Johnny Hodges, featuring a number of Jazz standards, including ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", ""Misty"" and ""Fantastic, That's You"". The album has been out of print for many years."
"""The Lawrence Welk Show""."
"In 1951, Welk moved to Los Angeles. The same year, he began hosting ""The Lawrence Welk Show"". It was broadcast from the Aragon Ballroom in Venice Beach. The show became a local hit and was picked up by ABC in June 1955."
"The show had a ""bubble machine."" Whenever the orchestra played a polka or waltz, Welk himself would dance with the band's female singer, called a ""Champagne Lady"" on the show. His first Champagne Lady was Jayne Walton Rosen (her real name was Dorothy Jayne Flanagan). Rocky Rockwell would usually sing novelty songs. Welk would also have one song each show where he would play an accordion solo."
"Welk's show would rarely play current music, except as a novelty. On the December 8, 1956 show, the show did play two current songs. They were ""Nuttin' for Christmas,"" and Elvis Presley's ""Don't Be Cruel."""
"The songs on the show were mostly popular music standards, polkas, and novelty songs. Welk often danced with women from the audience."
"Welk had very high quality musicians, including accordionist Myron Floren, concert violinist Dick Kesner, guitarist Buddy Merrill, and New Orleans Dixieland clarinetist Pete Fountain. He paid his regular band members very well, and it was common for them to stay with the band a long time. For example, Floren was the band's assistant conductor throughout the whole time the show was broadcast."
"The show didn't only play big-band era music. During the 1960s and 1970s, for example, the show played music that was originally by The Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, The Everly Brothers and Paul Williams and others, but in a style his older viewers would like. The show was originally in black and white. It changed to color in fall 1965."
"While it was on network television, ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" aired on ABC on Saturday nights at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time), but changed to 8:30 p.m. in fall 1963. From 1956 to 1959, it was also known as ""The Dodge Dancing Party"", because Welk was also hosting another show called ""Top Tunes and New Talent"" on Mondays. ABC canceled the show in 1971, but it continued on 250 stations across the country until 1982."
Personal life.
"Welk was married for 61 years, until he died, to Fern Renner (b. August 26, 1903, d. February 13, 2002). They had three children."
"Welk was an excellent businessman. He had investments in real estate and music publishing, and was a general partner in a commercial real estate development."
Welk had four US design patents:
Welk was a Roman Catholic and a daily communicant.
Later years.
Boyce and Hart
"Boyce and Hart were a musical and songwriting duo, who worked together in the 1960s and 1970s. Tommy Boyce (born Sidney Thomas Boyce in 1939 and died in 1994) and Bobby Hart (born Robert Luke Harshman in 1939) wrote and produced hit records for The Monkees (""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""Valleri""), Jay and the Americans (""Come a Little Bit Closer""), Chubby Checker (""Lazy Elsie Molly""), and for themselves, with ""I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight"" and other songs."
"Their biggest success was with the Monkees, as writers, producers and performers. Many of the early Monkees recordings featured Boyce and Hart's band, the Candy Store Prophets, before the Monkees were even selected from auditions. When the Monkees themselves took charge of their recordings, they still recorded Boyce and Hart's songs, and praised the duo to the public."
"Ten years after the Monkees's heyday, two former members, Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, teamed up with Boyce and Hart, touring and performing the band's hits. They also issued a new album on Capitol Records."

Dappy
"Costadinos Contostavlos, better known by his stage name of ""Dappy"", is an English rapper, singer and songwriter of Greek heritage. He leads the hip hop group N-Dubz. Contostavlos was raised on a Camden Town council estate, North London by his mother, Zoe Contostavlos and father, Byron Contostavlos. His father was the bassist in 1970s group Mungo Jerry.Contostavlos is from Greek origin but speaks fluent English with a classic North London accent. He does not think of himself to be ""English in anyway"". At home he speaks Greek. He says he is a ""foreign guy that lives in Camden"". He wears unusual hats. His trademark is a selection of woolly fleece lined hats with big pom-poms on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called ""Dappy hats"". He normally turns up one side of the hat."
Early life and current status.
"Dappy was born in Camden Town, London. It is said that he grew up in a small council flat with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large townhouse because his father was a member of 1970s band Mungo Jerry. In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was ""rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights"". Dappy showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard ""Fazer"" Rawson and Tula ""Tulisa"" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the ""Lickle Rinsers Crew"". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the ""inspiration behind the band"". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote ""Papa (Can You Hear Me?)"" was played at his funeral. It became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dappy later had the words ""RIP Dad"" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as ""B"" or ""Uncle B""."
He is a housemate in the 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK).
Personal life.
"N-Dubz were forced to change some of their live shows from the Uncle B tour after Dappy got temporary deafness. He later said that it ""was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear."""
Criticism.
"In 2007 Dappy released ""Love For My Slum"" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble. It was number one on Channel U for several weeks. It did not do as well with the media. It was heavily criticised for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a ""rich kid"" who is trying to look like a gangster. ""The Independent"" wrote ""His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement..."", they then went on to put ""Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?"". Other newspapers put that he was ""idolising thuggery"". When asked in interviews about the single, and these comments he said ""these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got""."
"In December 2008, Contostavlos pleaded guilty to two counts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex. He spat in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. He got four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay £50 to the girl and her friend, and £300 costs."
Delft
"Delft is a city in the province South Holland in the Netherlands. It is about halfway between Rotterdam and The Hague. It is famous for its Delft Blue pottery and the Delft University of Technology. It is the place where the royal family, the kings and queens, are buried. It has about 94,000 inhabitants."
Things to see.
"Delft is a city with typical Dutch canals, churches and large canal houses. The largest church in Delft is the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church)."
Deventer
"Deventer is a municipality and city in the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands. About 101,000 people were living there in 2021. It lies both in Salland and IJsselvallei regions, alongside the eastern bank of the IJssel river."
Deventer was founded by Lebuinus around 768. He built a wooden church there.
"A Catholic community called the Brethren of the Common Life was founded by priest Geert Groote in this city late 14th century. This community was connected with a Catholic reform movement called the Devotio Moderna, which was largely based on Groote and founded the same time."
"Deventer is well known for its cake, the so-called ""Deventer Koek""."
Ede
"Ede is a city in the Netherlands with 65,000 inhabitants, the communal district (gemeente) of Ede has 107,000 inhabitants."
Freud Museum
"The Freud Museum was the home of Sigmund Freud and his family after they escaped the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938. It is at 20 Maresfield Gardens in Hampstead, London."
"After the death of Anna Freud, the youngest daughter, in 1982, the home became a museum. The centrepiece of the museum is Freud's study, preserved just as it was during his lifetime."
"There are two other Freud Museums, one in Vienna, and another in Příbor, the Czech Republic, in the house where Freud was born."
The study.
"The study and library were preserved by Anna Freud after her father's death. The bookshelf behind Freud's desk contains some of his favourite authors: not only Goethe and Shakespeare but also Heine, Multatuli and Anatole France. Freud acknowledged that poets and philosophers had gained insights into the unconscious which psychoanalysis sought to explain systematically."
"The room contains the original analytic couch brought from Berggasse 19. On this patients would recline comfortably while Freud, out of sight in the green tub chair, listened to their 'free association'. They were asked to say everything that came to mind without consciously sifting or selecting information. This method became a foundation upon which psychoanalysis was built."
Antiquities.
"The study is filled with antiquities from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Orient. There are some fine masks and carving from Africa. Freud visited many archaeological sites (though not Egypt). Most of the collection was got from dealers in Vienna."
"He confessed that his passion for collecting was second only to his addiction to cigars. The importance of the collection can be seen in Freud's use of archaeology as a metaphor for psychoanalysis. One example of this is Freud's explanation to a patient that conscious material 'wears away' while what is unconscious is relatively unchanging: ""I illustrated my remarks by pointing to the antique objects about my room. They were, in fact, I said, only objects found in a tomb, and their burial had been their preservation""."
The collection includes a portrait of Freud by Salvador Dalí.
Emu
"The emu (""Dromaius novaehollandiae"") is a large flightless bird. It is native to Australia. The emu is the tallest bird from Australia. It is also the second tallest bird in the world, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. The emu is also related to the cassowary which is slightly smaller but heavier. It should also be noted, as an odd fact, that the Emus won a war against Australia."
Other emus.
There were four separate groups of emus in 1788 when the European settlers arrived. The emus on the mainland of Australia and those on the island of Tasmania may have been different species.
"There were also two species of dwarf emu, ""Dromaius minor"", one living on King Island in Tasmania and the other on Kangaroo Island. They are examples of island dwarfism. The group on King Island became extinct in 1805, that on Kangaroo Island in 1827, and that in Tasmania in 1865."
"Critics of Putin say that he has taken away people's freedoms, and that he has failed to make the country more developed. Russia makes lots of money from selling oil and gas to other countries, but because of corruption, this money is not used for improving living conditions."
"Recently, the Russian opposition has held anti-government rallies, campaigned against Putin on the Internet, and published independent reports for the general public. Because of censorship in the mass media, it's very difficult to get different information out to the public."
Putin was against invading Libya in 2011. He is also against invading Syria and Iran.
"On March 24, 2014, Putin and Russia were suspended from the G8. This was because the United States thought that the Ukraine crisis was Putin's fault."
"According to the Constitution of Russia, no-one can be president three times in a row. Because of this, Putin didn't put himself forward for the March 2008 election. However, you're allowed to be president as many times as you want, as long as it's not for more than two times in a row. In March 2012, Putin put himself forward for the elections, and won 64% of the vote. This means that he was the president of Russia until 2018."
"On December 6, 2017 Russia President Vladimir Putin announced he would run for a fourth term in the upcoming election, 2018 Russian Presidential Election."
"In July 2020, Russian voters backed a referendum that would allow Putin to serve as president until 2036."
"On 24 February 2022, Putin announced that his military was going to invade Ukraine. This happened after a year of tension and military buildup between the two countries. The invasion led to many calling Putin a war criminal and wanting him to be prosecuted as a war criminal."
Personal life.
"He is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and is divorced with two daughters."
Henry VII of England
Henry VII or Henry Tudor (28 January 1457–21 April 1509) was King of England from 1485 to 1509. He founded the Tudor dynasty by winning the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. His son became king Henry VIII of England.
Biography.
"Henry VII was born in 1457 to Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort. His father died two months before he was born, leaving his 13-year-old mother as his only parent. After Henry's birth, he spent a lot of time with his uncle Jasper Tudor. Jasper took Henry to France, where he spent most of his youth. Henry had a claim to the throne of England, but it was not a very good one, and he had to wait a long time for a chance to take the throne."
"In 1483, a new king came to the throne in England, called Richard III. King Richard was not popular with everyone. Some thought he had stolen the throne from his young nephews and had killed them. This gave Henry the chance he had been waiting for. With help from the French, he raised an army. They landed at Dale in Pembrokeshire, close to where Henry had been born, so he was able to gather more supporters on the way."
"The Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) had been going on for years. They were fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster and supporters of the House of York. Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house, tracing their descent from King Edward III."
King Henry VI and his family the House of Lancaster fought against their enemies for many years. The wars finally came to an end when King Henry VII of England came to the throne in 1485
"On 22 August 1485, Henry's army defeated Richard III's army at the Battle of Bosworth Field. When Richard III died in this battle, Henry VII became king. Other people also had a claim on the throne, and Henry did his best to stop them from taking it from him, either by executing them, putting them in prison, or trying to make friends of them, as he did with the Earl of Lincoln. Another step he took was to marry Elizabeth of York, the niece of King Richard III, who would herself have been the heir to the throne if she had not been a girl."
"There were also people who pretended to be long-lost members of the royal family, so that they could try to take the throne. One of these was a little boy called Lambert Simnel, who looked very like Edward, Earl of Warwick. The real Earl of Warwick was Henry's prisoner, but this did not stop other people from believing that Lambert was him. The Earl of Lincoln rebelled against King Henry and raised an army to make Lambert king, thinking that he himself could rule the country. There was a battle, and the Earl of Lincoln was killed. Lambert Simnel was captured, but, because he was only a child, Henry spared his life and he became a royal servant."
"Henry married Elizabeth of York, and by this action put an end to the Wars of the Roses. They had six children, but only four survived infancy:"
Henry VII increased taxes so future kings would have enough money. People disliked that.
Death.
"Henry VII died of tuberculosis in 1509 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his son, Henry VIII on 21 April 1509."
"Dover, Kent"
"Dover is a town on the coast in Kent, in the United Kingdom. It was built by the Romans. There is a castle in Dover, called Dover Castle. It is the largest castle in England. The population is about 39,078. Throughout history, it has been an important port of Britain because it is the closest port to mainland Europe. The sea between Dover and the French port of Calais is called the Strait of Dover. It is the narrowest part of the English Channel at only wide."
"The ferry port in Dover has ferries to Calais, France and Ostende, Belgium. Almost 45,000 people and 15,000 vehicles pass through the port every day. On of the largest tourist attractions around Dover are the White Cliffs of Dover."
Dover History.
"The Romans first tried to invade Dover in 55BC, under Julius Caesar. They were forced back by the Celts, who fiercely defended the coastline. It was not until 43 AD, under the rule of Emperor Claudius, that Roman forces landed on British soil at Richborough and took control of the land as far as the northern border. Dover, then called DVBRIS, became the Romans' most important naval town."

Example for different signals at the input coming from a thermometer in the machine:
Communication.
There are basically two ways of communication:
From the machine to the Simatic.
"In the machine, there are sensors. A sensor gives information about different situations in the machine. For example, how fast the motor rotates, what the temperature is or when the current action is completed. All this information is necessary for the program. The sensors give out an electrical signal, each signal goes by wire on an input of the Simatic unit. So the program knows what´s going on in the machine. This is very important, because now the program can perform the next correct step in its sequence. For example, if the temperature of the motor is too high, the program has to know it. Now the program will switch off the motor."
From the Simatic to the machine.
"In the machine, there are actuators. They cause a wanted motion, action or forming. Examples for actuators are a motor, a heater or a light. If the program says that it´s time to switch on the light in the machine, the right output of the Simatic unit will be set. That means that an electrical signal at the output goes by wire to the machine and switches on the light."
The name Simatic.
"The name Simatic is a registered trademark of the company Siemens, since 1958. Simatic connects “Siemens” and “Automatic” in one word."
Product lines.
Siemens developed four different product lines so far:
Used Software.
Every automation system needs a program to control a machine. To create a program you need a software. Siemens created their own software for their products.

Lect
A lect is a specific form of language.
Some examples of lects:
Register (linguistics)
"A register, in linguistics, is the way people use different words, spelling or grammar—talk or write differently—to different people, in different situations. They might be more polite to strangers, for example. Or they will be more respectful to their boss at work."
This chart shows the words or phrases that one would use depending on different registers:
Stratum (linguistics)
"In linguistics, a stratum, or strate, is a language that changes another language or is changed by another language."
"A substratum is the language which is changed, and a superstratum is the language that changes it. An adstratum is two languages changing each other at the same time."
Language transfer
"Language transfer is where a person uses their knowledge of one language when they learn another one. This can help them, but it can also confuse them."

Characteristics.
"Misurata Province (called even ""Misrata Province"") was located in northern Italian Libya, between the ""Tripoli Province"" and the ""Bengazi Province"". Its administrative center was the small city of Misurata on the Mediterranean coast."
"It was divided in three sections (""Circondari"" in Italian):"
"The population in the 1939 Census was of nearly 225,000 inhabitants, most of which were Arabs and Berbers. The Italians were nearly 10,000 and were concentrated in Misurata, Homs and some newly created villages for Italian colonists (Gioda, Crispi, Littoriano, Corradini, etc.)"
"Most of the population was Muslim, but there was a growing community of Catholics due to the Italian colonists immigration. Additionally there were nearly one thousand Jews in Misurata."
"The province from 1939 was considered officially part of the Kingdom of Italy, with the same laws. It was one of the 4 new Italian provinces of the so-called ""Quarta Sponda"" (Fourth Shore) of Mussolini's Greater Italia. Indeed on January 9, 1939, the colony of Italian Libya was incorporated into ""metropolitan Italy"" and thereafter considered an integral part of the Italian state (the French, in 1848, had incorporated ""French Algeria"" in the same manner)."
Neutrality Acts of the 1930s
"The Neutrality Acts of the 1930s were a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939. It responded to needs for relief, reform, and recovery from the Great Depression."

"This is algebraic notation with little figurines instead of initial letters for the pieces. Figurine notation is used in print and computer chess. Since it avoids initial letters for pieces, it is more international."
Notation for positions.
"In addition to the Forsyth notation, positions may be recorded in this simple fashion:"
Akiba Rubinstein
"Akiba Rubinstein (Stawiski, Poland, 12 December 1882 – 15 March 1961, Antwerp, Belgium) was a Polish chess Grandmaster in the first part of the 20th century. Around 1910 he was one of the three best players in the world.p346"
Biography.
"Rubinstein was Jewish, and his family planned for him to become a rabbi. However, he did not finish his studies, and chose to devote himself to chess entirely. The decision came in 1903 after he won fifth place at a tournament in Kiev. He learned to play chess when he was 16,&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford Companion to Chess"". Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and played with the strong master Gersz Salwe in Łódź."
"Rubinstein's best period was from 1907 to 1912. It began with his win at Karlovy Vary in 1907, and a shared win at St. Petersburg in the same year. It closed in a string of wins in 1912. He won five consecutive major tournaments that year: San Sebastian, Piešťany, Breslau (the German championship), Warsaw and Vilnius (although none of these events included Lasker or Capablanca).p79 Some believe that he was better than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time. Ratings from ""Chessmetrics"" support this conclusion, placing him as world #1 between mid 1912 and mid 1914. Others believe he was not quite so strong as Lasker, and was eclipsed by José Raúl Capablanca after 1911."
"Rubinstein was never given a chance to play Lasker for the world chess championship: he was unable to raise enough money to meet Lasker's financial demands. In the 1909 St. Petersburg tournament, he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him. However, he had a poor result at St. Petersburg tournament 1914, not reaching the final pool of five players. A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914, but it never took place because of the outbreak of World War I."
"After the war Rubinstein was still an elite grandmaster, but his results lacked their previous formidable consistency. Nevertheless, he won at Vienna in 1922, ahead of future world champion Alexander Alekhine, and was the leader of the Polish team that won the Chess Olympiad at Hamburg in 1930 with a superb record of thirteen wins and four draws. A year later he won an Olympic silver."
Mental health.
"After 1932 he withdrew from tournament play, mostly because his symptoms of schizophrenia prevented normal life. He suffered from a fear of people and society. He lived then in a sanitorium, and later rejoined his family."
"Rubinstein lived on for almost 30 years afterwards. He left behind no literary works (perhaps because of his mental problems), but a great heritage in his games. During World War II he was placed in an asylum. One account says that when the Nazis eventually arrived to haul the aged Jewish grandmaster from his asylum to the death camps, he was so patently insane that they abandoned the attempt."
Chess heritage.
"He was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening. He was exceptionally talented in the endgame, particularly in rook endings, where he broke new ground. Silman ranks him as one of the five best endgame players of all time, and a master of rook endgames."
"He originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit declined: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 (Rubinstein - Tarrasch, 1912). He is also credited with inventing the Meran variation, which stems from the Slav defence."
"Today, he certainly has no shortage of lines named for him. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3. is the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian defence."
"The Rubinstein Trap, a trap in the Queen's Gambit declined is named after him because he fell into it twice. One version of the trap runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 0-0 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 c6 10.0-0 Re8 11.Rc1 h6 12. Bf4 Nh5? 13. Nxd5! Now 13...cxd5?? is met by 14.Bc7, winning the queen, while 13...Nxf4 14.Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead."
"The Rubinstein Memorial tournament in his honor has been held annually since 1963 in Polanica Zdroj, with a glittering list of top-flight winners."
Martín Chambi
"Martín Chambi Jiménez, (Puno, Peru November 5, 1891 – Cuzco, September 13, 1973) was a photographer who came from the south of Peru. He was also known as Martín Chambi de Coaza. He was the only well known indigenous Latin American photographer of his time."
He is considered one of the great figures of American photography.
"Chambi is famous for the historic and social value of his photographs. He was a portrait photographer in the cities and the countryside of the Peruvian Andes. He was the leading portrait photographer in the Andean city of Cusco. Chambi also took many landscape photographs, and he sold these photographs as postcards. He was one of the first to use the postcard format in Peru."
"In 1979, MOMA in New York had a Chambi exhibition. The exhibition later moved to various locations. It inspired other international exhibitions of his work."

Calendar date
"A Calendar date is a way to refer to a certain day in a calendar. With the calendar date and the calendar, the exact day can be identified. With a different calendar, the same calendar date may refer to a different day. This can be seen easiest when comparing the Julian calendar with the Gregorian calendar."
"Calendar dates are important to refer to events (most holidays are fixed with reference to a particular event or calendar date.) One example may be Easter. In the Middle Ages, it has been fixed that Easter is to be the first Sunday that is (on or after) the 14th day after the spring equinox."
"Most calendar systems have a date format that has three parts, the day of a certain month, the month and the year. Sometimes the week is added."
Persian calendar
"The Iranian calendar also known as Persian calendar or the Jalāli Calendar is a solar calendar. It is currently used in Iran and Afghanistan. It is observation-based, rather than rule-based. Each year starts on the vernal equinox as precisely determined by astronomical observations from Tehran (or the 52.5°E meridian, which also defines IRST) and Kabul. This makes it more accurate than the Gregorian Calendar."
"The current Iranian Calendar year is 1401 AP"" (AP = Anno Persico/Anno Persarum = Persian year)""."
Hexagon
"A hexagon is a polygon with 6 sides and 6 corners (vertices). Like regular triangles and squares, hexagons fit together without gaps, which are known as tessellations. Because of this, they are often used for tiling floors. They are also quite common in nature. For example, the honeycombs in a beehive are hexagons."
West Edmonton Mall
"The West Edmonton Mall (WEM) is the second-largest shopping centre in North America. It is in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is one of the main tourist attractions in Alberta. The mall is also the fourth largest in the world. WEM first opened on September 15, 1981."

"The mall also has an Ice skating rink, miniature golf course, casino, skate park, hotel, petting zoo, three movie theaters and many other things to see."
Ahmad Khatami
Ayatollah Sayyid Ahmad Khatami () is a member of the Iranian Assembly of Experts.
"Although his name resembles that of Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president of Iran, the two men are not related. In fact, they have opposite points of view on many issues, such as democracy and velayate faqih in Iran."
Tendon
"A tendon (or sinew) is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. It is built to withstand tension. Tendons are similar to ligaments except that ligaments join one bone to another. Tendons and muscles work together, roughly as follows. When muscles contract, the tendon transmits the pull to the bone."
Anatomy.
"A tendon connects to a muscle at one end, and to bone at the other end. Each tendon has these two ""insertions""."
"Collagen fibres connect the muscle to the bones. A tendon inserts into bone at one end, and into the muscle at the other end."
"Tendons do not create any pulling force of their own. The tendons transfer the force of muscles pulling on the bone. Unlike elastin (another bodily tissue) tendons have very little ""give""."
Brad Renfro
"Brad Renfro (July 25, 1982 — January 15, 2008) was an American actor. He played Mark Sway in ""The Client"" in 1994.

Athelwald of Deira
"Athelwald (also spelled Oethelwald or Œthelwald) was a King of Deira. He was the nephew of King Oswiu of Northumbria, his overlord, but he turned on his family to support the pagan Penda of Mercia. When Penda was killed, Athelwald lost his kingdom."
Early Career.
"He was the son of King Oswald of Northumbria, who was killed by Penda of Mercia at the Battle of Maserfield in 642. At Oswald's death Northumbria was reduced back to the two kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswiu was the king of Bernicia and was acknowledge as overlord of Deira."
Penda had placed Oswine of Deira on the throne of Deira. But Oswine did not get along with his overlord Oswiu. He raised an army against Oswiu but then realized his army wasn't large enough and he sent them home. He was betrayed by one of his nobleman to Oswiu and was murdered in 651.
King of Deira.
"After Oswine's death, Athelwald became king. It is uncertain whether Oswiu (who was Athelwald's uncle) installed him as king or whether Athelwald took the kingship in opposition to Oswiu. At some point he allied himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda of Mercia. He guided Penda during his invasion of Northumbria in 655. But, when the armies of Oswiu and Penda met on 15 November at the Battle of the Winwaed, Athelwald withdrew to safety. Penda was defeated and killed. perhaps in part because of this desertion, and afterward Athelwald was not heard of again."
King Athelwald gave St. Cedd the lands of Lastingham to build a monastery.
Department
Department can mean several things:
Polar vortex
"The polar vortex (alternate names: Arctic cyclone or polar vortice) is a persistent large-scale cyclone located near geographical poles of a planet. On Earth, a polar vortex is usually in the middle and upper troposphere and stratosphere. The cyclone surrounds the polar highs. Polar storms lie in the wake of the polar front. They strengthen in the winter and weaken near summer. These vortexes span usually between 620 to 1,240 miles. They circulate counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere."
"Similar to hurricanes, a Coriolis effect causes the rotation of a polar vortex. The Arctic vortex has two main centers: one is over the Baffin Island, the other is over northeastern Siberia."
Climate change may be increasing Arctic polar vortex stretching events. This would cause more extreme cold in the United States.
Department of Alto Adige
"The Department of Alto Adige (, ) was a department of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy. It was named after the river Adige (Etsch), which flowed through it. The capital of the department was Trento."
"The department's territory was not the same as that of the modern Italian province of Alto Adige. Some of the territory is the same, such as the city of Bolzano, but most of the rest is now part of the province of Trento. These two provinces form the region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol."
History.
"The name ""Alto Adige"" was created in the late 18th century by Napoleon Bonaparte, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps. This was the name of the French administrative division known as the ""Department of Alto Adige"" (""Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige""), created during Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy in 1810. It was officially named ""Haut Adige"" to get rid of relation to the historic ""County of Tyrol"" of Austria. The District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic."
"Some years later, Napoleon created the Department of Alto Adige further north. This department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814. It was created with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino). The boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, who said that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians."

Boycott
"A boycott is a protest where the protesters do not buy a product or give money to a company. Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company."
"The word was made during the ""Irish Land War""'. It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. In 1880, the tenants (those who rented) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violent, everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the harvest, no one worked in his stables or his house. Local businessmen no longer traded with him, the postman no longer delivered his post."
"To get his harvest done, he had to hire 50 people from other counties, the counties Cavan and Monaghan. They were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen. Of course, this cost far more than what the harvest was worth."
Artificial
"When something is artificial, or man-made, it has been made by humans, not nature. For example, an artificial satellite is one made by humans, while a natural satellite is a satellite that was not made by humans. Many artificial things imitate or copy things found in nature. The imitation may use the same basic materials as those in the natural object; or it may use quite different materials, as in Artificial leather. These are concepts in defining reality. There are different ideas about what can be considered artificial and what is natural."
"The word ""artificial"" comes from the Latin words ""art"" (meaning ""skill"") and ""fex"" (""to make"")."
"Artificial does not necessarily mean ""synthetic"" (that is, created by synthesis). An artificial sweetener imitates sweetness using a chemical formula that is not found in nature; it is therefore both artificial and synthetic."
King Arthur
"King Arthur was a mythical king in the mythology of Great Britain. He lived in the medieval times, in his famous castle, Camelot. He possessed a sword known as Excalibur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake."
"King Arthur is a fabled ruler of Sub-Roman Britain who defended his kingdom from the Anglo-Saxons. He is a popular fictional character in modern literature. He won several battles, and had many homes. However, his favorite home was in Camelot. In one of the most famous tales of King Arthur, he pulls a sword out of a stone, making him King of the Britons."
"The first narrative account of Arthur's life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""History of the Kings of Britain""), completed ."
Camelot.
"Many castles claim to be Arthur's Camelot, but the most likely one is Tintagel Castle, Cornwall (though there is no evidence for this). In Camelot sat the famous Round Table, where Arthur, his queen Guinevere, Merlin, Morgan le Fay, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, Percival and many other valiant knights sat. Arthur and his knights went on many quests including The Quest For The Holy Grail, The Green Knight, The Black Knight and more."
Death.
"After King Arthur's many adventures, his son Mordred seized his kingdom and queen, forcing Arthur to fight for what was truly his. They fought for a long time. Mordred hit King Arthur in many places, but in the end Arthur killed Mordred. After this victory, King Arthur was weak and died from losing blood from battle wounds. As his knights rode back to Camelot, they threw Excalibur into the lake so that it could return to where it came from. One legend says Arthur never died, and will return when the British need him."

Also called eyelid geckos, the eublepharines have more simple features than other geckos. For example, they don't have the ability to climb surfaces. Unlike other geckos, they also have movable eyelids. They are generally active at night or at twilight. These lizards often eat insects and similar creatures. They lay a pair of leathery eggs, and, in most species, the gender of the young is determined by the temperature of the egg; just like crocodiles."
The subfamily contains the following genera:

Hematopoiesis
"Hematopoiesis (or haematopoiesis; sometimes also haemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cells. In a healthy adult person, about 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily to keep steady state levels in the blood circulation."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hemocytoblasts are the stem cells that give rise to all the other blood cells. The process is called hematopoiesis.&lt;ref name=""Birbrair n/a–n/a""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are in the core (bone marrow) of most bones."
As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression which limit the cell types it can become. It moves closer to a specific cell type (cellular differentiation). These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the surface of the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type.
HSC studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding. More recent advances have resulted in the use of HSC transplants in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders.
"The kererū (""Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae"") is the only type of pigeon native to New Zealand. It is very big and easy to spot, and its wings make a loud sound when it flies. It is the only still-living New Zealand bird which can eat large fruits whole, and so is important for spreading the seeds of many native trees. Kererū were an important type of food for Māori. There are much fewer kererū now than before the Europeans arrived in New Zealand, mostly because the Europeans brought meat-eating animals like cats, ferrets, stoats, possums, and rats, and cut down a lot of the forest. Because there are not many kererū any more, it is against the law to hunt them."
Name.
"'Kererū' is the most common name for this bird, but in some parts of the North Island it is called ""kūkū"" or ""kūkupa."" Kererū are also called ""wood pigeon"", but they are a different type of bird to the wood pigeon (""Columba palumbus"") of the Northern Hemisphere."
Description.
"Kererū are big and generally weigh between 550 and 850 grams. They have a white underbelly and dark green/blue head, shoulders, and wings. The green/blue colour is iridescent, meaning it is shiny and shows lots of different blues, greens, and purples in the sunlight."
Henotheism
"Henotheism is the adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group."
"Henotheism is sometimes defined as a monotheistic belief within a polytheistic world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god."
A henotheist would admit that many gods have real existence and are able to be worshipped. However the henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many gods.

History.
Meitei King Naothingkhong (c. 7th century) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur) built a temple dedicated to goddess Yumjao Lairembi ().
Mythology.
"Goddess Yumjao Leima appears in a human form in white clothes to come to bless her son, the King of the kingdom. Even during the death of a king, she came to the place in the form of a mortal being. She controls the life and the death of the kings. She is the chief of the household and the guidance of the kings."
Relationship with the Queen Mother.
"According to beliefs, Goddess Yumjao Leima is the divine representation of the (Royal Mother) of the kingdom. All the powerful queen mothers were integrated into goddess Yumjao Leima after their death. Goddess Yumjao Leima herself was the all-time ruling Queen Mother. The most powerful person in a kingdom was always the Queen Mother - representation of Goddess Yumjao Leima. In ancient Kangleipak, cut off heads of the enemies from the war were offered to the goddess. The Meitei kings ruled the kingdom in the name of their Queen Mothers. Battles and wars were conducted in the name of the Queen Mothers. One example is that of an event recorded in the Cheitharol Kumbaba:"
Worship.
Goddess Yumjao Leima is prayed for the longevity of life of the King. The final rites and rituals dedicated to Her are generally performed by the maibas.
Goddess Yumjao Lairemma () is mainly worshipped by the Thaopicham family of Meitei ethnicity.
"According to Meitei culture, the ""Nongmai"" class is in the middle position of the society of the maibis (priestesses). They used to take care of the cult of goddess Yumjao Lairembi."

Laikhurembi
"Laikhurembi (, ) is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess of justice, good counsel, divine law, order and secrecy. She is the chief Queen of God Thongaren ()."
She is the daughter of Lairen Humchouba. She is one of the divine incarnations of Leimarel Sidabi. She is one of the most important Umang Lais. Her pantheon is maintained particularly by the Taibungjam clan of Meitei ethnicity.
Etymology.
"In Meitei language (Manipuri language), the female first name ""Laikhurembi"" can be split up into three parts, ""Lai"", ""Khu"" and ""-rembi"". The Meitei language word ""Lai"" has multiple meanings. It may mean a god or a deity or a spirit or a disease or a picture or a painting in noun form. ""Lai"" may mean in adjective form in Meitei language. The Meitei language term ""Khu"" also has many meanings. It may mean """" or ""not "" in adjective form. It may mean a knee in noun form. It may mean ""to "" or ""to "" in verbal form. According to ""The History Of Manipur"" written by Wahengbam Ibohal, the words ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" are the names of tribes. The last part ""-rembi"" means chief, head or graceful in feminine form."
History and Origin.
"According to the Poireiton Khunthok, Laikhurembi () was the chief queen of Thongaren (). This book talks about her body in ways that show her personality. They say she had a wide mouth, which means she was loud or boastful. They say she had small breasts, which meant she used her heart less than she used her head; she was a thinking person and not a feeling person. They say she had sideways eyes, meaning she did not look at people straight on."
"Scholars think this queen may have had Asian ethnicity. Some scholars think Laikhurembi could come from a tribe that had both ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" people in it. Other scholars think ""Laikhurembi"" is just her title and not her name."
"Laikhurembi () is the daughter of Lai-ren Humchouba (, : Hoom Chao Hpa). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Lai-ren"" means ""Chief of Lai"". In Meitei language, the word ""Lai"" has many meanings."
"Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of King Thongaren (). Then king asked her to marry his younger brother, Poireiton, instead, because Poireiton's wife had died. Poireiton was beginning a journey to ""Tai Pang Pan"" and King Thongalel thought it would not be good for Poireiton to go without a wife. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. Instead of Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife Leinaotabi to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife."
Description.
"The Goddess Laikhurembi had special powers. She was ""Yungyatnaba"" (lit. ""erect and sharp"") which meant she could see objects accurately no matter how far away they were. She could look at a person and see who he or she truly was inside. When she made a judgement, she would announce her decision wisely, and people got the right rewards for what they had done (""things given in recognition of service, effort or achievement"")."
"No one could find the Goddess Laikhurembi unless she wanted them to find her. No matter how hard a person would look, she could hide and stay hidden."
The Brittas Empire
The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.
Chris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.
The show ran for seven series and 52 episodes — including two Christmas specials — from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.
"""The Brittas Empire"" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's ""Britain's Best Sitcom"" poll."
"The show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in ""The Brittas Empire""."
Plot summary.
"Gordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives."
"Helen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it hard to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent."
"Brittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss."
Episodes.
"""The Brittas Empire"" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called ""Get Fit with Brittas""."
"For the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank."
"However, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith, Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent."
"'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre."
"In 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix."
DVD and VHS releases.
"All seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s."
Critical response.
Critics John Lewis and Penny Stempel commented that:
"In its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, ""The Brittas Empire"" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch."
Influence.
"The show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and ""The Office""."
Setting.
"The exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire."

Black Forest ham
"Black Forest ham () is a variety of dry-cured smoked ham produced in the Black Forest region of Germany. Since 1997, it can only be made in a well-defined geographical area. In the case of Black Forest ham, the salting, and curing needs to be done in the Black Forest. Most of the pigs used come from other regions of Germany, or the European Union. This only applies to the European Union, though. In the United States and Canada, there are different kinds of ham which are sold as ""Black Forest ham"": These are usually produced locally, and very often, the methods of producing them are different from the original of the Black Forest."
"In 2018, about 6. 1 million tons were produced. About 85 percent was sold through discount stores, about ten percent was sold through specialized retailers, and the remaining fice percent was sold through restaurants."
Preparation.
"Raw ham is salted and seasoned with garlic, coriander, pepper, juniper berries and other spices. After curing for two to three weeks, the salt is removed and the ham aged an additional two weeks. It is then cold-smoked using ""local conifers and sawdust"" at around for several days. It ripens in an air-conditioned room for several weeks, becoming almost black on the outside and acquiring much of its distinctive flavor. As a result it usually tastes very salty."
Characteristics.
"Black Forest ham is boneless and about one-fifth fat. It has a very pronounced flavor and is common in German cuisine. It may be eaten fresh, for example on ""Holzofenbrot"" or rye bread, with fruit, or used as an ingredient in cooked dishes. Whole pieces of Black Forest ham can be preserved for months when stored properly. It is typically served at room temperature."

Yukultji Napangati
Yukultji Napangati is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She is a painter of the Papunya Tula group of artists. She is part of a generation of female painters who followed in the footsteps of the original male Papunya Tula artists.
"Yukultji grew up around Marruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay. She grew up without knowing about places like Kiwirrkurra, or her relatives living there. She had never met anyone from outside her own family. Her family lived a completely traditional nomadic way of life. Her father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo, but he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Yukultji's father died sometime around 1980. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. The event was big news at the time, and the family became famously known as ""the last nomads"". Yukultji was the youngest of this group."
"Yukultji experienced major culture shock when first coming out of the desert. She often found new things difficult to understand. In an interview once, she remembers, ""I hopped into a car and crouched down, and I saw the trees move. I was frightened. I was scared. I jumped right off because the trees were racing around the place."""
"Yukultji began painting in the early 1990s. Before this, she had watched her brothers painting and later decided to try it for herself. She paints stories and songs from her and her mother's dreaming. These stories are about her traditional country, around Marruwa, Ngaminya and Marrapinti."
"Her paintings are shown in several public collections in Australia. Her work has been shown in over 80 exhibitions in Australia and overseas. She was a finalist in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In 2012, Yukultji won the Alice Prize, an award for Australian artists in Alice Springs."

"Yalti was born in the Great Sandy Desert, sometime around 1970. She and her family lived as nomads in the desert, travelling along the western side of Lake Mackay. Most other Pintupi families had moved into settlements during the 1950s, but Yalti's father kept the family away from these. Her parents were Lanti (or ""Joshua"") and Nanu. She has an older brother, Tamayinya, and a younger sister, Yukultji. She married Warlimpirrnga sometime during the early 1980s, possibly when she was as young as 12. She and her family came out of the desert in 1984. She now lives at Kiwirrkurra, and has two sons and two daughters."
"Yalti finished her first paintings for Papunya Tula in June 1996. She makes acrylic paintings of landscapes associated with Pintupi dreaming stories. Her paintings are of important places in her country, around Marruwa, Laurryi, Wirrulnga and Patjarr."

He was a strong supporter of indigenous Australian rights (including land rights) and national aid for schools. In 1977, he was elected to the House of Representatives as member for Melbourne Ports. When Bob Hawke became Prime Minister in 1983, he put Holding in charge of Aboriginal Affairs. During his term, Holding tried to make federal laws for Aboriginal land rights. But Brian Burke, the Labor Premier of Western Australia, did not want this, because it would have upset the mining and agricultural industries, which were very important to his state. Holding was forced by Hawke to drop the proposal. In 1987, he was moved to the Ministry of Employment Services and Youth Affairs. The next year, he was made Minister for Transport, and then later Minister for Immigration."
Kottabos
"Kottabos () was a party game played at symposia in Ancient Greece. It was popular in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. It was also popular with the Etruscans. The game is played by flinging a bit of wine from one's cup at targets. The player would utter the name of his lover. The game was probably of Sicilian origin but spread throughout the Greek world. Many Greek poets mention the game in their works. By the time of the Roman Empire and the Age of Alexander the Great, the game had died out. It is not mentioned in Latin literature."

Pygmy peoples
"Pygmy is a word that describes several ethnic groups with unusually short people. According to anthropologists, pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than tall on average. The best known pygmies are the Aka, Efé and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil. The Negritos of Southeast Asia are also called pygmies."
"The word ""pygmy"" is sometimes thought to be pejorative (an insult). It is, however, the only word that is used to call ""all"" African Midgets."
"The word Bayaka is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies. In the Congo Basin, pygmies are called the Kongo word Bambenga."
Name.
"The name ""pygmy"" comes from the Greek word (""pygmaios""). This word was derived from (came from) the word which is the length between a person's elbow and knuckles. The Latin word (pl. ""pygmaei"") came from this older Greek word."
"The word was first used in Greek mythology by the poet Homer. He wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called ""Pygmies"" who lived in India and Ethiopia."
Origins.
"There are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short. It has been proved that their height is hereditary, and is passed on from parents to children. It may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests, where many pygmies live. This would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin D in their skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is important for bones to grow. Since the pygmies would get less calcium, they would have smaller bones and skeletons."
There are other explanations for why pygmies are so short. Some explanations are:
Some research shows that the genes for the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone are found much less in pygmies than in related tribes. These genes are important for humans to grow tall.
Africa.
"Pygmies can be found in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. Most of these groups are partly hunter-gatherers. They get food from the environment and trade it with nearby farmers. From the farmers they get crops and tools. There are about 250,000-600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest."
"James Buchanan was born on April 23, 1791 in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania, into a prosperous merchant family. He had four sisters and three brothers, and studied at the Old Stone Academy before entering Dickinson College in 1807. There he studied law and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1812."
"Buchanan was engaged to Anne C. Coleman, but she died early, and he never had children. He is the only U.S. president who was never married."
"Buchanan served in both the House and Senate, representing Pennsylvania, as well as the Minister to Russia, under Andrew Jackson, before stepping taking the presidential career."
Presidency.
"During the beginning of his presidency, he called slavery an issue of little importance. This was clearly not the case at the time; Northerners and Southerners were very divided on slavery, almost to the point of war."
The Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not American citizens and that the states were allowed to keep slavery legal. James Buchanan supported that decision because he did not want the pro-slavery states to stop being part of the United States.
"Buchanan supported the rights of slave owners to keep their slaves and wanted Kansas to adopt a constitution that allowed slavery. Because of that, the Democratic Party was divided on that issue and after the 1858 Congressional election, there were more Republicans in Congress than Democrats. He did not get along with the Republicans."
He ordered troops to fight against Utah based on untrue information that Utah was planning a revolt. Buchanan later realized that he made a mistake and apologized.
"During his term, the country was becoming more and more divided over the slavery issue. A few months before his term ended, some of the southern states decided that they were going to not be a part of the United States any more."
"Buchanan believed that it was a bad thing, but he did nothing about it because he felt that using force against the south was against the Constitution. He did not even prepare the country for war."
Legacy.
"At the end of his term, he left the next president, Abraham Lincoln, to face the greatest crises in United States history, the Civil War."
"Some historians think that Buchanan was the worst president of the United States in the history, because he did nothing to prevent the Civil war."
Hand
A hand is the part of the body at the end of an arm. Most humans have two hands. Each hand usually has four fingers and a thumb. On the inside of the hand is the palm. The five bones inside this part of the hand are called metacarpals. The wrist connects the hand to the arm. The hand has 27 bones including the wrist bones.
"When the fingers are all bent tightly, the hand forms a fist. The joints that are the hardest part of the fist are called knuckles. Many other animals, especially other primates, have hands that can hold things. Human hands can do things other hands cannot."

Qatar and Bahrain's flag is the same design but not the same colors because Qatar is white and maroon and Bahrain is white and red."
History.
"People have lived in Bahrain before there was writing. It has been ruled and influenced by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, and the Arabs, who made the island Muslim. Bahrain was in old times known as Dilmun, Tylos, Awal and Mishmahig."
"The islands of Bahrain, set in the middle south of the Persian Gulf, have attracted many invaders in history. The word ""Bahrain"", ""Two Seas"", means that the islands contain two kinds of water, sweet water springs and salty water in the sea."
"A location between East and West, fertile lands, fresh water, and pearls made Bahrain important in history. About 2300 BC, Bahrain started trading with Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and the Indus Valley (now near India). It was then called Delmon, and was linked to the Sumerian Civilization about 2000 BC. Bahrain also became part of the Babylonian empire about 600 BC. Historical records called Bahrain the ""Life of Eternity"", ""Paradise"", the ""Pearl of the Persian Gulf"" and other names."
"Until 1521, Bahrain also ruled Al-Hasa and Qatif (both are now the eastern province of Saudi Arabia) and Awal (now the Bahrain Islands). The country had all of the land from what is now Kuwait to Oman. This was called ""Iqlim Al-Bahrain"" (Province of Bahrain). In 1521, the Portuguese took Awal (now Bahrain) from the rest and since then the name of Bahrain only means today's Bahrain."

They were the fourth variety of BR's then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs, eventually encompassing 755 vehicles and five classes (313/314/315/507/508). They have mostly worked on the Merseyrail network since 1983, and continue to do so, now refurbished by Alstom's Eastleigh Works."
Iași
Iaşi is a city in the northeastern part of Romania. It is the second largest city in Romania as of the year 2007. Iaşi used to be the capital of Moldavia.
History.
Alexandru Lăpuşneanu changed the capital of Moldavia from Suceava to Iaşi in 1564. One of the first churches to be built in Moldavia was built by the Greek adventurer Prince Ioan Iacob Heraclid.
The Tatars burned the city down in 1513. The Ottoman Empire also burned the city down in 1538 and people from the Imperial Russian army did so again in 1686. The plague spread throughout the city in 1734.
The Russo-Turkish War of 1787 was stopped when the Peace of Iaşi happened. Alexander Ypsilanti and the Filiki Eteria came into the city and took it in 1822.
"Iaşi was the capital of Moldavia from 1568 to 1859. When World War I happened, Iaşi became the capital of Romania. This happened when the Central Powers took Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Bucharest became the capital again when Imperial Germany was defeated."
Geography.
"Iaşi can be found on the Bahlui River, which is a tributary of the Jijia. Forests and uplands are very common. These woods and hills include the monasteries of Cetăţuia, Frumoasa, and Galata. People have thought that Iaşi was built on seven hills (Cetăţuia, Galata, Copou-Aurora, Bucium-Păun, Şorogari, Repedea and Breazu in Romanian)."

Knockout stage.
"In 1910, Emil Kraepelin named the disease 'Alzheimer's disease'. Alzheimer's disease usually beigins affecting people between ages 60–65, in Ms. Deter's case - who was 55-years-old when she died - she had a form of what is now known as ""Early-onset Alzhiemer's disease""."
Famous cases.
"Anyone can get Alzheimer's disease, rich people or poor famous people and unfamous people. Some of the famous people who have gotten Alzheimer's disease are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch, both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities got worse with the disease."
"Other cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Puskás, the former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (United Kingdom) and Adolfo Suárez (Spain), the actress Rita Hayworth, the Nobel Prize-winner Raymond Davis, Jr., the actors Charlton Heston and Gene Wilder, the novelist Terry Pratchett, politician and activist Sargent Shriver, the Blues musician B.B. King, director Jacques Rivette, Indian politician George Fernandes,"
"and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. Kao. In 2012, Nobel Prize writer Gabriel García Márquez was diagnosed with the disease. Former Finnish President Mauno Koivisto died of the disease in May 2017. Country singer Glen Campbell died of the disease in August 2017."
Elaine Paige
"Elaine Paige OBE (born Elaine Jill Bickerstaff, 5 March 1948) is an English actress and singer. She was born and raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, in 1948. She is known for her roles in musical theater."
Life.
"She worked in the theatre from a young age. She quickly became famous in the role of Eva Perón in the musical ""Evita"" in 1978. She studied acting at the Aida Foster stage school in London and then played roles in the British tour of the show ""The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd"" and the first London production of ""Hair"". She played Sandy in the London production of ""Grease"" and appeared as one of Michael Crawford's girlfriends in ""Billy"". She has since said she was about to leave the world of acting, possibly to become a teacher, but then the role in ""Evita"" was offered to her."
"After ""Evita"", she did not have any work for a period. She thought that her musical career had seen its best. When the actress Judi Dench had an injury during rehearsals for ""Cats"", the producers asked Paige play the role in stead of Dench. They stated that the role ""was not another ""Evita"""" and that her role only had one and a half songs. Fortunately, the song was ""Memory"", which was a top 10 hit for Paige and has become her signature song."
"After ""Cats"", she appeared in ""Abbacadbra"", an ABBA compilation, and ""Chess"", also written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA but with lyrics by Tim Rice, co-writer of ""Evita"". Paige then scored a number 1 single, ""I Know Him So Well"", a song from ""Chess"", as a duet with Barbara Dickson."
"In 1989, she co-produced and starred in a production of Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"" in London, which made a star of John Barrowman. In the early 1990s, her term relationship with the lyricist Tim Rice stopped and Paige tried an image change by recording an album with a California-based producer in the Bette Midler torch singer vein entitled ""Love Can Do That"". Her solo albums had so far been a variety of songs, including the very successful ""Stages"" in 1983, with songs from musical theatre. In 1993, she returned to the United States to work with Peter Matz on an album called ""Romance and the Stage"" featuring songs from earlier days of musical theatre. The following year, she recorded, ""Piaf"", which had music from the role she was playing in the Pam Gems play, also called ""Piaf"". Critics were impressed by her acting skills in that play."
"However, in 1995 she had a role in another musical, playing Norma Desmond in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Sunset Boulevard"". She had always wanted to perform on Broadway and ""Sunset Boulevard"" now made this possible. For more than a year she played the role. She later had another role in 2000 with the ""King and I"". She has recently moved more into television and radio work."
Paige was awarded an OBE in 1995. Now she is hosting a Sunday afternoon BBC Radio 2 show which plays music from the stage and film.

History.
"The station was built as the terminus of what would become the Hudson Bay Railway in 1908. At first it served by terminating services from the cities in the south. but later destinations were expanded. By 1929 trains were running to Churchill, Thompson, Flin Flon, Lynn Lake, Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Prince Albert. By the 1960s all train services were operated by CN. In 1978 Serives were taken over by Via Rail whom at the time operated a total of 18 departures per week out of the station."
The 1978 timetable consisted of:
In 1980 terminating services from Saskatoon were cancelled. Then in 1981 Via received a budget cut which saw tri-weekly services to thompson and to Winnipeg via Swan River discontinued. In 2002 services to Lynn Lake were cut back to Pukatawagan followed by the service being cancelled in 2006 and replaced by a twice weekly mixed use train operated by the local first nations. In 2011 one of the 3 weekly trips to and from Churchill was made to terminate here rather than continue on to Winnipeg. In 2018 flooding saw services to Churchill cut back to Gillam and they weren't restored until over a year later. During the Covid 19 Pandemic terminating services were cancelled and service to Winnipeg and Churchill were retained on a once weekly freequency. This is because the route served vital communites without reliable road access. Service has since reached pre-pandemic levels.
Services.
Currently The Pas sees 7 departures per week to a few destinations:
The Pas also sees 1 train per week which arrives from Churchill which terminates there.
Fly orchid
"The fly orchid, ""Ophrys insectifera"", is a flower which uses scent for mimicry."
The plant uses scent to mimic the wasps' female sexual pheromones. This attracts male wasps. The wasps pollinate the flowers as they try to mate with them.
"It is a remarkable example of sexually deceptive pollination and floral mimicry. The plant is pollinated by only two species of wasp of the genus ""Argogorytes""."
"The soil the orchid grows in is poor, and it needs mycorrhiza to help it get nutrients."

"The tradition started from Patriarch Francesco Barbaro in the church of St. Mary in the castle of Udin, from 1596 and 1616. Since the end of the 17th century many authors wrote many ""Nunsiadis"", among the other Zuan Tite Tomadin, Antoni De Zorz, Meni Pecile, Vigji Comencin, Zuan Tite Candot, Jacop Tomadin and Vitori Franz. The version of Candot is the most singed nowadays."

John Denver
"The dance is thought to have come from about 5,000 years ago when the Koreans believed that the Sun, Moon, and Earth controlled the world. The people (almost always girls in hanboks) would dance under the brightest full moon of the year in order to bring a good harvest."
"In the 16th century, when the Japanese were attacking Korea, Korea's Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered women to do this dance. He told them to do this because he wanted to trick the Japanese into overestimating them. The women were said to have worn military uniforms and danced on Mount Okmae (옥매산)."
"On February 15, 1966, ganggangsullae was included in the list of the ""Important Cultural Properties of Korea"" #8."
Description.
"Traditionally, this dance performed without any instruments. Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight. They go outside in hanbok, traditional Korean clothing, hold hands, make a circle, and start rotating clockwise. The lead singer sings a line. Then, the rest of the people all sing, 'ganggangsullae'. Then the lead singer sings another line, and the rest of the people reply, 'ganggangsullae'. This is probably where the name of the song came from. As the dance continues, the tempo of the song can get faster. They sing about their personal hardships, relationships, and wants. During the dance, the women also play some games. The ganggangsullae can last until dawn."

Risks.
"Bulimia nervosa can cause many health problems. Because vomit has lots of acid in it, purging frequently can burn the person's mouth, throat, or teeth. One can lose nutrients or fluids in their body. Glands in one's throat and face may get larger and hurt. The immune system is weakened, as well as the possibility of muscle or heart problems."
Sometimes bulimia can cause difficulty breathing. This is because the acids that are in your mouth go to your lungs and damage the bronchioles. There is also feedback to the ego and a social stigma that may cause further psychological impact.
Statistics.
Most people who have bulimia are between the ages of 10 to 25. It is more common in females than it is in males. People who have had past trauma are more likely to be bulimic. People with obsessive compulsive disorder or perfectionism are also likely to have bulimia.

"It has ed spikes of reddish-green flowers, which bloom in summer, becoming purplish. The stamens and pistils are on different plants (dioecious); the ripe seeds are brown and shining."
Uses.
"Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves may be puréed in soups and sauces or added to salads and shav; they have a flavour that is similar to kiwifruit or sour wild strawberries. The plant's sharp taste is due to oxalic acid, which is a poison. In small quantities sorrel is harmless; in large quantities it can be fatal."

Electron transport chain
"An electron transport chain (ETC) is how a cell gets energy from sunlight in photosynthesis. Electron transport chains also occur in reduction/oxidation (""redox"") reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration."
"In aerobic respiration, each molecule of glucose leads to about 34 molecules of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) being produced by the electron transport chain. This is by far the most productive part of respiration."
Background.
The electron transport chain consists of a series of redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. The underlying force driving these reactions is the free energy (energy available to do work) of the reactants and products. Any reaction that decreases the overall free energy of a system will happen.
ATP synthase is an enzyme found among all domains of life. It is powered by a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient. This is the result of the series of redox reactions. What the electron transport chain does is produce this gradient. The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis.

Kuwait
"Kuwait is a small Arab country (about 17,819 square kilometers) in the Middle East."
"Kuwait is the most socially progressive country in the Gulf region. It has a small and rich economy. It has about 96 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. Crude oil reserves are the oil that is still under the ground and has not yet been cleaned up. Kuwait has 10% of all of the oil reserves in the world. The country makes a lot of money by selling oil. This money is almost half of all the money the country makes. The oil money is also 95% of the money made by selling things to different countries (people call that exports). Also, the oil money is 80% of the money the government makes. Kuwait is now talking with oil companies of other countries to make oil fields in the northern part of the country."
"Kuwait's weather makes farming hard (too little rain). Instead of farming, the country catches fish and buys food from other countries. About 75% of the country's water to drink has to be distilled (have the salt removed) or purchased from other countries."
"In 1990, Iraq invaded (brought an army in to fight against) Kuwait. This started the first Gulf War. Kuwait's official religion is Islam, although 15% of its population are Christian or Hindu. Arabic is mostly spoken in Kuwait but English is widespread among Kuwaitis (residents of Kuwait). Kuwait is one of the few nations that has education for every age."
Another interesting fact about Kuwait is that a lot of people speak English.

Governorates.
"Kuwait is divided into 6 governorates. The governorates are divided into districts, And the establishment of the governorates of Kuwait dates back to the Emiri Decree No. 6 issued in 1962, which divided Kuwait into three governorates: the Capital Governorate, Hawalli Governorate and Al-Ahmadi Governorate. The decree clarified the work of the governor, his subordination of the governor to the Ministry of Interior, and his responsibility towards security, provided that the Ministry of Interior issues the necessary decisions to indicate the limits of the governor's jurisdiction. There have been some changes regarding the governorates of Kuwait, which we summarize as follows:"
". On November 14, 1979: Some provisions of the administrative division decree were amended so that a fourth governorate, Al-Jahra Governorate, was added."
". On October 12, 1988: The first article of the article was amended to divide Kuwait into five governorates by adding Al-Farwaniyah Governorate."
". On November 27, 1999: Emiri Decree No. 290 was issued to add a sixth governorate, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate."
"Thus, Kuwait has become administratively divided into six governorates, each affiliated with several regions. Warba Island and Bubiyan Island belong to the Jahra Governorate, while the rest of the islands belong to the Capital Governorate."

Otherkin
"Otherkin are people who believe that part of them is not human inside. They say that, inside themselves, they feel more like another animal than a human. That other animal can be, for example, a wolf, a dragon or an alien. Some otherkin say that they are vampires and are usually acting like them, for example by drinking blood."
"Otherkin may also say they feel a special connection to other natural elements, for example minerals, the likes of fire, water, and wind, or plants."
"Otherkin is a neologism—a new word—and it is usually used only by people who say they ""are"" otherkin. The definition can change depending on who uses the word. Some otherkin say that their souls or minds are not human, that they were another species in a past life, or that being not-human is part of their religion. (Otherkin practice many different religions, however.) A few of them say that their physical bodies are not human, either, but there is no proof either for or against that."

Use of bonfires for rituals.
"Bonfires were also used for rituals. The idea was that the fire would purify. It was used to consecrate things, or people, that is to make them sacred, in some way. In ancient times, cattle were important symbols of wealth and status. Such cattle were led through the smoke of a bonfire. Couples who were to be wed on May Day would leap through the flames of the bonfire to seal their vows. Coals from a bonfire would be taken home to light the fires in family hearths. This practice was thought to bring good fortune. People also believed that the residents of the Faery realm were incapable of producing fire themselves; embers of bonfires would be carried to the underworld and tended there."

"The coal swamps were world-wide because, for that long time, the continents were close together in Gondwana. Therefore they had similar wet, tropical climates."
History.
The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian (~300 milliom years ago). Their distribution across several continents led Eduard Suess to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single supercontinent – Gondwana.
These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (~250mya).
"The only convincing Triassic records are very earliest Triassic leaves from Nidpur, India. Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur."
"Some textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the Jurassic. These are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves, such as those of ""Gontriglossa"", ""Sagenopteris"", or ""Mexiglossa""."
"Glossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the end-Permian mass-extinction event."
Gnetophyta
"The Gnetophytes are a group of seed plants with three genera. Their evolutionary relationships are unclear, but it is now clear that they are related to each other."
The three genera are:

"Changing how addends are grouped in an addition does not change its sum either. This is called the ""associative property of addition""."
For example: formula_9
Additive inverses (opposites).
The opposite of a number formula_10 is formula_11. A number formula_10 plus its opposite formula_11 is always equal to 0: formula_14
"For example, the opposite of 5 is -5, because formula_15"
The absolute value of two opposite numbers is always the same.
Subtraction.
"Subtraction is the second arithmetic operation and the inverse operation of addition. The number that is being subtracted is the ""subtrahend"" and the number it is subtracted from is the ""minuend"". The result of a subtraction is called a ""difference""."
The symbol for subtraction is −
Examples of subtractions:
formula_16
formula_17
formula_18
formula_19
formula_20
formula_21
"Because of the ""additive identity"", any number minus zero is the same number (formula_22)."
"In a subtraction of two terms, switching the minuend and the subtrahend changes the sign of the answer, meaning subtraction is anticommutative."
For example: formula_23 and formula_24
Multiplication.
"Multiplication is the third arithmetic operation and the second hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of division. The terms in a multiplication are called ""factors"", and the result of a multiplication is called a ""product""."
Multiplication is repeated addition.
The symbol for multiplication is × (• in algebra)
Examples of multiplications:

"Any number times one is the same number (formula_30). This is called the ""multiplicative identity""."
For example: formula_31
"Changing the order of the factors in a multiplication does not change its product. This is called the ""commutative property of multiplication""."

Panam Ningthou
"Panam Ningthou () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion. He is the protector of crops, especially paddy from hailstorm and thunder. According to legends, He ignited fire for the first time by rubbing flints. He is one of the Umang Lai deities."
History.
"God Panam Ningthou has his major cult center in Andro village. The Andro village in Imphal East district of present day Manipur is an ancient village. People of this village worship fire that is kept burning from the time of Poireiton Khunthokpa (34 BC-18 BC). The fire is kept in the Chakpa Panam Ningthou Meihoupirol (lit. ""Panam Ningthou sacred burning fireplace"")."
"According to R. Constantine, the fire burning in Andro is the oldest man-made fire in India. It has been burning without break for centuries."
Description.
"According to Thomas Callan Hodson (T.C. Hodson), Panam Ningthou is a rain and weather God of the Meitei people of Manipur. He recorded his description in his monograph The Meitheis published in 1908."
Mythology.
"When it was one or two days before the Lai Haraoba festival of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou begins, the God came to his temple in the form of a ball of light. He came flying from the east. He landed at a part of the Nongmaiching Hill. Sometimes, some people of Andro claimed to see that ball of light, even at other times of the year."
"God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou has a wife named Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi. Some people believed that she might be of Burmese origin. So, the God went to Burma () to meet her from time to time."
Festival and worship.
God Panam Ningthou is mainly worshipped by the people of Loi caste of Meitei ethnicity in Manipur. He has his major cult center in Andro village of Imphal East district of Manipur.
"Shakespeare noted that the Loi people regarded God Panam Ningthou as a special deity of the Meitei king. He further noted that the King himself provided sacrificial animals to the God. Buffalo was one among the sacrificial animals used to be sacrificed during the Lai Haraoba festival. Pigs were sacrificed when there was no Lai Haraoba festival. Whenever there was any suspicion of danger to the Meitei king, the King would send a pig and a cock to be sacrificed to God Panam Ningthou of Andro."
"The Chakpa Haraoba (one of the 4 types of Lai Haraoba festival) is annually celebrated in honor of God Panam Ningthou. The festive occasion falls in the Meitei lunar month of Lamta (""March-April interface month""). The festival starts from the first Sunday of the ""Lamta"" month."
"During the 9 day long festival, no outsiders of Andro are allowed to stay at the village. In modern times, notice is issued one month before the festival begins through mass media like television, newspaper and radio. The notice informs outsiders to leave the place as it is about to begin the festival. Natives of Andro may come to Andro before the festival starts. Once the festival begins, no one is allowed to either leave from or come to the village. People who have converted into another religion are not allowed to participate in the religious festival even if they are native of Andro. There are some Christian converts and Hindu converts in Andro."
"During the festival, people of ""Andro village"" wear black clothes as a custom. Besides Panam Ningthou, there are twelve other deities worshipped in Andro. During the Lai Haraoba festivals of these deities, outsiders of Andro can witness the event. The festivals in their honor are done separately from that of Panam Ningthou. But the festival of Pureiromba can be done together with that of Panam Ningthou. At this too, outsiders can witness the event but the place of worship is different from the exclusive one of Panam Ningthou."
"During the Haraoba of Panam Ningthou, there is no shortage of meat and wine. Boys and girls play important role in the festival."
Temple.
"The Temple of Panam Ningthou is in Andro, Manipur. It is also the Loishang (English: Office) to the representatives of the ""pana""s (English: State Divisions).

Association with other gods.
"According to the Thalon text, Panam Ningthou was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill. The cults of these five gods were integrated into that of a single God with the name ""Langmai Ningthou"" (lit. ""King of the Langmais""). The personal names became the aliases or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people evolved into a chiefdom. This chiefdom later rose to the Angom clan."

Selenography is the study of the physical features of the Moon.
Sorption
"When two chemical substances come in contact with each other, through what is called a phase, they will interact with each other in that phase. They may also have an interface. If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption, if the same process happens on the interface, it is called adsorption. In the year 1909, James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process, in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and adsorption."
"Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment; using sorption it is possible to bind pollutants to small particles in the air (called aerosols), or in the soil (where they bind to colloids). Sorption makes these bindings possible. In much the same way, polluants can be transported over long distances."
Machines and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning.

Khoriphaba
Khoriphaba () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). He is the son of Sky God Salailen. He came down from heaven to earth to search for his mother and then for a bride. He is best known for wrestling with Loyalakpa in the Lai Haraoba festival. He is also a polo playing God.
Description.
"God Khoriphaba is a Lainingthou. In Ancient Meitei language, ""Lai"" means God or Deity and ""Ningthou"" means King or Ruler. However, the term ""Lainingthou"" carries many meanings. It may refer to ""king of gods"", ""godly king"" or ""kingly god"". Since Khoriphaba is not the king of gods, he is a kingly god."
Khoriphaba is a sportsman. He participated in polo as well as wrestling championships.
"Among the deities, God Khoriphaba and God Loyalakpa possess the epithets of being the best wrestlers. The two powerful gods wrestled during the Lai Haraoba festival."
"God Khoriphaba is one of the polo player gods. He participated in the divine polo match. During the godly polo championship, Khoriphaba joined the southern team. His team was led by God Thangjing while his opponent's team (northern team) was led by God Marjing."
Mythology.
"God Khoriphaba was born with the divine union of God Salailen (alias Soraren) and Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi at Heaven. When Khoriphaba was three months old (or ""three years old""), his parents got separated. His mother was abandoned from entering into Heaven. So, little Khoriphaba was looked after by the 1000 queens of heaven. But he cried for his mother. Salailen tried to pacify the baby's cry but in vain. He gave him milk but it was of no use. He summoned his nobles and subjects. He asked them to make his son stop crying. Thousands of gods and goddesses tried but all of them failed to stop the boy's cry. Finally, Chingkheirel Apamba tried his luck. He sang hymns in praise of the baby God. Suddenly, the boy stopped crying. At this, Salailen named his son ""Khoiriphaba""."
"One day, Angoupalba Yaibirel Sidaba found Khoiriphaba crying near a tree. He brought the boy to his home. He asked his family to take care of the boy. The clan members looked after the child like their own child. They named him ""Puthiba""."
"One day, Khoiriphaba heard some women talking about him. They said, ""Look how cute the child is! We love him so much! His mother would have loved him many times than we love him. How much his mother would have suffered for the loss of the child."" Khoiriphaba immediately asked them about his mother. But none knew the answer to his question. So, he decided to search for his mother by himself."
God Khoriphaba descended from sky down to earth in search for his lost mother Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.
"He came to Moirang near Khoiri Keithel. The sun already set when he was there. Not knowing what to do, he started crying. God Thangjing and his consort Koiren Leima came to him. They came to know about the identity of the boy. The divine couple took care of Khoiriphaba."
"Under the guardianship of God Thangjing, Khoiriphaba grew up. He made many friends. He was nine years old. He started wrestling (), race, and so on. He was always the champion of all the competitions. This made his friends fell jealous of him. So, one of his friends told him about how he grew up under the care of Thangjing. Khoriphaba was told that they would not allow him to play with them because he was an inferior God. Khoriphaba felt dejected for many days. Thangjing noticed it and asked him. Khoiriphaba narrated him the incident. So, Thangjing decided that Khoiriphaba should be sent to his mother without further delaying. He summoned all the 27 friends of Khoiriphaba. He asked them to challenge Khoiriphaba for wrestling and race championships. None were ready for the challenge. Then Thangjing asked them about a tug of war in which all of them would stand together at one side and Khoiriphaba alone at another side. There was a condition. If they won, they would be the winner. But if Khoiriphaba won, they should send Khoiriphaba off to his mother's place at Haorok Konthou, carrying him on a palanquin. The 27 friends accepted the challenge. But all of them got defeated in the hands of Khoiriphaba."
"On the next day, the 27 friends proceeded for the journey with Khoiriphaba on a palanquin towards Haorok Konthou. They came from a long distance from Moirang. On the way, they came across a beautiful place. They could not control themselves to rest at the beautiful place for a while. They requested Khoiriphaba who agreed. The beautiful place where they rested was named ""Toubul"" (). Some friends were waiting for the resting friends at another place. The place where they waited was named ""Ngaikhong"". After some time, little by little, all of his friends left Khoiriphaba alone. So, Khoiriphaba continued his journey alone. On the way, he came across a river. On the river, many women were fishing using nets. Since morning, they could not catch a single fish. He was helped by a woman to cross the river."
"Finally, he reached Haorok Konthou. The people of the place were greatly awed to see him. They have heard of his quest. But Goddess Tampha was not at the place. Due to the fear of Salailen, the villagers sent her off to another place. She was looked after by the Kabui tribes in the hills. So, Khoriphaba set off for the next journey riding on his mare Ngangrubi."
"On reaching the village of the Kabui tribes in the hills, he was warmly welcomed by the tribesmen. He finally met his long departed mother. He proposed her to return home back to heaven. But she did not agree because she was abandoned by her husband. So, he sadly left his mother."
"There are also legends about God Khoriphaba looking for a bride. He veiled his face and hold a polo-stick over his shoulder. While searching for a lover, he was riding on a mare."
"God Khoriphaba reached Koubru's place. God Koubru offered him to choose any lady of his choice from his place. Khoriphaba chose Goddess Nungthel Leima. But Nungthel Leima was already the consort of Loyalakpa. So, God Koubru could not give him the desired lady. Koubru did not want to take back his own words. He asked Khoriphaba to choose any lady but he should do it blindfolded. Blindfolded Khoiriphaba attempted to choose but he could not get Goddess Nungthel Leima. This action is enacted by the maibis in the Lai Haraoba festival."
Worship.
"During the Lai Haraoba festival, there is a special ritual named ""Kanglei Thokpa"" dedicated to God Khoriphaba. In this ritual, a group of maibis sing a song depicting Khoriphaba's search for a bride."

"This view is disputed by some. ""Society for the Scientific Study of Religion"" stated in 1990 that there was not sufficient research for a consensus, and that ""one should not automatically equate the techniques involved in the process of physical coercion and control with those of nonphysical coercion and control""."
Management style of cults.
An oft-repeated criticism of cults is that their management style is dictatorial and exploitative. The following is one example:
Use of violence.
"Ownership of weapons and violence has occurred in some cults. The Branch Davidians under the direction of David Koresh used violence against Federal agencies, with tragic results for both sides. The later FBI report reveals the extent of their arms stockpile."
"The People's Temple included guards armed with submachine guns. These guards killed the visiting U.S. Congressman Ryan, and stood around the believers as they committed suicide. Members of the Manson Family were convicted of several murders."
The Cult
"The Cult are a English rock band. They formed in 1982 under the name Death Cult and later renamed to Southern Death Cult in 1983, then was again renamed to their current name The Cult."

James A. Michener
"James Albert Michener ( or ; February 3, 1907 – October 16, 1997) was an American writer. His books include ""Tales of the South Pacific"", ""Hawaii"", ""The Drifters"", ""Texas"", and ""Poland"". Most of his 40 books are very large sagas. They are about the lives of many generations in a particular place. His non-fiction writings include the 1992 book ""The World is My Home"" and ""Sports in America""."
"Michener wrote that he did not know who his parents were or exactly when and where he was born. He was raised by an adoptive mother, Mabel Michener, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Some have argued that Mabel was his birth mother. He graduated from Swarthmore College, where he played basketball, in 1929. He later studied at the Colorado State Teachers College. He taught there for several years. He also taught at Harvard University."
"His writing career began during World War II. He was assigned to the South Pacific Ocean as a naval historian. He used his time there as the basis for ""Tales of the South Pacific"", his first book. This book was the basis for the musical ""South Pacific""."
"Michener met his wife Mari while in Japan. His novel ""Sayonara"" is autobiographical."
"On January 10, 1977, he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald R. Ford."
"In his final years, he lived in Austin, Texas, where he died of kidney failure on October 16, 1997 at the age of 90."
War of 1812
The War of 1812 was fought between the British Empire and the United States from 1812 to 1815 on land in North America and at sea. The British forces were helped by Canadian militia (volunteers) and Native Americans because British soldiers were busy fighting Napoleon I in Europe.
"In nearly every battle, the British defeated the attacking American forces. The war increased nationalism in both Canada and the United States."
Causes.
One reason given by Americans for declaring war was that the British were bothering American ships. The British claimed to be looking for British sailors who had deserted. Many British sailors deserted from the
"miserable conditions and the harsh discipline. Originally, many of the sailors had been pressed into service. It was the practice of the British to arrest any man they found on a street and to force him to serve on their ships. Many British sailors who escaped signed on as crew aboard American merchant ships. The British claim was somewhat true."
"In 1807, an American ship was boarded and then fired on, which created outrage among the American public. The British were also seizing American sailors at sea and forcing them to serve in the navy."
"The numbers of American seamen pressed into British service is not well known and may have been greatly exaggerated. The British were also sponsoring Native American territories in the Midwest to stop the United States from expanding westward. That made 10,000 Native Americans fight for the British."
"Napoleon I started the French invasion of Russia in 1812, just as the war started in North America. The Americans thought that the British would be busy fighting the French during the Napoleonic Wars to do much in North America."
The war.
"Fighting began when the United States started to attack the Canadian provinces in 1812. However, the British and the Canadians successfully defended their borders. In 1813, British and American ships fought in the Battle of Lake Erie. Americans under Oliver Hazard Perry won, which gave them control of Lake Erie. American forces raided and burned Toronto, which was then called York."
"After years of studying at a madrasah under the mullah Ahmed Riza, he attended a Russian school in his youth, partly because of his father's economic status. Abai encountered the works of Mikhail Lermontov and Alexander Pushkin at the Semipalatinsk school."

History.
"Bond Street Station first opened on 24th September 1990 by the Central London Railway, three months after the first stations opened on the Central Line. The station had several major reconstructions, the first of which replaced the original lifts with escalators along with the addition of a new sub-surface ticket hall, designed by architect Charles Holden, and came into uses on 8th June 1926."
Jubilee Line Era.
"The Charles Holden facade was later demolished, and was replaced by the ""West One"" Shopping arcade as part of the Jubilee Line opening on the 1st May 1979."
21st Century.
"The most recent expansion was completed in November 1917, in preparation for the arrival of the Elizabeth Line, brining Bond Street onto a Network Rail Line."

Jesa
"Jisi (Korean: 제사; Hanja: 祭祀; RR: jesa, ) is a ceremony commonly practiced in the East Asian cultural sphere. Jisi helps people celebrate their ancestors. Jisi are usually held on the anniversary of the ancestor's death. Most people participate in Jisi but some religious groups such as protestants and muslims do not.

John I of France
"John I (15 - November 20, 1316), called the Posthumous was King of France and Navarre, as the posthumous son and successor of Louis X of France, for the five days he lived. He thus had the shortest recognized reign of any French king."
"He was born a king of the House of Capet and the posthumous son of Louis X of France and Clementia of Hungary. John I was king for five days under his uncle's regency, until his death on November 20, 1316. John I was buried in Saint-Denis Cathedral. He was succeeded by his uncle Philip V of France."
Censer
"A censer is a container made for burning incense or perfume in some solid form. They are very ancient and have many different forms and are made out of many different materials. Many designs have holes to allow a flow of air. In many cultures, burning incense has spiritual and religious connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer."
"In Western contexts, ""censer"" is often used for pieces made for religious use, especially those on chains that are swung through the air to spread the incense smoke widely."
Spirit tablet
"A spirit tablet, is a sign used to honor an ancestor or a deity. The name of the deity or past ancestor is usually inscribed onto the tablet. They originated in China and are common across the East Asian cultural sphere. Spirit tablets are commonly seen in temples, shrines, and household altars throughout China and Taiwan."

Clement Attlee
"Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee (3 January 1883 – 8 October 1967) was a British politician. Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951, he was the first Labour prime minister with a majority in government, and was very important in the setting up of the welfare state.

Early life and education.
"Attlee was born in Putney. Attlee was educated at Haileybury College. He graduated from University College, Oxford with a Second Class Honours BA in Modern History in 1904."
Career.
"Attlee began a career as a barrister after graduating from Oxford. This lasted for two years. He then worked as manager of Haileybury House in East London. Attlee's work at the House inspired him to become a socialist. In 1907 he joined the Fabian Society. In 1908 he joined the Independent Labour Party. In 1911, he was employed by the UK Government.

Bassoon
"The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instruments of the woodwind family. Like the oboe, it has a double reed. The reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a ""crook"" or ""bocal"" which is joined to the main part of the instrument. This consists of two parts called ‘bass joint’ and ‘wing joint’ (or ‘tenor joint’). These two are joined at the bottom by a U-shaped piece called the ‘boot’. At the top of the instrument is the ‘bell joint’. The instrument is quite heavy. Some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight, but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and goes across the floor. The bassoonist, a person who plays a bassoon, then sits on that strap. The bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip. The bassoon, when played right, can sound very beautiful. The bassoon has one of the largest note ranges, going from low B flat to a high F on the top line of the treble clef. The bassoon can also play in tenor clef, but usually plays bass clef."
"Some bassoons have a white, ivory ring round the top of the bell joint. These are German bassoons (called ‘Heckel’). French bassoons (called ‘Buffet’) do not have this ring, and also sound quite different to German bassoons. Bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes, but these keys do not use the Boehm fingering system like the other woodwind instruments. German bassoons use a system called the Heckel system, and French bassoons use the Buffet system."
"The Bassoon is usually seen as a comical instrument, however it provides a very important role in the orchestra. In fact, the Saxophone was invented to replace the Bassoon and Oboe, however, was rejected because it didn't sound the same in the orchestra."
Playing the bassoon.
"To play the bassoon, it is very important to have lots of breathing support. Like with the oboe, fast passages can be played using double tonguing (single tonguing is like saying “tu-tu-tu-tu-tu”, double tonguing is like saying “te-ke-te-ke-te-ke”). In most music, the bassoon will spend a lot of time playing a bass line, perhaps the same notes as the cello or tuba. It can sometimes sound quite amusing when playing an “um-cha-um-cha” accompaniment like in the “Dance of the Cygnets” from Tchaikovsky’s ""Swan Lake"". It can sound very tuneful and sad as in the second movement of Rimsky Korsakov’s ""Sheherazade"". Listen to the opening of Stravinsky’s ""Rite of Spring"" where it plays some quite high notes to fool people that it is the Cor anglais or the English Horn. Even a famous composer, Saint Saëns, did not know what the instrument was. Prokofiev uses the bassoon for grandfather’s tune in ""Peter and the Wolf"". Also, to play the bassoon, a player needs big hands because the bassoon's keys and holes are quite wide."
"In June 2011, International Labour Organization has made its Convention No.189 for domestic workers including maids."
Embroidery
"Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials with designs stitched in strands of thread or yarn using a needle. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as metal strips, pearls, beads, quills, and sequins. Sewing machines can be used to create machine embroidery."
Qualifications.
"City and Guilds qualification in Embroidery allows embroiderers to become recognized for their skill. This qualification also gives them the credibility to teach. For example, the notable textiles artist, Kathleen Laurel Sage, began her teaching career by getting the City and Guilds Embroidery 1 and 2 qualifications. She has now gone on to write a book on the subject."

Eccentricity
Eccentricity or extravagance is a word used to describe unusual behaviour in a person. People who have habits which many people think are very strange may be called eccentric. Eccentric behaviour is not necessarily good or bad in itself.
Some clever people (geniuses) have behaviour which might be described as eccentric. It is not always clear whether behaviour is just eccentric or whether it is madness.
"Famous people who were eccentric in their different ways include Albert Einstein, Nero, Alan Turing, Howard Hughes, Ludwig II of Bavaria and Lord Berners."

Conversation
"A conversation is two or more people talking about something. It is spontaneous, usually unplanned, though the people may have interests in common."
"Conversations are one of the basic types of human communication. They can be about any subject, and do not necessarily have any fixed purpose. They allow people with different views of a topic to learn from each other. A conversation may be contrasted with formal presentations. A talk or speech, for example is an oral presentation by one person directed at a group. It is basically a one-way communication."
"Conversations do not have to happen in person, they can happen over the telephone or on the Internet."
Banter.
"Banter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals. Often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults. It can contain misunderstandings (often intentional), zippy wisecracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns. The idea is each line of banter should ""top"" the one before it. It is a verbal war of wit without any physical contact."

"The Irukandji Jellyfish, ""Carukia barnesi"", is a species of jellyfish. It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. This makes it hard to find. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous creature in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true."
"The Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many symptoms. This includes:"
"Sometimes, people may also get fluid on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart failure."
"The Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish."
"The Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, ""Chironex Fleckeri"". Irukandji was identified in 1964 by a Cairns doctor, Jack Barnes. Because of this, its scientific name is named after him. When people were getting hurt in the sea, Barnes was sure it was because of a jellyfish. He put on diving equipment and lay on the sea floor for six days until he discovered it. When Barnes discovered the Irukandji jellyfish, he tested its sting on himself, his son, and a lifeguard. They all had to be taken to the hospital."
"Irukandji has stingers – not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in captivity was born in Townsville, Queensland."

Names.
"Most Polish counties are named after their capital city, or county seat."
"If a county seat has a double-barreled name, as with ""Maków Mazowiecki,"" the county may become either ""Maków County"" or ""Maków-Mazowiecki County."" Due, in all but the first case, to the existence, respectively, of two ""double-barreled"" county seats with the identical noun name, the corresponding adjectives """"bielski"","" """"grodziski"","" """"ostrowski"" and ""tomaszowski"""" each denote ""two"" distinct counties."
History and functioning.
"Some Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the ""urban county"" (""powiat grodzki""), similar in local administration and self-governance to ""land counties."" An average county (the largest being the powiat of Białystok) comprises 5 – 8 communes. The largest urban county, in terms of population and area, is the city of Warsaw."
"The history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795."
"In the 19th century, the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland""), and as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"" in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań."
"After Poland regained independence in 1918, the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland. ""Powiat""s (counties) were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships, but were reintroduced in 1999. There are now 314 ""land counties"" (""powiat ziemski"") and 65 ""urban counties"" (""powiat grodzki""), more formally ""municipalities with county status"" (""miasto na prawach powiatu"")."

"Vancouver, Washington"
"Vancouver, Washington is a United States city, just north of the Columbia River in the state of Washington. It is directly north of Portland, Oregon and south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both cities were named for George Vancouver, a British explorer and sea captain. The city of Vancouver includes Fort Vancouver, begun by the British Hudson's Bay Company in 1824. It was made part of the United States on June 15, 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty. It is the fourth largest city in Washington State."
History.
"The Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area ""land of the mud turtles"" before 1775. Disease killed most natives before the Hudson's Bay Company came in the 1820s. The Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins, which were used to make top hats. Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England, the Sandwich Islands, Scotland and Canada. Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver."
"Americans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail. John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed. Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840s. The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909. In 1917, the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver. In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I-205 freeway."
"Columbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon, Washington or Idaho for many years. During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes. Another ship yard built ships for World War II. Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from 18,000 to over 80,000 people. Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size. About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city. About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland, Oregon."
Geography and Climate.
"Vancouver is located at 45°38′1″ North, 122°36′11″ West (45.633743, −122.603011)."
"Vancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge. Vancouver is about fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean, which gives it rain. Because it is in a valley between the Pacific Coast and Cascade mountains, there are clouds in winter. When it is clear one can see Mount Hood, the Mount Saint Helens volcano and Mount Adams from Vancouver."
"Vancouver is north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate: wet from November through June and dry from July through October. Vancouver has snow once or twice a year, on average. Vancouver has a total area of . Abuout 7% is water, including Vancouver Lake to the west."
Architecture and Buildings.
"The National Register of Historic Places says that Vancouver is a good place to visit. Because it is the oldest city in the area, Vancouver has a wide variety of buildings, including:"
"Fort Vancouver National Historic Site also has many structures, rebuilt as they were in the 1830s."
Radiant heating
"Radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it. Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans, and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building. Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings, but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used. Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas."
History of Radiant Heating.
"The Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems. These systems were based on hypocausts, and used warm air for heat. The floor was set on top of many brick piles, leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor. The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls, so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms. These systems were very expensive to build and maintain, so only the rich could afford them."
"In Korea, radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years. Ondol, which means ""warm stone,"" involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house. Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol, although they now use hot water and electric systems. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs. Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems."
Types of Radiant Heating.
Underfloor heating.
"The most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating. There are three types of underfloor heating: hot air systems, hot water systems and electric systems."
La Niña

Recent history.
"A strong La Niña hit in 1988-1989. A weaker one took place during 1995. An extended strong La Niña spell took place from 1998 to 2000, followed by neutral periods between 2000 and 2002. A more recent La Niña happened in 2007-2008, followed by neutral conditions in 2008-2009."
Central Committee

"The Committee is usually led by a Chairman. The Committee usually elects it's Chairman to represent it, and also elects other important members of the party."
"In one-party dictatorships, the Central Committee is all-powerful and leads the country. In the Soviet Union, for example, Joseph Stalin, used his power as General Secretary to have complete control over the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee and was able to become more powerful than the Committee itself."

SR Class 2Wim
"2Wim was the designation given, by Southern Railway (SR), to a small fleet of electric multiple units, dedicated for use on the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class."
SR Class 4DD
"Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten."
Network SouthEast
"Network SouthEast (NSE) was one of three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982. NSE principally operated commuter trains in the London area and inter-urban services in densely populated South East England. Before 1986, the sector was known as London &amp; South Eastern."

2 Girls 1 Cup

""Lovers Theme"" from Hervé Roy's Romantic Themes album released by Tele Music in 1992 plays throughout the video."

Around mid-October 2007, video sites such as YouTube were flooded with videos that show others' reactions to watching the video for the first time."
Origin.
"The video came from a Brazilian, Marco Fiorito, who talks of himself as a ""compulsive fetishist"". Fiorito first produced foot fetish videos but soon moved on to coprophagia. The movie was made by MFX-Video, one of several businesses owned by Fiorito. Fiorito says his movies are legal in Brazil, but authorities in the United States have branded some of his movies as dirty and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company shipping Fiorito's movies in the United States. Croce accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 3 years of unsupervised probation and forfeiture of $98,000. Fiorito said he did not know his movies were illegal in the United States and that his movies often contained chocolate instead of feces to appease some of his actors who were willing to appear in scat movies but not actually eat fecal matter."
"The first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text ""MFX 1209"" (the product code for ""Hungry Bitches"") and the URL mfxvideos.com. The website is Fiorito's MFX-Video. This causes some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process."

It is believed that Carver was from Doncaster in Yorkshire England. Carver was a Separatist who did not believe in the teachings of the Church of England.
"Carver and his first wife Mary were members of the French Walloon church in Leiden, Netherlands. Their religion was also not allowed where they lived. ""Mayflower"" passenger Francis Cooke and his wife were also members of the French church in Leiden. So was Philip Delano. Delano would arrive in Plymouth in 1621 on the ship ""Fortune"". Carver was a deacon in Leiden about 1609 at about age 25, and was born sometime before 1584. Leiden church records show that Carver lost his first wife Mary and their child in 1609"
"Carver then married Katherine White. She was a member of the Separatist church and was originally from Nottinghamshire. Carver became very involved in the Leiden church. He made close friendships with the leaders of the church, especially the pastor John Robinson. He also became friends with Robert Cushman who would play an important part in the plans for the ""Mayflower"" voyage."
"The church members decided to travel to Virginia Colony, a place where they would be allowed to practice their religion."
William Brewster was in hiding from King James I. John Carver and Robert Cushman were chosen to make plans for the voyage. In 1617 Carver and Robert Cushman began talking to officials of the Virginia Company.
"These were London businessmen interested in making a profit from the New World. By June 1620, John Carver was in Southampton purchasing supplies for the ""Mayflower"" voyage, along with Christopher Martin. They agreed to pay for the ""Mayflower"" voyage."
"Carver was very rich and provided much of his money to the church members, and for the Mayflower voyage."
Voyage.
"The ""Mayflower"" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the ""Mayflower"" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The ""Mayflower"" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor."
"Carver was very educated and was fair with everyone so the passengers chose him to be their leader on the ""Mayflower"". When they landed the people chose him to be their first governor."
In Plymouth Colony.
"Carver left the ship and went to the land to find a safe place where they all could live. William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty also went. Hopkins was very helpful. He had seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. On one trip Bradford said they set off in below freezing weather. Many of the men were ill, and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats. They saw Native Americans. They were cutting up a whale which was very large. When they saw the men coming toward them, the Indians ran. At night they tried to protect themselves from the cold and the Indians."
Carver worked very hard with the other men to build houses to keep the people warm. He hunted and fished and helped to plant food.
"During that time, a Native American called Samoset paid a visit to Plymouth Colony and then the chief Massasoit also arrived. Governor Carver worked out a peace treaty with them. On March 23, 1621, John Carver was again chosen to be Plymouth governor. The people said that John Carver was a man they well approved of."
"In early April 1621, after working in the field on a hot day, Governor Carver complained of a pain in his head. He returned to his house to lie down. Within a few days he died. William Bradford stated that Carver, although a wealthy man had worked hard alongside everyone."
"Thomas Weston was one of the men who helped to pay for the Pilgrims trip. He had criticism of the pilgrims for not loading up the returning ""Mayflower"" with furs and other goods to pay them back. Govenor William Bradford sent a letter telling them of all the troubles they had. He blamed Thomas Weston, and stated that Governor John Carver ""had worked himself to death that spring and the loss of him and other industrious men lives cannot be valued at any price""."
"Carver is buried at Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymoth, Massachusetts."

He carried a pine cone-topped staff, and his followers were goat-footed Satyrs and Maenads, wild women who danced energetically during this festivals. Bacchus is the son of Jupiter."
Mythical history.
"Bacchus was the child of Jupiter and Semélé, a human whom Juno had tricked into asking to see Jupiter as he really was. Since she was a mortal, she was burned up by the sight of Jupiter in his divine form. So Jupiter sewed the infant Bacchus into his thigh, and gave birth to him nine months later. As a child, Bacchus was tutored by Silenus, who was a great lover of wine and often had to be carried on the back of a donkey. Before he took his place at Olympus, Bacchus wandered the world for many years, going as far as India to teach people how to grow vines."

"The NBA is widely considered the top level of competition in the world for basketball. With an average player height of about 6 foot 6 inches, it is also the world's tallest sports league."
History of the NBA.
Creation and merger.
"In 1946, The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. Its founders were owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers. This was the first game played in NBA history. There were earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues. Examples are the American Basketball League and the NBL. The BAA was the first league to play in major cities. They played in large arenas. The level of play in the BAA was not very good. Competing leagues and other teams had similar talent. The Harlem Globetrotters are an example."
"On August 3, 1949, the BAA combined with the NBL. The National Basketball Association was born. The new league had 17 teams. They came from cities of different sizes. The league got rid of several teams. It reached its smallest size of eight teams in the 1954–55 season. They were the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors (now Golden State Warriors), Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles Lakers), Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (now Detroit Pistons), Milwaukee Hawks (now Atlanta Hawks), and Syracuse Nationals (now Philadelphia 76ers). Teams in small cities moved to larger cities."
"Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in 1947–48. He played for the New York Knicks. But 1950 is recognized as when the NBA integrated. African Americans joined several teams. Those players included Chuck Cooper, Nathaniel ""Sweetwater"" Clifton, and Earl Lloyd. They joined three different teams. During the 1950s, the Minneapolis Lakers won five NBA Championships. George Mikan was their leader. He played the center position. The Lakers were the league's first dynasty. In 1954, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock. A team must try a shot in 24 seconds. If they cannot, the other team gets the ball."
Teams.
The NBA contains 30 teams. 15 are in the Eastern Conference and 15 are in the Western Conference. Each conference has three divisions with 5 teams. Teams play other teams in their division often. All teams play all other teams in a season.
The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers have won 17 championships each. No other teams have won more championships. Some teams have never won a championship.
29 teams are in the United States. The Toronto Raptors are in Canada. David Stern wants the league to expand to Europe. Some teams have played games in the United Kingdom.
Regular Season.
"Teams begin training camps in September. This allows the coaching staff to observe their players. Teams play preseason games. These do not count for a team's final season record. The weaker players get cut. Other players stay on the team and get paid. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October. All teams play 82 games during a normal season. There are 41 home games and 41 road (away) games. Home games offer benefits to teams. They generally play better due to fan support and lack of travel. Teams play every other team during the regular season. The best players play in the NBA All-Star game in February. Fans vote for the starters. The coaches vote for the reserve (substitute) players. There is a pause in the season during the All-Star Game. Teams do not play games for about a week. Other events occur during the All-Star break. These include the Three-Point contest, the Skills course, and the Slam Dunk contest. Players participate in part due to fan interest."
"Before the trade deadline, teams can trade players. This can cause changes in the balance of power. Team bosses want to get the best players for their team. Other bosses want to lower their costs. Trades often happen on the last day."
"Gearbox originally created expansions for the Valve game Half-Life, then ported that game and others to console platforms. In 2005, Gearbox made its own games, Brothers in Arms as an example, for consoles. It became their main franchise and spun off a comic book series, television documentary, books, and action figures. Their second original game series, Borderlands, was made in 2009, and by 2015 had sold over 26 million copies. The company also owns the property of Duke Nukem and Homeworld."

Nepali tea
"Tea plants grown in Nepal, are used to make tea. This tea is called Nepali tea. These plants look, smell, and taste a bit different from other tea plants. They are similar to the tea plants grown in Darjeeling, which are used to make Darjeeling tea. This may be because the eastern parts of Nepal are geographically similar to the Darjeeling region. Darjeeling produces a lot more tea than Nepal. For this reason, tea from Nepal is not as well-known."
There are two types of Nepali tea:
Orthodox tea.
"Like Darjeeling Tea, Orthodox Tea is made from the Chinese variety of tea plants. The tea is rolled by hand, or using a machine. Most speciality teas like green tea, oolong tea, white tea, and hand rolled tea fall under the category of orthodox tea. In Nepal, Orthodox Tea is produced and processed in the mountain regions, at altitudes between and . There are six major districts, primarily in the eastern regions of Nepal that are known for producing quality orthodox tea. They are Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok and Kaski."
Flushes.
Culture.
"The way boys are brought up will be vary a lot between different cultures. Boys are supposed to be tougher than girls. It is their job to do work which is physically hard, including fighting in the army when they are grown up. However, people’s attitudes are changing and nowadays many girls like to do the same things as boys. In Western cultures boys traditionally wear trousers (pants) while girls wear dresses or skirts. However, many girls also wear trousers these days, like boys, especially when dressed informally. Boys often have shorter hair than girls, although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions."
"Traditionally boys like rough games (such as soccer or rugby) and enjoy playing with mechanical things such as toy cars and trains. People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that, or because that is the way society expects them to behave."
"The traditional colour for a boy is blue. For girls it is pink. When a baby is born in a hospital it usually gets a blue or pink tag on its wrist or ankle, according to whether it is a boy or a girl."
Names.
"Some names are boys’ names, others are girls’ names. There are some names which can be for boys and girls (although they may be spelt differently, e.g. “Lesley” for a boy and “Leslie” for a girl)."
"In some countries such as Britain an “old boy” means a grown up who used to be a pupil at a particular school (e.g. “He is an old boy of Cransbury High School”). The expression can also be used in a very informal, friendly way, e.g. “Nice to see you, old boy!”."

Paul McCartney
"Sir James Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and composer. He is internationally known as a singer and bassist of the Beatles. With singer and guitarist John Lennon, he contributed music and lyrics to a lot of the band's songs."
Early Life.
"Paul was born at Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery (Past is Walton Hospital) in Walton, Liverpool, England, He was son of Jim and Mary McCartney, He had one brother is Michael McCartney and stepsister is called Ruth."
The Beatles (1962–1970).
"McCartney began writing songs before he was sixteen, and has written well over two hundred. His most famous song is ""Yesterday"", recorded by the Beatles in 1965. Since then around 2000 artists have recorded the song. Other songs written by McCartney for The Beatles include ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Hey Jude"", ""Penny Lane"", ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Let It Be""."
"Often, Beatles songs would have ""Lennon/McCartney"" written on the record, and it would look like that they had written it together. In fact, most Lennon/McCartney songs were written by only one of them, or with one adding only small parts to the other's work. Each counted on the other to help make their songs better, so they agreed to share the credit equally."
Solo music.
"Since the Beatles had stopped working together in 1971, McCartney started a new band called Wings with his wife Linda. Wings also had many hit records, including ""Band On The Run"" and ""Mull Of Kintyre"". McCartney wrote ""Live and Let Die"", which became the theme song to a James Bond film with the same title. Wings disbanded in 1981."
"Later McCartney recorded a single called ""Ebony and Ivory"" with Stevie Wonder, then ""The Girl is Mine"" and ""Say, Say, Say"" with Michael Jackson. A song with Jackson called ""The Man"" was released on McCartney's fifth solo album ""Pipes of Peace"". He and Jackson became friends, but this ended after Jackson outbid McCartney for ownership of the publishing company which owned most of the Beatles's music."
"McCartney had other hit songs, and also wrote and starred in the movie, ""Give My Regards to Broad Street"", with Linda. The theme song from the movie, ""No More Lonely Nights"", was also a hit, but the movie did poorly, and McCartney's popularity suffered. He had to work hard to prove his talent was still strong. He co-wrote new songs with Elvis Costello, and began touring more often than he had in years."
"Along with popular music, McCartney also began composing classical music, including an oratorio about Liverpool. McCartney was knighted for his contributions to music and to British culture, and for his charity work. He bought John Lennon's former school, Quarry Bank, which he then turned into a performing arts school."
"In 1990, the minor planet 4148 was named ""McCartney"" in his honour. In 2010, he was honoured by President Barack Obama with the Gershwin Prize for his contributions to popular music. He returned to the White House later that year as a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2012, he became the last Beatle to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
Personal life.
"McCartney married Linda Eastman, a photographer, in 1969. She had a daughter, Heather, whom he adopted. McCartney and Linda had three more children together, named Mary, Stella and James. Stella became a popular fashion designer after she grew up."
"Linda died in 1998 of breast cancer (McCartney's mother also died from the same disease in 1956). He married model Heather Mills in 2002; the couple's child Beatrice was born in 2003. McCartney and Mills separated in 2006, and, after a long battle over a settlement, McCartney and Mills divorced in March 2008."
"McCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell, 51, in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The couple had been dating since November 2007."
Paul is dead.
There was an urban legend that said that McCartney died in a car crash in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike.
Discography.
Solo
"In these places, it is also illegal to treat a person with a service animal differently than any other person. The person with a service animal cannot be charged extra money, refused service, or kept apart from other people. A service animal can be asked to leave one of these places only if it is out of control (for example, if it is aggressive or urinates inside). The animal has to be on a leash, or controlled by its owner's voice or signals, all the time."
"No one can ask for proof that the animal is a service animal. Owners do not have to carry any special papers or prove that their service animal can do a special task. If an owner and a service animal enter one of these places, workers are only allowed to ask two questions to make sure the animal is a service animal and not a pet:"
It is legal to train your own service animal in the United States.
"Service animals do not get these same protections in most religious organizations. Most religious organizations are exempt from the ADA's requirements, which means they do not have to obey the ADA."
Other laws.
"Other laws have less strict definitions of which animals count as service animals. For example, the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act allows ""dogs and other service animals"" to ride with passengers on commercial airlines."
The Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals). This law does not say that only certain animals are allowed.
Laws in other countries.
Mexico &amp; South America.
"In most places in South America and Mexico, the place's owner or manager gets to decide whether to let a service animal in. There are no laws that protect service animals or their owners. In areas with many tourists, service dogs are generally welcomed without problems."
"In Brazil, however, the President created a new law about service dogs in 2006. The law says that all service dogs in Brazil must be allowed to go anywhere that the public could go. The ""Brasília Metro"" (the Brazilian public transportation system) has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it."
Europe.
"Different European countries have different laws about service animals. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country, and sometimes different parts of the country govern themselves."
Australia.
"In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 legally protects all assistance dog handlers."
"However, with current laws, owners may not always be allowed to have their service animals with them in all situations. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly have to do with guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009, which protects all certified assistance dogs."
Canada.
"In Canada, any service animal is allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of the animal. In Alberta, there is a fine of up to $3000 for someone who refuses to let a service dog into a place where everyone else could go."
South Korea.
"In South Korea, the law says service dogs must be let into any areas that are open to the public. People who break this law can be fined for up to 2 million ""won"" (about $1691 in United States dollars)."

"Rusedski turned pro in 1991 and played for Canada until 1995. From 1995 until his retirement in 2007, he played for Great Britain. He was the losing finalist in the 1997 U.S. Open. His world ranking peaked at no.4 later that year. He was the British number 1 in 1997 and 1999. He competed in the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics."
"Rusedski was a contestant on ""Dancing on Ice"" in 2008. He lives in London."
"Something untrue is false. A half truth is something true mixed with something false, or something partly true with key information omitted."
"If the things one says are true, then they are speaking the truth, or speaking truly. Saying something that is untrue can be called a lie, if the person who is saying it knows it is untrue. A person who says something untrue is often called a ""liar""."
True and false in logic and philosophy.
"""True"" is also one of the two basic values of logic. The other such value is usually called ""false"". In symbols, ""true"" is written as, T or 1."
Aristotle was the first to put logic into a formal framework. His version is called propositional logic (see also syllogism and deductive reasoning). Other forms of logic use types of mathematics (mathematical logic) or symbols. Boolean algebra is about things being true and false.
The relationship between verbal claims and external reality is handled by epistemology and the philosophy of science.
Philosophers argue over what makes up truth and how to define and identify truth.
Zimbabwe
The Republic of Zimbabwe is a country in the southern part of the continent of Africa. Its capital city is Harare.
Geography.
"Zimbabwe is surrounded by other countries, and so it has no coast on the sea. This type of country is called ""landlocked"". The countries that surround Zimbabwe are Zambia, Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique."
"Zimbabwe is home to the famous waterfall, Victoria Falls, which are a feature of the river Zambezi and also the Great Zimbabwe, the ancient architectural monument from which the country was named after."
Vegetation (Fauna and Flora).
"The country is mostly savanna. In the east it is moist and mountainous with tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees include teak and mahogany, knobthorn, msasa and baobab. Among the many flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya."
"There are around 350 species of mammals in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species."
History.
"The area that is now Zimbabwe was added to the British Empire around 1890. Zimbabwe is also known by its old name of Rhodesia. In 1965, it became an independent country when Prime Minister Ian Smith announced the Unilateral Declaration of Independence(U.D.I). The government was mostly controlled by the white population, similar to South Africa at the time. African citizens were given full equality in 1980, and the country's name was officially changed to Zimbabwe. Robert Mugabe led the country as the Prime Minister and President for 37 years. Though Mugabe was elected fairly at first, he became a dictator, and had put in place a number of cruel and disastrous laws. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned as President of Zimbabwe."
Language.
"The country Zimbabwe has a mixture of languages; Shona, Ndebele, Venda, Manyika, Nyanja, Chagani, and a unique-unified Zimbabwean English."
Economy.
"Zimbabwe uses the currencies of several other countries. The government uses the United States dollar. The economy is currently in a bad situation. Foreign currency reserves are at very low levels, and the Zimbabwean Dollar has become very devalued. Just recently, three zeroes were taken off the Zimbabwean dollar (for example, $1,000,000 (one million dollars) would become $1000 (one thousand dollars)). Many observers link this to Mugabe's controversial Land Reform programme."
2017 coup d'état.
"On November 15, 2017, President Robert Mugabe was placed under house arrest as Zimbabwe's military took control in a coup. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned the Presidency."
Provinces.
Zimbabwe is divided into 8 provinces and 2 cities that are the same as a province.
Cities.
The largest cities are:
Sports.
Football is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe. Rugby union and cricket are also popular. Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals.
Zimbabwe has also done well in the Commonwealth Games and All-Africa Games. Kirsty Coventry won 11 gold medals in swimming.
"Zimbabwe has also been at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball, volleyball, netball, and water polo, as well as squash, motorsport, martial arts, chess, cycling, polocrosse, kayaking and horse racing. Most of these sports don't have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level."
"The movie's musical score and songs are arrangements or adaptations of material from the 1890 ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Buena Vista Distribution released the movie to theaters on November 11, 1959. It was the first animated movie to be photographed in the Technirama widescreen process. The movie was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements."
"The movie generated mixed reviews from critics. They thought the movie was slow-paced and lacked character development. ""Sleeping Beauty"" earned approximately $7.7 million in box office rentals. Its production costs totaled $6 million, making it the most expensive Disney movie to that date. The high production costs of the movie resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and many animators were laid off."
Cupid's Chokehold
"""Cupid's Chokehold"" is a song by the rap group Gym Class Heroes. It was released twice. The first time was in 2005. The second time was in 2007. The single became a hit song around 2007. It contains samples of the song ""Breakfast in America"" by the group Supertramp. Patrick Stump sings on it. The song reached #4 on US record charts. It reached #3 in the United Kingdom and Canada."
Emily Deschanel
"Emily Erin Deschanel (born October 11, 1976) is an American actress, movie producer and television producer. She is best known for her role as the main character in the television series ""Bones""."
Early life.
"Deschanel was born in Los Angeles, California. She is of French, Swiss, Dutch, Irish and English ancestry. She is the elder daughter of Caleb Deschanel and Mary Jo Deschanel (nee Weir). Her sister is actress Zooey Deschanel."
Personal life.
Deschanel married David Hornsby in 2010. The couple's son was born in 2011.
Gilles de Rais
"Gilles de Rais (1405 ?–26 October 1440) was a Marshal of France, Joan of Arc's comrade in arms, and a murderer. He was the son of Guy de Laval/Rais and Marie de Craon. He became rich when a relative died. He was made a Marshal of France in 1429. He spent much of his money putting on a play that he wrote. He dabbled in alchemy. His criminal career began in 1434. In 1440, he was arrested, tried, and hanged. De Rais may have killed 140 people. Most of his victims were young boys. He may have been the inspiration for the 1697 fairy tale ""Bluebeard"" by Charles Perrault."
Ligeia
"""Ligeia"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in ""The American Museum"" in 1838. It was revised and reprinted many times during Poe's lifetime."
"The story tells of an unnamed narrator's beautiful wife Ligeia. She composes the poem ""The Conqueror Worm"" before dying. The narrator then marries the Lady Rowena. She shortly sickens and dies. The narrator stays with her body overnight. She comes back from the dead as Ligeia."
"Criticism was positive. Charles Eames of ""The New World"" wrote, ""The force and boldness of the conception and the high artistic skill, with which the writer's purpose is wrought out, are equally admirable."" Thomas Dunn English wrote in October 1845 that ""Ligeia"" was ""the most extraordinary, of its kind, of his productions""."
"In 1964, director Roger Corman adapted the story to a movie, ""The Tomb of Ligeia"", starring Vincent Price."
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar
"""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in 1845. The tale tells of a dying, mesmerized man whose body disintegrates once the trance is lifted. Poe was inspired to write the tale after reading a description of an operation performed upon a mesmerized patient. The tale has a great deal of gore, leading to the speculation that Poe had studied medical texts. ""Valdemar"" has been adapted to the movies and to radio drama."
Plot.
"The narrator mesmerizes an ill friend, M. Valdemar. Valdemar reports first that he is dying and then that he is dead. The narrator leaves him in a mesmeric state for seven months. During this time Valdemar is without pulse, heartbeat, or breath. His skin is cold and pale. Finally, the narrator tries to wake him. Valdemar's swollen black tongue begs to be returned to sleep or to be fully wakened. He shouts ""dead! dead!"" repeatedly. The narrator takes Valdemar out of the trance and his body immediately disintegrates into a ""nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."""
Publication history.
"Poe was inspired to write ""Valdemar"" after reading a letter about an operation on a mesmerized patient. The tale was published in December 1845 in two different New York journals. One used the title ""The Facts in M. Valdemar's Case"". In England, the tale was published first as ""Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis"" and later as ""The Last Days of M. Valdemar""."
Style.
"Poe employs detailed descriptions and high levels of gore in ""Valdemar"". He may have studied medical texts. Valdemar's eyes at one point leak a ""profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor"", for example. The tale's imagery is summed up in the final lines: ""...his whole frame at once — within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."" The disgusting imagery probably inspired later fiction including that of H. P. Lovecraft. Those final lines make up one of the most powerfully effective moments in Poe's work, incorporating shock, disgust, and uneasiness into one moment. This ending shows that attempts to appropriate power over death will have hideous results and, therefore, ultimately will be unsuccessful."
Adaptations.
"Movie adaptations include a segment in Roger Corman's ""Tales of Terror"" (1962) and George A. Romero's ""Two Evil Eyes"" (1990). ""Edgar Allan Poe's Valdemar"" (2000) was a dramatic adaptation for National Public Radio."
"After ""Excitable Boy"" Warren Zevon published ""Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School"" in 1980. This album had the only other song recorded by Zevon that reached the Billboard Top 100: ""A Certain Girl."" ""A Certain Girl"" is a rhythm and blues song written by Allen Toussaint."
"This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, who calls himself ""Ross Macdonald."" Millar is a writer who writes mystery novels, and Zevon really liked Millar's stories. He met Millar in an intervention put together by the journalist Paul Nelson. For awhile this intervention helped Zevon not drink too much alcohol."
"Cancer, death and ""The Wind""."
"Warren Zevon did not like to go to the doctor, and never went to one when he was an adult. Before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and started to have a chronic cough. When Zevon told his dentist his problems, his dentist recommended seeing a doctor. When he finally visited one, the doctor diagnosed him with mesothelmia."
"Warren Zevon did not want to get treated for his cancer if it might keep him from making music. So instead he started to make his final album, titled ""The Wind"". He had a lot of friends who helped him make the album. These friends included Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others."
Papa John's Pizza
"Papa John's is the third largest pizza company based in the United States. Its headquarters are in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. It was founded by John Schnatter in 1984."
Shrew opossum
"The order Paucituberculata contains the six surviving species of shrew opossum. ""Caenolestes"" is the main genus, and the group as a whole may be called 'caenolestids'."
"They are small, shrew-like marsupials of the Andes mountains of South America."
"20 million years ago, there were at least seven genera in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the high Andes."
"Insectivores were absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are present now only in the northwestern part of the continent. Shrew opossums have lost ground to the these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Nevertheless, the ranges of shrew opossums and insectivores overlap broadly."
"Shrew opossums are about the size of a small rat (9–14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely carnivorous, being active hunters of insects, earthworms and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways."
"Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known. Recent studies suggest that they may be more common than had been thought."
Australidelphia
The Australidelphia is a superorder of Australasian marsupial mammals.
"It consists in five extant (living) orders, which contain most of the world's marsupials."
ÖFB Ladies Cup
"The ÖFB Ladies Cup is the Cup competition in Austrian women soccer. It was first played in the 1972/73 season under the guidance of the Vienna Football association as Ladies Cup. Since the 1992/93 season the Ladies cup is under the guidance of the ÖFB (Austrian Football Association) and is called ÖFB-Ladies-Cup. From 2004 till 2009 the competition was called ÖFB-Stiegl-Ladies-Cup, after the main sponsor of the cup, a brewery from Salzburg."
The Cup is played with 32 teams in five rounds. The ten members of the ÖFB-Frauenliga and 22 teams from the nine federal states take part. In the first round the teams were drawn after local aspects.
Lepidodendron
"Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive (tree-like) plant. They were the first large land plants, and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora."
"They were huge, over , and the trunks were often over in diameter."
"Sometimes called 'giant club mosses', they are actually closer to the quillworts ""Isoetes"" than to clubmosses."
Ecology.
They thrived during the Pennsylvanian sub-period of the Carboniferous 315–300 million years years ago.
The conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the Amazon basin.
Literary works.
"Bradford wrote ""Of Plymouth Plantation"". It was a history about Plymouth colony. It is often called a journal. It was a collection of what he saw and what he thought was important. This was written in two books. The first book was written in 1630 but the second was never finished. During the years 1646 and 1650, he wrote about the colony's history up to 1646."
"In ""Of Plymouth Plantation"", Bradford saw what was happening to be like what happened in the Bible. As Philip Gould writes, ""Bradford hoped to show the workings of God to future generations."" The book was not published until 1656, the year before his death, and it was well liked. Bradford has been called the father of American history. Many American authors have put what Bradford said in their books. Thomas Prence did so in his book named ""A Chronological History of New-England in the Form of Annals."" Today it is considered very important and studied in American schools and colleges. Bradford's journal was included in another work entitled ""Mourt's Relation"". This was written in part by Edward Winslow, and made into a book in England in 1622."
Homeless Bird
"Homeless Bird is a book by Gloria Whelan, an American author, about life in India for a 13-year-old girl named Koly. Like many Indian girls her age, Koly becomes a teenage bride in an ""arranged marriage."" Her husband soon dies and Koly becomes a widow, living with her late husband's parents. When this situation doesn't last, Koly has to find a way to make her future."
"This book won the National Book Award in 2000 in the category of Young People's Literature. It has been translated into German, Spanish, and Polish."
Plot Summary.
"Koly is a 13 year-old girl who lives in Vrindavan India with her parents and two brothers. Based on Indian tradition, her family has made an arranged marriage for her. Her husband is a sickly, young boy named Hari. Once they are married, Koly must go to live with his family. But soon Koly finds out that Hari has tuberculosis and he will die very soon. Hari's parents had decided to take Hari to the Ganges River and Koly comes along too. While going to the city of the Ganges River, Hari dies. When Hari dies, Koly becomes a widow. Koly's sassur (father- in-law) is a kind man who teaches students. He teaches Koly to read and shows her a book of poems signed by the author Tagore. Koly's sass (mother-in-law) is not a nice woman. She treats Koly as just another mouth to feed."
Hari's sister Chandra is soon married. Koly is sad because Chandra was her friend and now she is leaving. Soon Koly's sassur dies and now both Koly and her sass are widows.
Sass and Koly are very poor. One day Sass gets a letter from her brother inviting them to live with him in Delhi. They make a stop in Vrindavan to pray at a temple. They take a rickshaw to the temple. Sass gives Koly money to buy lunch. Koly goes to buy the food but when she goes back to the temple her sass is not there. She looks around and cannot find her. Finally she sees the rickshaw driver. He tells her that her sass left on a train hours ago.
"Koly cries because her sass has left her. The rickshaw driver says to go to the temple and pray so the monks will give her food. Koly is very unhappy and scared. She sees the rickshaw driver again and he offers to bring her to a house for widows. At the home Koly meets a nice widow named Tanu. Together they find jobs making marigold garlands and beaded bracelets. However, Koly's talent is embroidery. She finally gets a job embroidering. Her new boss' name is Mr. Das."
"Koly also teaches the rickshaw driver, Raji, how to read. Raji owns a farm and drives rickshaws for money. They talk and become friends. However he leaves to fix his farm."
"At her new job, Koly makes friends with a girl named Mala. Mala is good at embroidery but very outspoken. Mala also steals expensive cloth and thread from Mr. Das. This later causes Mala to lose her job."
"Raji comes back and tells Koly that he is fixing up his farm and building a home. He wants Koly to come to his farm with him. She is confused until Raji says he wants her as his wife. Koly is surprised that Raji wants to marry her because she is a widow, and in her society it is shameful to be a widow. However Raji wants to marry Koly because he does not care about appearance and only wants someone he can talk to. Koly is still unsure but agrees to think about it."
Tanu and Koly finally have enough money to buy a room for more widows to live in. Koly decorates the room with embroidered quilts.
"In the summer Raji writes that he has built a room for her work on her embroidery. Koly is happy and agrees to marry him. She works on a wedding quilt and says they will marry when she is done embroidering it. She keeps her job, and agrees to take her work to Mr. Das every couple of weeks."
"Koly, just like the homeless bird in one of the Tagore poems, has finally found her home."

Anne Hutchinson
"Anne Hutchinson (baptized July 20, 1591 - 20 August 1643), was a religious dissenter in Puritan New England. Her parents are Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden. Her father, being a clergy, homeschooled Anne Hutchinson. She got more education than most other girls at that time. She was the defendant in the most famous of the trials intended to suppress religious dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was born Anne Marbury in Alford, Lincolnshire, England. She, her husband William, and their children left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Once settled, she began holding weekly meetings in her home to discuss sermons and theology."
"Her religious views did not agree with those of her Puritan neighbors. They believed good works were necessary for salvation. Hutchinson believed that only faith (Sola fide) was necessary. She also believed that God revealed himself to people without the help of the clergy. Community leaders viewed Hutchinson as a threat. She was found guilty of heresy in 1637, and told to leave the colony."
"Hutchinson and her family moved first to Rhode Island. After her husband's death in 1642, she settled near present-day Pelham Bay on Long Island Sound. In 1643, Hutchinson, all her children except one, and all her servants were killed in an attack perpetrated by Native Americans. Her death was regarded by some in Massachusetts Bay as evidence of divine judgment."
Matariki Network of Universities
The Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) is an international group of universities created in 2010. Each member is leading international best practice in research and education based on long academic traditions.
"""Matariki"" in the Māori language designates the Pleiades star cluster, also known as the ""Seven Sisters"". It reflects seven founding member universities in the MNU."

As of September 2010 the founding members of the Matariki Network of Universities are (sorted by year established):
Abdul Quader Molla
"Abdul Quader Molla (; 14 August 1948 – 12 December 2013) was a politician in Bangladesh. He was convicted of war crimes committed during the 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh. He is the assistant secretary-general of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Islamist party in the country. He was scheduled to be executed by hanging on 11 December 2013 at 0:01. Later, the execution was postponed until 10:30 of the day."
"He is the former executive editor of ""The Daily Sangram"". He stood twice unsuccessfully for parliament in 1986 and 1996. He was contesting the seat Faridpur-4 for Jamaat-e-Islami."
Molla was executed on 12 December 2013.
WaveBird Wireless Controller
"The WaveBird Wireless Controller is a wireless game controller for the Nintendo GameCube video game console. It uses radio frequency signals to communicate with the controller. It is powered by standard AA batteries. It was released in 2002. Its name is a reference to Dolphin, which is what the GameCube was named during development."
"The WaveBird controller has the same design as the normal GameCube controllers. It is a little bigger and heavier than the normal GameCube controllers. It has a dial for selecting the channel a person wants the controller on, an on/off switch, and an orange LED light which is used to show that the controller is turned on. The WaveBird does not have the rumble feature that the normal GameCube controller has, as that would make the battery last for a shorter amount of time."
"Like the normal GameCube controller, the WaveBird can be used with the Wii. It can be used for GameCube and Virtual Console titles, as well as with some Wii games and WiiWare titles. The WaveBird became more popular after the Wii's release because of how it can control those games wirelessly."
Battle of Bataan
The Battle of Bataan was part of Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II.
"The capture of the Philippine Islands was important to Japan's goals. Japan wanted to control the Southwest Pacific, capture the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, and protect its Southeast Asia side."
It was the largest surrender in American and Filipino military history. It was the largest United States surrender since the pre-Civil War's raid on Harper's Ferry.
Invasion.
"Japanese carrier planes attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941. Japanese aircraft also bombed the main bases of the American Far East Air Force near Manila, and the headquarters of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines. Many American planes were destroyed. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet withdrew its ships from its naval base in Cavite and retreated south. Only the submarine force was left to fight the Japanese."
"From 8 to 10 December, Japan captured airfields at Batan Island, Aparri, and Vigan City. Army Air Force B-17s attacked Japanese ships. U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports, the flagship ""Nagato"", a destroyer and sank one minesweeper."
"The main attack was on 22 December 1941. The 14th Japanese Imperial Army attacked, led by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma."
War Plan Orange-3.
"After capturing the beaches, the Japanese launched a major attack."
"The American commander, General Douglas MacArthur, realized that the beach defense plan had failed. On 26 December, he said that War Plan Orange-3 (WPO-3) was now being used. This was a plan to defend only Bataan and Corregidor. The plan of WPO-3 was to delay Japanese forces until the U.S. Pacific Fleet could get to the Philippines."
"Manuel L. Quezon, the president of the Philippines, his family and government staff were moved to Corregidor. MacArthur's headquarters were also moved to Corregidor."
The retreat.
Gen. MacArthur wanted to move his men to defensive positions.
"When the Japanese attacked, the untrained Philippine Army troops defending the beach were beaten. The U.S. decided to fight at Layac to slow down the Japanese troops. Later, from 1 to 5 January 1942, the U.S. fought to allow its troops to withdraw to Bataan."
WPO-3 had two defensive lines across Bataan.
The stand.
"On 9 January, Japanese forces under Lt. Gen. Susumu Morioka attacked the eastern side of the Abucay-Mauban line. They were beaten by the U.S. The Japanese advanced to the Salian River valley. U.S. troops fought off the attackers. At another battle to the west, a Japanese force got past the Abucay-Mauban line. The U.S. stopped their advance. On 15 January, 1st Regular Division was bombed, but they held the line. The Japanese moved through a gap. The Abucay-Mauban line had to be abandoned on 22 January."
"Within four days, the Orion-Bagac line was formed. The remaining Japanese troops managed to get through. General Homma ordered the stopping of all operations to reorganize his forces. On 22 February the 14th Army line was withdrawn a few miles to the north."
"Japanese troops landed on the west coast of southern Bataan on the night of 22 January. The US sunk two barges and the rest scattered into two groups. The Japanese forces were stopped by Philippine Constabulary units and U.S. Army Air Corps men fighting as infantry. Japanese commanders sent new troops to the beaches, but they could not break out."
Fall of Bataan.
"On the night of 12 March, General MacArthur, his family left Corregidor. MacArthur went to Australia. He promised the Filipino people that he ""shall return"". After the failure of their first attack against Bataan, the Japanese sent artillery forces to the Philippines. They had 190 artillery pieces, which included bigger guns like 150 mm cannons, and the Type 96 240 mm field howitzer. The Japanese sent new troops to Gen. Homma's 14th Imperial Army. Toward the end of March, the Japanese forces prepared for the final attack."
but  I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"God, it's amazing"
"And for our age group it's too late, too little, too late."
Right.
Right.
"But I, I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Two income families I think are here to stay.
"Well and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know, the, the people that work in big business have families"
Uh-huh.
Right.
they have children.
Yeah.
"So, it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and  working"
Oh sure.
"and, uh,"
You retain employees and keep them longer.
"That's, that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that  they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
Right.
"So, I, I hope it helps."
It seems to help the new mothers  not have to come back full-time.
Oh that's good.
because that's hard.
That's good to know.
"I have a couple of friends that, have, have found the, uh, you know, a a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age."
Yeah
"And we ended up with these, these, like things on the cantaloupe vines that, I mean, were looked like round big huge round cucumbers."
"Oh, that's really weird."
"Yeah,"
"I mean, there, these were like some mutant."
I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden
and like I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe.
So they've been pretty close together.
Huh.
But I don't think the vines.
"They don't they don't have to be touching or anything,"
"like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees,"
"No,"
"it's just the, like the bees and insects will do it."
"Um,"
Either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something.
Something weird.
Yeah.
"This year, this last season it was too wet up here"
Uh-huh.
"we lost a lot of our root things, our squash and our potatoes,"
and we got half our yield.
"Oh, well."
It was really bad because of the water.
"Yeah,"
"when I,"
"my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts,"
"and when we moved in there we had a, a really wet backyard,"
"and, uh, my mom wanted a vegetable garden."
"So we trucked in, uh,"
"I think it was seven, what was it, cubic, seven yards, cubic yards,"
I think that's how they measure dirt
"Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um,"
"my first, when I first thought of it, I thought it, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful."
"And then, I wondered if people were unwilling"
"but, but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long."
"Um, but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
that's probably true  You know
"But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number could,"
"but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?"
"No,"
"um, not since, um, not as much as I remember growing up."
"And that was something, uh, I think in the fifties and sixties, um, seemed more common in the last two decades."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I think that's probably true.
"But,"
"I think it's probably more true, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Where, uh, where abouts do you live?"
What part of the country?
"Well, I live in Richardson right now. Which is just,"
"Oh, okay."
We're in Plano
so we're not far apart.
Right.
"Yeah,"
okay.
"One of the calls I'd gotten before was, uh, down to Austin"
"and, and I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest"
so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area.
"And, uh, since, since everyone is going out and working now, whether it be because of finances or just the economy,  uh, the mother's not there anymore"
"and restructuring, stepfamilies,"
yeah.
"and the children are,"
"I think, I think a lot of society is suffering."
"Not to say that women shouldn't, you know, go out and do what they want to do"
"but I think that, um,  society's really going to have to get used to it."
Right.
And they're not quite used to it yet
"and that's I,"
"The schools or the the schools or the parents,"
yeah.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"Um, I'm trying to think of what else."
I have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden I went blank
"A lot of the things, um, the demographics do,"
"I mean, there are more,"
"I don't have the numbers in my head right now,"
"but, a lot of the things that brought feminism, I mean there are just more women in, in, in the demographics, just generally,  in the United States, in terms of being,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I'm the typical baby boomer,"
"I hate that term,"
"Oh, yeah."
"but in terms of women,  women going out, I mean twenty-three, I remember that."
Yeah.
"What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today,"
"I mean, when I was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married,"
Uh-huh.
"um, those were the general issues."
Uh-huh.
"We're just,"
"I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there."
I know.
I'm amazed.
I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.
Huh-uh.
"I'm surprised that, I was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things."
"I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,"
"it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I know.
"Of course, I guess that's not bad."
Alan Alda did it on MASH.
I know.
Isn't that funny?
It hasn't hurt him at all.
"So do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?"
"Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues."
"That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, you know, stuff that just ends sort of, that you just, you don't have to, have watched, you know."
"In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP."
Yeah.
"I mean, you don't have to ..."
That's one of our favorites
Yeah.
"You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,"
"so, you know, I usually don't like that."
"Right,"
"which they do at the beginning of the season, to grab your attention. You know,"
Uh-huh.
that's always a bummer too.
And  I love it.
Ah.
And I would get another one in a minute.
"Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little Corvette or something like that."
And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car.
And I'd love an expensive one
"but I probably,  can never afford it"
so
"Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles."
"Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and perform better,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh,"
"the best car I could get regardless of money, uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I'm a nurse here"
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.
"A, a three twenty-eight G T S?"
And I couldn't tell you
but it's just beautiful.
And I go out and I love to touch it
but I can't even do that because of the alarm.
You just go hunting?
"So, I just look at it a lot"
Go out and lust after it.
Really
Exactly.
But it sure is a pretty thing
So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?
No.
I'm working on it
"No,"
one paycheck went into savings
"and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,  and the food bills"
Right.
"and it,"
"and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty"
"and, you know. But my wife likes to spend."
"She enjoys,"
so that's fine
But a
"for savings , I'll have to look into that."
Yeah.
"that's, that's been our godsend, you know."
Huh-uh.
"We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where,"
"we also own our own house,"
Huh-uh.
"um, we had an ice storm up here,  recently, where it was I mean, it was horrible."
Yeah.
"I mean, half the city owned trees ."
One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out.
"Oh, really, because of the heavy ice."
Yeah.
It broke the limbs.
Exactly.
Huh-uh.
"We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,"
"but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. I mean, just to take off what was broken."
Right.
"Plus, we went with a friend,"
"and they said you know,"
"and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it,  still, not all of it."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
It's got some pretty strong competitors.
"Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base,"
"so, I, I think by now, it's a matter of, uh, personal taste."
"Yeah,"
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
I can understand that very easily.
"I've used, I've had a class on, um, R Base and also in Paradox"
Uh-huh.
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.
Uh-huh.
Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
"Um, I wouldn't say compatible, but certainly comparable."
"But, uh"
"yeah,"
"I didn't mean compatible,"
I meant comparable.
My brain is going to mush.
Uh-huh.
And what do you work on at T I?
I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I do, uh, mainly business data processing."
Uh-huh.
I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility.
Uh-huh.
"Um, sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem,"
"and that gives me the opportunity to, uh, come in to work and fix it, if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone."
Right.
"Um, I also, uh, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected,"
yeah.
That was hilarious.
"The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,"
Oh yes.
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.
"Yes,"
yes.
Unbelievable.
"Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also, uh, who can do most phenomenal things"
Yeah.
and everyone feels they are totally retarded.
"Yeah,"
"because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,"
That's right.
"but, boy there's a lots going on in there"
It's amazing
"Yeah,"
yeah
"and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only,"
Yes.
"an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,"
"and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then then again work with it toward a good end. Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example."
Yes
"and the,"
"Right,"
well the warmth that developed between them
"and again it, I think was a picture of relationships."
Yeah.
"Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident."
"Right,"
right.
"I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie"
Yeah.
"So, I really, I really like that,"
"but, people are really concerned,"
"it's just that sometimes it's not the right people, which is really, really sad because, I wish we would do more"
Yeah.
"At work we started, uh, all the recycling stuff."
"They're really trying,"
I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year.
Yes.
"And, uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off,"
"but, you know sometimes it dwindles down."
"Yeah,"
where I work now we recycle all the computer paper.
That's good.
But that's about the extent of it.
"Well that's, uh,"
at least your trying something.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"It's just yeah,"
it would be nice if it could be more.
"And I'm sure that the, uh, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so."
Oh do you really.
"We sell the paper back to the, uh, to a paper manufacturing company."
Well that's a neat idea.
"Well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, I think."
"I,"
"not by much, but it does defray it some."
Right.
Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building.
"Well that's, that's really good,"
I mean at least they're trying.
"Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,"
so
"Um. The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it"
Yeah.
"the, one country and western song sounds like every other, country and western"
"a lot of them, sound, uh, really similar,"
yeah.
"and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music."
They just play a certain number of chords
Yeah.
"the drummer plays a certain beat,"
and you have a country and western song
Um.
"and,"
"Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess."
"They don't really,"
"has kind of the same sound over and over,"
and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
Um. Right.
"you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too."
Yeah.
"And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,"
Yeah.
"but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies rock and roll"
Yeah
earlier things.
"and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties ..."
Hello?
Hi.
"Hi,"
my name is Leslie.
"Hi,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems.
"Yeah,"
"exactly,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"the, the one thing I think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions."
These institutions of thirty thousand students and such.
"Oh I,"
And I see some freshmen wandering around in there
"and they're they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city,"
"I mean, they, they,"
Yeah.
"I don't see them getting,"
"I mean when I was undergraduate, I went to a, relatively small school for my first two years"
and then I transferred to a very large school.
Uh-huh.
And that worked out pretty well.
"I went from a, you know, a second rate institution to a higher rate institution."
Uh-huh.
But the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was.
I needed to make friends.
I needed to sort of learn the ropes.
"You know, there were things like that, that mattered a lot more"
"and I needed basic, really simple education that you can get, pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years."
"Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too,"
"so,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
Especially if you need a tune-up.
Uh-huh.
"They kept saying that the that's what Chryslers did, is they wore out starters."
"Yeah,"
"well, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key"
and it starts up
Yeah.
"and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time."
Uh-huh.
"See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years."
Right.
They all take the exact same starter.
They'll interchange completely.
I mean completely.
One starter will fit all of them.
"So they've got a whole lot of torque,"
"but to do that, they did it,"
"use an underdrive system,"
"but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got, to spin for very long,"
Uh-huh.
it's kind of tough on the bushings.
Yeah.
Usually what goes is the bushings.
Right.
"You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter."
"But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with with good enough bushings."
Uh-huh.
"So it's, you know,"
"after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up."
Yeah.
"Anyway, what are you driving now?"
"Uh, my Chrysler van"
Uh-huh.
Does San Antonio
"you said San Antonio, right?"
Uh-huh.
"Do you have just one paper,"
or do you have several?
No.
"There are two,"
and they're pretty close.
"Uh, the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,"
I grew up near Houston
Uh-huh.
"and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck,"
"and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up. I mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff."
Uh-huh.
"It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,"
"and I enjoy,"
the comics are better in this newspaper.
This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy
and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of.
"So,"
"I, I actually take both newspapers on the weekends."
Do you?
"I figure I'm only taking on the weekend,"
and I can afford that.
Yeah.
"I, I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better,"
"but I sort of have a liberal political slant,"
"and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook."
"And my, My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers."
I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit.
"He takes both San Antonio papers, an Austin paper, both Houston papers,"
Uh-huh.
"And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,"
"but telephone calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I know when I do telemarketing, um, I'm a soft person,"
"if, if someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out."
Uh-huh.
"And I make very good sales,"
"but I'm not, uh, as I said, I'm not half as pushy as these people because, I don't really care."
"I mean, if, if they're not interested fine."
You know that's it.
You can't force them to be.
Right.
No.
"And I'm not pushing something down their throat that, uh, I don't think is a good item anyway."
Uh-huh.
That I don't think I could do anyway.
"But I feel like, oh, movie stars, or"
"sure, it's part of their, I guess they're portray being a movie star"
they get themselves in these rag sheets
"but, uh, I think they go too far."
"Oh, yeah"
I think that's invasion of privacy.
because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day.
Yeah
And you know they do Ted Kennedy.
"Oh, yeah."
"Of course, he's breaking the law all the time,"
so it's a different story then.
"You know, but, but Ed McMahon, I mean, you know, who cares about Ed McMahon."
"He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air, you know."
And he has a chauffeur.
"I'm, I'm fairly newly married."
I've only been married less than two years
Uh-huh.
"and before that, I never owned a home or anything,"
so I never had any deductions.
"Right,"
right.
"So, really, it was always just money thrown away."
Thrown away.
"Yeah,"
jeez.
"And I never really thought about it because,"
You were good at it
"Yeah,"
"I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um, became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I suspect that, you know, thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and, you know, the amount that I know they buy, I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation, and, you know, just don't talk about it."
Yeah.
"Most, most people don't like to talk about money."
"They feel uncomfortable, I think."
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"You know, for a lot of people it is very personal."
very personal.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and especially if you, if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be,"
Yeah.
"But I think the, the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt. Not, not including like a mortgage."
"A mortgage is an understandable debt because that's, you have, you have to have a roof over your head."
Uh-huh.
"That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family."
"Yeah,"
Is it really?
Yeah.
except that mine are a little bit older
"and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,"
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.
Uh-huh.
You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.
That's right.
That's right.
"Well, that's what she said to us."
"She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?"
"And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college."
"And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know."
And that was kind of our view on it.
"It just costs too much,"
"you just can't do it, you know."
"So, I don't know,"
"it's, it's,"
"I don't, uh,"
"it just amazing,"
"it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years."
I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.
"And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them."
"Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,"
"Oh, goodness."
"and I said, that's wonderful."
I applaud that.
"Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, and I'm,"
"I,"
"I'd,"
"I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work."
"But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid."
"Paid, right."
"Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company."
"But, but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
Some that may decide not to.
"yeah,"
"Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget."
"Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure."
Uh-huh.
It's only getting worse exponentially it seems.
Yes.
Exactly.
"Um,"
"There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do"
"and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course,"
"but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"Oh, which state is that?"
"Uh, State of Minnesota."
Uh-huh.
"So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages."
"I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it"
Uh-huh.
so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.
Right.
Right.
"and, uh, of course, the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing, the more you can trust their, their judgment and their insight."
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"But the media insight, as you said,"
I just kind of read and kind of be aware
Yeah.
"and then, uh, I don't like to make a whole lot of, uh, judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that, uh,"
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
That's a real different topic.
"I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy."
I know.
"I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about."
"See, I'm a college student,"
"so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that."
Yeah.
"But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic."
Yeah.
"I think, personally, you know,"
"I'm, I used to be a college student ten years ago"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, golly."
"You're like, No, you don't, no."
"It's like, how do you know my name,"
"where did you get my phone number,"
and why do you think it's a deal for me?
Uh-huh.
"I don't, yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either."
Uh-huh.
"I just don't, I don't see,"
"and, then, I, I think, uh, hadn't thought about this before"
"but if you do that, if they would, uh, uh, decide to ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, you know, a black market for them."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
right.
"And so, you know, they, they would just,"
"all the profits would go to, you know,"
"Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has I think they're liable now for,"
Yeah.
"they  can be, you know, put in jail and everything. The, whoever owned the gun."
"Oh,  Oh , yeah,"
the owner's responsibility?
"You know, now  when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them up"
Yeah.
"or, you know."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"you know, that's, that's true."
"Uh, you know, I, I had a friend who was a, uh, a policeman in a, in a local borough just a small, uh, one of the little neighborhoods, you know, one of the small towns, uh near Pittsburgh."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she said that, that, uh, you know, he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that"
"but, I mean, you know, you're, you know,"
"people make, you know,"
"they forget or, you know, you know,"
"kids get in,"
"the way kids, the way kids are, you know, I mean, they can, you know."
Well they can get into almost anything anymore
Right.
"Okay Uh, let me see."
"or I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news."
"I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors,"
Yeah.
and you feel comfortable with them
"and,"
"It is interesting though,"
it becomes a little of personality.
"In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago"
Uh-huh.
"and, and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago"
"and, uh, they had, they had fired him, uh, because he was too"
"anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds"
Uh-huh.
and that's interesting.
"That's, that's what the T V stations do."
they're trying to get ratings.
That's true.
"And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings."
Their job.
That's true.
So that really effects how they report the news.
"Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy"
"but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes."
"Is he the sports,"
"Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes?"
"Yeah,"
"I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed."
"Okay,"
well good talking to you.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
Bye-bye.
"and could call them,"
you go to their office anytime.
"I had some instructors that, uh, would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends, when I was having trouble with something"
Huh.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
you won't get that at M I T or virtually or anything like that.
"No,"
"no,"
"and that,"
"And you you know, and you can't blame the professors either, because you look at their job description,"
No.
"you'd you know,"
teaching is third down on the list of importance things
"and,"
"Right,"
right.
"Publish first,"
and the
"yeah,"
"and, and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research, because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time."
Right.
"So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers."
People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job.
Yeah.
"But, oh, well"
"Yeah,"
"it's, there's a lot of factors that people don't ever, ever consider in, in their selection of a college"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe, I wonder if, if they enter these conversations that people have been having, uh ..."
what kind of fishing do you enjoy?
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, I work in metal fab"
"and tenths of inches are, are normal."
"And, you know, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch."
"Well, have, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, uh, metric type things like ..."
"Yes,"
I am.
"I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle"
"and, and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years"
and the metric system comes easy to me.
But my ...
"I think it's interesting you you know, when you go out there"
and you're looking for a wrench
and you want the next size larger.
"I've got, I inherited some, some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds."
Right.

"In April 2005, the New York City based Film Forum premiered an ""expanded"" version featuring several restored scenes, along with a new musical score by Christopher Caliendo. This expanded version was actually the 136-minute cut authorized by producer Jerry Bresler before he left Columbia Studios. Recently unearthed in Sony Pictures' archives, the restored version played in selected cities in North America and has been released on a Region 1 DVD. All of the cuts were edited out of the released version at the last minute; it is highly unlikely that Peckinpah's director's cut will ever be fully restored."
"Restored scenes are listed below. These include both brief inserts and additions to existing scenes, as well as four major scenes restored to the film."
"Available as extras on the DVD are an unfinished knife fight scene between Potts and Gomez in a Mexican village, a longer version of Teresa and Dundee's interlude at the lake, and several silent outtakes – including a master shot which would have opened the massacre scene at the beginning, of Lt. Brannin and his men riding past a sheep farmer to the Rostes Ranch."
"For the 2005 restored version, a new score was composed by Christopher Caliendo. This score was composed and recorded with a small studio orchestra to authentically sound the way director Peckinpah might have approved it had he been alive at the time of the film's restoration, and the way the music might have been done in its original 1965 release as opposed to today's larger orchestra-type scores. The new score is regarded by some critics as being better than the original, which was disliked by film experts and featured the title song performed by the Mitch Miller Sing-a-Long Gang, though many concede the new music is far from perfect; for example, there has been criticism of Caliendo's decision to leave unscored several sequences which did have music in the original version."
"Upon its theatrical release, ""Major Dundee"" received generally negative reviews while acknowledging the film's potential. In his review in ""The New York Times"", Eugene Archer wrote that the film had ""an interesting cast, a superior visual texture, unexpected bits of character revelation and a choppy continuity that finally negates its impact."" He praised Peckinpah for ""seeking a fresh approach to the Western"" and acknowledged that the director ""displays a fine eye for panoramic vistas."" Archer concludes:"
"Many of the flaws identified by film critics in 1965 were addressed in the 2005 restored version, and film reviews of the DVD are much more positive. In his review in ""Alt Film Guide"", Dan Schneider called ""Major Dundee"" ""a near-great film that has a checkered history"" and ""likely the most gritty and realistic Western ever made."""
"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% positive rating from top film critics based on 32 reviews, and a 67% positive audience rating based on 3,478 ratings. Metacritic, another review aggregator, reports a score of 62/100 based on 12 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews""."
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

The track was extended in 1960 to form the present Long Course. There is also a ""Short Course"" of , now used only by meetings organised by the Vintage Sports-Car Club."
"The track is owned by the Bugatti Owners' Club (BOC), founded in 1929, who were looking for a permanent home and bought the land in 1937. The club had previously run events at Lewes and on the Chalfont Heights Estate, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. The club also ran a one-off event at Joel Park, Northwood Hill, Middlesex, on 22 June 1935, which was won by Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth, on a Bugatti, in a time of 30.16 sec.

Unfortunately, the noise nuisance, which is a disease not unknown to motor-race course promoters, broke out and the project was reluctantly abandoned..."""
"The first event at Prescott was staged in April 1938, on what is now the Short Course. As announced in ""Motor Sport"": ""The Opening Rally on April 10th will comprise an assembly at Cheltenham for lunch, followed by a run to Prescott and possibly timed runs up the hill, followed by tea at the Prescott club-house.

"Dr. Rolf Potter Kennedy McPherson (March 23, 1913 – May 21, 2009) was the pastor of Angelus Temple and president of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, serving in that capacity from 1944 to 1988. By his retirement, the evangelical Pentecostal denomination had grown from 29,000 members in 410 churches to 1.2 million members in more than 19,000 churches located in 63 countries."
"Rolf McPherson was born on March 23, 1913 in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the son of Harold Stewart McPherson and Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. He was the half-brother of Roberta Star Semple, the daughter of Aimee and her first husband Robert James Semple, who had died of malaria one month before the birth of his daughter. Rolf and his sister Roberta were part of many services and revivals when young. McPherson attended college, first studying engineering. He switched to religion in 1930 after his mother became ill, and also completed divinity school, earning a doctorate."
"McPherson began his career as a preacher. His mother groomed him to take over Foursquare after a management dispute resulted in Roberta being ousted from church leadership. After his mother's death in 1944, and for the next 44 years, McPherson led the denomination, headquartered at Angelus Temple, and brought it into the evangelical mainstream, which supported its tremendous development in the United States and expansion internationally."
"He retired in 1988. After retirement, he continued to attend church every week, serving in congregational ministry. He resigned from all church duties in 1997. He died on May 21, 2009, at his home in Los Feliz at age 96, having been predeceased by his first wife, Lorna Dee Smith McPherson.

= = = 1891 Atlantic hurricane season = = =
"The 1891 Atlantic hurricane season ran through the summer and the early winter of 1891. The season had ten tropical cyclones, seven of which became hurricanes including one which became a major Category 3 hurricane. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only cyclones that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. The tracks of four of the ten known 1891 Atlantic cyclones were revised in 1996 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas. Following re-analysis in 2003, two storms previously considered distinct are now regarded as a single system, Tropical Storm 8. A number of other storms from 1891 were considered for inclusion in the Atlantic hurrice database, HURDAT, but are currently excluded due to a lack of evidence of tropical storm intensity."
"A tropical storm formed in Gulf of Mexico northwest of Campeche on July 3. By the evening of July 6 it was approaching the coastline of Texas and had become a Category 1 hurricane. It made landfall just west of Galveston and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. It dissipated near the Alabama-Tennessee state line two days later after further weakening to a tropical depression. Sections of Galveston were flooded by a storm surge. At Baton Rouge, tornados related to the hurricane demolished a hundred homes and caused two floors of the state penitentiary to collapse killing ten prisoners."
"A tropical storm formed south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 17 and travelled on a northwesterly path before dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean on August 29 without making a landfall. For the majority of this period it is believed to have been a minimal Category 1 hurricane based on readings taken at Bermuda, which it passed on August 27, the capsizing of a steamer, the ""Dunsmurry"" on August 29 and observations from another ship, ""La Touraine"", which ran into the rough seas left in the hurricane's wake on August 30 and 31st."
The Martinique Hurricane of 1891 or Hurricane San Magín of 1891
"A Category 2 hurricane with winds of was first seen at mid-day on August 18 about east of Barbados. The hurricane tracked northwestward at , and grew to a major Category 3 hurricane. That night, the hurricane passed over Martinique, lashing the island for four hours. The hurricane killed more than 700 people alone in Martinique. After reaching its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 961 mb, the storm began to weaken, becoming a Category 2 storm early on August 20. That evening it passed to the south of Puerto Rico. Sustained winds were measured at 100-105 mph. As it began to turn northward, it made landfall on the extreme eastern edge of the Dominican Republic with winds of . Around midnight on August 21, the cyclone passed north of Grand Turk. During the late afternoon and into the evening hours there, frequent rain squalls occurred, and at 10:15 pm a strong gust of wind was reported. After that gust, the winds decreased in intensity, until around midnight when winds picked up from the west. By 8:00 am the next morning, the wind was blowing southerly, and steady rain was falling on the island."
"The hurricane continued to weaken whilst traveling northeastward through the Bahamas on August 22. The center of the storm passed directly over Crooked Island, Bahamas. From August 23, a ridge of high pressure situated off the southeast coast of the United States prevented the, now Category 1, storm recurving to the north. Instead, it passed over the Florida Peninsula as a tropical storm, making landfall near Homestead on August 24. Subsequently, it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it dissipated on August 25."
"On Martinique, the storm destroyed houses, crops and trees across the entire island. Fifty boats in harbours around Martinque were damaged or destroyed. At Ducos, only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34 people lost their lives. At Fort de France, twenty people were killed. A military camp at Balata was destroyed, with a number of soldiers there sustaining injuries from airborne debris. In total, the death toll from this hurricane was put at 700. In South Florida, the cyclone also produced hurricane-force winds that blew boats ashore near present-day Cutler."
On September 2 a tropical storm formed northeast of the Leeward Islands. It began moving northwestward and reached category 2 hurricane strength by September 4. By September 7 the cyclone was off the coast of New England and was bringing heavy rain to that area. When the hurricane made landfall in Nova Scotia and then Newfoundland on September 8 it destroyed a number of small vessels but then quickly weakened and dissipated north of Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea on September 10.
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 19°N 47°W on September 16, before developing into a Category 2 hurricane on September 20. This hurricane never made landfall but did pass within 100 km of Bermuda on the night of September 21. A ship was reported wrecked on the coast of the island that night. The hurricane became an extratropical storm on September 26 in the mid-Atlantic off Nova Scotia."
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 21°N 54°W on September 29. It moved northwestward becoming first a Category 1 hurricane then, October 3 a Category 2 hurricane. At this strength it passed to the south, then to the west, of Bermuda on October 4. It quickly weakened as it continued heading north and was already an extratropical storm when it made landfall in Nova Scotia on October 6. It also affected Newfoundland before dissipating in the Labrador Sea on October 8."
A moderate tropical storm formed in the Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica on October 4 and passed to the west of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before striking the Isla de la Juventud and Cuba on October 6. The next day it passed across southern Florida before travelling northeastward off the east coast of the United States and then decaying in the open Atlantic on October 8. Some vessels were driven ashore on the coast of Cuba and two people drowned in flooding on the island.
"A tropical depression formed north of Honduras on October 7 and strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. On October 9 it passed across Cuba and quickly weakened to become an extratropical storm. As an extratropical storm it made landfalls in Florida on October 10 and, five days later, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland where it dissipated."
"A tropical storm formed north of Grenada on October 12, and made landfalls on Saint Croix and the main Virgin Islands on October 14.The system strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane as it proceeded north. The storm centre passed west of Bermuda on October 18 at that strength but weakened to a tropical storm just before affecting the southern tip of Newfoundland on October 20."
"On November 3 a tropical storm formed northeast of present-day Nassau, Bahamas. It treked north, passing east of Bermuda on November 5. The storm never made a landfall before dissipating in the open Atlantic off Nova Scotia on November 6."
"= = = Eugene Maximilian, Prince of Hornes = = ="
"Eugene Maximillian, 1st Prince of Hornes (October 1, 1631 – March 10, 1709) was the son of Ambroise de Hornes, 2nd Count of Bassignies and Marie Marguerite de Bailleul de Lesdaing. He was a great-grandson of Philip de Lalaing, 3rd Count of Lalaing"
"He was made a Prince of the Empire on October 19, 1677, and his domain elevated to the Principality of Hornes. It was an enclave of Liege. He was married to Princess Anne Marie Jeanne of Croÿ and had one son, Philippe Emanuel, Prince of Hornes. He died 14 October 1718."
"Mu'in ad-Din Unur al-Atabeki (; died August 28, 1149) was the Turkish ruler of Damascus in the mid-12th century."
"Mu'in ad-Din was originally a Mameluk in the army of Toghtekin, the founder of the Burid Dynasty of Damascus. When Zengi, the atabeg of Aleppo, besieged Damascus in 1135, Mu'in ad-Din was at the head of army defending the city. That year the Burid Shihab ad-Din Mahmud took control of Damascus after the assassination of his brother; when Zengi gave up the siege and instead besieged Homs, Shihab ad-Din sent Yusuf ibn Firuz and Mu'in ad-Din to govern it, with Yusuf acting as Mu'in ad-Din's lieutenant. In 1137 Mu'in ad-Din was still governor of Homs when the city was briefly besieged again by Zengi. In 1138, Shihab ad-Din appointed Mu'in ad-Din atabeg of Damascus and gave him the title ""Isfahsaller"". Later in 1138, Zengi negotiated a marriage between himself and Shihab ad-Din's mother Khatun Safwat al-Mulk, and as part of the settlement Zengi received Homs. Mu'in ad-Din was given the castle of Barin in place of Homs. On June 22, 1139, Shihab ad-Din was assassinated in Damascus; Jamal ad-Din, emir of Baalbek, was chosen as his successor, and Mu'in ad-Din was chosen to govern Baalbek in his absence. He was in charge of the defenses of Baalbek when Zengi arrived to avenge the murder of his stepson. Zengi besieged it with 14 catapults and the city surrendered to him."
"In 1140 Jamal ad-Din died, and Mu'in ad-Din continued to rule as regent for Jamal ad-Din's son Mujir ad-Din. That year, Mu'in ad-Din besieged Banias with help from King Fulk of Jerusalem and Prince Raymond of Antioch; Mu'in ad-Din offered 20 000 pieces of gold per month to pay for their expenses. When it was captured, Mu'in ad-Din handed it over to Fulk and returned to Damascus. A more thorough alliance, to protect Damascus against Zengi, was negotiated during a visit by Mu'in ad-Din to Jerusalem, accompanied by the future chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh."
"King Fulk died in 1143, and Zengi was assassinated in 1146. Zengi was succeeded by his sons Saif ad-Din Ghazi I in Mosul and Nur ad-Din in Aleppo, and Mu'in ad-Din took the opportunity to besiege Baalbek; the governor, Najm ad-Din Ayyub, father of Saladin, quickly surrendered to him. Mu'in ad-Din also asserted control over Homs and Hama, and sent Yarankash, the assassin of Zengi, to Nur ad-Din, after Yarankash sought refuge in Damascus."
"Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's power, but it was his policy to remain on friendly terms with his neighbours wherever possible, whether they were Christian or Muslim. In 1147 Nur ad-Din and Mu'in ad-Din negotiated an alliance, in which Nur ad-Din married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter Ismat ad-Din Khatun. Having established peace with Aleppo, Mu'in ad-Din set out to besiege Salkhad and Bosra, after their governor, Altuntash, allied with Jerusalem against him. This broke Jerusalem's treaty with Damascus, forcing Mu'in ad-Din to turn to Nur ad-Din for assistance. Nur ad-Din arrived with the army of Aleppo, and the crusaders were forced to withdraw; both Bosra and Sarkhad then surrendered to Mu'in ad-Din. In August 1147 Mu'in ad-Din was formally recognized as governor of Damascus by the Caliph of Baghdad Al-Muqtafi and the Seljuk Sultan Mas'ud, and he was also recognized formally by the Fatimid Caliph in Egypt, al-Hafiz."
"In 1148 news reached Damascus of a new crusade, called in response to Zengi's capture of Edessa in 1145. Mu'in ad-Din prepared for the inevitable siege, although he had hoped his former alliance with Jerusalem could be restored and that the crusade would attack some other city. When the crusaders arrived in July, according to Ibn al-Qalanisi, Mu'in ad-Din ""distinguished himself in combat with them, and displayed a valour, steadfastness and gallantry such as was never seen in any other, never wearying in repelling them nor taking respite from the struggle against them."" Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly sent for help from Nur ad-Din and Saif-ad Din Ghazi, whose power he did not wish to see extend as far south as Damascus, and the crusaders besieged the city for only four days before withdrawing. It is possible that Mu'in ad-Din had bribed the crusaders to leave before Nur ad-Din arrived. After this success, the three emirs besieged the castle of Araima in the County of Tripoli, but Mu'in ad-Din was forced to acknowledge Nur ad-Din as his overlord."
"In 1149 Mu'in ad-Din led raids against crusader territory, in response to their raids against the territory of Damascus which they continued to make after the failure of their siege. He agreed to a two-year truce with King Baldwin III, and then joined with Nur ad-Din against the Principality of Antioch. Mu’in ad-Din patrolled the Hauran with his army while Nur ad-Din defeated Antioch at the Battle of Inab that year, in which Prince Raymond was killed."
"After returning to Damascus in July 1149, Mu'in ad-Din ""ate a hearty meal, as was his usual custom, and was seized thereafter by a loosening of the bowels...From this resulted in the disease known as dysentery..."" The emir died on August 28 and was buried in the university he had established in the city. As he had been acting as regent for Mujir ad-Din, the latter took his place as the rightful heir of Damascus. Mujir ad-Din was a weak ruler, however, and by 1154 Nur ad-Din was fully in control of the city and all of Syria."
"Mu'in ad-Din had three daughters, who married Nur ad-Din, Mujir ad-Din, and a soldier named Margar respectively. In addition to Ibn al-Qalanisi's favourable depiction of him, the Christian chronicler William of Tyre also speaks very highly of Mu'in ad-Din: he showed ""sincere fidelity"" in his negotiations with the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was ""a man of much wisdom and a lover of our people."" William of Tyre rendered his names in Latin as ""Meheneddin"" for Mu'in ad-Din and ""Anardus"" for Unur."

"= = = John McPherson (footballer, born 1868) = = ="
"John McPherson (19 June 1868 – 31 July 1926) was a Scottish footballer who played for Cowlairs, Kilmarnock, Rangers and the Scotland national team."
"Born in Kilmarnock and known as 'Kitey' from a young age, McPherson started his career with his local side Kilmarnock, winning the Ayrshire Cup in 1885. He appeared for English club Everton as an amateur in 1887, also playing for Cowlairs of Glasgow in the early rounds of the 1887–88 Scottish Cup, which led to a protest by their defeated opponents Third Lanark over the possibility of McPherson and others having professional status (prohibited at the time). Another player (Robert Calderwood) was found to have been paid by an English club and the match was replayed, with Cowlairs winning again. McPherson did not return to Everton, featuring instead for Kilmarnock in the same edition of the Scottish Cup before spending the next two years with Cowlairs, after which he joined Rangers in 1890."
"McPherson played mainly as a striker at Rangers, but was often used in other positions including goalkeeper. He played in the inaugural Scottish League season, 1890–91, where Rangers finished as joint champions with Dumbarton. McPherson's first recorded appearance was in a friendly against Everton on 19 April 1890 at Ibrox, and he scored in a 6–2 defeat. His first League appearance, however, was in Rangers' first ever Scottish League match, on 16 August 1890 in a 5–2 win over Hearts at Ibrox, in which he scored. McPherson scored 15 goals in Rangers' 18 matches in the League that season, including four in a 6–2 win over Cambuslang at Whitefield Park on 23 August 1890 (the first ever hat-trick scored in the Scottish Football League) and five in an 8–2 win over St Mirren on 4 October 1890."
"Despite Rangers' successful introduction to the Scottish Football League, they had to wait until season 1898–99 to win the League title again. It was done in style as Rangers won all of their 18 League matches, with McPherson netting 10 times. That remarkable season was the first of four consecutive League titles and McPherson made significant contributions to all of them, scoring nine goals in 1899–1900, seven in 1900–01 and three in 1901–02 — which proved to be his last season with Rangers."
"McPherson also won three Scottish Cup medals with Rangers, the first in 1894, where he scored in five of Rangers' six matches, including the 3–1 final win over Celtic at Hampden. McPherson also scored in the 1897 final, where Rangers defeated Dumbarton 5–1. His third medal came a year later, 1898, in a 2–0 win over his former club Kilmarnock. His final recorded appearance for Rangers was in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Glentoran on 2 April 1902."
"McPherson was also a Scottish International, winning a total of nine caps and scoring six goals. He is one of four players named John McPherson (none of whom are related) to have represented Scotland at full international level. He also played five times for the Scottish League representative side."
"A qualified engine–fitter, McPherson maintained a close association with Rangers after his playing years, serving as a director from 1907 until his death in 1926 at the age of 58. He is buried in Craigton Cemetery not far from Ibrox Stadium."
"McPherson had several family members involved in football. His son, also John, played at Junior level with Benburb, and his grandson Johnny (known as 'Sailor' due to his wartime navy service) played a single league match for Rangers in 1948 followed by spells at senior level with Ayr United and in the juniors with Irvine Meadow."
"In addition, his younger brother David was a teammate at Rangers, had a long spell at Kilmarnock (including in the 1898 Scottish Cup Final where he and John were on the opposing teams) and was also a Scottish international. Elder brother James was a teammate at Kilmarnock, Cowlairs and the Glasgow FA team, played as a guest for Celtic and spent a lengthy period as a trainer at Newcastle United working with Frank Watt; when James retired, the role was taken by his son , whose previous jobs included the Norway squad at the 1920 Olympics, Vitesse in the Netherlands and Bayern Munich in Germany. Another of James's sons was also a trainer/manager who led HBS to the Dutch championship in 1925, while his daughter Mary married Newcastle player and Germany international Edwin Dutton."

"Miles & More is the largest traveller loyalty programme in Europe with 25 million members as of March 2014. It offers rewards to passengers of the Star Alliance travelling on certain types of tickets. The programme was launched by Lufthansa (LH) in 1993 and has about 40 airline partners, including the 28 airlines of the Star Alliance. The programme enables its members to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles on all of the fully integrated airlines, all Star Alliance members as well as several other partner airlines. Furthermore, there are more than 270 non-aviation companies affiliated with the programme. These include partners from the hotel, car rental & cruise industries, subscriptions & books, banks & insurance, telecommunications & electronics industries as well as shopping & lifestyle. Customers are able to build status, which gives them access to certain privileges. Miles & More is free of charge."
The following airlines are partners of the Miles & More program:
There are two types of miles within the programme.
"These are miles that can be collected in the account of a member and be used to buy flights, upgrades, merchandise from the Lufthansa WorldShop and other Miles & More partners. For standard Miles & More members they retain validity for 36 months, after which they expire. (Miles are not extended by having any activity on the account as with most other airlines). For Frequent Travellers, Senators and HON Circle Card holders, the miles have no expiration date. However, as soon as a customer does not hold any of these cards any more, the expiration date of all miles is set to 36 months counting from loss of frequent flyer status. For Miles & More Credit Card (Visa or MasterCard) holders issued in several countries, miles have no expiration date as long as the card is held and/or used. If the credit card contract is ended, the original expiry date of the miles is reinstated; although the earliest miles can expire is at the end of the quarter after the credit card contract is ended."
"Status miles can only be earned when flying on the fully integrated partner airlines or on Star Alliance members. There is no other way to earn these miles. In addition, status miles expire at the end of each calendar year. They are used to identify the frequent flyers and members that are able to qualify for a higher status on the basis of the status miles that they have collected in one year."
"Select benefits are advantages that can be earned in addition to the status benefits, as part of the programme called Miles & More Selections while the status is still valid. Once the member has reached specified mileage levels by flying, additional advantages can be selected. With every mileage level reached the range of select benefits increases. The selection of the select benefits varies from the status the member has. The select benefits for Frequent Travellers e.g. include business lounge vouchers, e-vouchers or mile exchange, the ones for Senators a Hilton Gold Membership, in addition. For HON circle members additional benefits such as coupons up to a value of 100 Euro as well as additional Senator partner cards are available."
"HON Circle miles can only be earned when flying in business or first class on the fully integrated partner airlines and Air-Rail trains in Germany (up to a total of 600,000 miles within two consecutive calendar years). They are necessary to attain the top-tier status on Miles & More – HON Circle. Until April 1, 2006 it was possible to also collect this type of mile on United Airlines. This option no longer exists. HON-miles have to be accumulated within two calendar years. Only Senators with an account balance of more than 300,000 status miles over two years, and existing HON Circle members, can see these miles on their account statement. HON Circle qualifying miles balance is also visible to Frequent Traveller and Senator members when logged in their Lufthansa iPad or Android app."
"The miles that a member receives after having completed a flight depend on the Airline issuing ticket, mileage flown, the class of service and the booking class."
"Tables show the number of miles earned with Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and SWISS. The number of miles earned with other airlines can be calculated using the Mileage Calculator available at the Miles & More website."
"These mileages apply for flights operated by Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and SWISS. There is the possibility to earn 10,000 miles on all flights operated by the Lufthansa Private Jet."
"Lufthansa always has a number of promotions, most lasting for 1–2 months only. They include double mileage on new routes, extra miles for using electronic check-in and alike. Some of the promotions are restricted to residents of certain countries and others are restricted to certain customers."

"The Volkswagen Bratislava Plant is an automotive factory and co-located test track in Bratislava, Slovakia owned by Volkswagen Group."
"Funded by the ruling Communist Party to expand car production across Czechoslovakia, it agreed a partnership in 1969 with Italian automaker Alfa Romeo, but the proposed new-model was never developed beyond the clay-mock-up."
"On 1 July 1971, Bratislavské Automobilové Závody (BAZ) was founded, sub-contracted to produce Škoda Auto models, but with all pressings and parts supplied by the Czech-based partner. The factory began producing the Mladá Boleslav-designed 731 (saloon) and 732 (station wagon), as well as other BAZ marketed small (MNA) and medium-sized trucks (SNA). Later vehicles developed included the 3-door Locusta coupé."
"After developing a partnership with Tatra, the company also produced military vehicles, including the popular Praga V3S."
"BAZ vehicle production ended in 1982, when the production of the Škoda Garde was started, with the resultant development of the factory spurring the construction of new apartment blocks in the borough of Devínska Nová Ves. However, parts supply from the parent plant in the Czech Republic was slow, resulting often in a number of part-finished vehicles being held in storage, often awaiting singular parts. The factory later produced the Škoda Rapid 130/135/136, as well as a variety of parts for other car manufacturers in Czechoslovakia."
Some prototypes from BAZ can be seen in Museum of Transport in Bratislava.
"After the fall of the Iron Curtain, in May 1991 Volkswagen Group bought an 80% share of BAZ. Skoda Auto production continued, and was expanded to include other models within the VW Group portfolio, initially the Volkswagen Passat. In 1998 Volkswagen Group bought out the remaining company shares, and renamed the company Volkswagen Slovakia. Volkswagen then bought the remaining shares in Skoda Auto in 2000."
"Since VW developed their large SUV platform, the factory has become a specialist producer of all VW Group marques large SUV's, which presently include the Audi Q7 and the Volkswagen Touareg, and the co-designed Porsche Cayenne which is based on the same platform. It is also the only VW Group factory to produce the Golf Syncro four-wheel drive. Since December 2011 the factory has produced the VW up!, as well as the badge-engineered SEAT Mii and Škoda Citigo for European markets."
"The factory area of the plant currently covers an area of . Bodies are assembled and welded in one of two body shops, and then painted with one of 26 standard colours in the paint shop. The co-located Aggregate/Modules hall produces gearboxes for both on-site consumption and various models of the VW Group brands. The bodies are moved to the assembly hall, which covers an area equivalent to 21 football pitches, where the painted body is mated with the pre-assembled under-body and chassis. The VW Group and Porsche models then split."
"The Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Toureg and Up! variants are completed by installing the finishing components including wiring, wheels, seats and the steering wheel. The final assembled SUV is then transported via cable car to the co-located test track for a final on-road test. If the car then passes a further inspection, it is prepared for dealer delivery."
"Since 2016, the Bentley Bentayga has also been produced at Bratislava."
"DHL handle all shipping and distribution arrangements from the site, via railway (70%) or road. Aside from on-site body pressings, gearbox production, and various under-body and drive train components sourced from the Martin plant; 90% of parts are delivered to site from Volkswagen's component consolidation centre in Wolfsburg, Germany, shipped directly to site via 10 daily trains."
"First and second generation Porsche Cayenne models were sent direct to shipping once the body has been mated with under body. They were then shipped directly by rail to the Porsche factory in Leipzig, Germany, where interior fitting out, finishing and inspection were completed. Third generation Porsche Cayenne are being completely produced, and finished directly in Bratislava."

"""The Seven Lively Arts"" brought together a number of notable performers: Beatrice Lillie, Bert Lahr, Benny Goodman, and ""Doc"" Rockwell as well as showgirls - ""the prettiest around at the moment,"" according to ""The New York Times"" review."
"The solo dancers for the ""Scènes de Ballet"" were Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin (who was also the choreographer). Although Rose had requested a 15-minute work, ""the music was cut to a fraction of its original length when ""The Seven Lively Arts"" ... opened in New York."""
"""Scènes de ballet"" is a score of between 16 and 18 minutes' duration, written in 1944. It was commissioned by Billy Rose for a Broadway revue. The music occasioned one of the best-known Stravinsky anecdotes. Rose telegraphed Stravinsky: """" To which Stravinsky telegraphed back: """""

"The Global Change Award, is an innovation challenge created by the H&M foundation. It created a trend report in 2017 to look at the future of sustainable fashion. Five ""megatrends"" are identified by the organisation that will lead the future of sustainable fashion. The first ""megatrend"" is ""Power of Nature"" which is the industry looking into materials that have always been looked at as waste as a more sustainable method to making new clothing. The materials that will mitigate negative impacts from the industry include vegan materials from the earth and recycling old fabric into new clothing. The second ""megatrend"" is ""Rent a Closet""; this initiative has been around for a while. This trend ultimately lowers the new purchase of clothing and disposal of clothing, which means less waste. Rent the Runway is an example of the ""Rent a Closet"" trend. Rent the Runway started as a company that would give luxury brands like Hervé Leger, Vera Wang, Etro to people who may not be able to afford the clothing at regular retail price. Renting and sharing clothing is also known as CFC (collaborative fashion consumption) a sustainable fashion trend consumers are getting involved in. The third trend is ""Long Live Fashion"" is the revival of Vintage clothing. Vintage clothing is a way to lower the amount of clothing that gets disposed of and ends up in landfills. Companies like RE/DONE, Vintage Twin and Frankie Collective sell re-paired vintage clothing. Repairing and reselling clothing has less negative impact than creating new clothing does. The fourth megatrend is ""innovative recycling"" which is looking at waste as value. The industry is starting to create incentives for consumers to participate in the recycling of clothing."
Tailored couture is one option for the future of a greener fashion industry as it can potentially lead to less waste and more jobs improving the economy. Tailored couture is no longer desired because of the convenience of malls and stores provide but the consequence of the convenience is the pollution of the environment. Tailored clothing if it were to become the norm mass production of clothing that will not be bought can be reduced and reusing and redesigning old clothes to fit could reduce the amount of old worn out unfitting clothes thrown out or given away.
"In 2019, the UK Parliament's Environment Audit Committee published a report and recommendations on the future of fashion sustainability, suggesting wide-ranging systemic change, not least government regulation and tax-incentives for sustainable practices, such as lowered VAT for repair services. As highlighted in the report, wide political and social changes are needed to push industry towards more sustainable practices and levels of consumption: brands doing ""less harm"" is not enough. The report finishes with the following statement;""Retailers must take responsibility for the social and environmental cost of clothes. They should use their market power to demand higher environmental and labour standards from suppliers. Offering rental schemes, lifetime repair and providing the consumer with more information about the sourcing and true cost of clothing are all measures that can be more widely adopted. Shifting business practice in this way can not only improve a business’s environmental and social impact but also offer market advantage as they respond to the growing consumer demand for responsible, sustainable clothing.""(p.54)"

"The song is sung from the perspective of a self-proclaimed ""boy from down in the boondocks."" He sings of a girl who lives nearby, for whom he feels love and he steals away with occasionally. The people who live or are born in the boondocks are suggested to be a lower class than those in the city. The girl's father is the singer's boss man, which, along with the social division, prevents him from proclaiming his love and connecting with them, despite the shared feelings (which is the basis for the line ""but I don't dare knock on her door/for her daddy is my boss man""). The singer proclaims that ""one fine day, I'll find a way, to move from this old shack,"" presumably to be able to join the higher class members of society and finally be able to date the girl within the public eye."

Furthermore, the author point out that a sustainable metals management cannot be defined in isolation, because a global issue like this is linked to many other issues at the global level: population and welfare increase, the concurrent expected rise in demand for food, water, and energy, the availability of metals and other non-renewable materials, the shift to a renewable energy system, dietary choices, etc. Therefore it should be part of an overall effort to steer society towards a more sustainable development."
"The production of different metals has different potentials to impact the environment. The report gives reasons to why metals can become relatively more important from an environmental impact point of view. First of all, the demand for most metals is rising rapidly and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Secondly, a shift towards a renewable energy system implies that the material, especially metal, intensity of energy production will increase substantially. Thirdly, in the future, the energy intensity of production of metals is expected to increase due to the use of lesser grade of ores."
"Marina Rebeka (born 1980) is a Latvian opera, song and concert soprano."
Marina Rebeka is one of the leading sopranos of our time and considered one of the
world's best Violettas in Verdi's “La Traviata”. She has also gained a wide reputation as one

"Affine gauge theory is classical gauge theory where gauge fields are affine connections on the tangent bundle over a smooth manifold formula_1. For instance, these are gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media when formula_2, the generalization of metric-affine gravitation theory when formula_1 is a world manifold and, in particular, gauge theory of the fifth force."
"Being a vector bundle, the tangent bundle formula_4 of an formula_5-dimensional manifold formula_1 admits a natural structure of an affine bundle formula_7, called the ""affine tangent bundle"", possessing bundle atlases with affine transition functions. It is associated to a principal bundle formula_8 of affine frames in tangent space over formula_1, whose structure group is a general affine group formula_10."
"The tangent bundle formula_4 is associated to a principal linear frame bundle formula_12, whose structure group is a general linear group formula_13. This is a subgroup of formula_10 so that the latter is a semidirect product of formula_13 and a group formula_16 of translations."
There is the canonical imbedding of formula_12 to formula_8 onto a reduced principal subbundle which corresponds to the canonical structure of a vector bundle formula_4 as the affine one.
Given linear bundle coordinates
"on the tangent bundle formula_4, the affine tangent bundle can be provided with affine bundle coordinates"
"and, in particular, with the linear coordinates (1)."
"Marjanović was born into a large working-class family with 7 children in Knin, in the Littoral Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia). He had 4 brothers and 2 sisters. His father, Dušan, worked in the local factory, while mother Marija was a homemaker."
"After completing primary school and gymnasium in his hometown, Marjanović moved to Zagreb where he attended musical academy which he never finished."
"He then moved to Belgrade, where in 1960 he graduated at University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics, more specifically at the department for microeconomics."
"Upon graduation, Marjanović came back to Knin since he found employment there as the supervisor in Tvik factory. From there, he advanced to the position of financial director, and eventually moving on to metallurgical factory in Zenica. In 1973, he transferred to the Moscow outpost of Progres - a state company that handled close to 80% of Yugoslav black metallurgy and other heavy industries."
"By 1976 he quickly advanced up the ranks to become one of the directors at Progres. He handled company's steel division in Russia quite successfully while developing an impressive network of influential friends and business partners such as Viktor Chernomyrdin (later to become Prime Minister of Russia), and Yuri Brezhnev, son of Leonid Brezhnev."
"In 1979, Marjanović was named as Progres' general director."
"From 1989 until 1994, he was the president of FK Partizan's executive board. One of his more notable moves while at the post was bringing Predrag Mijatović to the club in December 1989. Mijatović, at the time a young promising player from Titograd's FK Budućnost, was very close to signing with Hajduk Split when Marjanović stepped in and convinced him to come to Belgrade. Upon leaving the club, Marjanović was named Partizan's honorary president."
Marjanović officially commenced his PM term on 18 March 1994. He was widely regarded as little more than a puppet of then Serbian president Slobodan Milošević.
"After early parliamentary elections in late 1997, Milošević's SPS-led coalition (with Yugoslav Left and New Democracy) formed a government with far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) led by Vojislav Šešelj. Marjanović was picked for another PM term that started on March 24, 1998."
"Naturally, Marjanović continued as a mere extension of Slobodan Milošević who at this time held the post of President of Yugoslavia. Here's how sources from the top levels of Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia described Marjanović's government modus operandi in ""Evropljanin"" magazine: ""Prime Minister Marjanović suggests something – ministers do not vote – and then Marjanović simply concludes the matter as agreed on. Of course Marjanović neither suggests nor concludes anything without first consulting Milošević"". (""Evropljanin"" issue #13, 19 October 1998, p. 15)"
"Even deputy PM Vojislav Šešelj indirectly confirmed this operating procedure when he said the government meetings are always well prepared, never lasting longer than 15–20 minutes. (""Srpska slobodarska misao"", Vol. I 2000, issue #1, p. 142)"
"This two-year period is widely seen as the most brutal whilst Serbia was led by Milošević. Marjanović's government (with Šešelj as its deputy PM), passed two of what critics consider to be the most draconian pieces of legislation in Serbian political history: the University Law that stripped the University of Belgrade of its autonomy, opening the way for the government to install professors, deans and rectors, as well as the Information Law, which aimed to restrict the activities of media financed by political enemies; despite this, the media played a prominent role in the 5 October 2000 coup d'état."
"Similarly to his first term in office, Marjanović again took a back seat, leaving the limelight to more aggressive members of his cabinet like deputy PM Šešelj and Minister of Information Aleksandar Vučić."
"On 21 October 2000, two weeks after the Bulldozer Revolution, Marjanović resigned to be replaced by a transitional government composed of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) until new parliamentary elections could be organized."
"Marjanović continued to lead Progres all throughout his six and a half years as Serbian PM, though he claimed his status at the company was frozen. The company, which during the 1990s started importing gas from Russia (deal personally negotiated by Marjanović) was still officially publicly owned."
"Although allegations of wrongdoing ran rampant for years, Marjanović was never prosecuted. No legal action was taken against him after the new authorities took office following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000. On 23 January 2002, Marjanović was re-elected as Progres' main board president."
"He died on 21 February 2006, in Belgrade, at age of 68, from undisclosed causes."

Kingsbury was the first baseball player to earn back-to-back Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Awards, in 2001 and 2002. He went to school at Fordham where he set an NCAA record for stolen bases in a game (8), and was drafted by the Pirates in the 8th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, but his excellent glove, a quick bat, an intelligent hitting approach, and his work ethic could have given him a third or fourth-round pick if he'd gone to a warm-weather college."
"During the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens, Greece, Kingsbury, who has a Greek grandmother, was given the chance to play for the host nation, Greece. Most of the players on the Greek baseball team were Americans with Greek heritage, including North Florida coach Dusty Rhodes, and White Sox scout John Kazanas, Clay Bellinger of the Orioles, outfielders Nick Markakis the Orioles and Nick Theodorou of the Dodgers, and catchers Mike Tonis of Royals and George Kottaras of the Padres."
"Kingsbury, an alumnus and 2008 Hall of Fame inductee of Fordham University and current member of the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, picked up one of the biggest hits of the tournament for Greece, an RBI triple, in their lone win, which came against Italy in the preliminary round."
"In the spring of 2006, Kingsbury was invited to the Pirates major-league camp in Bradenton, FL as a non-roster invitee. During the seventh inning of the first game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Kingsbury dove for a ball in right field and upon hitting the ground dislocated his left throwing shoulder. He fully tore his rotator cuff and labrum thus ending his 2006 campaign."

It served as the governor's mansion for nearly four decades in the twentieth century, and has been designated a National Historic Landmark. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."
"In 1701, Richard Stockton purchased, from William Penn, the property. His grandson Richard Stockton (1730–1781) had 150 acres, on which, in the 1750s, he built the house that his wife Annis Boudinot Stockton named ""Morven"", after a mythical Gaelic kingdom in Ireland."
"Commodore Robert Stockton (1795–1866) later lived in the house that was built on the property. Robert Wood Johnson II, chairman of the company Johnson and Johnson, leased the home after Bayard Stockton died during 1932."
"In 1944, New Jersey Governor Walter E. Edge purchased Morven from the Stockton family. The sale was subject to the condition that Morven would be given to the state of New Jersey within two years of Edge's death. Edge transferred ownership of Morven to the state during 1954, several years before he died."
Morven served as the New Jersey's first governor's mansion from 1944 until 1981.

"King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC, ; ) is a megaproject announced in 2005 by king Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the then-king of Saudi Arabia."
"With a total development area of 173 km² (66.8 sq mi), the city is located along the coast of the Red Sea, around 100 km north of Jeddah, the commercial hub of Saudi Arabia. The city is also approximately an hour and 20 minutes away from the city of Mecca, 3 hours from Medina by car and an hour away from all Middle Eastern capital cities by plane."
"The total cost of the city is around SR 207 billion, with the project being built by Emaar Properties. A Tadawul-listed company created from Emaar Properties, a Dubai-based public joint stock company and one of the world’s largest real estate companies, and SAGIA (Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority) which is the main facilitator of the project."
"The city, along with another five economic cities, is a part of an ambitious ""10x10"" program to place Saudi Arabia among the world's top ten competitive investment destinations by the year 2010, planned by SAGIA. The first stage of the city is completed in 2010 and the whole city is planned to be fully completed by 2020. The city aims to diversify the nation's oil-based economy by bringing direct foreign and domestic investments. The city is also aspires to help create up to one million jobs. Upon completion, KAEC is said to be larger than Washington DC."
It is being built along with 4 new cities in Saudi Arabia to control sprawl and congestion in existing cities.
"The city is divided into six main components: Industrial Zone, Sea Port, Residential Areas, Sea Resort, Educational Zone, and a Central Business District (CBD) which includes the Financial Island."
"The industrial zone is estimated to cover 63 km², of land will be dedicated to industrial and light manufacturing facilities—identified as key growth drivers for the Saudi economy—and can now host 2,700 industrial tenants. The jobs created estimated to be in industrial and light industries (330,000); research and development (150,000); business and office (200,000); services (115,000); hospitality (60,000) and education and community services (145,000). The ""Plastics Valley"" planned within the zone will use raw materials readily available in Saudi Arabia to produce high-end plastics used in automotive, biomedical, construction and food packaging industries. As of April 2016, 127 companies signed contracts to build and operate factories in the city."

"King Abdullah Port is estimated to cover 17 square kilometers, it will be the largest in the region with a capacity of over TEU|20 million of containers per year. The first concession was given to National Container Terminal (NCT) and the operator is currently operating on four container berths. The port will have facilities to handle cargo and dry bulk, and will be equipped to receive the world’s largest vessels notably with its state-of-the-art Ship-to-shore cranes able to handle 25 containers across and the deepest draft in the region -18m. The port is the kingdom's first to be owned and funded by the private sector. The port serves as a linking passage between three continents, Asia, Africa and Europe. The port is considered an important part in the transportation network that connects between the contents and delivers goods to around 400 million people in the Middle East."
"In 2018, King Abdullah Port at KAEC had ranked second among the world’s fastest-growing ports."
"The residential area is planned to include 260,000 apartments and 56,000 villas. It will be divided into smaller residential, commercial, and recreational areas. Parks and green spaces will be used extensively throughout the residential area. The area is estimated to be home for around half a million residents, and another ten thousand tourists. Each district would feature its own public amenities, such as mosques, shops and recreational venues."
"The Resorts Area will be designed to feature services and amenities, hoping to draw both local and international tourists. Set to become a major destination on the map of Saudi Arabia and the map of the Middle East as a whole. It will include hotels, shopping centers and other recreational facilities. The number of hotel rooms and suites are proposed to be 25,000 hotel rooms in more than 120 hotels. Among the tourist draws at the resort is an 18-hole golf course, with training facilities and driving range. An equestrian club, yacht club and a range of water sports will also be constructed."
"The Educational Zone is a part of plan to bring the Saudis capabilities and aspirations in technology to globally competitive levels. The Educational Zone is planned to consist of multi-university campus flanked by two Research & Development parks. The multi-university campus is designed to accommodate 18,000 students, and a 7,500 faculty and staff members."
"The central business district (CBD) is planned to offer 3.8 km² of office space, hotels and mixed-use commercial space. The Financial Island, within the CBD, has now been doubled in area to cover 14 hectares (35 ac) of land, which will be the largest regional financial nerve center for the world’s leading banks, investment houses and insurance groups."
"A common Renaissance and Baroque theme is females that are abducted or seduced by divinities. This includes Leda and the swan as Zeus, as well as Europa, Antiope, and Danae. Many portrayals of women being seduced by divinities are shown in a sensual manner. For instance, Rubens's ""Leda"", is very erotic. Leda is shown fully nude with her buttocks and left breast being visible. The swan is caressing her on her most intimate area with its neck cradled between her breasts. The swan is depicted as a graceful animal who also can ravish."
"There are many variations to the myth of Leda and the swan. Leda is sometimes called Nemesis and other times they are two separate people. Leda was married to the king of Sparta, Tyndareus. She is the mother of several children though she is most known for giving birth to Clytemnestra, Helen, Pollux, and Castor. The most common myth claims that Zeus transformed himself into a swan to couple with Leda. Some versions claim that she loved Zeus and willing had sexual relations with him, while other versions claim she was seduced and therefore was not willing. That same night, she coupled with Tyndareus also. Leda then gave birth to four children at the same time. The two pairs of twins resulted in Helen and Pollux belonging to Zeus, and Clytemnestra and Castor belonging to Tyndareus. Though each pair is attributed to either Zeus or Tyndareus, each man is said to be the father of all four children. Castor and Pollux were called the Dioscuri meaning “Zeus’s sons,” even though Castor was mortal because he was the son of Tyndareus and Pollux was immortal because he was the son of Zeus."
"According to Hermes in Lucians’ ""The Dialogues of the Dead"", Leda and her daughter (Helen of Troy) are the only women worthy of the title “beauties of old.” Rubens's depictions of Leda clearly embody the phrase. With Leda's curvy figure, alabaster skin, and golden hair, she is a sight to behold. Because Rubens was known for this type of female figures, Leda was the perfect subject to paint. Rubens became famous partly for his Rubenesque figures and were not common at the time, making his two ""Leda’s"" stand out even more."

"Control Center (or Control Centre in some countries) is a feature of Apple Inc.'s iOS operating system, introduced as part of iOS 7, released on September 18, 2013. It gives iOS devices direct access to important settings for the device by swiping a finger up from the bottom of the display (or a swipe down from the top right corner on iPhone X, XS and XR series and iPad devices). It is similar to the SBSettings tweak for iOS jailbreaking."
"Control Center gives iOS users quick access to commonly used controls and apps. By swiping up from any screen – including the Lock screen (if the control center is set to be accessed from the lock screen) – users can do such things as switch on Airplane mode, turn Wi-Fi on or off, adjust the display brightness and similar basic functions of the device."
"Since iOS 7, it also included an integrated flashlight function to operate the reverse camera's flash LED as a flashlight. The flashlight feature is only available on iPhone and iPod Touch, and iPad Pro. Beginning with iOS 9.3, a Night Shift toggle became available through the Control Center on all iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad models that have an Apple A7 chip or later."
"Other functions are offered, such as the ability to turn Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb on or off; lock the screen's orientation; play, pause, or skip a song, see what is playing; connect to AirPlay-enabled devices; and quickly access the clock, calculator, and camera apps. Users also have access to AirDrop, previously only available on Macs and newly added to iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch models using the Lightning connector in iOS 7, as a method of transferring files between Apple devices."
"In iOS 7 through iOS 9, it featured a single-paged slide up panel with a blurred background, which provided a layer of translucency over the content below. The design for the most part remained the same, aside from a few small, occasional changes. Due to the intense resources needed to create a blurred effect, iPhone 4, iPad 2 and iPad 3 do not feature a translucent background, and instead feature a grey background with slight transparency without blur."
"In iOS 10, it morphed into a card-like design with a white background, and separated into three separate cards accessible by swiping horizontally. The first card consisted of main device controls, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb, while the second page was dedicated to media controls, and the third page for controlling HomeKit enabled devices linked in the Home application."
"The Control Center received a significant redesign in iOS 11, unifying its different pages into one and allowing users to 3D Touch (or long press on devices without 3D Touch) the icons for additional options, and vertical sliders allow users to adjust volume and brightness. The Control Center is customizable via the Settings app, and allows for a wider range of settings features to be shown, including cellular service, Low Power Mode, and a shortcut to the Notes app. These changes are still present in the current stable release of iOS 12."
"iOS 12 brought few new additions to Control Center, but of them, the most notable being updates to Do Not Disturb. Now, when users 3D Touch, or long press the Do Not Disturb icon, it allows them to automatically set when a Do Not Disturb session will end. Current options include setting it to turn off after one hour, when leaving your current location, the next morning, or when a calendar event ends."
"Control Center has received generally positive reviews. In contrast for the user having to access the Settings application to change most preferences, Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch thought that ""separating [Control Center] from that function and making it accessible throughout the iOS user interface via a simple swipe up from bottom is a really big improvement."""
"The iOS 11 update was criticized for changing the way the buttons for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work; more specifically, the toggles would disconnect devices from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, while leaving the radios on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation stated that this change not only hurt battery life, but was also bad for security, describing the buttons as turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ""off-ish"" (greyed out, but not crossed out, as it would appear if switched off directly from the Settings app), as well as further criticizing the connections resuming at 5:00 am everyday."

"The ashy-gray tube-nosed bat (""Murina cineracea"") , is a species in the vesper bat family Vespertilionidae, found in southern Asia, including Pakistan, northern India, Burma, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. They have tube-shaped nostrils (hence the name) which assist them with their feeding."
"The ashy-gray bat is one of 126 new species found in the Greater Mekong region during 2011. There were two other tube-nosed bats found in Southeast Asia in 2011: Beelzebub's tube-nosed bat (""Murina beelzebub"") and Walston's tube-nosed bat (""Murina walstoni""). All three species are small for bats and ""M. cineracea"" is small for a ""Murina"" bat. These three new tube-nosed bats were discovered by a team from the Hungarian Natural History Museum (HNHM) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI). All three of these bats live in tropical forests, making them endangered by deforestation."
"The name ""ashy-gray"" comes from the color of their dorsal fur, while the ventral fur is dark gray, and there is some white fur on the breast area. In some areas the tips of the hair are dark. It lacks the golden guard hairs so common in other members of the genus ""Murina"". This bat is small enough to fit in a person's hand, weighing . As of 2013, there are still few details known about them and their ecology and it is suspected there are many more species of bats yet to be discovered in the region."
"Vespertilionid bats have many cryptic species. As an example, the members of the ashy-gray bat were formerly classified as Scully's tube-nosed bat (""Murina tubinaris""). Eight new species were found in Southeast Asia between 2005-2009. The use of DNA technology has proved very useful in differentiating between the various species of ""Murina""."

"Unlike the communities of Altenburg, Frohna and Uniontown that were settled by Saxon Lutherans from Germany, Friedenberg was founded in 1838 by Lutheran immigrants from Bavaria, Germany. These Bavarians came from the Upper Franconian region, some from the city of Langenstadt near present-day Kulmbach. These immigrants worshiped in members’ homes until a log church was built in 1846 north of Cinque Hommes Creek. From 1852 until 1885 the congregation worshiped at their church on Frankenberg overlooking the Cinque Hommes Bottoms. In 1885 the congregation moved to its present site in Friedenberg and built a brick church. Peace Lutheran church disbanded in 1980."

Construction, operation and maintenance of the line is contracted to the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium."
"Passenger services between Circular Quay and Randwick, known as the L2 Randwick Line, commenced on 14 December 2019, while services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford, known as the L3 Kingsford Line, are expected to commence in March 2020."
"Since the light rail network's original line opened in 1997, a line through the Sydney central business district had been suggested numerous times but failed to achieve State Government support. This changed in February 2010 when the Keneally Government announced a new line from Haymarket to Circular Quay via Barangaroo. The final route was not decided, with the three options being to send the line north via George Street, Sussex Street or a loop using both."
"When the O'Farrell Government took office in March 2011, it committed to building a line through the CBD to Barangaroo, with a preferred route along George Street. It also committed to conducting feasibility studies into the construction of lines from the City to Sydney University and the City to the University of New South Wales. On 8 December 2011, the government announced shortlisted potential routes for these extensions. In 2012, Transport for NSW (TfNSW) decided the routes to Sydney University and Barangaroo via The Rocks provided fewer customer benefits and were considered a lower priority. A route from Circular Quay to the University of New South Wales via Central station was seen as the best option."
"On 13 December 2012, the government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion line from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade with branches to Kingsford and Randwick. Construction was expected to begin in 2014 and to take five to six years."
The line services areas that were previously served by Sydney's former tram network. Some of the new route follows tram lines of the former network.
The route is mostly on-street but includes an off-street section through Moore Park. The only major engineering works on the line were a new bridge over the Eastern Distributor and a tunnel under Moore Park and Anzac Parade. There will be between eight and ten new traffic light controlled intersections created along the route.
"Several changes to the design were announced in December 2014. The major changes involve revising platform lengths at all stops to support an increase in the length of the trams from 45 metres to 67 metres, redesigning several stops, switching technologies for the delivery of the wire-free section and the removal of a proposed stop at World Square. It was also announced that the projected cost had increased from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion. The government claimed the increase was due to the design modifications, but a 2016 report produced by the Audit Office of New South Wales found that the increase was largely due to TfNSW underestimating the cost of the project."
"A pedestrian zone was established along approximately 40% of George Street, between Bathurst and Hunter Streets."
"The section between Bathurst Street and Circular Quay is wire-free, with trams using Alstom's proprietary ground-level power supply technology to run instead. This was originally to have been achieved by equipping the trams with batteries and providing recharging facilities at stops."
"The line is designed to handle special events in the Moore Park precinct and at Randwick Racecourse. Events at Moore Park were initially planned to be served using two coupled trams long, with double length platforms at the Central Station and Moore Park stops. Following the decision to make all tram vehicles operate in coupled pairs with a total length of , the plans to build double length platforms at Central and Moore Park were abandoned, and platforms of all stops will be long."
"A depot for the trams was built at the north-western corner of Randwick Racecourse, providing stabling facilities and allowing light maintenance. Heavy maintenance will be conducted at the Lilyfield Maintenance Depot at the site of the former Rozelle Yard. The maintenance depot will be accessed via the Inner West Light Rail."
"The line was built as a public-private partnership (PPP), with the contract covering detailed design, major construction, operation and maintenance of the line as well as the provision of rolling stock. A contract for early construction works was awarded to Laing O'Rourke in July 2014."
"In February 2014, three consortia were short listed for the main contract – covering the construction and operation of the line:"
The iLinQ consortium withdrew after Balfour Beatty pulled out. Balfour Beatty was reportedly concerned about cost overruns for the project and falling profitability of the company as a whole.
"At ""HM"", Sarah Brehm said that ""Restart is packed with tracks that compete with the quality of today's current mainstream pop music, and the lyrics are much more positive, encouraging and wholesome than what is on the radio"", and that ""unlike their previous albums as it's packed with electrifying beats rivaling radio pop music."" Sarah Fine at New Release Tuesday wrote that this release was different from any of their past albums, yet stated that ""The production quality is nearly flawless, and lyrically, working with some of the best songwriters in the industry shows in the quality of the work. While the lyrics take the band to a whole new level, the group's journey into uncharted sonic waters is the real game changer."" At Jesus Freak Hideout, Mark Rice added that ""It is no great secret that Tait's Boys have been progressively getting more poppy and electronic, but I could never have seen it coming for the Newsboys to venture into the realm of dubstep."""
"At Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre wrote that the release was ""Full of powerful lyrics, infectious enthusiasm and pop-dance melodies that are new, fresh and invigorating, the band are able to deliver 16 songs full of intensity, hopefulness, encouragement and powerful truths directly from Scripture."" Dave Wood of Louder Than the Music said that ""This is the new style of modern worship, taken outside of the four walls of the church, and served up on an accessible plate that a secular-influenced generation will enjoy."" At Christian Music Zine, Emily Kjonaas wrote that ""The new-era Newsboys have rediscovered, and solidified, their sound and you can hear it in ""Restart""."" Daniel Edgeman of Christian Music Review wrote that the album was ""filled with how great our God and many other aspects of our Father."" At ""Worship Leader"", Randy Cross stated that ""This isn't just fun music, but lyrics that drive home the purpose that we as Christians embrace"", yet told that ""The musical style of the first four songs is very similar."""
"""Restart"" garnered acclaim from music critics. Sarah Brehm felt the release ""will be a contender for best pop album of the year in the CCM market."" Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms wrote that ""Wherever you look you'll find cleverly conceived, expertly executed and, most important, spiritually uplifting pop music,"" with the Newsboys ""clearly still a brand leader."" Roger Gelwicks stated that """"Restart"" is the best the Newsboys have ever sounded"" and being ""Comfortable in their own shoes and daring enough to stay interesting, the Newsboys are still a force to be reckoned with, and ""Restart"" is proof."" Mark Rice of Jesus Freak Hideout felt that ""There is lots of good to say about this album, a lot of it being simply a full album of original, fully Christ-centered material made by some excellent musicians."" At ""Worship Leader"", Randy Cross added that """"Restart"" is a wonderful album from start to finish. It's electronica start only reinforces the more reflective songs that follow and creates a great balance overall."" However, Cross noted that ""While this beautifully sets up the more acoustic leaning songs, it may feel repetitive to the casual listener."""
"At New Release Tuesday, Sarah Fine wrote that this was the band ""at the top of their game"". CM Addict's Julia Kitzing wrote that the band ""never looked back and their albums just keep getting better."" At Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre found this to be ""such a powerful and compelling album"". Dave Wood at Louder Than the Music wrote that he ""really did grow to love it."" At Christian Music Zine, Emily Kjonaas rated the album a 3.25-out-of-five, and felt that because """"Restart"" comes at a time where computerized, auto-tuned music seems to be popular among the mainstream industry"" the release may become ""popular amongst that crowd."" However, she noted that ""Newsboys fans may not find this record enjoyable, but Tait-led fans will enjoy ""Restart""."" On the other hand, Daniel Edgeman at Christian Music Review called this a ""stand out album."" At ""CCM Magazine"", Matt Conner wrote that ""Electronic dance music is here to stay and clearly so are the Newsboys."" DeWayne Hamby, reviewing the album for ""Charisma"", called it ""a new collection of pop-flavored tracks""."
"For the ""Billboard"" charting week of 28 September 2013, ""Restart"" was the No. 38 most-sold album in the entirety of the United States by the ""Billboard"" 200 and it was the No. 1 Top Christian Album as well."

With a coverage area of and serving a population of 39,843, the PFD consists of 92 career personnel, split among five fire stations."
"Prior to 1884, Prescott had no water system for fire protection. Wells were sunk at the four corners of the courthouse plaza and double acting hand pumps were installed. In 1884 the water system was installed and the Prescott Volunteer Fire Department was started with a single hose company using a two-wheeled cart hand drawn with of hose. In 1954 the then four separate volunteer companies were merged into one and named Prescott Fire Department."
"The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008. The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed. The 2017 film ""Only the Brave"" was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire."
"On June 30, 2013, 19 members of the 20-man group died fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire. Only Brendan McDonough survived. The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters, but not all of the bodies were found inside them. According to the National Fire Protection Association, it was the greatest loss of life for firefighters in a wildfire since 1933, the deadliest wildfire of any kind since 1991, and the greatest loss of firefighters in the United States since the September 11 attacks. Vice President Joe Biden attended the memorial and stated, ""All men are created equal. But then, a few became firefighters."""

"Odette Valery (spelled Valéry in French publications), née Helene Vasilardi, (1883–?) was an Italian dancer of Greek parentage. She made her début at La Scala in 1898 at the age of fifteen. She moved to Paris where she danced with the Ballet Excelsior at the Folies Bergère. She came to regard dancing ""en pointe"" as ""old-fashioned"" and made her name doing reconstructions of ancient Greek dances in bare feet. Later she portrayed Cleopatra and did an Egyptian dance with a live asp. She was well-educated and spoke French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as some English and she played the piano well. In 1908, she caused a sensation in New York when she danced in the last act of ""Samson and Delilah"" at the Manhattan Opera House where she had been engaged by Oscar Hammerstein I. Her dance included the participation of one of three snakes (with fangs removed) which were cared for by their own groom, Robert, whom she had engaged in addition to other servants who travelled with her. In 1910 she was earning $1000 a week when dancing in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. She owned several automobiles and amassed a fortune in jewellery. She spent lavishly and by 1912, she was destitute. Her money ran out when she had to have an operation and as a result she could not work for an extended period. Although her weekly salary was what a workman earned in a year at the time, she hadn't saved a penny. She was found ill and starving in a cheap boarding house in Notting Hill, London where she was being cared for by her seven-year-old son Gaeton. She had been surviving thus for a year by pawning her jewellery. She was found by a friend who was performing at Hammerstein's London Opera House. The friend took her in and was planning to send her back to her home in France to recover. She returned to Paris and although she was reputed to have had twenty-eight love affairs in one year at the height of her fame, she had few real friends and continued to live in poverty. It was a California heiress, Mrs. Jackson Gouraud, who came to her aid on reading about her plight and gave a fund-raising ball in her honour at Martin's, New York.

Law enforcement in Illinois is complex with many overlapping jurisdictions related to the administrative divisions of Illinois.
"At the state level, there are at least eleven law enforcement agencies. At the county level, there are sheriffs, forest preserve police and other specialized police forces. At the local level, most cities and many villages have municipal police forces, park district police forces, and even local specialized police forces. Many colleges also have their own campus police that are often sworn police officers."
"In 2000, Illinois was ranked 4th in the U.S. in the number of full-time sworn officers with 321 per 100,000 persons, behind Louisiana (415), New York (384), and New Jersey (345). In this ranking, only New York had a higher total population than Illinois. Illinois is also near the top of most law enforcement numbers lists, such as number of agencies per state, number of agencies with special jurisdictions, and number of local police agencies. Even taking into account that Illinois is the fifth most populous state, many of the ratios are higher than more populated states."

= = = Nanosheet = = =
A nanosheet is a two-dimensional nanostructure with thickness in a scale ranging from 1 to 100 nm.
"A typical example of a nanosheet is graphene, the thinnest two-dimensional material (0.34 nm) in the world. It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms with hexagonal lattices."
Silicon nanosheets are being used to prototype future generations of small (5 nm) transistors.
Carbon nanosheets (from hemp) may be an alternative to graphene as electrodes in supercapacitors.
"The most commonly used nanosheet synthesis methods use a bottom-up approach, e.g., pre-organization and polymerization at interfaces like Langmuir–Blodgett films, solution phase synthesis and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, CdTe (cadmium telluride) nanosheets could be synthesized by precipitating and aging CdTe nanoparticles in deionized water. The formation of free-floating CdTe nanosheets was due to directional hydrophobic attraction and anisotropic electrostatic interactions caused by dipole moment and small positive charges. Molecular simulations through a coarse-grained model with parameters from semi-empirical quantum mechanics calculations can be used to prove the experimental process."
"Ultrathin single-crystal PbS (lead sulfur) sheets with micro scale in x-, y- dimensions can be obtained using a hot colloidal synthesis method. Compounds with linear chloroalkanes like 1,2-dichloroethane containing chlorine were used during the formation of PbS sheets. PbS ultrathin sheets probably resulted from the oriented attachment of the PbS nanoparticles in a two-dimensional fashion. The highly reactive facets were preferentially consumed in the growth process that led to the sheet-like PbS crystal growth."
"Nanosheets can also be prepared at room temperature. For instance, hexagonal PbO (lead oxide)) nanosheets were synthesized using gold nanoparticles as seeds under room temperature. The size of the PbO nanosheet can be tuned by gold NPs and concentration in the growth solution. No organic surfactants were employed in the synthesis process. Oriented attachment, in which the sheets form by aggregation of small nanoparticles that each has a net dipole moment, and ostwald ripening are the two main reasons for the formation of the PbO nanosheets. The same process was observed for iron sulfide nanoparticles."
Carbon nanosheets have been produced using industrial hemp bast fibres with a technique that involves heating the fibres at over 350F (180C) for 24 hours. The result is then subjected to intense heat causing the fibers to exfoliate into a carbon nanosheet. This has been used to create an electrode for a supercapacitor with electrochemical qualities ‘on a par with’ devices made using graphene.
"Metal nanosheets have also been synthesized from solution-based method by reducing metal precursors, including palladium, rhodium, and gold."

"A cake was made which was called Soddag Valloo or Dumb Cake, because it was made and eaten in silence. Young women and girls all had a hand in baking it on the red embers of the hearth, first helping to mix the ingredients (flour, eggs, eggshells, soot and salt) and kneading the dough. The cake was divided up and eaten in silence and, still without speaking, all who had eaten it went to bed, walking backwards, expecting and hoping to see their future husband in a dream or vision. The future husband was expected to appear in the dream and offer a drink of water."
"Other means of divination was to steal a salt herring from a neighbour, roast it over the fire, eat it in silence and retire to bed; or to hold a mouthful of water in your mouth and a pinch of salt in each hand as you listen to a neighbour's conversation, whereupon the first name mentioned would be that of your future spouse."

"""Jinnie the Witch"" is a modern Manx English song, which was sung around the Douglas area."
"According to Hampton Creer, Jinny's real name was Joney Lowney. She lived in Braddan and was tried at Bishop's Court for witchcraft in 1715 and 1716. Her greatest ""crime"" was stopping the Ballaughton Corn Mill. She was sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment, fined £3 and made to stand at the four market crosses dressed in sackcloth."
The modern song goes as follows :
"In the west of the island a longer version was sung, which is more closely related to the Manx version."
"The following version dates from the 1930s – a similar version is recorded in ""A Vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx Dialect"" by A. W. Moore, Sophia Morrison and Edmund Goodwin (1924):"
"The 1970s southern version from Castletown includes the mention of the Witches Mill, the Smelt Monument and the Old House of Keys:"

= = = Coleophoridae = = =
"The Coleophoridae are a family of small moths, belonging to the huge superfamily Gelechioidea. Collectively known as case-bearers, casebearing moths or case moths, this family is represented on all continents, but the majority are found in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. They are most common in the Palearctic, and rare in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Australia; consequently, they probably originated (like most or all other Gelechioidea families) in northern Eurasia. They are relatively common in houses, they seek out moist areas to rest and procreate."
"These ""micromoths"" are generally of slender build, and like in many of their relatives, the margins of their wings usually consist of a ""fringe"" of hairs. The tiny caterpillar larvae initially feed internally on the leaves, flowers, or seeds of their host plants. When they emerge to feed externally, they usually construct a protective silken case, discarded and built anew as they grow and molt. The common names of the Coleophoridae refer to this habit."
"The bagworm moths (Psychidae), which also belong to the primitive Ditrysia (although to superfamily Tineoidea, not Gelechioidea), build similar cases as larvae. As opposed to these, though, the case-bearer females leave their cases to pupate and have normally developed wings as adults, instead of being neotenous as female bagworms usually are."
"About 95% of the over 1,000 described species have been placed in the ""wastebin genus"" ""Coleophora"". Many proposals have been made to split smaller genera from ""Coleophora"", but few have been accepted, due to the uncertainties about which species are closest to the type species of ""Coleophora"" – ""C. anatipennella"" – and thus would remain in the genus."
"Regarding the family's circumscription versus other Gelechioidea, it is by now far less disputed than usual for this superfamily. The Blastobasidae, Momphidae (mompha moths), Pterolonchidae, and Symmocidae have formerly been included in the Coleophoridae as subfamilies, but are more often considered separate families today. With the internal relationships of Coleophoridae genera (as far as they are widely accepted) and species essentially unresolved due to the classification problems mentioned above, no subfamilies or tribes are accepted in the family for the time being."
Genera of case-bearers at least provisionally accepted by recent authors include:

"TLRC sold Win FM to the Tindle Radio Group in September 2006, and the new owner rebranded the station as Dream 107.2 in October 2007, adopting a soft adult contemporary music policy."
"With extensive competition in the South Hampshire marketplace from numerous regional rivals - including Ocean (now Heart), Wave 105 and Original 106 (now 106 Sam FM) - Dream 107.2 struggled to build an audience, and Tindle Group subsequently decided the station was not viable as a business and should be sold off."
"In November 2008, Tindle Radio Group sold Dream 107.2 to Town & Country Broadcasting, who sought and received permission to largely absorb the Winchester service into their existing Radio Hampshire service at Southampton.

It was the brainchild of County Sound CEO, Mike Powell who successfully lobbied the IBA for permission to put separate programming for the Haslemere district on what was originally intended to be a relay transmitter for Guildford's County Sound. The station was launched by County Sound's Terry Mann, formerly Programme Director of Radio 210, Reading."
"After County Sound merged with Radio Mercury to form Allied Radio, Delta Radio was closed down by its new owners in 1992 and the transmitter went back to being a relay. However, when Mike Powell's UKRD Group won the Guildford licence (after it came up for renewal), Delta Radio was relaunched in 1996. Wey Valley Radio had already been operating as a full-time service in nearby Alton and Four Marks since 1992. This station was launched as a ""community"" station by David Way and Paul Mann after years of campaigning for such a licence. David Way and Paul Wisdom are the new Wey Valley Radio licence holders today. It was acquired by UKRD in 1994."
"The decision to merge the two stations operationally was made in 1998 and the Wey Valley service was renamed Delta, and then in 2000, the Haslemere licence (which had previously been a part of the Surrey and North East Hampshire franchise) was merged with the Alton licence to finally form a single radio station."
"On 28 May 2009, Radio Hampshire ceased broadcasting due to Town & Country Broadcasting deciding to sell the station. On 5 June 2009, the two licences for Radio Hampshire in Southampton and Winchester were acquired by internet station Play Radio UK."
"The new station for Southampton and Winchester, named Play Radio, launched on the 107.2 and 107.8 FM frequencies at 10am on 4 July 2009. As under Radio Hampshire, the station operated a split breakfast programme (one for Southampton and one for Winchester), with all other programming shared across the two frequencies."
"In April 2010, the licences were purchased by Celador Radio Broadcasting for an undisclosed sum."
"It was announced on 21 June 2010 that the service would be relaunched as The Breeze 107. The new station would be aimed at upmarket 40- to 59-year-olds and broadcast classic and contemporary easy listening music with a slight female bias. It was also announced that the station would relocate, leaving its longtime base at St. Mary's Stadium to share facilities with sister regional station Jack FM in the Kingsway area of Southampton."
"Celador subsequently sought and received permission from Ofcom to end the split breakfast programme, meaning that as of the Breeze relaunch, listeners in Southampton and Winchester were receiving identical programming at all times."

"Erta Ale (or Ertale or Irta'ale) is a continuously active basaltic shield volcano in the Afar Region of northeastern Ethiopia. It is situated in the Afar Depression, a badland desert area. Erta Ale is the most active volcano in Ethiopia."
"Erta Ale is high, with one or sometimes two active lava lakes at the summit which occasionally overflow on the south side of the volcano. It is notable for holding the longest-existing lava lake, present since the early years of the twentieth century (1906). Volcanoes with lava lakes are very rare: there are only eight in the world."
"""Erta Ale"" means ""smoking mountain"" in the local Afar language and its southernmost pit is known locally as ""the gateway to Hell"". In 2009, it was mapped by a team from the BBC using three-dimensional laser techniques, in order for the mapping team to maintain a distance and avoid the lakes' searingly hot temperatures."
"Erta Ale is centered over the East African Rift system, which is a triple junction setting whose movements are resulting in the formation of a pull-apart basin or rift. The volcano comprises mainly mafic material which has been brought up to the surface caused by unroofing of the mantle due to this rift formation."
"There was a major eruption on 25 September 2005 which killed 250 head of livestock and forced thousands of nearby residents to flee. There was further lava flow in August 2007, forcing the evacuation of hundreds and leaving two missing. An eruption on 4 November 2008 was reported by scientists at Addis Ababa University. Another eruption was reported in January 2017."
"Not much is known about Erta Ale, and the surrounding terrain is some of the most inhospitable on Earth, making travel difficult and dangerous. The Afar region also experiences intermittent ethnic violence due to unification struggles by the native Afar people. On January 16, 2012, a group of European tourists was attacked at Erta Ale. Five tourists were killed, two taken as hostages and seven others wounded. The Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) claimed responsibility for the attack and released the two kidnapped tourists in March 2012. One travel guide recommends hiring ""one or maybe two armed guards or police"" as guides to visit Erta Ale. Commercial tour companies offer tours to Erta Ale which are generally accompanied by military escort."

She fought Manslaughter as he menaced the team, and then aided the Defenders and the Interloper in battle against fellow Defender Moondragon, and the Dragon of the Moon who was possessing Moondragon. Andromeda sacrificed her life force, joining with Manslaughter, the Valkyrie, and the Interloper to drive the Dragon of the Moon from the Earth, and her body was turned to stone."
"The Dragon would later return, this time without a body. To stop the Dragon of the Moon, Doctor Strange cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of Genevieve Cross and these Defenders now called themselves the Dragon Circle. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans."
"Andromeda played an important part in the 1989 ""Atlantis Attacks"" crossover. Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but was bested by Attuma in personal combat. She was kidnapped unconscious by the Deviant priest Ghaur as one of his ""Seven Brides of Set."" Under Ghaur's domination, she accompanied She-Hulk to acquire a piece of Set's life force. In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom thanks to the Fantastic Four and Avengers."
"Andromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived Deep Six, a group of underwater heroes. During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve's. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor's soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda's body. Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda's body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma's own Deep Six. Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis."
Andromeda later appears as a member of Namor's Defenders of the Deep.
"Andromeda has all the powers inherent to the ""Homo mermanus"", but her strength and speed are far greater than that of any ordinary ""Homo mermanus"", though not as great as that of her father, Attuma. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant to the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. Her specially-developed vision allows her to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean."
"She can survive only for 10 minutes out of water, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air. Her stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water."
"She has been trained as an Atlantean warrior, and is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice. She carries a short sword and an 8"" dagger as additional weaponry."
Andromeda also has extensive knowledge of biochemistry.
= = = Great Hinckley Fire = = =
"The Great Hinckley Fire was a conflagration in the pine forests of the U.S. state of Minnesota in September 1894, which burned an area of at least (perhaps more than ), including the town of Hinckley. The official death count was 418; the actual number of fatalities was likely higher."
"After a two-month summer drought, combined with very high temperatures, several small fires started in the pine forests of Pine County, Minnesota. The fires' spread apparently was due to the then-common method of lumber harvesting, wherein trees were stripped of their branches in place; these branches littered the ground with flammable debris. Also contributing was a temperature inversion that trapped the gases from the fires. The scattered blazes united into a firestorm. The temperature rose to at least . Barrels of nails melted into one mass, and in the yards of the Eastern Minnesota Railroad, the wheels of the cars fused with the rails. Some residents escaped by climbing into wells, ponds, or the Grindstone River. Others clambered aboard two crowded trains that pulled out of the threatened town minutes ahead of the fire."
"James Root, an engineer on a train heading south from Duluth, rescued nearly 300 people by backing up a train nearly five miles to Skunk Lake, where the passengers escaped the fire. William Best was an engineer on a train sent specifically to evacuate people."
According to the Hinckley Fire Museum:
"Because of the dryness of the summer, fires were common in the woods, along railroad tracks and in logging camps where loggers would set fire to their slash to clean up the area before moving on. Some loggers, of course left their debris behind, giving any fire more fuel on which to grow. Saturday, September 1st, 1894 began as another oppressively hot day with fires surrounding the towns and two major fires that were burning about five miles (8 km) to the south. To add to the problem, the temperature inversion that day added to the heat, smoke and gases being held down by the huge layer of cool air above. The two fires managed to join together to make one large fire with flames that licked through the inversion finding the cool air above. That air came rushing down into the fires to create a vortex or tornado of flames which then began to move quickly and grew larger and larger turning into a fierce firestorm. The fire first destroyed the towns of Mission Creek and Brook Park before coming into the town of Hinckley. When it was over the Firestorm had completely destroyed six towns, and over lay black and smoldering. The firestorm was so devastating that it lasted only four hours but destroyed everything in its path."
"The fire destroyed the town of Hinckley (which at the time had a population of over 1,400) as well as the smaller nearby settlements of Mission Creek, Brook Park, Sandstone, Miller, Partridge and Pokegama."
The exact number of fatalities is difficult to determine. The official coroner's report counted 413 dead while the fire's official monument notes 418. An unknown number of Native Americans and backcountry dwellers were also killed in the fire; bodies continued to be found years later. Along with the 1918 Cloquet Fire (where 453 were killed) it is one of the deadliest in Minnesota history.
"Today, a section of the Willard Munger State Trail, from Hinckley to Barnum, is a memorial to the fire and the devastation it caused. In the town of Hinckley, on Highway 61, the Hinckley Fire Museum is located in the former Northern Pacific Railway depot. It is located a few feet north of the former depot, which burned down in the fire. It is open from May 1 until the end of October."
Lutheran Memorial Cemetery in Hinckley has a historical marker and granite obelisk as a memorial to those who perished in the fire. 248 residents of Hinckley perished in the fire and are buried in a mass grave at this cemetery. Some are unidentified.
"The Brook Park Cemetery on County Road 126, south of Minnesota State Highway 23, has an historical marker plaque and a memorial to the 23 fire victims of Brook Park, with a tall obelisk on top of a granite marker."
"Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett, the Union soldier who killed John Wilkes Booth after Booth's assassination of Abraham Lincoln, is presumed to have died in the fire. His last known residence is believed to have been a forest settlement near Hinckley, and a ""Thomas Corbett"" is listed as one of the dead or missing. Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett may not have died in the fire. Thomas Gilbert Corbitt lived in the Town of Thurston, in Steuben County, NY. He was a Civil War veteran in the 50th NY Engineers, Co. E. In late September and early October of 1894, Steuben County newspapers reported that Thomas Corbitt, until recently a resident of Thurston, was burned to death, along with his property, in the great fire at Hinckley, Minn."

"The #19 engine, also known as the ""Lew Brown"", features a propane-fired boiler and has a total weight of 25 tons (engine and tender). Like its older brother engine, the #12, it is a scale replica of The General. The engine is painted green and was originally named Simon Kenton, after a famous Ohio frontiersman."
"Kings Island maintains a total of 12 open air passenger cars, arranged as 6 cars on each engine. 6 of the cars are painted green, and are typically matched with the No. 19 engine. The other 6 cars are painted red, and are matched with the No. 12 engine. Capacity per completed train (6 cars) is 465 park guests. Each passenger car has a series of seals depicting Native American Tecumseh and frontiersman Simon Kenton (after whom the engines were originally named) with the railroad name."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad features two train stations. Losantiville station is considered the line's main station, and is located in the Rivertown section of the park, next to the entrance of White Water Canyon and Mystic Timbers. It is a covered station and platform. There is also a station located at the entrance to Soak City Water park, which is an uncovered concrete pad station that, unlike the Losantiville station, is a curved station."
"Each train is manned by a total of four associates; an Engineer, Fireman, Front Conductor, and Back Conductor (position of back conductor may be eliminated with the operation of a scaled down train of three passenger cars, rather than the regular six). The Engineer is in charge of the operation of the locomotive, while the Fireman watches over the boiler pressure levels, and maintains the fire and water levels in the boiler. The Front Conductor is in the charge of the movement of the train, as well as the entertainment and wellbeing of the passengers aboard. Additionally, each station must be manned by a Station Master who is responsible for the safety of passengers in the station, helping passengers load and unload, as well as keeping capacity."
"Each morning, the train crew (Engineer and Fireman) prepare the engines for operation at the engine house, located near the Losantiville station. Once the first train of the morning reaches the Losantiville station, the front conductor and back conductor board the train. Once the train is staffed completely, the train must do a full test cycle around the track before passengers can be loaded. During the morning hours, only one engine is in service. Midway through the day, the second train is brought into operation. Opening procedures for the train brought out second differ slightly, in that the front and back conductors board the train in the engine house, rather than at the Losantiville station."
"The Front Conductor is in charge of the movement of the train. During a normal passenger loading procedure, the station master must clear the station platform with a thumbs up signal, at which point the Back Conductor must clear the Front Conductor for movement with a hand signal known as a ""Highball"". Once the Front Conductor verifies the Highball from the Back Conductor and the clear from the Station Master, the Front Conductor will ""Highball"" the Engineer, who then proceeds with operation of the locomotive. ""Highball"" hand signals are also given at two locations along the train route, between the Front and Back Conductor, to signal that everything is clear on all six passenger cars."
"After the water park closes, the park resumes one-train operation for the rest of the night. The last train leaves at park closing and backs the train into the locomotive garage (engine house). After the last cycle has completed for the night, the Engineer and Fireman proceed to back the other train into the engine house from the Losantiville station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad has some private grade crossings for the private roads where the workers go on. The private grade crossings have one or two crossbucks. There is also a public grade crossing that has four railroad crossing signals, two gated signals with bells and lights for the public path and two gateless signals with just lights for the private road. This crossing is right next to the Soak City station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad operates during the entire season. Throughout most of the season, it entertains guests and serves as transportation to and from Soak City. During the park's annual Halloween Haunt event, which occurs on weekend nights in September and October, it was transformed into a haunted maze known as ""Tombstone Terror-Tory"". The attraction had a western-theme and utilized the exit path of White Water Canyon. When Kings Island began construction of Mystic Timbers in 2016, the exit path was shortened significantly, and Tombstone Terror-Tory was removed from the Halloween Haunt lineup."

"The Galwan River flows from the disputed Aksai Chin region in southern Hotan County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang of China to Ladakh of India. It originates in the area of Samzungling on the eastern side of the Karakoram range and flows west to join the Shyok River at . It is one of the upstream tributaries of the Indus River."
"The river is named after Ghulam Rasool Galwan, a Ladakhi explorer from Leh, who first explored the course of the river. In 1899, he was part of a British expedition team that was exploring the areas to the north of the Chang Chenmo valley, when ran into this previously unknown river valley. Harish Kapadia states that this is one of the rare instances where a major geographical feature is named after a native explorer."
"The river's length is about 80 kilometers, and it is fast-flowing."
"The Galwan river is to the west of China's 1956 claim line in Aksai Chin. However, in 1960 China advanced its claim line to the west of the river along the mountain ridge adjoining the Shyok river valley. Meanwhile, India continued to claim the entire Aksai Chin plateau."
"These claims and counterclaims led to a military standoff in the Galwan River valley in 1962. On 4 July, a platoon of Indian Gorkha troops set up a post in the upper reaches of the valley. The post ended up cutting the lines of communication to a Chinese post at Samzungling. The Chinese interpreted it as a premeditated attack on their post, and surrounded the Indian post, coming within 100 yards of the post. The Indian government warned China of ""grave consequences"" and informed them that India was determined to hold the post at all costs. The post remained surrounded for four months and was supplied by helicopters. According to scholar Taylor Fravel, the standoff marked the ""apogee of tension"" for China's leaders."
"By the time the Sino-Indian War started on the 20 October 1962, the Indian post had been reinforced by a company of troops. The Chinese PLA bombarded it with heavy shelling and employed a battalion to attack the post. The Indians suffered 33 killed and several wounded, and the company commander and several others were taken prisoner. By the end of the war, China reached its 1960 claim line."

= = = Russian cruiser Vladimir Monomakh = = =
"Vladimir Monomakh () was an armoured cruiser built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the 1880s. The vessel was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev. She spent most of her career in the Far East, although the ship was in the Baltic Sea when the Russo-Japanese War began in 1904. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron and participated in the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. She was tasked to protect the Russian transports and was not heavily engaged during the daylight portion of the battle. The ship was torpedoed during the night and was scuttled the following morning by her captain to prevent her capture by the Japanese."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was classified as a semi-armored frigate and was an improved version of the preceding . The ship was designed with high endurance and high speed to facilitate her role as a commerce raider able to outrun enemy battleships. She was laid out as a central battery ironclad with the armament concentrated amidships. The iron-hulled ship was fitted with a ram and was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling. The ship's hull was subdivided by ten transverse bulkheads and she had a double bottom deep. Her crew numbered approximately 550 officers and men. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced at deep load."
"The ship had two vertical compound steam engines, each driving a four-bladed, manganese-bronze propeller. Steam was provided by six cylindrical boilers at a pressure of . The engines produced during sea trials which gave the ship a maximum speed around . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" carried of coal which gave her an economical range of at a speed of . She was ship rigged with three masts and had a total sail area of . To reduce drag while under sail, her funnels were retractable."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was armed with four guns, one at each corner of the battery that were sponsoned out over the sides of the hull. Eight of the dozen guns were mounted between the eight-inch guns in the central battery and the remaining four were outside the battery at the ends of the ship. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by four 9-pounder and ten Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with three above-water torpedo tubes."
"The ship's waterline belt was composed of compound armour and extended the full length of the ship. It was six inches thick amidships, but reduced to at the ship's ends. It extended above the waterline and below. Transverse bulkheads thick protected the guns in the battery from raking fire. The sponsons of the 8-inch guns were equally thick. The protective deck was thick."
"Construction began on ""Vladimir Monomakh"" on 22 February 1881 at the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May. She was launched on 22 October 1882 and completed on 13 July 1883. The ship's total cost was 3,348,847 rubles. Although the second vessel to be laid down in the ""Dmitri Donskoy"" class, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was completed first. Due to constant changes during construction, the design of both vessels diverged considerably by the time of completion. The ship was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev."
"On 11 October 1884, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" began a leisurely voyage from the Baltic Sea to the Far East. She made port visits in Kristiansand, Norway and Portland Harbour, England before reaching Malta on 25 November. The ship spent most of the next six weeks in Greek waters before arriving at Port Said, Egypt on 12 January 1885 to transit the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" encountered the British ironclad battleship there and was followed by her all the way to Japan as tensions were rising between Great Britain and Russia in early 1885. The ship arrived in Nagasaki in March 1885 and was appointed flagship of the Russian Pacific Fleet under Rear Admiral A.E. Kroun. Based out of Vladivostok, she normally wintered in warmer waters. For example, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" visited Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong, Batavia, Dutch East Indies and Penang Island between November 1885 and March 1886. She returned to Kronstadt in 1887 and was refitted in 1888."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" departed Kronstadt for the Mediterranean on 6 November 1889 where she remained for the next year. She joined the official escort for the Tsarevich Nicholas II’s visit to the Far East. The Tsarevich travelled aboard the and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" provided protection. The two ships reached Singapore on 2 March 1891, and reached Vladivostok on 23 May. Once at Vladivostok, Captain Oskar Stark was appointed commander of the ship and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was overhauled through August. She wintered over again at Nagasaki, departing for Europe on 23 April 1892 and reached Kronstadt in August, where the ship was given a thorough refit beginning on 22 September. The heavy sailing rig was replaced by three signal masts, her funnels were fixed in place, and her boilers were also upgraded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was reclassified as a 1st Class Cruiser on 13 February 1892."
"On 2 October 1894 the ship, now under the command of Captain Zinovy Rozhestvensky, was ordered back to the Mediterranean. In view of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, the Council of Ministers ordered on 1 February 1895 that the Mediterranean Squadron reinforce the 2nd Pacific Squadron. She reached the Chinese treaty port of Chefoo on 16 April and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, 2nd in command of the Pacific Fleet, on 13 May. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained at Chefoo until late in the year before sailing to Vladivostok and then to Kobe, Japan in January 1896."
The ship only remained there for a short time before she was ordered back to Kronstadt for a major modernization. Her obsolete 8-inch and 6-inch guns were replaced with five new 45-calibre 6-inch and six Canet guns. The ship's six original boilers were replaced by a dozen cylindrical boilers.
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was transferred back to the Pacific Fleet in November 1897 and reached Nagasaki in February 1898. After the Triple Intervention expelled the Japanese from Port Arthur, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was part of the Russian force which subsequently occupied that strategic harbor. In June 1900, she transported troops involved in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. In September 1900, on her return to Port Arthur, she accidentally rammed and sank the merchant vessel ""Crown of Aragon"". In December 1901, she rendezvoused with ""Dmitri Donskoy"" at Hong Kong, and the two ships returned to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained in the Mediterranean until August 1902, and reached Kronstadt in October. In 1903–04 some of her Hotchkiss guns were replaced by ."
"In February 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron, which was sent to reinforce Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky's Second Pacific Squadron. The Third Pacific Squadron transited the Suez Canal and joined the 2nd Pacific Squadron at Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 14 May 1905 where they was assigned to the Cruiser Division commanded by Rear Admiral Oskar Enkvist."
"At the decisive Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was positioned to the right side of the Russian line of battle, guarding the transports and so avoided the pounding that the other vessels of Second Pacific Squadron received, although she engaged the Japanese cruiser . The Japanese ship was hit several times and driven off, but only three crewmen were killed and seven wounded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was hit several times itself and had one 120 mm gun destroyed and its crew killed. The most dangerous hit was a shell that burst over a 6-inch shell hoist and started an ammunition fire. The prompt flooding of the magazine averted an explosion."
"At nightfall, the Japanese torpedo boats engaged the surviving Russian warships and the cruiser claimed to have sunk one of her attackers at 8:25 p.m. ""Vladimir Monomakh"", mistaking one of her attackers for a Russian destroyer, was hit around 8:40 by a single torpedo which ruptured her hull near the No. 2 coal bunker, but sank the torpedo boat. The damage was severe but her crew kept her afloat and her engines operational, although she continued to take on water. The next morning, however, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" headed towards Tsushima Island and began to unload her wounded into her surviving boats. Captain Vladimir Aleksandrovich Popov gave the order to abandon ship, and ordered the seacocks to be opened to scuttle the vessel rather than surrender it to the Japanese. The ship sank at 10:20 a.m. and the crew was captured by the Japanese auxiliary cruisers and . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was officially removed from the navy list on 28 September 1905."

"More than 420 feature-length film versions of Shakespeare's plays have been produced since the early 20th century, making Shakespeare the most filmed author ever. Some of the film adaptations, especially Hollywood movies marketed to teenage audiences, use his plots rather than his dialogue, while others are simply filmed versions of his plays."
"For centuries there had been an accepted style of how Shakespeare was to be performed which was erroneously labeled ""Elizabethan"" but actually reflected a trend of design from a period shortly after Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare's performances were originally performed in contemporary dress. Actors were costumed in clothes that they might wear off the stage. This continued into the 18th century, the Georgian period, where costumes were the current fashionable dress. It was not until centuries after his death, primarily the 19th Century, that productions started looking back and tried to be ""authentic"" to a Shakespearean style. The Victorian era had a fascination with historical accuracy and this was adapted to the stage in order to appeal to the educated middle class. Charles Kean was particularly interested in historical context and spent many hours researching historical dress and setting for his productions. This faux-Shakespearean style was fixed until the 20th century. As of the twenty-first century, there are very few productions of Shakespeare, both on stage and on film, which are still performed in ""authentic"" period dress, while as late as 1990, virtually every true film version of a Shakespeare play was performed in correct period costume. The first film in English to break this pattern was 1995's ""Richard III"" which updated the setting to the 1930s but changed none of Shakespeare's dialogue."

"The Udzungwa Mountains are a mountain range in south-central Tanzania. The mountains are mostly within Iringa Region, south of Tanzania's capital Dodoma. The Udzungwa Mountains are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, and are home to a biodiverse community of flora and fauna with large numbers of endemic species."
"The mountains are home to the Hehe people, and the name Udzungwa comes from the Kihehe word “Wadzungwa"", which means the people who live on mountainsides. Iringa is the largest settlement in the mountains, and the regional headquarters."
"The Undzungwa Mountains cover an area of 16,131.40 km², the largest of the Eastern Arc ranges. The highest peak in the range is Luhombero at . The mountain range extends generally northeast-southwest. The Usangu Plain lies to the northwest, drained by the Great Ruaha River and its tributaries. The Great Ruaha River separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Rubeho Mountains and Uvidunda Mountains to the northeast. The Kilombero River valley lies to the south and southeast. To the southwest the Makambako Gap separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Kipengere Range."
"Both the Great Ruaha and Kilombero rivers are tributaries of the Rufiji River, which empties into the Indian Ocean. The Lukosi River originates in the central part of the range, and empties eastwards into the Great Ruaha. The Little Ruaha River and its tributaries drain much of the western portion of the range, emptying northwards into the Great Ruaha."
"The Udzungwa Mountains intercept moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, and receive more rainfall than the surrounding lowlands. Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and southeastern slopes facing the Indian Ocean, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations."
"The Udzungwa Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west."
"About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as ""islands"" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Udzungwa and other Eastern Arc mountains has extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species). 10 percent of them are protected by the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and the Udzungwa Scarp Nature Forest Reserve."
"The Udzungwa Mountains are covered with lowland rainforest, montane rainforest, miombo woodland, grassland, and heathland. Forests extend from 300 to 2579 meters elevation, and vary in composition and species type with elevation and rainfall. The wetter eastern and southeastern slopes receive more rain from the Indian Ocean and support evergreen forests on the lower slopes; the drier western and northwestern slopes have decidious miombo forests and woodlands at lower elevations and evergreen forests only at higher elevations."
Broad areas of forest on the central plateau have been cleared for agriculture and pasture. An analysis of satellite images taken between 1999 and 2003 found 1353 km² of the mountains were still covered in evergreen forest.
"The mountains are home to many mammals, including Abbott's duiker ""(Cephalophus spadix)"", Kipunji ""(Rungwecebus kipunji)"", and Udzungwa red colobus ""(Cercocebus galeritus)"", and unusual animals such as the grey-faced sengi ""(Rhynchocyon udzungwensis)"". The Udzungwa forest partridge (""Xenoperdix udzungwensis"") is an endemic species, with its closest relatives appearing to be the hill partridges of Asia. Elephants ""(Loxodonta africana)"" are found in the forests along the southern escarpment."
"Although the two mountain groups are ecologically distinct, the Eastern Arc Mountains share many species and plant communities with the Southern Highlands which lie to the southwest across the Makambako Gap. Both are Afromontane regions, home to characteristic montane species and ecologically distinct from the adjacent lowlands. The Southern Highlands' climate is more influenced by Lake Malawi than by the Indian Ocean. Some limited-range montane species, including the Kipunji and Kipengere seedeater ""(Crithagra melanochrous)"", inhabit both the Udzungwa Mountains and the Kipengere Range."
"The Kihansi spray toad ""(Nectophrynoides asperginis)"", which was found only around a waterfall on the Kihansi River, became extinct in the wild in 2009 when an upstream dam altered its habitat. The toads have since been reintroduced after a successful captive breeding program."
"Protected areas include Udzungwa Mountains National Park (2088.69 km²), and Udzungwa Scarp (20,220 ha), Kisinga-Rugaro (14,164 ha) and West Kilombero (c.55,000 ha outside the national park) forest reserves"
"It is possible to visit the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and go hiking and trekking. The park has no roads passable by vehicle and is accessible only by foot. The trekking routes vary, from the short and easy one-hour Sonjo Waterfall hike to the extremely difficult 6 day trek the Lumemo Trail. The most popular route is the Sanje Waterfalls trail, taking about four hours to complete."
"The World Wide Fund for Nature is working with local communities to protect the park and provide conservation and management support, monitoring, research and ecotourism initiatives. The help of the local communities is encouraged by giving them access to resources such as the collection of firewood, harvesting medicinal plants and gathering grass for thatching."
"Tanzania's A104 highway runs from northeast to southwest through the central plateau of the mountains, extending northeastwards to Dodoma and southwestwards to Makambako, Mbeya, and the border with Zambia. The A7 highway meets the A104 at Iringa, and extends eastwards through the mountains to Morogoro and Dar es Salaam."
"The Tazara Railway skirts along the southern escarpment of the Udzungwa Mountains, passing through Kidatu (where it meets the Misuku branch of Tanzania's Central Line at a break of gauge), Katulukilla, Mang’ula, Kiberege, Siginali, Ifakara, Idete, Ruipa, Mbinga, Mngeta, Ikule, Chita, Chisano, Mlimba, Lumumwe, Mpanga, Kitete, Kimbwe, Uchindile, Mgololo, Kiyowela, Kitandililo, and Mahongole."

"USS ""Kaskaskia"" (AO-27) was a ""Cimarron""-class fleet replenishment oiler serving in the United States Navy, named for the Kaskaskia River in Illinois."
"""Kaskaskia"" was launched 29 September 1939 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy; acquired by the Navy from Esso Oil Company, 22 October 1940; and commissioned 29 October 1940, Commander U.S. Gregory in command."
"""Kaskaskia"" cleared Boston, Mass19 November 1940 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 3 January 1941. She transported oil between West Coast ports and Pearl Harbor, making six cruises before 7 August, when she made an oil run to Johnston Island. The oiler returned to Mare Island 10 September for overhaul and repairs. In San Francisco when the Japanese made their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, ""Kaskaskia"" immediately began preparations to join the Service Force in the Pacific."
"Sailing from San Diego 6 January 1942, ""Kaskaskia"" commenced fueling operations en route before arriving Pago Pago 20 January. For the next six months she operated out of Nom-a refueling the ships engaged in the violent struggle to stem the Japanese advance. The oiler arrived Kodiak, Alaska, 3 July with a cargo of oil and fuel to be used in the Aleutian Islands campaign. She returned to Wilmington, California, loaded oil and aviation gasoline and continued oil runs to Alaskan ports until she steamed to Nouméa late in March 1943. ""Kaskaskia"" supplied many ships, increasing the mobility of the fleet during the successful campaigns in the South Pacific."
"""Kaskaskia"" returned to San Pedro 28 July for repairs before resuming her duties at Pearl Harbor 21 September. She transported oil between California and Hawaii until she sailed 25 November to support the Gilbert Islands campaign. Returning to Pearl Harbor 10 December, the oiler resumed her cruises between San Pedro and Hawaii."
"As the Navy pushed relentlessly toward Japan, ""Kaskaskia"" departed Pearl Harbor 16 January 1944 to support operations in the Marshall Islands. After the Navy had captured the Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, ""Kaskaskia"" supported carrier task forces during their devastating raids on Truk, the Marianas Islands, and Palau Islands in February and March."
"The oiler continued fueling operations in the Marshall Islands area until she cleared Majuro 6 June to fuel destroyers and destroyer escorts in the invasion of Saipan. Throughout June and July ""Kaskaskia"" remained on hand, assisting the fleet to take Saipee, Guam, and Tinian – important supply areas in the future campaign for the Philippines."
"As the Navy fought toward the Philippines, Admiral Nimitz decided to take the Palau Islands as a staging area for aircraft and ships during the invasion of Leyte. ""Kaskaskia"" departed Manus on 4 September with a task group bound for an assault on Peleliu. She operated in the Palau area until returning Manus 8 October. Her stay was a brief one, however, as she sailed 10 October for Leyte. Prior to the actual landings, she fueled units of the fleet, continuing this vital duty until a beachhead had been established. The oiler returned Ulithi 23 October and made another fueling run to the Philippine area early in November."
"After an overhaul at San Diego December 1944 through February 1945, ""Kaskaskia"" arrived Kwajalein 11 March to service the fleet. The oiler cleared Ulithi 30 March for the fueling area off Okinawa, the last major step before the Japanese homeland itself. Once again the oilers, the unsung heroes of the war, stood by refueling the many ships engaged in the irresistible assault from the sea on Okinawa."
"""Kaskaskia"" was relieved of fueling duties off Okinawa, only to be summoned for another important service. She departed Ulithi 3 July to refuel units of the carrier task forces, launching raids on the Japanese Islands of Honshū and Hokkaidō. When the Japanese surrendered, ""Kaskaskia"" steamed into Tokyo Bay 10 September with ships of the Occupation Forces. She continued refueling operations in Japan, China, and Formosa for an entire year before arriving San Pedro 28 September 1946."
"Between 1947 and 1950 she ferried oil and aviation gasoline from the West Coast to the Far East and naval bases in the mid-Pacific. When North Korean troops invaded South Korea, the United States accepted the challenge and ordered its forces to defend the embattled peninsula. ""Kaskaskia"" cleared San Diego 16 September to operate out of Sasebo. During October she entered the heavily mined waters off Wonsan, fueling ships blockading and bombarding that key port."
"During December she arrived off Hungnam to service ships engaged in evacuation operations in that area. Throughout the harsh winter months, ""Kaskaskia"" continued vital fueling missions between Japan and Korea. During the United Nations counteroffensive in the spring of 1951, she also stood by for fueling operations. The oiler returned to Long Beach, California, 27 August for overhaul and operations along the Pacific Coast."
"She sailed for the second Korean tour January 1952, arriving Sasebo on 22 January to refuel the ships engaged in the Korean War. In addition to services in Korea, she also supplied units in Japan, Okinawa and Formosa before returning Long Beach 31 July. Overhaul and training preceded her third Korean deployment from 27 December to July 1953. On this tour she supported ships engaged in fire support operations. Returning home 17 August, ""Kaskaskia"" underwent overhaul; she then sailed again for the Far East 4 January 1954, operated out of Sasebo and returning San Francisco 12 October. Following coastal operations, the oiler was placed out of commission, in reserve, 8 April 1955."
"""Kaskaskia"" was transferred to MSTS 8 January 1957, and operated in that capacity with a Navy crew until 21 October 1957 when she decommissioned and was turned over to the Maritime Administration 10 December. ""Kaskaskia"" was struck from the Navy List 2 January 1959."
"The Berlin Crisis of 1961 necessitated the reactivation of ships and ""Kaskaskia"" was reinstated 8 September. Following overhaul and alterations she recommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey, 6 December, Captain John D. Howell in command. After shakedown operations in the Caribbean, the oiler arrived Mayport, Florida, 1 May 1962. Throughout the summer she engaged in exercises off the Florida Coast, and sailed to the Azores to participate in Project Mercury, manned orbital flights. She was in company with during the latter's recovery of Astronaut Walter Schirra 3 October, demonstrating the large role of the Navy in space operations."
"""Kaskaskia"" return to Mayport 22 October and two days later sailed to participate in the Cuban blockade. President John F. Kennedy ordered the blockade when the Soviet Union tried to plant offensive missiles only from the United States. The naval pressure persuaded the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles, easing the crisis. The oiler returned to operations out of Mayport 21 November."
"She cleared Mayport 5 February 1963, for a six-month Mediterranean cruise to refuel ships of the US 6th Fleet, then resumed refueling exercises off Florida for the rest of the year. During 1964 ""Kaskaskia"" engaged in fueling operations and exercises off Florida and in the Caribbean, constantly seeking improved methods to increase the mobility of the Fleet."
"On 6 January 1965, ""Kaskaskia"" sailed for another 6th Fleet deployment. While she was operating in the Mediterranean, her crew worked day and night delivering over 19,000,000 gallons of fuel to 169 ships. ""Kaskaskia"" returned to Mayport, 7 June 1965. She operated primarily along the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean into 1967. Highlights of this period were service to ships patrolling off the coast of riot-torn Santo Domingo in the summer of 1965, and participation in the recovery team for an unmanned Apollo Program space flight in February 1966."
"""Kaskaskia"" was decommissioned for the final time in December 1969 and sold for scrap in September 1970."

"Rolling Vengeance, also known as Monster Truck, is a 1987 exploitation film directed by Steven Hilliard Stern and starring Don Michael Paul and Ned Beatty. The movie follows a truck driver that builds a special, eight-ton truck to help get revenge against the rednecks who killed his family and raped his girlfriend. The film script's initial premise centered on a young boy that created special monster trucks in order to eliminate drunk drivers."
"The five drunken sons of influential local business owner Tiny Doyle have been terrorizing the streets of their small town in their pick-up truck. Local trucker Big Joe Rosso has a wife named Kathy, a son named Joey, and two young daughters named Allison and Kristin. Big Joe and Joey do business with Tiny, delivering liquor to his bar, but that doesn't stop Tiny's son Vic from driving drunk and running Kathy off the road, killing Kathy, Allison, and Kristin. Thanks to Tiny's influence, the local judge sets Vic free after ordering Vic to pay a $300 fine. Lieutenant Sly, one of the local cops, is sympathetic toward the Rosso family, but Sly is about to retire, and Tiny has a lot of clout in this town. Enraged and bereaved, Big Joe goes after Vic, but the Doyles kill Big Joe. After that, they rape Joey's girlfriend Misty. Enraged and frustrated, Joey builds a monster truck out of junked car and truck parts, with seven-foot tall tires, a flame thrower, and a giant retractable combination drill and metal cutter mounted on it. Joey is out to do what the local authorities cannot or will not do...put an end to the Doyles once and for all."
"Reception for the film has been mixed, with most reviews upon its initial release being negative. Twitch Film gave a mostly positive review for ""Rolling Vengeance"", stating that although the film didn't go against any genre conventions, it does ""play all the right notes to their hilt"". Dread Central also praised the film, commenting that it was ""a cult film just waiting to be rediscovered"". The San Jose Mercury News panned the film, calling it ""predictable""."

"My Worst Nightmare (original title: Mon pire cauchemar) is a 2011 French-Belgian comedy-drama film written and directed by Anne Fontaine, starring Isabelle Huppert, Benoît Poelvoorde and André Dussollier."
"Agathe is a successful art dealer who lives with her husband François and their son Adrien in a wealthy quarter of Paris. Adrien is an underachiever at his school and Agathe fights any disadvantages that this can bring for him in parent-teacher conferences. François is more of a reserved person and procrastinates on a construction project. The situation gets stirred up when Adrien's friend Patrick, who is Tony's father, enters the picture. Tony is brilliant in his studies irrespective of his poor access to amenities, so Agathe has a soft spot for the child. And, Adrien's test results seem to be getting better. But Patrick has a rather dubious social background. He lacks both tact in social situations and a proper home or job for supporting a family. Agathe is distressed by Patrick's unpolished behavior and his intrusion into their life. Her husband François hires him to take care of the overdue construction project and they become friends. Then François cajoles a woman Patrick had wanted for himself and leaves Agathe. Patrick and Agathe are left back with the children. Agathe develops a sense of attachment for this unruly man who, ""au contraire"" to her husband, empathizes with her and is dedicated to ensuring his son can attend a respected school. But Patrick fails continuously to become responsible and they break up. Some time later they reconnect because each seems to complete the other."
"""My worst nightmare"" was evaluated as an ""utterly conventional French bourgeois comedy"". Still it was also considered ""watchable"" just because of its cast."
"Isabelle Huppert was in particular praised for making Agathe's transformation believable. Benoît Poelvoorde's performance was recognised a ""often irritable and hilarious"".

"= = = St. John's Episcopal Church (Jersey City, New Jersey) = = ="
"Saint John's Episcopal Church in Jersey City, New Jersey is located on Summit Avenue in Bergen Hill. Owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, it is considered a masterwork of 19th-century ecclesiastical architecture. The building, which has fallen into disrepair, became a municipal landmark in 2013."
"Erected in 1870, the Gothic Revival-influenced building was designed by John Remson Onderdonk, a local architect and practitioner of the ecclesiological philosophy, and is considered to be a masterpiece of 19th-century ecclesiastical architecture by the city's landmarks conservancy. Its façade replicates a portion of the Chartres Cathedral in Southern France. Once housing the largest Episcopal church congregation in New Jersey, among its members were many of the leading citizens of Jersey City. It was called the ""Millionaire's Church"". In 1914, much of the church was damaged by fire, but was elaborately restored. By the mid-twentieth century, reflecting the demographic change in the city, its congregation became more working class. From 1960 to 1968 the church was a center of the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements during the rectorship of the Reverend Robert W. Castle who preached a social gospel and drew attention to the plight of the city's poor. The church has not housed an Episcopal congregation since 1994."
"The Bergen Hill Historic District, of which the church is a contributing property, was established as a municipal historic district in 1986 and identified in New Jersey's state historic preservation office (SHPO) in 1989/1991 (ID#1481). In 2008, the SHPO issued a certificate of eligibility (ID#4986) for listing individually on both the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. Attempts made in 2007/2008 to have the church designated a local landmark were unsuccessful, the motion having been tabled by the Jersey City City Council. When it appeared that the diocese was moving to demolish the building, a campaign was begun to convince the city council to re-visit the issue which it did in June 2013 and adopted a measure granting landmark status."
St. John's has not been in regular use since 1994. In 2004 Preservation New Jersey named St. John's one of the most endangered historic sites in the state.
"There is concern that if the building continues to deteriorate it will be necessary for it is to be demolished. The Jersey Landmarks Conservancy, a preservation group, believes that the Episcopal Diocese of Newark has intentionally neglected the building in order to demolish it. The stained glass windows, altar, and other items were removed in 1997. In January 2012, the church's altar was offered for sale on e-bay. The diocese maintains that the preservation of the building is too costly and that no serious offers to purchase it have been forthcoming. In March 2013 the City of Jersey City served the diocese a Notice of Unsafe Structure, after which it contracted an asbestos abatement work and applied for a permit for demolition. Its designation as a local landmark requires that special approval be given before the building can be razed. The diocese disagrees with the landmarking. In 2015 it was decided to convert the property to residental spaces, including consruction of new buildings and conversion of the church."

They played their first album Divine Infekt in its entirety for the album's 10 year anniversary."
"Around the same time, Nero Bellum announced on Psyclon Nine's Facebook page that the band's new album would be titled """", and would be released in November 2013 with the help of the band's Bandcamp website page that allowed fans to donate to help raise funds for the album's production. In return, fans would receive different sorts of merchandise. Chris Vrenna of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails helped produce a few tracks on the album."

"After the Bandcamp controversy, Rotny and Jon posted on the official Psyclon Nine Facebook page that both had quit the band due to Nero disappearing again, stating they felt he was irresponsible. Jon left a very apologetic letter to the fans on his personal Facebook page, explaining again how he and Rotny had nothing to do with the Bandcamp donations."
"On March 30, 2014, Nero Bellum explained on his personal Facebook page that he was in therapy and was unable to send out the Bandcamp orders. Due to Rotny and Jon quitting the band and other misunderstandings, Nero felt it was time to put an end to Psyclon Nine, canceling their European tour."

= = = Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos = = =
"Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos is an Australian television comedy programme which was broadcast on Nine Network on 3 September 1992. It was a one-off special spin-off of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air partway through the broadcast of its first and only episode on the order of network owner Kerry Packer."
"""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" premiered in 1990, and was similar in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) ""America's Funniest Home Videos:"" viewers would send in amateur-shot videos that were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the ""funniest"" by the studio audience was awarded a prize at the end of the show."
"The producers often received racy or risqué videos that couldn't be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature, and since the show's policy stated that videos sent in by viewers couldn't be sent back, videos that didn't make it to the program were still kept by the station. The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience."
"It differed from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" in more than just the content of the videos. It had a different opening, a modified version of the ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""'s theme song, and a slightly modified set. It was hosted by Australian radio personality Doug Mulray. Due to the difference in content, the show aired at 8:30 PM and was preceded by a short message warning viewers of the show's content, and informing them that it was a one-off special that was different from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"The show followed the same structure of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", in which the videos were shown in short blocks, interspersed with humorous monologues written and delivered by Mulray. Mulray often poked fun at the content of the videos, which he described as ""The most sensational collection of home videos since Rodney King nicked out for a pizza recently."" Mulray also did humorous voice overs as the videos were shown, similar to Lisa Patrick's on ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"Anita Baldwin sold the land to the County of Los Angeles for $92,000 in 1918. A sand green golf course appeared following the closure of the school and Arcadia citizens took it over and operated it as a highly successful club."
"In 1935, through an act of Congress, the United States Department of War deeded 185 acres to Los Angeles County with the provision that it be used as a park and recreation center. The redevelopment of Ross Field was a Works Progress Administration project that included not just the golf course but a swimming pool, tennis courts, two baseball fields, a children's playground, and a lawn bowling complex."
"The Santa Anita Golf course opened in two stages. Nine holes were opened in April 1938 and the complete 18 opened on October 12, 1938."
"1938 also saw the birth of the Santa Anita Open—held each year until 1955, in the middle of October, to celebrate the opening of the Golf Course and to start the official Winter Golf Tournament season in Southern California. Prize money that first year was $1,000. Frank Moninger personally underwrote the first two tournaments. The Santa Anita Golf Club with the help of a few individual golfers underwrote the next few events. The County donated the Golf Course for the Santa Anita Open. The Course Record established in the days of ""The Open"" is 62 - held by Ellsworth Vines. Lloyd Mangrum won the first and second Opens with 274 and 278. Par at that time was 70."
In the 1960s the 9th hole was altered to make way for the construction of a baseball field at Arcadia Park. The original tee box was re-positioned to the South West of its original location and the hole was lengthened and turned into a par 5 thus changing par at the course to 71. The original dog leg left configuration and chute of trees has been lost and the hole now plays due east and relatively straight. Additionally significant changes were made to the short 281 yard par 4 17th hole where the large expanse of sand on the left side (south) was replaced with grass. The hole retains its name from the time (Desert) but has lost much character and altered the strategic challenge of its original configuration. Other changes from the era include the removal of several bunkers on the Par 5 Third hole and the sandy waste area between the 10th and 18th holes.
As part of the change in management in 1986 commitments were made to increase secondary facilities (clubhouse and dining) as well as substantive changes to the course itself during 1990-1991. The first hole and the driving range were swapped for safety reasons as errant shots from the range threatened cars on Santa Anita Avenue. The original dog leg left 1st hole was shortened from 409 yards to the current 367 yards. The 18th Green was moved forward to make way for clubhouse construction but the total yardage remained the same as the tee box was lengthened.
"During the 2000-2010 period small modifications were made to return a single bunker to the right of the 3rd hole (where the original design had three) and a large bunker in the center of the fairway of that same hole. Tee boxes on the 4th, 7th and 17th holes were modified. The detached tee boxes on 7th and 17th are seldom if ever used in open play though are occasionally used in tournament play."
"The current record is held by Blake Moore of Monrovia, California who shot a 9 under par 62 on Sunday, July 20, 2003. Moore is attributed with the current record as mentioned above several holes have been changed since ""The Open"" era and the course is now a par 71 rather than the original par 70."

"Louise Germain (1874–1939), née Louise Richier was a French painter."
"Although she was born in Gap, Hautes-Alpes, France, Louise Richier lived much of her childhood and adolescence in Algeria, returning to France by the time she was twenty. By 1894 she was studying in Marseille with the animal painter Walter Bildecombe."
"She lived in Aix-en-Provence with her husband Eugene Germain and their two children, Émile and Sylvain."
"At age 25, about 1899, she met Joseph Ravaisou and she took to painting. Reportedly, she also worked alongside Paul Cézanne, as did Ravaisou. In 1925, she watched over Joseph Ravaisou on his deathbed."
"On January 4, 2007, the Center for Individual Rights filed a lawsuit in Washtenaw Circuit Court, asking a judge to order the University of Michigan to immediately comply with Proposal 2, and abandon their affirmative action programs. The case was resolved on January 29 when Eric Russell, whom the Center for Individual Rights was representing voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit."
"Jan. 9–10: BAMN held a press conference at Cass Tech High School in Detroit announcing that their appeal of the Federal Appeals Court decision overturning the delay of the ban on affirmative action. The next day, after placing holds on admissions, the University of Michigan announced that they will comply with the ban on affirmative action. Hours later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens responded to BAMN's appeal of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision overturning the delay of Proposal 2's implementation and ordered all briefs due by January 17. U-M, Wayne State, MSU, and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm all filed briefs in support. Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox urged Stevens to deny the injunction. On January 19, the Supreme Court denied BAMN's appeal without comment."
"On Thursday, February 15, BAMN submitted 2,000 petitions to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan demanding that there be no drop in minority enrollment. The following Tuesday, on February 20, the Michigan Student Assembly, the elected student government of U-M passed a resolution demanding that there be no drop in underrepresented minority student enrollment."
"On Friday, July 1, 2011, the Federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held the amendment unconstitutional on the grounds that it ""reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests,"" and thus violates the 14th Amendment. Attorney General Bill Schuette then announced that he would appeal the ruling and ask to have the case re-heard ""en banc,"" by all active judges rather than a panel of three."
"On Thursday, November 3, 2011, the Equal Justice Society and more than a dozen other organizations announced that they had filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, urging the court to strike down Michigan's Proposal 2 as unconstitutional. The brief authors argue that Proposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution by creating procedural barriers for people of color."
"On 16 November 2012, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals sitting en banc upheld the earlier ruling that the Initiative is unconstitutional. Supporters announced their intention to appeal to the Supreme Court."
"On March 25, 2013 the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari, agreeing to hear the case. Arguments were heard during the Supreme Court term beginning in October 2013."
"On April 22, 2014 the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative as Constitutional."
"On Friday, February 16, 2007, the University of Michigan released admissions data showing that, in a period that includes the time after Proposal 2 was implemented, minority admissions of primarily lower test scores declined 25% from the same period a year before. The data also show that in the period immediately before Proposal 2 was implemented, minority admissions was up 55% from the same period in 2006. A spokeswoman for the university, Julie Peterson, has said that since the numbers aren't final and since so many minority students applied early, the drop cannot necessarily be attributed to the amendment itself."

"Boulders Beach is a sheltered beach made up of inlets between granite boulders, from which the name originated. It is located in the Cape Peninsula, near Simon's Town towards Cape Point, near Cape Town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is also commonly known as Boulders Bay. It is a popular tourist stop because of a colony of African penguins which settled there in 1982. Boulders Beach forms part of the Table Mountain National Park."
"These African penguins are only found on the coastlines of Southern Africa - (South Africa & Namibia). These penguins are currently on the verge of extinction. As a result, the penguins are under the protection of the Cape Nature Conservation."
"Although set in the midst of a residential area, it is one of the few sites where this vulnerable bird (""Spheniscus demersus"") can be observed at close range, wandering freely in a protected natural environment. From just two breeding pairs in 1982, the penguin colony has grown to about 3,000 birds in recent years. This is partly due to the reduction in commercial pelagic trawling in False Bay, which has increased the supply of pilchards and anchovy, which form part of the penguins' diet."
"Bordered mainly by indigenous bush above the high-water mark on the one side, and the clear water of False Bay on the other, the area comprises a number of small sheltered bays, partially enclosed by granite boulders that are 540 million years old."
"The most popular recreational spot is Boulders Beach, but the penguins are best viewed from Foxy Beach, where newly constructed boardwalks take visitors to within a few meters of the birds. It is also a popular swimming beach, although people are restricted to beaches adjacent to the penguin colony."

Baker had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of colonel but resigned following his election as lieutenant governor, during which time he played an important role in overseeing the formation and training of states levies. He served as acting-governor for five months during the illness of Governor Oliver Morton, and was elevated to Governor following Morton's resignation from office. During Baker's full term as governor, he focused primitively on the creation and improvement of institutions to help veterans and their families that had been disaffected by the war. He also championed the post-war federal constitutional amendments, and was able to successfully advocate their acceptance."
"Conrad Baker was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, on February 12, 1817, the son of Conrad Baker, a Presbyterian minister, and Mary Winternheimer Baker. He worked on the family farm until age fifteen and attended common school. He then enrolled in Pennsylvania College in Gettysburg where he studied law, but quit before graduating. He continued to study law in the office of Thaddeus Stevens. He met Matilda Escon Sommers and the couple married in 1838. They had two children. Baker was admitted to the bar in 1839 and opened his own office in Gettysburg."
"In a Des Moines Register interview Fallon said, “We think it’s very important. We think this is a tool that will help mobilize people to understand the problem and to do more about it…this needs to become the defining issue of this century.” Fallon was inspired in part by another cross-country march, the 1986 Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, for which he coordinated the Iowa logistics. Although this was a national campaign, it was intended to have an international audience and was desired to include participants from multiple nations, as climate change is a global phenomenon."
"The headquarters of the non-profit are located in Des Moines, Iowa. As of October 2013 they had six staff, had raised $120,000, and earned endorsements from 350.org, James Hansen, and U.S. Senator Tom Harkin and Congressman Bruce Braley among others."
"The marchers departed from Santa Monica, California on March 1, 2014, traveling through Nebraska (focus on the Keystone Pipeline) and ended in Washington, D.C. in November, 2014.

"Reverend Bob Cook planned to take part in the march. ""The Des Moines pastor’s life work has been for the poor, but he doesn’t view the Great March for Climate Action as a departure. The poor are affected most by climate change, as they are from most troubling world events, Cook said."""
"Ben Bushwick, a student at Ohio University, marched most of the way. “I’m marching because quite frankly I don’t see any other choice,” Bushwick said. “Atmospheric disruption is a real threat that people do not take seriously and will make mitigation and adaptation efforts a lot more difficult.”"
"Faith Meckley, a student at Ithaca College, says, “I was interested, but only for a three-week walk from Pittsburgh to Washington. ... After thinking about it and talking to my academic advisor at Ithaca, I decided to take the spring semester off and do the walk from Taos, N.M., to Washington. I am committed to this issue. I want to do more than my environmental blog and sign petitions. I have a respect for the planet.” In line with her commitment, she left the march early to protest storage of liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas in her hometown region of Seneca Lake, New York."
"An average day’s walk was expected to be 14–15 miles. Campsites for tents were prearranged. Organizers had hoped to haul all of the gear and supplies via bicycles to minimize energy consumption and maximize sustainability, but after some intensive research this proved infeasible, so trucks running on biodiesel or vegetable oil fuel were used. Research into solar cookers, composting toilets, determined how far the marchers were able to use sustainable methods to handle food and energy needs, and human waste. Participants and volunteers shared daily chores including but not limited to setting up camp, food preparation and clean-up. Interactive workshops focused on climate change, the anthropogenic effect on the environment, and active solutions."
"Throughout history, marches have been associated with political and social change. Examples include but are not limited to: the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913, Gandhi's Salt March to defy Britain's imperial power, Martin Luther King Jr's Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights and the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. Peace walks have been particularly popular in the peace movement."

She served in the North Sea, Atlantic, and the West Indies. ""Calypso"" was sunk whilst acting as a convoy escort on 30 July 1803 after colliding with a West Indiaman merchant ship during a violent storm."

"""Calypso"" was first commissioned in September 1783 under Commander Ralph Dundas for service on the Irish and Scottish stations. She was then refitted at Plymouth and placed in ordinary in October 1785. She was paid off in October 1786."
"Her second commission began in January 1787 under Commander William Mitchell. After fitting for Channel service she sailed for Jamaica on 16 April 1787, returning to home waters in 1790 and once more being placed in ordinary."
"""Calypso"" underwent a period of repair and was refitted at Portsmouth between July 1793 and March 1796. Her third commission began in January 1796 under Commander Andrew Smith, who took her to sea following her repair and refit to join Admiral Duncan's North Sea Fleet."
"In January 1797 Commander Richard Worsley took command and operated ""Calypso"" as a convoy escort and cruiser. Commander C. Collis succeeded Worsley in November 1797. Collis continued operating in this role until April 1798 when ""Calypso"" returned to Portsmouth for refit."
"Commander Henry Garrett took command in April 1799 and was succeeded by Commander Joseph Baker in November of that year. Baker took ""Calypso"" to the Caribbean, sailing for the Leeward Islands in February 1800. Whilst under Baker's command on this station, ""Calypso"" participated in several notable actions."

"From 1794 the Admiralty allowed a crew of 121 for a 16-gun sloop such as HMS ""Calypso"". The Commander and Lieutenants were professional sea officers, trained in gunnery, navigation and seamanship in equal measure and appointed to the ship by Admiralty Commission. The Lieutenants were all at least nineteen years of age, having served a minimum six-year apprenticeship as Midshipman or Master's Mate before undertaking and passing the examination for Lieutenant. The Commander would usually have been an experienced Lieutenant who had come to the attention of the Admiralty or his Commander-in-Chief through some distinction in service or by having an influential patron. The Commander's duties were almost identical to those of a Post Captain, although on a smaller scale, the exception being that as a Commander he had no automatic rights of promotion to the flag list and could quite easily remain a Commander for the rest of his career."
"The Warrant Officers were specialists appointed to the ship by Navy Board Warrant. The Wardroom Warrant Officers were allowed all the privileges of a Commissioned Officer, eating and sleeping with the Lieutenants. The Standing Warrant Officers stayed with the ship throughout its commission and remained aboard when the ship was placed in ordinary. They were heavily involved with the fitting out of the ship and general maintenance. Cockpit Officers had a higher status than the Petty Officers and could generally expect to reach the Wardroom in time, with its members aspiring to be Lieutenants, Masters, Pursers or Surgeons. Petty Officers performed particular roles that required additional skills or expertise, and they were usually rated by the Captain or First Lieutenant on joining the ship. Unlike the Warrant Officers, the Petty Officers had no security in his rank; the Captain could demote a Petty Officer for negligence. A Petty Officer could also lose his rating on moving to a new ship."

"Kevin Lamont Hardy (born July 24, 1973) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Dallas Cowboys, and Cincinnati Bengals. He played college football at the University of Illinois."
"Hardy attended William Henry Harrison High School, where he received numerous awards and accolades as a high school football player. As a senior, he posted 127 tackles (47 solo), 2 interceptions, 32 receptions for 610 yards and 13 touchdowns, 55 carries for 410 yards, returned 6 punts for 42 yards and 15 kickoffs for 344 yards. He received All-Evansville, City Player of the Year, All-Southern Indiana and Conference and Region Player of the Year honors."
"He also was a cum laude honor roll student, played basketball and ran track. His basketball teammates included Calbert Cheaney, an All-American at Indiana, Walter McCarty, who played at Kentucky, and Chris Lowery who played at Southern Illinois and is now an assistant coach at Kansas State University."
"Hardy accepted a football scholarship from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. As a redshirt freshman, he was third on the team with 67 tackles. As a sophomore, he started all 11 games and ranked fourth on the team with 78 tackles."
"As a junior, he registered 80 tackles. During his time at Illinois, the Fighting Illini had a number of outstanding linebackers. In the 1994 season, the four linebackers in coach Lou Tepper's 3–4 defense were Hardy, fellow Butkus Award winner Dana Howard, future NFL player John Holecek, and Simeon Rice. Because of this, Hardy was often overlooked as a linebacker. At his position, he was not prolific in accumulating tackles like Howard, or in quarterback sacks as was Rice, who as a ""rush linebacker"" played on the line of scrimmage like a defensive end."
"Hardy was recognized as being among the very best linebackers in college football as a senior, winning the Dick Butkus Award and receiving consensus first-team All-American honors. He started every game at ""drop"" linebacker, finishing with 105 tackles (second on the team), 11 sacks, 15 tackles for loss, 5 forced fumbles and 3 interceptions (tied for the team lead). He had 18 tackles against Michigan State University and 3 sacks against Indiana University."
"Hardy finished his career ranked ninth on the Illinois All-time list with 330 tackles, fourth in sacks with 18, and fourth in tackles for loss with 38. He was a business major and was initiated as a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity."
"Hardy was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the second overall choice in the 1996 NFL Draft, signing a six-year $14.8 million contract with a six million dollar signing bonus. Hardy's fellow linebacker at Illinois, Rice, was selected with the third overall choice. Hardy became the first defensive rookie in franchise history to start on opening day, going on to start 15 games. He recorded 130 tackles (second on the team), 5.5 sacks (third in the NFL among rookies), 7 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions (tied for the team lead), 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and was named to the NFL All-Rookie team."
"In 1997, he was limited with injuries, starting 11 out of 13 games at strongside linebacker. He tallied 73 tackles (3 for loss), 2.5 sacks and 5 quarterback hurries. He suffered a sprained left medial collateral ligament against the Dallas Cowboys, missing 3 contests and seeing limited action in several games the remainder of the season because of the injury. He was able to start the wild card playoff game against the Denver Broncos, collecting 8 tackles."
"In 1998, with the signing of free agent Bryce Paup, he was moved to weakside linebacker and started all 16 games. He had a franchise record 186 tackles, while also making 1.5 sacks, 10 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions, 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery."
"In 1999, Hardy led all AFC linebackers with 10.5 sacks and led the team with 153 tackles. He also had 7 tackles for loss, 24 quarterback hurries, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery, helping the Jaguars achieve a 14-win season. Hardy was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as named to the AP All-Pro first team."
"In 2000, he registered 149 tackles (led the team), 3 sacks, 16 quarterback pressures, 6 tackles for loss, one interception, 5 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries."
"In 2001, he was moved back to strongside linebacker, but injured his knee in the ninth game of the season. At the time he had 98 tackles (second on the team), 5 1/2 sacks (tied for third on the team), 9 quarterback pressures, one interception and 4 passes defensed. It would be his last game with the Jaguars, who eventually moved him to the injured reserve list, due to needing a microfracture surgery which was thought to be career threatening, because in those days not many players fully recovered from this medical procedure. He left as the franchise's All-time tackles leader, after playing six seasons, which included four trips to the NFL playoffs."
"The Dallas Cowboys gambled that he could return from the complex surgery and signed him on April 14, 2002, as an unrestricted free agent, counting $2.5 million in his first year and structuring the rest of the $23 million contract with a $5.025 million option in the second year."
"Hardy recovered from his injury and played for the Cowboys in the 2002 NFL season, finishing the season ranked third on the team in both total (114) and solo tackles(73), while making 2 sacks, 18 quarterback pressures, 8 tackles for loss, 10 passes defensed and 3 forced fumbles. He played outside linebacker, lining up as a defensive end in some passing downs. Because of salary cap issues, he was released on February 27, 2003, in order to avoid a $5.025 million option bonus if the Cowboys retained him."
"On March 6, 2003, he signed a four-year, $14 million USD contract with the Cincinnati Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, to be the Bengals new middle linebacker, after playing outside linebacker in his previous seasons. Hardy was an integral part of the Bengals' defense, starting all 16 games, leading the team in defensive snaps played (1,030 of 1,038 for 99.2%) and was second on the team in tackles (91)."
"In 2004, he was moved to strongside linebacker after the signing of free agent Nate Webster, starting 14 games and making 84 tackles. The Bengals terminated Hardy's contract in a salary-cap move on May 3, 2005."
"Hardy finished his career with 742 tackles (563 solo), 36 sacks, 43.5 tackles for loss, 11 forced fumbles, seven fumble recoveries, 45 pass deflections, five interceptions for 59 yards, and one touchdown in 134 games."
"Hardy currently resides in Jacksonville, Florida. In August 2007, he built his South Beach club venture, Dream Nightclub, centered around a motto that ""reality is overrated."" ""I've been around and entertained people all my life, so I made a business out of it"" said Hardy."
"Stuart married Kerri McKeehan, sister of TobyMac, in 1995. The two later divorced."
Stuart has visited Haiti consistently to help with missionary efforts. He started the Hands and Feet Project in 2004 along with Audio Adrenaline.
"On January 12, 2010, Mark, his parents (Drex and Jo), and his wife Aegis were working at the Hands and Feet Project in Jacmel, Haiti when the earthquake struck Port-au-Prince. None at the Project were injured by the quake, and Mark was able to get the word out about the plight of the residents of Jacmel via multiple Skype interviews with media outlets such as CNN, MSNBC and BBC, among others. He assisted with relief efforts in Jacmel until he returned to the U.S. on January 22, when he continued to assist by raising funds through continued coordination of relief efforts and organization of benefit concerts."

"In geometry, the great cubicuboctahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U."
"It shares the vertex arrangement with the convex truncated cube and two other nonconvex uniform polyhedra. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron (having the triangular faces and 6 square faces in common), and with the great rhombihexahedron (having the octagrammic faces in common)."
The great hexacronic icositetrahedron (or great lanceal disdodecahedron) is the dual of the great cubicuboctahedron.
= = = Dodecadodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the dodecadodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It is the rectification of the great dodecahedron (and that of its dual, the small stellated dodecahedron). It was discovered independently by , and ."
"The edges of this model form 10 central hexagons, and projected onto a sphere, represent 10 great circles. These 10, along with the great circles from projections of two other polyhedra, form the 31 great circles of the spherical icosahedron used in construction of geodesic domes."
"It has four Wythoff constructions between four Schwarz triangle families: 2 | 5 5/2, 2 | 5 5/3, 2 | 5/2 5/4, 2 | 5/3 5/4, but represent identical results. Similarly it can be given four extended Schläfli symbols: r{5/2,5}, r{5/3,5}, r{5/2,5/4}, and r{5/3,5/4} or as Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams: , , , and ."
A shape with the same exterior appearance as the dodecadodecahedron can be constructed by folding up these nets:
"12 pentagrams and 20 rhombic clusters are necessary. However, this construction replaces the crossing pentagonal faces of the dodecadodecahedron with non-crossing sets of rhombi, so it does not produce the same internal structure."
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the small dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common), and with the great dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common)."
This polyhedron can be considered a rectified great dodecahedron. It is center of a truncation sequence between a small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron:
"The truncated small stellated dodecahedron looks like a dodecahedron on the surface, but it has 24 faces: 12 pentagons from the truncated vertices and 12 overlapping as (truncated pentagrams). The truncation of the dodecadodecahedron itself is not uniform and attempting to make it uniform results in a degenerate polyhedron (that looks like a small rhombidodecahedron with {10/2} polygons filling up the dodecahedral set of holes), but it has a uniform quasitruncation, the truncated dodecadodecahedron."
"It is topologically equivalent to a quotient space of the hyperbolic order-4 pentagonal tiling, by distorting the pentagrams back into regular pentagons. As such, it is topologically a regular polyhedron of index two:"
The colours in the above image correspond to the red pentagrams and yellow pentagons of the dodecadodecahedron at the top of this article.

The medial rhombic triacontahedron is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the dodecadodecahedron. It has 30 intersecting rhombic faces.
It can also be called the small stellated triacontahedron.
"The ""medial rhombic triacontahedron"" is a stellation of the rhombic triacontahedron, which is the dual of the icosidodecahedron, the convex hull of the dodecadodecahedron (dual to the original medial rhombic triacontahedron)."
"It is topologically equivalent to a quotient space of the hyperbolic order-5 square tiling, by distorting the rhombi into squares. As such, it is topologically a regular polyhedron of index two:"

"Trenary placed 5th in her first senior national championships in 1986. Later that summer she won the U.S. Olympic Festival. In fall 1986 she placed second to Elizabeth Manley at the St. Ivel International. At the U.S. championships in 1987, she finished second in both the compulsory figures and short program, where she landed a triple flip jump for the first time in her combination. In the long program Trenary landed four clean triple jumps, including the triple flip, and she upset reigning world champion Debi Thomas to take her first senior national title. At the 1987 World Championships, she rallied from 11th in the compulsory figures to place fourth in the short program, again landing the triple flip jump in combination, and fifth in the long program, to place 7th overall. In 1988, Thomas regained the U.S. title, with Trenary finishing second. Trenary placed 4th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. She was 5th at the 1988 World Championships, where she fell on the triple flip in both her short and long programs. Due to her strength in compulsory figures, Trenary again won the U.S. Championships in 1989, although she was defeated by Kristi Yamaguchi in the free skating. Trenary won bronze at the 1989 World Championships."
"In 1990, Trenary won both the U.S. and World titles. Her strength in the compulsory figures was the deciding factor at the 1990 World Championships. She was 5th in the short program and second in the free skate to Midori Ito but her top placement in the figures kept her in the lead overall. The International Skating Union eliminated figures after that season. After she won her World title, her coach, Carlo Fassi, returned to live in his home country, Italy, and Trenary began working with Kathy Casey."
"Trenary's triple jumps included the toe loop, salchow, and flip, which was quite competitive for a female singles skater in the mid-to-late 1980s. One of her signature moves was a combination of a one-foot axel into a triple salchow."
"In January 1991, Trenary underwent surgery to drain her ankle after she developed a staph infection. As a result, she withdrew from the 1991 U.S. Championships. In March 1991, Trenary moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to work with Carol Heiss Jenkins."
"With the elimination of compulsory figures—formerly Trenary's strength—from competition, the technical standard for jumping in women's skating had risen greatly, with the top skaters all attempting five or six different triples. Trenary's injury was slow to heal and she had problems regaining her former standard of jumps, much less learning new ones. She planned to compete at the 1992 U.S. Championships, beginning her comeback in fall 1991 at Skate Canada, where she finished second in the short program to Surya Bonaly, but dropped to fourth overall after the long program, where she was unable to successfully land any triple jumps. She qualified for the 1992 U.S. Nationals by winning the 1991 Midwestern Sectional Championships with an uneven performance: after a strong short program in which she landed a triple flip combination, she was unable to land any triple jumps in the long program. She ended her bid to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in December 1991."
"After turning professional, Trenary toured with the Tom Collins Tour of Champions and Stars on Ice for several years. Prior to the 1993 World Championships, the eventual winner and soon-to-be Olympic champion, Oksana Baiul, cited Trenary as her favorite skater for her beauty and style. Although Trenary's early professional competitive career was uneven, in 1996 she skated particularly strong programs, choreographed by her then-husband, Christopher Dean, to George Winston's ""Variations on a Theme by Pachelbel"", and to Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin' as part of the U.S. team in its victory over the world team in Ice Wars."
Trenary retired from skating in 1997 after developing a life-threatening blood clot in her shoulder.
"Trenary married British ice dancer Christopher Dean on October 15, 1994. They have two sons, Jack Robert and Sam Colin. Dean's agent confirmed in March 2010 the couple had separated."

"The Wisconsin tornado outbreak of 2005 was an outbreak of tornadoes that occurred primarily in southern Wisconsin on August 18, 2005. A system of storms unleashed a total of 28 tornadoes, 27 of which were confirmed in southern Wisconsin, and 1 confirmed in Minnesota. This outbreak set a new record for the most tornadoes observed in the state in a single day, breaking the previous record of 24 tornadoes set on May 8, 1988. The system generating the Stoughton tornado was also accompanied by many reports of severe winds and hail throughout the region. The Stoughton tornado was documented on an episode of The Weather Channel's ""Storm Stories""."
"By far the most significant tornado of the day developed 2.0 miles (3.2 km) north of Oregon at 6:15 p.m.. This large, intense multiple-vortex tornado tracked 20.0 miles (32.2 km) into Jefferson County from Dane County, devastating the town of Stoughton."
"East of Oregon the tornado tore through several farms before impacting residential subdivisions in Stoughton. One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor. Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton. As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed. As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed. As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Several vehicles were flipped and tossed as well. Some homes in town were completely leveled, and an F4 rating was considered. Further investigation revealed that the homes were not well-built, and the slow (sometimes nearly stationary) forward movement of the tornado negated a rating higher than F3. After striking Stoughton, the tornado caused damage to trees and crops north of Busseyville before dissipating. Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha. 23 people were injured."
"Ten years later to the day, three tornadoes touched down outside of Lake Geneva, Big Bend, and Waukesha. There were no injuries or fatalities from those tornadoes."

On retirement from his judicial career, Sathasivam was appointed as the 21st Governor of Kerala from 5 September 2014 to 4 September 2019. Sathasivam is the second judge from Tamil Nadu to become the CJI, after M. Patanjali Sastri. He is also the first former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to be appointed as the Governor of a state. He is the first Governor of Kerala to be appointed by the Narendra Modi Government."
"Sathasivam was born to Palaniswamy and Natchiammal in Kadappanallur near Bhavani in Erode district. He graduated from Government Law College Chennai after completing his BA degree Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal College, Sivakasi."
"Sathasivam enrolled as an advocate on 25 July 1973 at Madras. He was then appointed to the post of Additional Government Pleader, and later as the Special Government Pleader in the Madras High Court. He was appointed a permanent judge of the Madras High Court on 8 January 1996, and transferred to the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 20 April 2007. He was elevated to the post of Judge of Supreme Court on 21 August 2007. During his tenure as Chief Justice, he was the Chairman of the General Council of the Gujarat National Law University. He succeeded Sheila Dikshit as the Governor of Kerala in August 2014."
"Justice Sathasivam authored several path-breaking judgments including the Reliance Gas Judgment (May 2010) where he observed that ""in a national democracy like ours, the national assets belong to the people"" and ""the government owns such assets for the purposes of developing them in the interests of the people""."
"He also delivered the verdict in the controversial triple-murder case of Stains and upheld the conviction of Dara Singh. On 19 April 2010, he delivered the judgement in the Jessica Lal murder case of 29 April 1999. Along with Justice B. S. Chauhan, Sathasivam delivered the judgement in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case, sentencing Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt to five years' imprisonment under the Arms Act. Dutt was asked to serve out the remainder of his sentence. According to ""The Hindu"", ""In a number of judgements, he [Sathasivam] cautioned the courts against awarding lesser sentence in crimes against women and children and showing undue sympathy towards the accused by altering the sentence to the extent of period already undergone."""
"In January 2014, a three-judge panel headed by Chief Justice of India Palanisamy Sathasivam commuted sentences of 15 death-row convicts, ruling that the ""inordinate and inexplicable delay is a ground for commuting death penalty to life sentence"". Supreme Court of India ruled that delays ranging from seven to 11 years in the disposal of mercy pleas are grounds for clemency. The same panel also passed a set of guidelines for the execution of a death row convict, which includes a 14-day gap from the receipt of communication of the rejection of first mercy petition to the scheduled execution date, after going through the Shatrughan Chouhan vs Union of India case."

They played their home games at Charles Koch Arena, which had a capacity of 10,506. They were in their 69th season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. They were led by seventh-year head coach Gregg Marshall. They were the last team to finish the regular season and enter the NCAA Tournament unbeaten until Kentucky did it the next year."
"The 2013–14 season was arguably the best season in Wichita State's 108-year basketball history. After defeating Missouri State on March 1, 2014, Wichita State became the first men's Division I team ever to finish the regular season 31–0 (Kentucky matched it the next year) , the first team to finish 18–0 in conference play in the Missouri Valley Conference since the 1985–86 Bradley Braves, as well as the first to finish the regular season undefeated since Saint Joseph's in 2003–04. The team's 35–0 start was the best men's Division I start ever (before Kentucky started 38-0 the next year), beating the 1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels who began the season 34–0 and the best Missouri Valley Conference start ever, beating the 1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores, who went 33–0 to start the season. They spent most of the season in the top 10 of both major polls, rising as high as #2 in late February. They continued their run by winning their first MVC tournament title since 1987, and were ranked second in both final major media polls, the highest final national ranking in school history. Though some analysts noted that Wichita State's schedule was relatively easy compared to previous teams that finished the regular season primarily because none of their opponents throughout the season were ranked when they played them, as well as only beating one opponent that was ranked at any point in the season (Saint Louis, who also had a lack of quality wins)."
"They entered the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament undefeated at 34–0. The Shockers beat Cal Poly, 64–37 for their NCAA-record 42–game winning streak to start a season. Two days later, and playing their 5th and final straight game at St. Louis' Scottrade Center, Fred VanVleet's three-point attempt at the end-of-game buzzer against Kentucky bounced harmlessly off the rim, and so went their attempt to become the first men's team in 38 years to win the title undefeated."
"In the 2012–13 college basketball season, the Wichita State University Shockers, under sixth-year head coach Gregg Marshall, finished the season 30–9 and 12–6 in Missouri Valley play to finish in second place. They advanced to the championship game of the Missouri Valley Tournament where they lost to Creighton. They received an at-large bid to the 2013 NCAA Tournament, receiving a 9 seed in the West Region, where they defeated 8 seed Pittsburgh and 1 seed Gonzaga to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the West Region semifinals they defeated 13 seed La Salle and 2 seed Ohio State in the regional finals to be crowned West Region Champions and advance to the Final Four for the second time in school history and first time since 1965. In the Final Four, they lost to eventual-champion Louisville, 72–68. Wichita State was ranked #4 in the final Coach's Poll of the 2012-13 season."

= = = Peace and Rhythm = = =
Peace and Rhythm is the second album led by jazz drummer Idris Muhammad which was recorded for the Prestige label in 1971.
"The Allmusic site awarded the album 3 stars stating ""Parts of the second solo album by Prestige Records' house drummer, Idris Muhammad, are an even poppier affair than ""Black Rhythm Revolution"", with a mellow soul-jazz feel replacing the slight Latin tinge of the earlier album... ""The Peace and Rhythm Suite"" is a side-long suite consisting of two long, spacy compositions that predate the ambient house scene by nearly two decades yet sound entirely of a piece with that style. Long, droning, sustained chords on a variety of wind and reed instruments float above Muhammad's percussion, which ebbs and flows in a free, almost arrhythmic way through most of the piece. Fans of The Orb or Brian Eno will find it an old hat, but for early-'70s jazz, this was downright revolutionary""."

"It took Girls Aloud five months to release ""No Good Advice"". Nadine Coyle said in an interview with The Lipster, ""We were No.1 for a month straight and then getting songs from all these other producers and we were, 'Nah, don't like it'. We waited from December to May before releasing a second single because we knew it had to be our strong point or we might as well kiss our careers goodbye."" Kimberley Walsh further exclaimed, ""We knew it was strong enough to come back with."" Girls Aloud reportedly had to re-record ""No Good Advice"" because ""it features rude words"", such as ""damn"" and ""shit"". However, the line ""Here I am / Dirty hands, I don't give a damn"" was kept intact. An explicit version of the song appears on the special edition bonus disc of ""The Sound of Girls Aloud"", replacing the lyric ""shut your mouth because it might show"" with ""shut your mouth because your shit might show"". Furthermore, an early demo of the song appears on a singles boxset released in 2009; this demo including the clean lyric in the first bridge and the explicit lyric in the second bridge."
"The song was released as a CD single, featuring an exclusive b-side entitled ""On a Round"", which was later covered by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai under the title ""Run Run"" for her 2009 compilation album ""Jeneration"". The CD format also includes the Dreadzone Vocal Mix of ""No Good Advice"" and its music video. The DVD single did not actually feature the ""No Good Advice"" music video, just a photo gallery and behind-the-scenes footage. It did, however, include audio of the track and the video to ""Sound of the Underground"". Another remix, the Doublefunk Vocal Mix, was later featured on the ""Life Got Cold"" single and the remix album ""Mixed Up""."
"""No Good Advice"" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. A BBC review described the song as ""better than anything else [...] in the charts."" Unlike many other songs, it was said to be ""not obsessed with trying to be a cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together"" that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. It was said to be ""just as good, if not better"" than ""Sound of the Underground"". It provides ""more brassy and in-your-face lyrics of defiance and determination [...] Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits."" On a less positive side, Tourdates.co.uk said that ""No Good Advice"" was a failure at adding attitude to Girls Aloud's music and imitates ""as many songs as possible."" The song has been compared to The Knack's ""My Sharona""."
"In 2003, the song won the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer(s) of the best British pop single of the past year. Popjustice founder Peter Robinson wrote that the song ""established a motif that would saturate Girls Aloud's string of subsequent singles: an unpredictable and triumphantly contrary desire to push and pull the band in exciting new directions at every turn."""
"""No Good Advice"" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, held off by R. Kelly's ""Ignition Remix"". The song slipped to number five in its second week on the chart. The single lasted two more weeks in the top twenty at numbers eleven and seventeen respectively. Overall, ""No Good Advice"" was inside the top forty for six weeks; it spent an additional eight weeks in the top 75, selling over 105,000 copies. ""No Good Advice"" suffered a similar fate on the Irish Singles Chart, peaking at number two behind Ireland's Eurovision finalist Mickey Joe Harte. It spent three consecutive weeks at number three, behind Harte and R. Kelly. The song fell to number seven in its fourth week on the Irish chart. It spent four further weeks in the top twenty."
"The song also charted in the top fifty in Belgium and the Netherlands, placing at numbers 45 and 26 respectively."
"The video for ""No Good Advice"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed ""Sound of the Underground"" and would also direct ""Life Got Cold"". It features the members of Girls Aloud clad in metallic, silver, futuristic outfits (which are seen on the cover of the original release of their album Sound of the Underground). Girls Aloud fade in and out like holograms, centered around a rusty old car parked near a phone booth. They are joined by several men playing electric guitar, whom they flirt with while in various other poses. In a separate scene, while a black background with bright pinkish lights being emitted from behind, all five girls shake tambourines and dance. The last two scenes are intertwined with neon-coloured animated special effects the background, finally ending with an explosion scene."
"In a special programme shown exclusively on MTV to promote their second album ""What Will the Neighbours Say?"", Girls Aloud confessed that they hated the ""No Good Advice"" video shoot. According to the group, both Cheryl and Sarah's trousers ripped and the make-up artist shouted at them. The group woke with bruised thighs the following day. The music video can be found on the group's 2005 DVD release ""Girls on Film"". In the group's 2007 DVD ""Style"", which also features the music video, Girls Aloud were horrified by the video upon watching it again. Regardless, viewers of FHM TV voted the video for ""No Good Advice"" as the fifth sexiest music video of all time in 2006."
"""No Good Advice"" was performed live for the first time on """" on 5 April 2003, a month ahead of the single's release. Girls Aloud sang in front of a checkered background in red outfits with black accents, as seen on the single's artwork. The group returned to the show three more times to perform ""No Good Advice"", including a performance using taxi cabs as a prop and another using phone booths. It was performed on ""Top of the Pops Saturday"" twice, as well as its parent show. Girls Aloud also visited ""Blue Peter"" and ""Popworld"". It was also performed at a number of live events in 2003, such as Spring Break, Pepsi Silver Clef, Party in the Park, the West Belfast Festival, and a festival in Belgium. Girls Aloud also sang the song on Germany's ""VIVA Interaktiv"". In the United Kingdom, Girls Aloud later performed at the Children in Need telethon and on ""Popworld""'s Christmas special."
"Girls Aloud performed ""No Good Advice"" on their first three concert tours. For their first tour, 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say? Live, Girls Aloud performed the song in school uniforms. The rendition featured an introlude taken from part two of the Pink Floyd song ""Another Brick in the Wall"". The following year, ""No Good Advice"" was featured as the second track on the Chemistry Tour. The group, who were created by mad scientists in the show's opening sequence, wore lab coats. The performance, influenced by Broadway, was set in a laboratory as each member was paired with a male dance partner. After a dance break, the mad scientist dancers performed a ""magic trick"" in which he made Cheryl Cole ""disappear"" and then reappear. For 2007's """", Girls Aloud performed ""No Good Advice"" in lingerie. The stage featured pedestals and platforms which Girls Aloud were on. For 2009's Out of Control Tour, ""No Good Advice"" was included in a greatest hits medley which closed the show. The song was also performed on the band's 2013 reunion tour, Ten - The Hits Tour 2013. It was performed as the second song in the show after the opener ""Sound of the Underground""."

"The album celebrates some of the world's major water bodies and surrounding areas. Although presented as a proper album, it contains tracks from throughout the early career of the band, and was designed as a sort of ""best of"" collection. Compared to ""Mystic Island"", this album's tracks mostly come from the albums ""Cusco II"", ""Virgin Islands"" and ""Ring der Delphine"", but has selected tracks from other albums as well, as well as the brand new track ""Chorus"", an alternate version of ""Flying Condor"" from the ""Apurimac"" album. Each track has been remastered for this release. Additionally, some of the tracks have been edited to shorten them, most noticeably ""Bur Said"", ""Jebel at Tarik"", and ""Bodensee""."

"David Michael Brown (born February 25, 1970 in Summit, New Jersey) is a former professional American football quarterback who played for Duke University and later in the National Football League for the New York Giants and Arizona Cardinals."
"Brown grew up in Westfield, New Jersey and played high school football at Westfield High School, graduating in 1988."
"After his career in football, Dave went on to become a director at New York Life Investment Management. In 2008, Dave joined Lehman Brothers where he served as a Senior Vice President of Lehman's Private Fund Marketing Group. He left Lehman Brothers in 2008 to become the Co-Head of Greenhill's Private Capital Advisory Group. In 2015, he joined Moelis & Company to lead their new private equity fundraising business."
"Brown had a successful career at Duke University. In his November 4, 1989, starting debut he threw for 444 yards against Wake Forest University, including a 97-yard touchdown to wide receiver Clarkston Hines to establish Duke's longest play from scrimmage. Later that month, Brown set a school single-game record with 479 passing yards against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, upending Duke's rival, 41-0, to finish the year with seven straight wins and a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. The Blue Devils subsequently received a bid to play in the All-American Bowl, Duke's first bowl game in almost 30 years. In 1991, Brown was chosen as the recipient of Duke's Carmen Falcone Team MVP Award."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football quarterbacks: pass attempts in a season (#4, 437), pass attempts in a career (#5, 845), pass attempts in a game (#8, 54), pass completions in a game (#5, 33), pass completions in a season (#5, 230), pass completions in a career (#5, 463), passing yards in a game (#1, 479), passing yards in a season (#5, 2,794), passing yards in a career (#5, 5,717), touchdown passes in a game (#2, 4), touchdown passes in a season (#3, 20), touchdown passes in a career (#4, 42), 300-yard passing games in a season (#2, 4), 400-yard passing games in a career (#3, 8), 400-yard passing games in a season (#1, 2), and 400-yard passing games in a career (#2, 2)."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football offensive players: total offensive yards in a season (#5, 2,851), total offensive yards in a career(#5, 5,770), total offensive yards in a game (#2, 470), and two-point attempts in a game (#1, 3)."
"Brown was drafted by the Giants as the top overall selection in the 1992 Supplemental Draft. His first start came on December 12, 1992, when he was forced into the lineup due to injuries of Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler, and Kent Graham, dropping a 19–0 decision to the Phoenix Cardinals. To make matters worse, Brown himself was injured during the game and didn't play a down the rest of the season."
"Following Simms' retirement after the following season, Brown won the starting job in 1994 and helped guide his team to a 9–7 record, including a season-ending six-game winning streak. However, the Giants won only a combined 11 games in the next two seasons and their offense finished statistically worst in the league in 1996. This finish led to the firing of Dan Reeves, and the hiring of noted QB guru Jim Fassel."
"After injuring his chest during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Brown lost his starting job in 1997 and was never able to re-claim it. Jim Fassel went the rest of the season with Danny Kanell at quarterback and had an unexpected run to the playoffs and division title. In the off-season Brown was signed by the Arizona Cardinals to play primarily as a backup, and he ended up finishing his career in 2001 with Arizona."
"Following his career in professional football, Brown moved on to investment management."

"Cyber Sunday was an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). From 2004 to 2005, the event was known as Taboo Tuesday and was exclusive to the Raw brand."
"During the event's ""Taboo Tuesday"" years, it was the first regularly-scheduled pay-per-view held by the company on a Tuesday since 1991's This Tuesday in Texas, the first regularly-scheduled non-Sunday pay-per-view since the 1994 Survivor Series, and the first non-Sunday pay-per-view of any kind since in 1996. The inaugural event was held in October, and the 2005 event was pushed back to early November. By 2006 the show was moved to a more traditional Sunday night slot—alleviating problems with the taping schedule of ""SmackDown!"" (usually held on Tuesdays)—and renamed Cyber Sunday."
"The most distinctive feature of Cyber Sunday was the ability for fans to vote on certain aspects of every match. The voting typically began in the middle of an episode of ""Raw"" a few weeks beforehand and ended during the pay-per-view, often moments before the match was slated to begin. Because of this, Cyber Sunday was billed as an ""interactive pay-per-view"". For the first four events, voting was made online through WWE.com, with the official tag line for the PPV being """"Log On. Take Over."""" In 2008 however, this was replaced by votes through text messaging but this was only available to United States mobile carriers. However, the match between The Undertaker and The Big Show was made universal, as fans were allowed to vote for the match stipulation on WWE.com."
"In 2009, the event's Pay-Per-View slot was replaced by Bragging Rights. However, the fan interaction aspects of the pay-per-view have since been incorporated into ""Raw"" as ""WWEActive"" (originally ""RawActive"") for most ""Raw"" episodes."

Anchor stores include Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, JCPenney, Macy's, Sears, and Target."
"In the early 1980s, a proposal for a two-story indoor mall in Poughkeepsie, New York was submitted. Despite much conflict and many protests, the proposal was submitted, and the mall opened on August 1, 1987 as the Poughkeepsie Galleria Mall."
"Upon opening, the mall had five anchor stores: G. Fox & Co., Jordan Marsh, Lechmere, Filene's, and J. C. Penney. Due to underperformance, the Filene's store closed in 1989 and was replaced with Steinbach, which relocated from South Hills Mall next door. Sears also announced plans to relocate from South Hills Plaza at the same time. Steinbach closed in 1995 and became Dick's Sporting Goods and DSW Shoe Warehouse the same year. Filene's returned to the mall in the early 1990s by taking over the defunct G. Fox chain, while Sears ultimately opened at the mall after Jordan Marsh was vacated. Montgomery Ward also moved into the mall in the early 1990s, becoming the sixth anchor and replacing an existing store in Poughkeepsie."

"There are other ways to collect award miles when not travelling. The Lufthansa Miles & More Credit Card can be subscribed to (which may be issued as a VISA, MasterCard or American Express card, depending on the country in which it is issued) and at least one award mile for every two Euro spent. A one-time sign-up bonus is given and sometimes introductory promotions may apply, such as double or triple award miles for an introductory period."
"Award miles can be earned on certain Deutsche Bahn trains, when staying in certain hotels, shopping in certain shops (such as the LH Worldshop), renting cars, investing in certain funds, opening an account with certain banks, picking up a catalogue in a Bang & Olufsen store, and others."
"For all offers see Miles & More website as offers vary between countries. However, all these offers do not earn any status miles."
"Once a member has collected the necessary number of miles, they can be used to buy flights, upgrades and products from the Lufthansa Worldshop (offer restricted to residents of some countries only)."
"Miles in a member's account can be exchanged for award flights on all the fully integrated airline partners and all of the Star Alliance carriers. The number of miles that is deducted from the account depends on the origin and destination of that flight. The number of miles that is required can be checked in this file. Additional fees and taxes will still apply for award flights (but can be paid by additional miles). Since the beginning of 2017, with “Cash & Miles” members have been able to use miles flexibly for their flights, and thus, to reduce the amount of money to be paid."
Lufthansa does add fuel surcharges hidden as fees on award tickets. This is prohibited for US based carriers. A transatlantic award flight (regardless which airline is actually flown) with Miles and More can cost up to 500 EUR in additional taxes and fees whereas the same itinerary booked with the US based Star Alliance partner (United) and their miles would cost less than 100 EUR in fees and taxes (even if the itinerary involves Lufthansa aircraft). So Miles and More may have a much lower value than US based Miles.
"In September 2016, Miles & More adjusted the flight award table, thereby reducing the international / national surcharge per flight distance for domestic European premium flights. Miles & More thereby takes over a part of the regular surcharge. Participants now pay €5 instead of €35 in economy classes and €20 instead of €43 in business class with Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SWISS and brussels airlines. The number of miles required for a flight award inside Europe was adjusted slightly, increasing by 5,000 award miles for return flights."
"Miles can be redeemed for upgrades on all fully integrated carriers of Miles & More and on the following Star-Alliance partners: All Nippon Airways (ANA), Asiana Airlines, Condor Airlines, Singapore Airlines, TAP Portugal, Thai Airways International, United Airlines. Again the number of miles required depends on the destination of the flight. The exact number is found on . Passengers are only allowed to upgrade one class of service. Only certain booking classes qualify for upgrades."
"Miles can be redeemed for rental car, hotel, shopping, banks & insurance, telecommunications & electronics industries etc. Moreover, the Miles & More GmbH also continues to expand its offers in relation to travel. The hotel booking portal Miles & More Hotels already makes it easier for users to book the accommodation they need quickly, giving members the opportunity to earn at least 1,000 miles per night or to redeem their miles. In addition to this, the Miles & More rental car service allows members to redeem miles to book rental cars. Avis car rental in US costs 47,000 miles at the minimum, finding a Hilton hotel and shorting the list based on miles is impossible, selection of hotels in Best Western is very limited (The hotels are available in Best Western but most of the hotels in the list in US are NOT available for miles)."
"Members of the programme also earn award miles when paying their purchases with their Miles & More credit card. Holders of the Miles & More Credit Card Gold benefit furthermore from unlimited mileage validity. Programme members use more than 1.4 million Miles & More Credit Cards in Germany and 22 additional countries, primarily in Europe, America and Asia."
On Miles & More all customers can build status through collecting status miles. The status miles from 1 year only count towards status. Status is important as there are many privileges and advantages that status holders receive (such as priority check-in).
There are four status levels on Miles & More:
"This is the normal status that everybody gets after they join the program. This status does not receive any officially documented privileges. A Miles & More member starts with a temporary paper-card, which is usually cut out from one of the Lufthansa magazines or printed from the internet; a plastic card is sent once the member has credited at least one award mile to their Miles & More account."
"The frequent traveller card is given to all Miles & More customers that received a total of over 35,000 status miles or had 30 flights. This status remains valid for two years and a member can requalify in any one of those two years. All status cards expire in February of the third year, i.e. if status is earned in November 2009, the status will be valid until February 2012."
As a frequent traveller a passenger receives a number of privileges:
"Having collected 100,000 Status Miles within one calendar year, Miles & More members will receive ""Senator"" Status with a validity of at least two years."
The main benefits of Senator status are:
"Having collected 600,000 HON Circle Miles within two calendar years, Miles & More members receive HON Circle Status with validity of two years."
The main perks of having HON status are:

"Kenneth McLaren DSO (sometimes known as Kenneth MacLaren), (1860–1924) was a Major in the 13th Hussars regiment of the British Army. After his military service he assisted with the growth of the Scouting movement founded by his friend Robert Baden-Powell."
"In 1898 McLaren married Leila Evelyn Landon, who died in 1904. He married Ethyl Mary Wilson in 1910 despite the advice of Baden-Powell, who considered her below his station."
"McLaren had schooled at Harrow and studied at Sandhurst before joining his regiment, the 13th Hussars in 1880. He was posted to India, where he served as regimental adjutant and later aide de camp to General Baker Russell. In South Africa he was gravely wounded at the Siege of Mafeking in March 1900, and taken prisoner by the Boers. He was created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1900."
"McLaren played polo throughout his military service, and was umpire of one of the two matches in the 1908 London Olympics."
"McLaren first met Baden-Powell (also a 13th Hussars officer) in 1881. Although McLaren was 20 at the time, Baden-Powell nicknamed him ""the Boy"", on account of his appearance. The two became fast friends, their relationship being one of the most important friendships in Baden-Powell's life."
"McLaren was recalled to military service in World War I, but retired again in 1915 due to ill-health."
"McLaren was one of the staff at Baden-Powell's Brownsea Island Scout camp in 1907. Baden-Powell convinced McLaren to be his first manager at the C. Arthur Pearson Limited office of ""The Scout"" magazine but McLaren resigned that position in March 1908."
