"You know he just bought them from  sale or whatever it was, sixty, seventy quid  bit of polish."
They were  not mistaken.
"Did, he did well."
"Some of them have a lot of stuff, you know I don't seem to ever get hold of the stuff me, to  tables and that  little Eric in there he seems to get loads of stuff"
Yeah I can't

"He's got a lot of connections Eric, you know and"
I have very few I'm afraid.
There you go.
Thank you.

Mm
and he erm  he was very upset about it.
Then he  by that time this expensive  and that's the one that's .
So he said   start again.
"You're still paying out that's the trouble, all the time."
Well that's it.
"But on the other hand, what can you do about it?"
You can't
"No, no it's oh no you can't go round gummy."
"We're going to, we've, we've got this  going down to  for three weeks, you know next weekend  or the weekend afterwards, and we don't keep getting appointments, see I'm gonna keep ringing him up and pestering him and saying"

It must be about three weeks ago.
Can't think what it was for now.
I think it was one of those impromptu ones.
I know  it wasn't my birthday you just came in with it didn't you ?
It's  birthday.
I mean the only trouble is they're no use afterwards are they?
Must have had a brainstorm
I said they're no use afterwards are they?
I don't  I don't know.
Because they're forced I reckon.
Oh.
I think they'll grow if you put them in the garden  eventually.
Well
"Well I mean they won't flower again, that's for certain you see and it's it's gotta be"
"No, well not this year anyway, they  they could"
Oh right.
"Have you got, oh ta look  take this as well."

I'm going to have a go at this   today.
"They've dried out a bit, been too tacky to do anything with."
"Bye bye chaps, don't let them out."
No  see you then.
Did they try and drag you up the farm yesterday?

Oh and you kept them off the road did you?
You didn't just er

"Ooh I  number again, I'll take it out in a minute."
Yeah.
Oh no
"And er she said well, I said I'm ever so sorry but she's  anyway  so I thought oh God!"
That's a step in the right direction.
Yeah.
I rang
Yep
Dee dee dee doo doo .
"You can't, you don't go through to that office at   I go further on"
Yeah.
but they are amalgam is it
Yeah
"amalgamating, with another firm so the paper work probably has got lost  So I"
"she said she was gonna ring me back, but you see I haven't been here this afternoon so I'll perhaps ring again tomorrow."
Okay.
"Well I couldn't do nothing about it really, she said well that'll be sorted out in  she said I'll treat it, we're now sorting it out today what we're doing."
Mm.
"So I said well I hope it's not gonna be too long I said cos we're not a  a very big firm  and I said, you know, we want the money!"
She said well I should imagine that's what's happened  the paper work here has got muddled up with the other.
Oh.
So she said I'll do I'll sort it out straight away for you  well I had a phone call at
"eight o'clock this morning, who the hell that was from, I don't know, I was out the washing line  I come flying in but I never got it, and nobody's rung."

Can you take it off the
Mhm.
music as well though if you had to?
If somebody gave you a bit of sheet music?
No.
No I would have to learn the tune like by listening to the
Aha.
to the person singing.
Aha.
"That's the only way I would  learn a tune, I couldn't sight-read the"
Mhm.
the music off a sheet.
Right.
Do you have you ever had a go at the piano or that?
"No, though I would like to have been able to have played, I can remember saying to my mother once, I would like to have been able to have learnt the piano."
And er but of course they couldn't afford to buy me a piano to learn on so
Mhm.
that was it.
Any other instruments
Mhm.

I that I like?
"Or would have, to listen to?"
"To listen to, to listen to, mhm."
"I like the guitar, I like to listen to the guitar, not the classical stuff, I'm sorry to say but, I like to listen to the guitar."
"Or er a clarinet, I like the sound of"
"Aha, aha"
"Dunno, well that's the situation."
"I think you're allowed  you're allowed to make thirty pound a week profit  fifteen hundred pound a year, anything over fifteen hundred pound  on your business  they   gotta pay tax."

"the people that have  left are sort of in the recession and that now, there's all the  really big business people and that  that have come down to the same level as everybody else."
That's right.

Thursday night I was living in dread of the choir.
"And I trundling along the district line to the Embankment across to Sloane Square  and then hello, hello, I didn't expect to see you here."
Oh oh!
I never met anyone on the tube before from choir.
And I'm sure my face was a picture.
I was just
appalled!
I was just thinking about what a horrendous evening it had been the night before and then he
confronted me
with his awful beard and everything.
Oh I dunno.
Is there anyone in
And I had
"the choir that lives near you, or  sca , can travel with you?"
"Actually there's Paul, the guy who'd given me a lift to the concert and, and he mentioned going to the  , the film I saw, erm  but I knew he was going to the pub, he always goes to the pub afterwards."
"So I pa , I told one girl in the choir what had happened, and I think to begin"
And what did she say?
with she thought I was overreacting cos she didn't really  respond.
Is she married or what?
"And then , she is married."
"Er erm  and then later on I, I, I think maybe she did realize, you know, cos I said  I wasn't prepared for that and that hasn't happened before."
"I didn't want to think, her to think that I was a show-off, you know"
Yes.
"oh I have fun with men all the time, chasing them and that."
Mm mm.
In my dreams!
And  er er
"she, she said to me on the way o , er as I was  I said look I'm going to  scoot now and she said well I hope you don't get any unwanted company on the way back."
And I really felt on edge walking back to

Spent four hundred pounds on it.
"They, they had a documentary on Metros apparently and the Me they said that Metros of a certain period for about, I think  from his period sort of  A registration, B registration, Y registration  they're absolute rubbish apparently."
Yeah.
"You know, all the rusting and everything, they've improved now."
"The Me if he had a Metro now he'd, you'd get a better deal but they said that"
They're cheap though aren't they?
Well yes but not cheap if you have to keep replacing them and
Think he'll probably buy a new car  probably.
photographic  photo service.

And yet  two or three years ago it used to stop up there.
"Now you stop further, now you're almost stopping on the lights."
I promise you a pound if you

"Oh I'll give you , I'll give you a pound don't worry, make sure you do the job properly, mm  you'd better do it outside, cos the er, the boot polish don't go on the carpet."

"So with that  call it coincidence, call it what you like  but one of these low-loaders come in  to pick up a caravan or something like."
"And I said there you are, he's there waiting to pick my caravan up."
He was empty you see.
I don't know who he was.
And she said wait here Mr  and in she goes in to this bloody meeting  and out he came.
And he said I'm sorry Mr  but you haven't got an appointment.
"I said do you want me to have an appointment, do you want to listen to this tape?"
Or do you want me to take my caravan off here?
He said why?
I said because I feel I'm being .
I said I'm not getting a fair square deal here.
"I said and not only I think that, other people on the site think so."
He asked me if I could wait five minutes.
when I'm in there.
And Darren was on a day off and he's been .
And Darren come in  spoke to me and he says  oh I  Danny.
I said no you bloody won't.
You'll get in that office with me.
I said I want him in there.
He sold me the caravan.
And I went in there.
I says now  have you had any visitors from   a couple of nights in my caravan.
No he said.
I said I think somebody's saying some untruth to me.
I said because I've got a tape here  and there's a couple  who'll go to court if necessary.
And I said is my caravan being cleaned weekly  as people go out if they've got it for a fortnight fortnightly.
Yes he said.
I said well you play that  I said cos I've played it back.
"And out he goes and gets this woman and in she comes with a chart  with a woman's name  the job number, that done it week by week or fortnight, whatever it does."
And that is all there and signed that she done the caravan.
It's her signature.
Her signature.
Oh they go  if he starts singing!
Why!
Cos  singing?
"So he dropped a metal pallet on  purpose  and course, it makes a hell of a row!"
"Yeah  well I would of thought it'd been nice, been nice to have"
Well
somebody happy around instead of miserable.
"Yeah but he, he is rather loud."
Is he always singing?
Oh terrible!
I wouldn't mention it.
I suppose he does it on purpose don't he?
Yeah.
Never mind singing.
"I ha I had sort of few, few words with him this morning."
With who?
"Cliff, Cliff ."
Why?
Cos of that   come in front again.
we do.
I never said nothing mm  cos
Why aren't you drinking that?
Yeah when I've had this.
"I never said anything  then he er  I could see he'd gone cos he just stood there  for about ten minutes like th and everybody else was working, he just stood there like this for about ten minutes by the rack  see him doing nothing  I never said nothing  he come charging through with a rack  and knocked all the pallet over what they just stacked up  with fifty boxes on  so we had to  make that right  and he stacked a load of L T M boxes which are temperamental anyway  and he hadn't pulled the wrap tight so as soon the bloke lift them up with the forklift, they fell all over!"
They fell over.
Ooh Christ!
"And then I'd  I'd had enough  and then he started messing about and he started pushing the boxes down through my strapper  then, course that messed the strapper up!"
So I
Did it?
I was doing the lift.
Oh!
He said what's the matter?
Oh  and how you
pocket
Yeah.
and clip the thing on there and they'll think it's a bloody  radio or something!
"Yeah you wanna get some headphones for that as well, then that makes all"
I've got some headphones.
Yeah well they're not made to work are they
They're at work
cos they
No I can't afford this.
"No you don't plug them in, just put the wire in your pocket  then they'll think they can just listen to music."
"Well then they won't talk to me  they won't take any notice anyway, if they do, I've got a letter I can tell them what I'm doing."
Go on  expla a letter will make a
Well drink up!
people if they say what the hell are you doing.
You what?
Hey down!
Just drink it
She's stirred him up.
properly!
If people say to you
I'm drinking it properly
"what the hell are you doing, you give them that  and if they say they don't wish to be on the tape  you have to erase their voice."
Oh.
Na
Some people might not object  although it's anonymous
Me.
no one knows whose voice it is but
It's nanny
Me go  me go.
I've got about ten of them to give people if they ask  we what are you doing.
Look a
Yes.
And then we paid for a winter clean.
And it's filthy!
Mm.
I had to go down there twice
To get it done!
Okay?
Because the windows were filthy!
"Twice, that we argued  ."
"Well, well  you came here didn't you when the curtains hadn't been"
Jump down then Phillip!
"And when I spoke to Mr , I said well  if I was renting a caravan and went to see it and it was dirty like that, I wouldn't want to take it on!"
"And, I said surely you have somebody who goes round and checks them before they're let?"
"No, he said!"
"So what they do is, apparently they wait for somebody to complain"
Yeah.
and then they look at the caravan!
Do they?
That's somebody who comes up to rent it!
So I said and in that case then  probably  you move them into another caravan?
"Oh no, we clean it and  they go into it!"
"I said, you mean to say people wait around while you clean the caravan?"
I don't believe it!
"You're alright , you're alright for your holiday, find a caravan dirty, you've gotta complain before it gets cleaned!"
Ha!
People will !
They can complain to the Tourist Board.
to be done when he was he.
Should be bloody licensed!
You can did you say?
You can.
You can't!
"Tell me darling, what have you really had to eat today while I've been away?"
While you've been away?

I'm ever so considerate.
"Did I tell you Steve's car conked out last week, again?"
The Capri?
Yeah.
Points.
No.
Points?
Yeah he had to put new points in.
"Last night he had to put new plugs in, they were brand new before he crashed it weren't they?"
It's probably cos
Could've been.
They refused point blank and he had to take it to another garage.
Did you send another bill?
Yeah.
"No i I phoned insurance up and told them what they'd said, cos I got Maggie to phone, it were Maggie that said, they told Maggie that they were gonna put a second hand wheel on and everything instead of a brand new one so she told insurance  about it ."
"They went mad, they told us that we'd got to take it to National Tyres, took it there, twenty three pound fifty it cost us."
"What's that for, tracking?"
"Tracking and balancing it, none of it were done."
"They had to do the lot so they give us an invoice, we took it in to insurance and they're gonna write a cheque, deduct it off that thing"
Mm.
and send us the cheque back.
Cos they should've done it.
Send you cheque back?
Yeah.
Mm.
so can we talk about what your losses are?
We w suggest that you have losses under the heading of er

Extended plus services for diverted traffic and so on.

"So we got behind  So I said well we'll tr I'll try and get caught up  sort of, in the new year  you know, get them  a bit ."
Actually I think I'm gonna finish that catalogue anyway I'm just

"So I explained to them, I said well that's cos you changed over  and I sort of never put it across through  oh she said well don't worry I've done it now, she said you haven't got anything to worry about now, I said well it did bother me a bit  to think that  I didn't think you had my payment!"
"Oh yes she said, we've had it  I thought well why send me letters,then!"
Well that's a standard letter I suppose and
"Well that's what she said, that's a standard letter."
"Yeah  the only trouble is, you know, standard letters don't always sort of"
Well you get some little old dear what runs the
That's right.
catalogue to
Yeah.
.
No that's him
You've been in it!
that's him  on the phone
So have I!
he was saying all the sort say at work you know that they   they don't know and they start on about er
You have been a  .
"you ruin your chances so  about three times a week the  comes in to arrange my poll tax and all this  and they get going you know well why should a bloke that  having a big house and he only pays the same rate as them  so I said, well it's like this as far I'm concerned I said  you know  no bloke  works perhaps twice as many hours as you do  he chooses"
haven't you?
Yeah  yeah.
"When I said, I think that's wrong!"
Yeah.
"The only time you don't pay a self-employed stamp  is if you  your business  earns,yo you can actually get away it, if you've lost money on your own business  on paper  or if you've  earned"
Well we have!
Why have you got it?
"Yeah tha that's what I'm saying, I ain't got to."
You haven't got to pay it?
No
What about that last lot?
"Ah that's , what they've said once you've paid it, you can't get it back, and if you don't pay it they can't insist you pay it."
Well you haven't paid it.
No I paid the last one though.
Well you can't stop paying it now.

Yes.
activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
"Yes cos most,o most of that one barrier, it said on the news that they're o automatic."
That's right.
So
They have er special cameras which  they take the line of the trains both sides.
Mhm.
"And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers  the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you."
So it's a very silly thing to do.
Yes.
Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going across.
Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across.
"But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come"
"If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway  er th ah  there's only way you can escape."
Go round by the barrier pole.
"Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield."
Yes.
The barriers
Er
.
they've got full barriers you see.
Full barriers.
Double are safe.
"Well, they're different because they have them  they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're"
Yes they are controlled.
controlled by a television.
Er
"If they're controlled  well dad, everyone knows that one th the Tackleby's controlled by a man."
Oh yes.
That was good wasn't it?
Yes.
"Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box didn't you?"
No it's alright!
"But this, this bloke has sort of said, ooh he said, apparently one of the blokes  that were working for him said  that he had overheard him saying they were gonna burn the coach out."
Oh!
"And if this chap said, the one that took it that night, he said there is no point in him doing it because he didn't have the coaches insured for enough."
No.
No.
"He took this bloke in, he didn't have a job."
Isn't it mean?
Mm.
You know the er
It is.
"Cou po , could possibly"
Yeah.
going on the what not.
And did this chap do it?
They don't know who did it.
No.
"They tried to make Jim had done his own coach, the one that took us over"
Yeah.
there.
Yeah.
"But he le , they let him go off on holiday in the end."
It wa it was the night before they went on holiday.
How depressing Marg!
"I mean I can understand it in this day and age, people trying to"
Get their money back.
Yeah.
Get their money from insurance policies and try and make their money back
"I suppose what it really amounts to, it's probably someone who's in the same line of business  and they're trying to get the best way aren't they?"
Mm.

"I'm looking, I'm from sort of like"
in the conditions.

Yeah.
I understand what you mean.
"Danny's point is valid there because when you're reading a legal document, T, the T N T Express U K will hereafter be known as the carrier"
Carrier.
"he's put, so we wrote"
So really that's saying the title
"Yeah, the legal"

"That's what I'm saying, so  er, just er interpretation of the question slightly misleading there."
Right.
No worries.
What is a definition of a consignment?

"Yes, it'll be worth following that up, cos that's, that's one of the erm, they, they've done quite a lot of work of Amnesty and general studies in the past, there was a sheet of sort of quotes of, how good the Amnesty  was, and there was one from the teacher at Birchwood or what, what's Margaret Dane School, so erm, yes, if, if you could definitely follow that up erm John"
Yeah.
cos that'll be a very useful school to have interest .
Erm.
"Erm I also have a letter er from a Kate , I'm not sure from which school she goes to, but she's fourteen and she's going to one of the local schools,"
Mm.
"but, erm, she was hoping to come to the meeting this evening, but she phoned at the last minute and said she couldn't make it, but erm, I don't know if it would be more appropriate perhaps for the schools groups to get in touch with her and I"
Did she leave her name and .
"Er, yes, but I, it's at home."
"Yes, could you, perhaps you could find out which school she's at"
"Yes, okay."
Erm.

"And then if, if it's fine with her, we'd have some, well you'd let you know,contact"
", what's the time ."
"Alright, yeah, okay."
Right.
"Because it's, I mean  it would be very good if we could have several schools"
Yeah.
interested.
"Er  have you got, all these people waiting to be told ."
You'll end up with about a dozen letters on mantel again cos I always forget to post things.
Well I'll post that tomorrow.
Well there's no rush.
"Aye you can, yeah."
"Well usually if there's not a stamp wanted, is there a stamp wanted?"
No.
"Yeah usually if there's no stamp wanted I get one of lasses while I'm at work, they'll drop it off for me."
I always say will you do me a favour and they shove it in box.
Erm  ah

And traffic.
"Traffic and all sorts, see I were talking to Joyce this morning"
Mm.
"and, I meant to listen to it but I forgot"
Oh.
"and there were buses and lorries and, quite a lot of the tapes, they've got buses and lorries and all sorts, with working outside."
With you being a lollipop lady it's bound to happen innit?
Mm.
Haven't you thought of going back to doctors?
Haven't you thought it costs three pound bloody sixty a prescription?
"Yeah, and he always writes me out a couple and I ain't got the money."
Tt.
a lot of our clients
"But on a bigger job you can, you can put the resource in can't you?"
Yeah.
"But a lot of our client's finance sections, don't see the difference between a big and a little job they see some pigeon holes in their spreadsheet and they want to put something in there."
Anything.
"And th they, they've got this sort of"
But this is where we need to talk to the client
Yes.
Of course they are.
isn't it?
"J j just agree with client he might, might be  prepared to accept on a quarterly basis"
Yeah.
you know?
I mean we don't necessarily have to give him it every month.
One could argue
Yeah.
if we're not careful we'll be causing him work.
Oh.
know what they want half of them anyway when they're
Ah.
Let us halt it there.
the customers.
Yeah.
As er I said before.
"Let us sit down, Trev, and see what is sensible"
for us to provide them with.
"Go and talk to them and say look, this is what we can provide to you."
It will be meaningful.
Is that good enough?
"And the chances are they'll say, bloody hell, that's marvellous."
Because what they're getting now is nothing.
Mm.
Well!
not!
He was never the Prime
"He wasn't, Michael Foot?"
Oh I know he put  in there.
Oh no he
He should of been.
He's never been president of
He was very outspoken he was a very outspoken
He should of been!
He was leader of the
But the first
bloody  only the  the way they should dress!
"Ah, yes well ah, that's got nothing to do with it!"
Oh!
But now it has!
I mean he's probably got more money than they've bloody got!
The  it's all a blind anyway those rags he goes round in!
"Duffel coat, he got he got censored"
There's
because he wore a duffel coat instead
Well it's like
That man underneath a duffel coat
What did Ken  say about this chap from Vauxhalls?
"Convena did all his work  and they asked him to go to London  you know, there's some was on years ago  so he goes to the headquarters and he said he just couldn't believe it, he turned on him and said  you're a shallow bloody hypocrite he said!"
Those lads down there they're fighting  living on their ruddy  strike pay  and look at you lot!
He said they were there the whisky was flowing  you know hypocrites!
"And he said, oh come on you're here have a bloody good"
Well
time you know.
on your argument then  anybody who  who works their way up through the ranks and gets to the top  has gotta become corrupted!
"That's what you're saying, no ma"
Mm.
Mm.
"Also, we are a much more tolerant society, generally."
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"We can encompass people who are a bit different nowadays, which they couldn't."
Yeah.
Couldn't in those days.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
"I think they use the phrase now, do their own thing."
"That  yeah, yeah, yeah"
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
"Yes, yeah."
"So we now have erm, reference to the bible and the erm, prodigal son."
"The prodigal son was a black sheep to his father, and to his older brother."
But how different were the reactions of the two.
"His adventure started off quite normally, as I'm sure you'll remember from the erm, from the parable."
"Every child must break away from the parental fold, and establish his own personal identity."
Things began to go wrong when he got into bad company.
He had then asked for his share of his inheritance.
"He wanted it then and there, not later."
"With money in his possession, was he a pray to the unscrupulous."
I'm sure he was.
He had journeyed into a far country.
That showed initiative.
But did it cut him off from the guidance he needed?
"The story relates, that he spent all."
"He was not prudent enough to have saved, so he began to be in want."
.
"I could, seems to though they're getting stronger on this than ."
"Mm, it's come to the front of the journal hasn't it  section"
Yeah.
mm.
"One, one  er stress in my, on what happens so that, that it's companying it's been manufacturing leg irons that's been going out there to the Nile, hasn't it, wasn't it to ."
"They didn't mention , they'd mentioned somewhere else, but erm"
Somewhere.
I think it was Central America wasn't it?
Wasn't it Saudi?.
No.
Saudi they had some sort of electronic torture chamber
Thing  electric  was
"Oh yeah, the erm, the house of  or something."
Yeah.
"Wasn't one of the chair was, though the man held up, held  arms was it?"
"He wasn't   an, I think he was ."
"Oh, perhaps erm"
Got a number of .
"yes, mm, one wonders what a British company are doing manufacturing leg irons anyway in the twentieth century ."
"No  when you get to, when you get to the magazine, I'll see  on the front cover ."
Yeah.
It's not  it's very .
"Right, anything else from Headquarters?"
"Erm, I know there's a world  conference at the assembly, central hall, Westminster, twenty second of February."
"It's Bury St. Edmunds interest in Asian we generally go if we've got an Asian prisoner, we haven't, perhaps it's of opinion ."
"Sorry I missed that, Asian week."
As
"conference, on the twenty second of February."
"Er raffle tickets, have a raffle ticket."
.
"I'll give it to Peter, are you interested in that Peter, or ."
Mm.
And I think we ought to get him over to one of our meetings.
And  and he said he would.
And I think if we could make it get one of the Uttlesford  chaps to the same meeting
marvellous thing they did.
Yeah.
Well what he did say was don't  you know  don't go over the top in criticizing that because
Yeah.
you know he he says that there's a lot of things which are happening.
He's got all sorts of schemes  a lot of schemes in the pipeline.
I suppose he doesn't want to be seen to be just reacting to your letter he's obviously started doing these things off his own bat anyway hasn't he?
Oh yes.
Yeah.
I mean and and he he feels that er  pressure groups like ourselves are very positive because it gives him a bit of  weight  when he's arguing for things.
Yeah
Well they can't push it from the top
But I mean  on a sort of wider thing  erm
Yeah.
You know one of the things that we could do  is to do another directory.
Yeah.
I think  because I think I think
But
it's a real shame  we're so out of date.
Mhm  but I I you know we we're  can we actually do it?
I mean we would need  fifty people
No I would not distribute it
to deliver
er from door to door.
"I would erm put it out in the library, put it out in in surgeries."
Put it out in public places and that's it because  I mean  the number of people  erm they went to these directories like hot cross buns.
I mean every week I supplied them with a new stack of  everybody wanted them.
"What, the recycling directory?"
Yes.
"I I I I went to to a place first and er I  and I I went home you know, without them knowing."
mother took me back  by the hair
Mhm.
By my hair.
Did did they know you'd gone home?
Pardon?
Did they know that you went?
No.
No?
"What did your mother say then, was she cross with you?"
"No she said, Oh, she said, What do you want?"
"So I says, I I don't like there I want to go I want to come back."
"So she said, Look here my dear girl, she said, you go back and tell the lady that you"
Do you remember how much they paid you?
Pardon?
well there was a lot of call for that.
Mhm.
"And women worked in that department, whereas the men worked at the huge broadloom"
Mhm.
"looms which are very heavy, very heavy, and through fashion, fashion changing and I mean people don't have these things any more."
A lot of pubs and hotels will do the the their places out in these narrow sections so if one gets worn they can lift it up and
"Mhm, yeah."
replace it.
"But houses, when you're doing a house you, you don't tend to do that now, you just have your broad loom"
Mm.
and fit it in.
So in that relationship
"the d the, the women are redundant as it were."
Yes.
"There only is two, well there are two, one, they do shiftwork."
Mhm.
Yeah.
Measure  the works
re
"In, in, in, in the past"
words.
the resident engineer has been doing the measure and also agreeing the valuations.
Well I don't think
Now
what Hughie's saying is that that will be done
Th that responsibility
mutually
valuations because we've got this
Mm.
Perhaps you do.
"which, which"
Personally I don't think really there's a need for a great deal of site measurement.
"I think, I think it should all be, you know, basically it should be done from"
The offices.
because they've dug a big hole doesn't mean you measure the big hole.
It's all part of the measuring anyway.
You're paying for the hole they should have dug provided it was at least as big as they
In accordance with the  and the er the
what do you call it?
Yeah well.
The
Preamble.
preamble.
"Can I take it then, that these items will be clearly defined when the project coordinator discusses with the team quantity surveyor at the"
Who does what.
Yes.
Who does what because
Yes.
is it an important part of it?
yeah

"we'll have to take a, french kids and that talking"
oh yeah
that's to do with the Norway from English
"yeah, but, there's a thingy on it, they'll be a  but it ain't just us school, it's other schools in it as well"
"yeah I know, but, they, they'll all, there, the others is two schools is one after another school and we're the only erm boys school and it's not  an all girls school doing it, otherwise it ain't"
"no, there's more schools than that, cos er the lady said that er, she goes I'm, cos there is  when you  he went what schools are these?, and so reading out a couple of schools, about four of 'em"
and
"no, quite out far they were"

"how do you know it's thingy?, how do you know it's for the kids in Norway?"
"she said something about it in school, she goes she wants their names right and their occupation  cos say like you go to the butcher shop and then you go to  that and the other"
yeah
so Norwegian they learn in English don't they though
"oh yeah  oh but, yeah, but, this is gonna be done mostly on the streets in it for us?, so what they gonna learn about that?don't remember when thingy"
the last
remember when he hit the first stone and hit that car window
I don't
"well  this thing weren't it, it was parked up, this was ages"
yes
"this was two years ago, just before er activities week weren't it?"
he goes what
away and
he found that
legged it
My
It's with condensation of fat and everything  er with them just decorating all rooms and that it's
Ah.
"so you can have microwaves, toaster, kettle"
Yeah.

Yeah.
Oh I were just wondering.
Can't find clocks.
Can't find bugger all.
Oh so they'll be round here somewhere then won't they?
"Yeah, radio alarm clocks."
"I just wondered how much they are cos that one that er just disintegrated on me, I got it from Britannia."
It's rubbish.
It's never worked proper
Yeah.
"it sort of played about two or three minutes of music and then it went crrrkkkkkk for a few minutes, that's why I kept hitting it."
"And then music, if you hit it, music come back on."
Oh well
Stupid it were.
"Have to have a proper look later, I can't find it."
Ah found one.
"I says I can't find them, I found them."
Here we are
"what's that one, number four, number four   digital clock, mains operated, fast time, alarm set, snooze feature, battery back-up  four ninety five."
Not bad
That's not bad at all that.
No.
Seven ninety nine.
Six ninety five.
Six ninety five and a six fifty.
Very good.
"And they wouldn't mess about if you, you  they slapped you if you didn't do as you were told."
So that put me right off for a start.
But erm  you only get one good set don't you?
That's right.
I
"And also you see right from, right from pregnancy"
Well they get it free don't they?
At the moment.
yeah.
I mean er it's before they're  conceived that you've got to try to
"Oh yes, yes."
I mean it's no good  smoking yourself to death and then er
That's right.
falling for a baby and then saying
No no
oh dear
Well that makes me ill now.
"It didn't used to but when I, I, I, I feel like going up to these girls and saying for god's sake take that thing out of your mouth."
That's right.
When they're pregnant or they've got a little baby.
It's horrible.
I mean
But you know you can't tell people.
"This friend of ours who lost his wife last year, well we've got another friend who was very fond of her  she also smokes  we just happened to me we didn't say"
No.
I mean it's happened now so we never
Absolutely.
No you can't.
say to th this chap you know but  we just happened to mention in passing to Jeanette  and she really jumped and said oh Pat didn't smoke a lot.
But
Was it very sudden?
"we know via my daughter  she's a nurse and she said no  cancer  get a lot of uterine cancer and all this it's not, not in the lungs now."
I that's what I mean
Yeah
it's not like they're gonna be
no
like old times
in the morning
"That's right, I"
probably economise
You'd be no good working for
standing there waiting for
you'd be out
"as a fact  your hair at the back, don't tell anybody you're a hairdresser for god's sake."
Pardon?
Where's Kim?
"Over at Dave's, Dave's at er, we're talking about the er,"
"there, talking about the greengage and er, says oh to Jackie, he said, oh yes Stuart's the M C for tonight, M C, M C, what do I want M C for?"
I said well it gives them a bit of panache don't it?
"Well, oh probably, here we go, got one on"
ain't take
No
by the time you get up the road and get back  why people really
along here I don't know
"I don't know , I don't know"
you don't have
"I won't take this, I'll leave it here"
yeah
well you're using my
"well, in the left drawer on top of the fridge, lying beneath the fridge"
yes I know
"Ta ra love, see you later, take care now"
"She didn't say what, she's, she's had a bit of a set back since then, she's had gall bladder trouble you know"
Oh yes
"No  forty pints in two  like Saturday afternoon and Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and Sunday night, he got through forty pints  or perhaps just under forty pints but that's it."
Well is he an alcoholic?
Well he's always been able to drink like that  he's .
Well he's happy enough behind all this isn't he?
Well  well I dunno.
"Well I'm, I must admit I don't know."
But I was   the trouble
What?
is
He's rotting his stomach isn't he?
"yeah I mean, and the trouble is  what  n annoys me more than anything  is the fact that he's good worker  I me even when he's drunk, alright he don't work at full capacity  but he does sort of almost as much as what they do  and when he's"
Yeah.
"sober  he can do more than they do  I mean i that ain't the sort bloke you wanna lose, and I'm, when he balls and shouts at them  well he gets on your nerves really  but at the end of the day I'll  you know, I'll put up with it."
"You can put up with that, good God!"
"Yeah because he's a, he's a bloody good worker but  and when he's like  Cor!"
And the other morning  disgrace!
"The funny thing is, like  there's a beer smell isn't there?"
Yeah.
"But he has got the sort of  acidy sort of alcohol smell on his breath  just like you'd been on  spirits all night  or whatever, any sort of  you know, wine and  it's not a beer sort of smell."
"But I mean he's  I mean Ivan said to me, phworgh, he said when Cliff's breathing over you!"
"I said I know I said, just like neat alcohol innit?"
God he said!
Well I should think  that's   acidity in his stomach innit?
"Definitely  and he'll say I've got this pain, I've got this pain, I should think you have Cliff!"
"Oh it's not that, no it's not."
Where's he get the pain?
In his side.
In his side?
"I think he's rotting his liver, that's the feeling."
"Liver, yeah , exactly."
But you see he's that thick
.
Oh okay.
"Oh I suppose we've gotta, oh well what did we do last time?"
"I remember the problem was last time sending those little plans out, the Ormskirk you know?"
"Give them the drawing number so we sent a transmittal note, course we never got a transmittal note back."
It's best to avoid that.
Yeah.
"Erm  right well I think the thing to do is, on  beyond that is to make sure we work through the checklist."
Okay?
"Erm  Now layouts, site layouts."
Yeah maps and things.
So are you leaving the ball in my court on that?
On what?
On the statutory undertakers.
Cos I can probably get some information out of here.
I think i if you want  er I mean you're quite happy to draft a letter?
Yeah.
I mean that's a
I mean again
standard thing that goes to all of them
"we need to write them, warn yeah, and we ask them to let us know what they've got planned don't we?"
Yeah.
So you could send them a letter with a little diagram that
Yeah.
"I wonder how good that is, yes I think that's alright isn't it?"
"Then they wouldn't  they'd understand what we, that meant wouldn't they?"
Yeah but that's got specific things on .
True.
"Yeah well all we did for Ormskirk was, it was just an O S map and we just drew a bloody great circle round it"
and said this is the study area.
That's probably the best thing isn't it?
Yeah.
And blow up
"I will try and remind you about that, er, on other occasions, so that it doesn't er, slip into the recesses."
"Er, and the other thing, just to comment on the programme."
"I hope that we shall have the Deputy Lord Mayor, er, Bob  on the last Wednesday of our session."
"The reason the programme's taken so long, was to find a time when he's available."
"That Wednesday is in the school holiday, although we shall be continuing."
"It means that he can slip out of school, er, in the afternoon, when normally, in nor on a normal school day, he would not be able to do that."
"Erm, so I'm hoping that that will work, it's it's down in the diary for him to do that, and and I've given a little note about what the Adult School is all about."
"And I'll write to him to confirm, and er, if I do bump into him, I shall jog memory of that one."
"Erm, with the change of programme, then, the Black Sheep of the, of the Family."
"Er, which I have already found."
"It is on page a hundred and thirty- nine, for those of you who wish to er, follow."
It starts off with.
"Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have you any Wool?"
How does the black sheep of the nursery rhyme appear to children?
"Other sheep they see, are unlikely to be black, so a black sheep is different."
"They soon learn that anyone referred to as a black sheep, is not only different, but is regarded as being in disgrace."
This is all politically incorrect.
"Yes, yes, yes it is, indeed,"
I was thinking about that.
"isn't it, nowadays."
"Wh wh wha what shall we do, if they were saying a black sheep?"
Erm.
A green one.
"Erm, a green."
"Yes, yes, yes."
"I don't think you can even say, non-white, can you, nowadays."
Yes.
A Jacob.
a Jacobs sheep.
A Jacob.
A Jacob's sheep.
Yeah.
You have a lot of nicknames in the factory?
"Er  well er the just these two people that retired there, er they used to come  this man in a car from , that was their lift to their work."
And it was the days of the C B
Mhm.
"and he had this handle,a and er they were saying, we'll need to get ourself a handle,"
"ah, I said, well what about the Dolly Sisters?"
"So that stuck and eventually when that place folded and we came over here, er we just called them the Dollies and that was, they were referred to, everybody knew who they were,"
Aha.
the Dollies.
Aha.
"So that, that's a bit of it in there."
Aha.
"So you just basically, you all"
"A and, and"
know each other by your ordinary names?
Mhm.
You don't shout nicknames
Mhm.
"at each other, no?"
"Well not in our department anyway, I don't know, I can't speak for anybody else."
"Aha, right."
Although I've worked in nearly all the departments you don't really get to know the people that well.
Mhm.
"have we missed out anything, is there anything"
I don't know.
you'd like to tell us?
Cos we're novices at this.
Och aye.
I mean er does it bother you at all that  well I mean are most of the men managers?
Managers men?
Er the management
Where's the opportunities for like female apprentices and things like that?
I'll just ri rinse my fingers  hand cream on my hands.
"That  was used as er, I can't remember what Richard was using it as yesterday"
He was poking it
What're we going to do about these tiles for the step?
To cover this little hole up.
I hate to think what must be down there now.
"Oh, where're my other glasses?"
and they were cheaper than
Cheaper?
Fenwicks?
"Cheaper than what you call it, the place in  I've got the price"
Cheaper than the do it yourself shop up ?
But when can we get through to Newcastle?
"Well I, well I'm on a weeks' holiday aren't I, at Easter?"
"And I've got to go, unless we go to  Tuesday  been to the dentist"
Which Tuesday?
After they break up?
That's right.
Which is  next Friday
Yes
So I hope they've sorted out
The what?lin
The  appeal at the school that Mrs  was supposed to have let Miss White know so she could send it off to the parents to get the money back  scanner
You didn't tell me about that
I did tell you
You didn't.
"All you told me, hang on, ah"
Miss White
"all you told me was that Miss White was retiring but I hadn't to tell anyone, which I haven't done, which I don't intend to do"
"At the beginning of Lent, Miss White approached me to see what she should do about the  appeal"
Ah ha
"as she always does, since I said why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was plenty of children  locally?"
Have you rung up already?
Yeah.
Can't say owt if you
Tt.
What you tell them?
Slept in?
Told them I had migraine.
Tt.
"I'm running out of fucking excuses now, I'm going to write book out."
You'll have to remember what you've used.
Your grandma's dead four times.
Poor old grandma .
I'm a rotten bastard aren't I?
No.
Everybody does it.
You're not on your own.
"I tell you summat  I'm getting fed up because every time I don't feel absolutely great, and I go over there and say will you stand in for me, I don't feel well, I don't want to."
"It was an arrangement we had I, I wouldn't phone in  cos you have to wait three weeks for your wages  if I phone in."
"So I says I wouldn't phone in, I'd let you know and you could do it and I'll pay you myself, I don't mind, you know, losing a day's pay."
I said I'll pay you mysen.
"So er  she says yeah fair enough then she won't have to wait three week, cos it's only me that's losing, not her."
Yeah.
Anyway she's been going out on and off for quite a while now.
So I thought well I don't have to wait three weeks for mine so  next time I don't feel great  I'm gonna call in and take a couple of days off.
According to them I have had four weeks off in ten years.
That's it.
That's all I've had off.
"No I'm lying, four weeks in nine years."
Why's she looking at excuses not to do it like?
Er apparently they phone her up or summat and ask her if she'll go and stand in for other people and she turned round and says if I can't have this school I'm not doing any.
That's what she's been doing.
So
Do you know that bit where he was ha looking over the diving board and stuff?
That was Jonathan to a T.
We went swimming with Jonathan the other night and he got up on the top board and sort of and he was sort of like hanging on to the bar like this  looking over
"Oh god, that's  like."
and he couldn't do it and the worse thing was everybody in the pool had gone  go on
"What, what happened was Robert, Rob and me shouted, Robert  and me were there and who was it, Helen was there I think as well, his ex girlfriend  we were going  go on Jon, go on jump   and everybody in the pool started it  go on Jonathan"
"and he couldn't do it, he was so totally embarrassed and all the rest of it, he had to get down and everybody was  boo boo, chicken, chicken"
Oh he felt so wet.
I felt so sorry for him.
Can you do it?
Mm?

"there was one time I dove in and I hurt my back, I sort of like keeled over, kicked  well"
"Oh I know what you mean  you went in like that and your back, your, your legs went like that there?"
Yeah.
Ooh!
"But I've jumped off the second one, I haven't dived off the second one."
No way.
"I got up, I remember like I'd just  I'd just learnt to dive off the first one  like I was running down like, yes!"
And I got up with the intention of diving off the second one and I went no!
Jumped off it.

He wore those new shorts
Yes.
But

Excuse the long .
"Page fifty seven please your worship, Robert James , he is in the cells your worship sorry!"
So it will take a moment for him to be bought up.
There are apparently further charges to be put to him your worship  the charge of theft  and we charge him with handling stolen property.
He's only charged with one offence of criminal deception at the moment.

"I didn't know, I mean I could of spoken to ."
"Well you're the defendant, one would of thought yo yo yo know what'll happen to you!"
I haven't .
"you see and they're asking for people who could ref who could, you know, give references to cos like  put all these, all, down on these different things that you want like  you know, say you want  but then a lot of people just put down small business and management, something like that."
You'll end up with some real wanker like.
"Ah no then, no."
I don't mind if it's yous guys.
"Oh it wouldn't be me cos I'm, I'm doing it this year and I only thought of it too late"
Yeah.
"and I'd already put my other form in like to er I, and I was raging cos like I could've got  and sat in here for a fucking week"
Well you still can if  you want like .
"No I have to go and, have to go to this"
"No some other people were saying about that, you know, ah that they, you know  that they were gonna put in for it but they wouldn't let them cos it was  shop, you know, blah blah blah."
But I mean  yes certainly if it was y if it was you coming down but I don't want
It won't be me.
plonker that I don't know.
It wouldn't be me.
"No, no, that's alright"
You've not talked to me all day and then it's that sort of thing.
"Well I could probably get somebody who would be into comics like  and then that would maybe start you talking and then like, but he could still be an old wanker sure"
As long as
What's this?
Who's this?
I don't know who it is.
Someone called  Raoul
You mean Raoul as in
Raoul?
Friend of Johnny's?
Yeah.
"No, don't think so."
Is Raoul English or something?
"Er  no I just think his dad is  and they've just picked it up from their dad, you know."
It's not the   Rhythm guitarist the bass player  oh my goodness .
Oh they've got a drummer as well
a vocalist as well.
And mum and Chrissy slept in the car.
"and and th that's ri they were, they, mum was gonna stay at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train"
Yeah.
and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car.
"And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash."
Yes.
Thank goodness we didn't.
Well it was one of those things wasn't it?
Well it's a good job mum came.
Mm mm.
"I hope, I hope ."
Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we weren't sure what it was.
"It happened just after we went past the, just before."
You could see  er  a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards
I
the crossing.
And th th and they would be police ones if they'd got blue lights and
Mm mm.
"so did you, could you hear the sirens?"
No I couldn't.
"But erm  when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened  and we went to the toy fair and then we came back  and there was er  you could see all the ambulances and everything still there."
And the train was there leaning over.
But half of it was still on the rails.
Yes it was the front coaches went off.
Front coaches?
Onto the side I think.
Well what sort of express?
It was erm  well what do you think it would be?
Er  I think it must have been a multiple unit.
That's right.
It was a diesel multiple unit.
And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
"They ain't got  a mask or anything like Tutenkhamen has, have they?"
No  there was only one real mask.
Oh well that's   I've seen  Jimmy.
When do you see him?
In the .
What?
half past eleven  just now  literally just now  and er  and he  basically he don't know about  what he's on about.
Oh no!
"Nope, he don't know  erm  what he's saying is"
A lovely little man weren't he?
that blokes that's erm  dro been rigging it  who he does the things for.
Why?
"Well, because he said  for obvious reasons, he said er  I didn't want  my name and address  mentioned."
isn't mentioned in the papers.
Now he's gonna wish we'd tell him  so he said erm
Well what has he done with it then?
"Oh it was genuinely gone  quite genuine, he said  you now, he had a , that we know about  but it had  genuine"
"Cor , it didn't do that!"
Well there are you  don't go near them.
Well we'll have to get our own then won't we?
So he said   choice  because it was his  property they contacted him  but he said what he's done is though right  there isn't anywhere near that amount!
He said we're talking about eighty or ninety
We're short on twenty two.
"We could  we can, ah no  no  in terms of money  he's talking about four or five thousand maximum."
Well
Where did you  get the twenty two from then?
Cos he told me there's three hundred gone.
Well Jimmy ought to tell her
"Well  you know what he's trying to do, he's trying up the claim  so when  back, he's still gonna get the amount that he wants  so he said t to  Jim  something about, he isn't paying the insurance  I said you're joking!"
He said I've insured it he said but I ain't paying  as well he said!
"If you're getting all the money he said, you can pay the premium!"
So erm  they're sort of having a few words at the moment.
Do I
No  when you're disqualified.
But don't apply for a driving licence in the meantime.
Yeah okay alright.
But er  you'll be in a far  safer position  if you actually produce your licence on the twenty fifth of October.

"Yes, you can leave the court room."
"Er, so yours is better Mrs ."
"Er number twenty one sir, the January ."
Sorry  twenty one?

"But there may be, there may be"
I think we're discussing two issues here.
"Can we, can we bottom the V O"
Yeah.
one as a start .
"I don't see there's a problem with the V O one, because"
It's
"nobody nobody can issue V Os unless they're delegated to do so, in, in the letter that's signed by me."
I rely on you gentlemen
"And, and they have got the permission of the project manager to spend that money."
Yeah.
Correct.
Yeah.
I rely on you gentlemen to make sure
Too right.
"that the people who are delegated, are competent to discharge those duties."
Yeah.
"An and I must admit that I wouldn't, I would not expect to see anybody delegated within the contract at less than M S one level."
"Because I just don't think they i they're competent to do the duties of the engineer's representative, because you need a knowledge of the contract."
Tt.
Well.
"There are some jobs that, that we get involved with  are very very small"
We've had John  on
Yeah.
John  's been on jobs and he's er
Well.
"He's been as the R E, which is reasonable to be fair."

"and I see, when he sees me park there, flash me, I just follow on, you know"
So I
"what he can do is have something when he gets up, rather than the old"
something sort of
"Yeah well, I don't, I don't get a dinner before I go up to bed."
Well what you got then?
I don't know I think it's Wednesday week

About six months.
Why are you homeless?
"Well I used to share a, share this flat with my mate and erm  you know, she got a bit out of hand, she kept bringing  all these people home and she kept having these parties and it was really difficult for me to study cos I used to go  well I still try to go to college, but erm  you know, it was really hard for me to study  and made my life really, really difficult!"
"Isn't it more difficult now though, if you're homeless?"
Ya.
How do you get time to study?
"Well, you know I, just doesn't really matter any more, the point is surviving."
"But I mean, when I was living with her we just had all these arguments cos, you know, I just never got any peace!"
"There are  sometimes I could find this quiet little  place somewhere and just think, you know, it's really nice."
"But, what about your family?"
Can't you go home?
"Well, I could do but I, you see, I haven't got the money to get home and  you know"
Where do you live then?
I live up in Scotland somewhere.
Somewhere?

"No, some  just erm"
Somewhere!
Do you beg?
By Loch Lomond.
Do you beg?
Oh yeah!
"Well, sometimes, but you see  you know, people aren't willing to give anymore."
And there's so many homeless people that
Mm.

Do you blame them?
"yeah you haven't got, you touch fucking little shit head"
what
"shit head, shit head"
fuck you
"right, oh you don't live on bother, you fucking cheap oh big Jim blouse, cheap back and side"
is that enough information
what?
is that enough?
enough what?
you got enough?
"eh, I, I was supposed to do   well I was suppose to do ten, do you know how many I've done?"
no
"one side, not even one, one side, I'm doing now"
"no, oh Rick, Rick borrow  bikes weren't we?, so how come I done it?"
should of put it on your bike
"oh what?, what?, bung it on and drop it"
"Oh I have really, not, what I've done is I've taped one, one whole side and then I taped over it again by mistake"
oh
"what did  say, she ain't come yet?"
what about if she lets us keep the walkman
mm?
what about if she lets us keep the walkman's
"yeah, yeah, that'll be wicked"
"she wouldn't, I know she ain't  never do that"
is your tape recording?
yeah
oh no
"when a country makes a produc a product, whether it'll be fruit or food or, er clothes and sells them to another country  what is that called?"
"don't look at him, I've written the answer down  when a country buys the two, Mark take your coat off, give me your walkman, not suppose to bring to school"
it's a thing sir
they make
animals and crops
Right I I that's fine yes I'll
You see it makes it easier for us as well because it means that if you do if you are there we can leave you in charge for ten minutes while
Presumably Mark will run?
Yeah I would think so.
I'll tell him to give you a ring if it's
Yeah right I'll put him down with a question mark.
Oh it's nice to see people to see a good list of people who are going.
And I could put myself down as  in case I get there for a day or two.
And for candidates erm yeah I'll I'll stand I'll have to bite the boys again.
Yeah.
Talking of standing did did we ever make any progress on Fishergate?
We haven't got anybody.
John hasn't come back to us.
No.
Erm John  said he informed me he he'd stand for Monk again and he I told him to write write a .
John  's Monk.
Presumably in the selection ballot we don't have to
I think we do have
We can have su suggested
But we don't
wards.
But we don't definitely have to sign people.
Er so you were Clifton.
Which is erm Bill
That's Clifton.
That's Clifton.
I I'm certainly interested I'm quite interested in Bishop Hill unless anybody else wants it.
Erm again I mean I'm happy to give that if there's someone actually living in Bishop who wants it but erm I've got erm some someone who lives there wanted me to stand in.
Good reason to er.
Do you have any
Not at this time.
I guess I can stand somewhere.
It is.
"See a few of them, you know right at beginning where it shows you preface?"
Yeah.
"That's where it's jumped, not on the film itself."
"Yeah you know why, it's, it's because of cont continuous rewinding."
You always get damage at front of tape.
Best thing to do is just cut it off.
Ah we will do later cos
Well or yeah.
he uses  cuts it all off and gets rid of it.
"Yeah it's erm  any damage on tape, nine out of ten times i is the first foot  it's because when they wind them back i it, it's a jag"
tight innit?
complete jag all the time when they wind them back.
Yeah.
Aye well that doesn't bother us.
No.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta love.
"shorts and  so I thought right, clean or mucky, you're in the wash."
"So , thought I'll get them all washed and put back in bedroom before he notices they're missing."
So that's what I did.
"Now what we're on about   yeah as I were on about, that er  what I do is, with days like this, cos you can never guarantee  if they're gonna be dry, wet or what, so I watch to see if it rains, if it don't  they're virtually dry when I fetch them in."
So that's what I've been doing.
I don't know whose T-shirt's whose.
That one's mine.
So that's what I've been doing.
"I fetch them all in, stick them on clothes horse, they're all round fire while I'm on lollipop and then nip to shop and when I come in within half an hour they were bone dry."
Easy.
That's one way to do it innit?
Fetch them in at half past three.
But if they're dry I just fold them up and put them away anyway.
I'm just transferring socks.
"a and, and, and the S on the M as it were."
Yes.
Right.
"The oth the other, the other option is for us to hold that."
because it was supposed to be briefed last
Mm.
month.
"Well in that, in that case"
when
"I've seen, I've seen all this"
Mm.
in that case when
It is ours.
Well we can't
We've got a
Right.
"In that case Jim you say to your staff that you're gonna have a dialogue with Dave  and myself, with a view to confirming how it will be implemented as far as your organization is concerned."
But surely
"we can still issue it, we can still brief"
This issue
that issue?
Of course you can.
Yes.
Well.
It is
work
It's been issued Roger.
"I think, I, I personally, I think everyone's got to work to it until they find it doesn't work."
"Ca can't you just, can't Jim just brief his staff, but er as far as that's concerned w he takes it that the Q S has asked him to do all the site measurement er and that they will then produce the certification"
Mm.
based on that?
Yeah.
"Couldn't have been really much better really,"
Well
Yeah
"Well he was dashing out when I  when I called him  erm his wife answered the phone and she said  you just  him he's going out at the door  so he came rushing back and I said I wanted him to judge  champion of champions and  the  and I said there'll be two  and he said, hang on, and he's write it down said I'll just stick it all at one and see to it when I come back, oh I gotta go and he went."
Yeah.
And that was it.
Yeah yeah  yeah.
"Well he, he appreciated  at the previous table show on the sixth of October  and that was a case when it was always  you know, because Danny only told me on that night that he could come."
Yeah.
"So it was all a hotchpotch, it was all  and I had to do the  the best  I could for those who showed fish and that was the only way I could do it."
Right er  thanks Emily  for your report.
Any proposers and seconders?
"I'll propose Emily's report and, and in doing so I'd like to say  thank you to her for her sterling work this year, I think she's done a terrific job  erm and I'd like to thank her personally for the help she's given me over the year."
I couldn't have managed without her.
Any seconders?
Got to get your name in the minutes somehow.
"Right, thanks Emily."
Erm  librarian's report
sixty P and thirty P
Oh is it?
Thirty pence.
Yeah well
We auc we auctioned  the books after as you know  and erm  so I  I'll have to make a new list of what's left and let you have it.
"I know I, I will be against"
they take books out once or twice and then  the older members don't take 'em out
I mean I know it's difficult
Yeah.
having them at home  I mean  erm
Yeah
but they're still not
They didn't  they didn't take them out of the  Joe  you know  erm
"er I think we get a saturation point and the thing that annoys me is  that young fellow who came to the club  had a   got, we got a special  went to the special trouble of getting a  for him  and I cannot get it off him and he lives up Newton way somewhere  I've been to him three times"
"So, what I'm saying is they're just th , they're, they're, it's just for er"
The biggest place near it.
the biggest place near it.
Now what
"I'm saying is, is you ought to get very close to that geographical map  because  it's the logistic  logistics er  difficulty with getting, and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are valleys and the fact that that, in South Wales they can't just go across country, they have to go back down the valley after the M four and up again."
"Cos we're driving lorries, we're not driving little, you know  trial bikes that go over mountains like the Brecons and stuff, you have to"
But we do use the sheep in some ways don't we?
"That's right, that's right, we do use the sheep ."
But not for
No.
the sake of the .
"No, right."
What
"what I'm saying is, you know, you can't go from Stirling to Aberdeen  in a couple of minutes."
That's big country up there.
"And so there's a big mountain range running up the middle of the country, someone thought once was the English Channel."
Well that's okay cos we've got a tunnel now.
"Yeah, we got a tunnel now."
Yeah.
"The English Channel, not the Pennines."
But they're going where's the Pennines?
Erm what I'm saying is
I'd say I don't know where it is at all.
I am saying to you now folks become familiar with the erm  depots.
Now what about the depot numbers?
No idea.
No.
Forty nine.
Not at all.
Forty six.
Forty nine.
I'm gonna call them out.
Yeah.
ten p or twenty p.
"Oh that that would be a different ball game, selling it in places wouldn't it?"
Oh yeah.
Ho how many
"That's our, I mean, you know you can go round in newsagents or doctor's surgery and dump them."
But to actually say right can you s can you collect the money for us!
Well one could put a  box next to it.
"Well in some places, yeah ."
"Yeah but I mean, mm."
a copy's a lot.
"It is, yeah."
Well although
I mean it I'm not suggesting that isn't cheap but erm  to produce at five p a copy
Oh yeah.
thousand it's gonna cost what's it gonna cost?
Er.
What's five thousands?
Five thousands.
Fifty pounds.
Mm.
Mm.
"I mean I'm, I'm, I'm only going on the fact that I I tend to do everything on the cheap so I tend to get  if I can find somebody who does photocopying I can  do it then we'll do it."
"For me to produce that'll cost me  basically  my time and my  my you know I, say my laser copies' paid for by my business  erm"
copies.
"So I mean if I, if I produced for instance si five or six masters  and then people can go and do copies here and there that's actually not a bad way of doing it."
"And that'll be, I've got about a ream of, well it's only about a ream  paper."
Just pr producing new copies as you need them rather than produce five thousand and I think we we have sort of hundreds to throw away in the end.
But I  it to to er  recycling.
Yeah.
Well I'll get in touch with this  East Herts guy to get all his information.
Good.
Yeah within the nearest place with  a biggish
With a  yeah.
football team possibly yeah.
Anyway
Right.
Right so er
I think that's everything.
Yeah.
"So if I get it laid out again then, you know"
"Yeah fine erm but as I say it's just sort of you know kind of minor layout changes, that's all I was suggesting"
Yeah.
"so you know at a pinch you could probably run it like that and I don't suppose anybody would notice the difference but, you know, just in terms of you know making things look attractive"
Right.
"erm  so  you know but you may find if you give, print off a few and give them to a few people over the weekend"
Mm.
you may find that some additional changes occur to you
Mm.
which you might want to incorporate anyway so you may not want to print off another version anyway
Yeah.
so er
"Erm oh yeah the other thing was  it's two sided at the moment, is that"
Mm.
best or do you think
Erm generally speaking the consensus is it helps if it's sort of on one side
Oh right.
but how you do your original is up to you I mean it's just what we ask for from reprographics and you know they do single sided
Okay yeah.
"double sided, collated, stapled"
"different coloured paper and all, you know, all this sort of thing"
Yeah.
"so er erm  er  so that's  no, is there anything else we need to worry about  with regard to that?"
Er no I don't think so.
Aha.
"she said, why can't you be a normal mother and just want chocolates or perfume?"
"I said, well that's not much good when you're hanging from the end of a  rope ."
And who do you go with?
I go with my husband.
Your husband?
Mhm.
"And whereabouts do you go, just"
"Oh  Glencoe, Skye, Aran, you know just"
Mhm.
up there.
"Do you, do you stay up there, do you have"
Mhm.
a caravan.
"No, a tent, or we've got an estate car if it's just a weekend jaunt, and it's maybe wet, we just sleep in the back of the car"
aha.
"So  complete change from this place anyway,"
"aha, and you meets up with so many wonderful people."
"Aha, aha."
It gives you something else to talk about.
"That's right, aha."
"Instead of just,going to Tescos for some groceries or"
"I mean I, I, I don't drink a lot, I mean maybe after I've been out in the hills you have got to drink something to replace the sweat, but I'm not a great drinker and I don't, I don't smoke and I, I don't like discos or anything like that"
Mhm.
so you've got to find something else to do.
"That's right, a healthy pursuit."
I used to play a lot of badminton and swimming but I've got bored out of my ears so it's something to keep fit.
Mhm.
"So I bought myself a bike, and I've been popping backwards and forwards to my like"
How about
Ah but as I say my daughter thinks I'm mad.
how about nicknames?
"But the problem is the lower level at that,i i i it's at the N C O level where complaints are made by soldiers and because the complaint has to be made through the regiment, then the the pressure is for the soldier to withdraw his complaint  ."
"Rea really brief so how widespread is it in the Army, bullying or intimidation?"
"How how can we tell, because as an officer, and this is this is Richard's point, as an officer how do you know what goes on in the barrack room?"
Nicky can I have a word ?
With wa Andrew I've got somebody else to speak to.
If I
Okay.
get a chance I'll come back to you.
Er where's James ?
James.
Now you're on the run from the Army at the moment?
Mm.
Er why did you run away?
"Er mental torture, I just couldn't handle it no more."
What were they doing to you?
Er I was handcuffed to a radiator in the nude and urinated on.
I was tied into a sleeping bag and hung upside down from a tree overnight.
Er
"Why did they pick on you do you think Andrew, er James ?"
My size.
Yeah.
And you know
Did you s did you te did you say for god's sake stop doing this to me?
"Did you try and stop them, did you try and make them see reason?"
"Th there was no point, the chain of command to make a complaint was blocked."
There was just no way.
Did you see this happening to other people?
Yeah.
What sort of things were they doing to other people?
"Erm two people back to back with their trousers round their ankles, newspaper shoved up their backside, lit in the middle, first one to move got a kicking."
And is this common?
Or were these just a few isolated sadists ?
Pretty good!
So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really?
Eh?
All that
And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so
Have you got to pass for the stage then?
Yeah.
I used an
What
old one.
"So  those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine  turned mine round she saw it and went  she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't  thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't  just turned it round on her."
"I bet your  friends a will be  sick then, won't they?"
"I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one!"
And there must have been about ten thousand there last time.
They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in  and you can spin round.
Oh yeah!
"They had one of those in there  but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on!"
Those lasers  lasers that   the .
Velcro walls?
"No, they didn't have that there."
"A huge octopus,octopus  -ish, had these massive  tentacles that's going right the way across the ceiling!"
Video screens.
Very good!
They're all gonna be pissed on Friday cos we got in for nothing!
Why is your voice so quiet?
Cos  the washing machine out there  it's .
What sort of smoke  from the machine?
Hiss!
Oh it's ?
No !
What hissing?
Proper smoke machine.
"But the people who  Q T S course, have got a lot of work."
Have they?
"Mm, much more than me."
I'm glad I'm not doing that.
Really?
Loads of assignments have been set already.
"They're really quite heavily bogged down, and they were to do them all, er one day at school."
"Really, bloody hell."
Yeah the teachers seem to do nothing do they?
Really?
"I mean, Ann finished lectures, Ann's finished lectures yesterday, she's a secondary teacher and she doesn't have a lecture again until after Christmas."
Really?
"And she's got another two weeks off now, until she goes into schools and then she's in the schools full-time, but even so, she won't have, she didn't have exams."
"She had exams last January, didn't she, and she hasn't had exams since last January, she won't have until next  during June."
Really?
"And like, she has, like, although she's doing secondary teaching, she has it easier than anybody."
Mm.
"At this stage, anyway."
"I mean, it'll probably get harder."
"I wouldn't mind doing that, if there was, if I could do secondary teaching."
Really?
Mm.
"But I wouldn't wanna do primary or junior, just"
"Well do, would you be, is it T T S, secondary, T T S, weren't it?"
"No, but"
primary
"Well, in T T S"
T T S they can't do secondary.
Only do primary and junior.
"Oh, no in, in our college they're doing secondary."
"Cos I asked them about it, and they said  I'd much rather be doing that."
"Mm, yeah I would really."
Right.
He wrote it and handed it to me for this newsletter and I ran out of space.
Could put the green councillors ten reasons to be one in I suppose.
Yes
Oh yes definitely .
Anything to fit .
It will depend what the space situation is.
A nice grovel can go in.
Advert for the letter box sticker.  want stuff or is it contact through the office to .
Yes.
Unless you have unless you have supplied a specific date.
Erm if you like I can provide a a specific spiel.
Seeing as it is the you know the birthday edition.
It will it is quite nice er make a thing of it.
I think also if we could have some sort of timings when people could turn up.
Yes sure.
Okay I'll knock those up and I'll have to run that by my household.
Mm yeah.
So when do you need those by then?
Erm er middle of next week I suppose roughly .
Okay.
I would say next meeting is at it's the one time we're going to have one.
Erm and do we have anything else to go in this newsletter?
Erm
I could keep one in the green Eurobonds advert.
Yep
Yeah.
certainly.
Fine idea.
And if anybody thinks of any more diary dates or anything.
Yeah I'll let you know.
I think there might be a I've got one  announcement you can put  from that.
. Punch and Judy show.
Magic  and juggling with ka plate spinning.
Er Playbus painting competition.
"Raffle, refreshments, tombola  and various merchandise stalls so I suppose  that's us."
Quite
Mm.
Do they do fire eating act or
We can contortionism or   my legs up behind my neck.
An alternative might be to just to ask whether some of our membership forms could be  put out so that
Well I think they're more interested in the five pounds!
Yeah alright well.
Yeah.
I mean to make a contribution.
No to be honest because that that's what Greenpeace do isn't it?
Don't you belong?
Yeah  start the Harlow one up
Yeah.
the whole of their effort really is devoted to
Yeah they don't do it.
"They're actually, they just do fund raising to their local groups and everything else is obviously sort of controlled by central office or"
That's right everything is central.
Ac action is central  or something.
Yeah but I mean
So they're probably just gonna have their  you know  merchandise and a few people sort of
It's difficult really because I mean we're sort of striving for the same sort of things
I know.
Yeah.
aren't we.
It's er  you don't want to be seen to be erm
Who's it actually run by?
competing with each other in any way.
Well.
Okay.
"Don't know what, don't know what they'll make of all that gobbledegook.   bye bye love."
Have a good weekend.
See you soon .
See you next week.
"This is the wrong side, they must have rewound it without meaning to."
Well you're supposed to use side A
it won't tape it doesn't matter .
"But it does to them, because they've got side A and side B on every tape."
Yeah.
"And if they haven't got  side  side one tape two following  I mean side two side, tape two side A following tape one side B, it puts them out a bit I should think  are you going up the dog path?"
"Yeah, come on ."
"When, when did you get all this stock of perfume?"
"Erm, four years ago, three or four years ago  ."
.
"He went out on Christmas Eve, to find you present"
"That's right, I remember that ."
"and he got this job lot of  perfume, and he said oh I can shot these out over the next few years, I said, oh if you really want to ."
Where does he keep them?
"I've no idea, in fact last year, did he give you some last year?"
"I can't remember ,"
"Yes, he did ."
"he said alright, I, I, I was in trouble because I forgot where I hid them."
A miniature one.
I had to look in the top of his wardrobe.
You'll have to look somewhere.
"Take it all away, he probably gave it to girls at work as well or something."
Yes.
"Well no, cos it would be too late after Christmas wouldn't it?"
"Probably, no he doesn't give presents ."
"Oh he does, he gives er his secretary and switch board girl a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine and  but I do all the Christmas cards"
"Yeah, I know you do"
Yeah.
"You paying me in 'and, and Dennis is paying me in 'and and I'll a er, thousand pound a week, the way that  I keep getting these job offers."
Back-handers.
Anticipation obligations.
The only trouble is they're only offers.
"What's happening down here, then, didn't you hear no more about when you finish then, down here at"
No.
"Only some bad  things, what I've supposed to have done, or what I'm not supposed to have done."
But
Who cares over it.
"some money out of it, I took him to court."
proven.
Oh.
But you can't do it without money.
"No, that legal aid don't go far"
"Legal aid, won't enter enter entertain it."
Not for owt like that.
"No, I'm afraid"
"You see, 'cos you weren't actually employed, you see, 'cos you say,"
No.
"you couldn't really take him to a tribunal could you, 'cos ya"
"No, I weren't employed."
any money to take him to a tribunal.
"Well, I made my, I made it plain that er, at the training centre, you know, I says, I says to em, I said er, in my opinion, I says, he doesn't want, he don't want to kn , he he don't want to know."
"Oy, you."
"He says any anything what goes wrong, he says, you automatically get blamed for."
I told you.
"He says, well, it's your job not to let it go wrong, I said, I didn't let it go wrong."
"I said, but other people let it go wrong and they got away with it."
Look what I found.
I've just called for her money.
Corrinne's money.
No.
"The, the  yeah."
What have you told  only you haven't told Gwyllam  anything have you?
"Cos you, what you've told him is  did you talk about chapter eight?"
No.
No.
"I, I just said to him, when he said we've got these census point ahead I said well  we've got certain restrictions, you know, we've certain rules and regulations we've gotta comply with  I mean I didn't reel off any of this  blah."
"But I said oh, are you familiar with setting up roadside interviews and  for this type of thing?"
"Oh yes, we've got such and such a fella out there that does nothing but that out all day long."
And yet they didn't have any signs  so I think he's talking through his hat.
But what he probably means is that they set up signs for
Yeah.
"you know, roadworks and stuff."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I mean I would have thought they've gotta comply with the same
Yeah.
the same sort of things.
"I think the thing is, actually, just thinking about it, there will be a Welsh version of this  if there is one if you see what I mean?"
Yeah.
"If there isn't one  then we, we er er it  er  oh mind you I suppose there's no hassle to them to put a Welsh thingy, anyway I'll look at that."
"Right, now the other thing is that what Jim's doing which is that programme, how is that coming along?"
Yeah.
What I did  was I got  I went down to the print room and I got a piece of A one paper and  I mean if you want to use  Chris
"Chris  over in Chester office, see if, that one would, oh mind you there isn't a chair there is there?"
Mind you is Jonathan away?
There's this chair here.
Jonathan's not here.

"Again all in Nottingham Station, on local."
"And there we are ladies and gentlemen, as er all things should finish with the Queen."
Erm
That er concludes my little contribution to the evening's entertainment.
Erm I hope it may be of some interest.
Erm it is I assure you but a fraction of what I've got.
but erm they difficulty is in erm let's say keeping within a couple of hours.
Well that's fantastic..
Erm anyhow thank you er all very much.
Right.
Is there anybody
how you got started singing?
How I got started singing?
Aye.
"Well me, oh, how I got started singing, it was really just  I didn't sing very much really."
My dad was a good singer.
"He wasn't a trained singer or anything, it was, just happened that he, he was a good singer."
My younger brother he's a good singer as well.
But er us
"Did he sing at home, your dad?"
"He just sang round about the house, aha."
They have one now?
They do.
Yes.
Oh!
They suddenly found the room.
Yes  actually.
Well  in a parking block.
Er  would anyone like coffee?
No  thank you.
"one, two."
"Now what was it, I mean  or would you prefer anything else?"
some tea?
Tea?
I'll I'll go and check .
"One thing I  struck me this week there's a new regulation as regard punctures on tyres because I had this completely flat tyre and a whole new set of tyres and I said to him well can't you mend it, can't you put an inner tube in like I I've done before cos there was a nail in it you see."
Yeah.
And I said just get the nail out and re repair the inner tube he said no it's the there's a new regulation  this year that if the outer case of the you know the tyre has
tea.
they're not allowed to repair it because safety regulations because  the whole expanse and then supposedly the actual puncture  comes off.
And I said well what happens to these extra tyres?
Right.
"So he sa , I mean does anybody know anything about anything like that?"
"No, no."
Presum I mean I just lost four
I know this  I just know about about a sort of friend of ours  is making money meanwhile in Germany .
He found  well  of course erm connections so he got the permission through the embassy.
"He's now running lorry loads of worn tyres to Russia, to the Soviet Union and makes money  loads of money because the tyres, they couldn't ha get any tyres so  the tyres he saw there were totally without profile."
You know.
Yeah.
So the old tyres  he could erm find in Germany were a lot better.
He carted them over.
. Making thousands out of it.
Is it more or less straight up?
More or less horizontal?
About forty five or?
It's probably about seventy.
Right.
"Maybe seventy, maybe eighty."
"So you could draw a rough sketch like that,"
Mm.
"just measure it with a protractor, or measure along here."
That would be  if we drew wh wh how do we find the gradient really?
"We draw a little triangle, don't we?"
Yeah.
"So at point one, it's nought."
"What would, what would that be at the point two?"
For X
Three.
equals two?
Two three.
"So we could get the point two three, and we could take the gradient of that as being fairly close to the gradient of the curve."
Mm.
Erm how can we get it more accurately reflecting what's happening there?
Right.
Point something.
So if we did something like that that's where we want it.
That's where we want the gradient
Mhm.
"and we took a line from there to there, where this is that's where X is equal to, that'll go far."
Nought nought point nine say.
"And just the other side of it, where X equals one point one."
Mm.
"We're going to have, difference along the X axis will be nought point two."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go on then.
"Why people think it's noisy for us on a double main road, but it ain't really."
"Well, you get used it in don't ya."
"When our Norma come and stop here, she she was,"
Used to sleep
I don't know how you sleep all night with all that traffic going up and down.
No.
But we never hear it.
You don't hear it.
"No, we didn't."
"I remember one  first night we stopped there, buses were coming at crack of dawn,"
Yeah.
"it must have been about four or five o'clock in morning, and now we never hear any traffic."
No.
No.
Perhaps you get used to.
Yeah.
"But we don't hear many people, on a road like that."
No.
"I were thinking about that bungalow, and, well actually it's as far from  our road, nearly as far from our road to there, as what is it from bungalow window to road."
Where to  yeah.
it really is
"Know, thinking about people walking back as far as t' shopping my point."
"There nowt much difference in, from t' garden"
"I think the only trouble over there, is your to gonna have people parking in front of ya gate, like when they go to the chip shop."
They won't
Yeah.
"They won't 'cos 'cos er, I'm afraid if they do, I shall be out straight away at 'em."
"Well, it's only a matter of parking at, parking your own car as well"
"I'll clamp the bugger, I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it."
Park here at your risk.
"And everything's very nice , lovely!"
Mm.
"Because you want the right size  join  what you put in  they hadn't got any, no more of these"
No I said to Geoff well I hope he don't come back.
Who?
They're supposed to
"That bloke, I don't want him coming"
.
"Well dear you won't worry, I'll shall soon tell him to !"
"You ought to  you ought to say to him, I shall ring the police, you come round here any more!"
"people in the, in the  bay I wouldn't"
No I'm not!
"I don't want him, it worried me that he might come and bother your mother."
Yeah.
No!
There's no  this time.
I can stick up for myself!
Oh!
So he won't  you just don't
I did that
I know you can.
old bloke!
"End of the day   and if you don't let him in, he don't have to have any"
No.
anyway!
"Well I tell you something if he ke , if he does start to hassle us I shall ring the police and I shall tell them!"
Mm.
I should use
"I shan't have no qualms about it, I shall say well he's hassling  me and my mother-in-law and we can do without it!"
"That old boy that I spoke to, when his  he was with his daughter, I said you give me my bloody keys and you  money!"
I gotta move!
I said well there's a wheelbarrow down there mate!
I ended up paying for him.
"She's not bothered, she never goes near him."
Never goes near him.
She never goes near him.
She's frightened to death of 'im
isn't it.
I know.
But I don't think Geoff would be very pleased.
"Well, if you say to him, that just say that  and that, that's you know, oh, just say something like, just say something like  I can't keep up with him Dennis, he's throwing loads of dust about, just say to him,think about selling, to you want to buy him back or, you know."
"Well, they won't, I don't think they'd have him back."
No and that's  a
"I don't think, I don't think sell him."
Has he got to wait.
A.
I don't think you'd get what you paid for him.
"Probably not, but I mean, cage is worth a hundred and fifty quid."
That's what Russell paid for the cage.
"Oh, look."
Mm
"Oh, look."
What.
"Look,"
"that he's into,"
"Well, I mean, he's no problem to me."
I'm not bothered about him.
"You know, I'd rather keep him than sell him, but"
"It's like everything else, you've always summat else to bloody feed."
Mm.
"By the way, when we had that pair, that were driving me mad, and then that one died, when we were in bungalow."
"Other one would learnt how to open a crack, and it were in that cage, and it could hear birds outside."
"Anyway in the end we let er Kenny's grandad have 'im, I mean, 'cos they got me mum's bird."
"They've got two of his own, he ended up with four birds."
Barbie doll  and that's what she was.
"Well no, not as attractive as a Barbie doll!"
"Well  no, but"
But
I'm  but the style was there
"She,i it was  it was becoming like a dictatorship!"
It was her at the helm
"Ooh well this is what it beca , it did"
And
"and th the so called democratic, you know, choice of all these poli , all these MP's and what not which would comprise  parliament and government and head of the Tory party at the time  you know i it really  their voices on the, on the  the cabinet  you know, they were, they were just destroyed!"
"Well, you said  you know you, we were on about Germany and, and becoming you know  could it happen again?"
If  if she'd of had her way  she would of been the dictator of this
Yeah.
"country, and she would of been in power forever!"
Oh I know!
"You know that's, she would of been wanting to ma , make her life president or whatever it was!"
"I think she would of done with the Que , er done away with the Queen to get"
"Yes, I think there was a bit of competition on there wasn't"
Yeah.
there?
I'm convinced
But
she wouldould!
"Yeah, I mean"
"If it meant her staying in power that, I mean she"
Well
would of done it she would of got rid of them to make sure she  she stayed there.
Yes it came to er
Are you tired?
A fine state of affairs didn't it
"No, I'm alright Ken, yeah."
with her  even her own party  giving
Don't see why not.
"Some of it's useful, I mean"
What and that thing?
What?
That can be chucked.
"Well, we need it, the amount of stuff at the moment, and get rid of it  when we  know what we're doing with that thing."
Well we're gonna need two removal vans.
"Well if we have two removal vans, we have two removal vans!"
We didn't fit in the last one.
We only just fitted.
"The company pays for it, I don't care!"
And that was squeezing it.
But if the company pays for it I don't give a damn!
Hadn't you better contact Pickfords.
"Well they'll do it, I'm sure one"
Cos er they might sort of book them up ahead or something.
They'll do it in time.
They're not moving much at the moment.
Aren't they?
Well obviously not.
"Oh yeah, true !"
The housing market is hardly buoyant is it?
"So, in other words, you can  push them down a bit."
Did you get the er  bit they saved on the  stamp duty  to buy the kitchen?
It's possible.
Does that mean yes?
Oh good!
Mum was so embarrassed!
"She didn't know how you got the chee , the nerve to do it!"
Disgraceful!
"If you don't ask, you don't get anything."
"Don't ask, you don't get!"
"However you decide to, by instalments or by"
"Mm, mm."
"one, one big lump."
Mm.
"But at the end of the day, it ain't really what I want to do."
No.
"I mean I, I want to get into mental health care."
Mm.
"And and erm  if I  I'm hoping I'll like it when I get in there, but something tells me I would."
Well as I say I went for this interview and she phoned me last Sunday didn't she?
"I went on the Monday for the, to the house."
Then on the Tuesday I went to the hospital.
And erm  she phoned me up on the Sunday.
She said I'm  I'm just ringing to tell you Joy that you didn't get  you you haven't been successful with your application this time.
"But she said  erm I wanna just tell you  all the others  that haven't made it, we've just said well I'm sorry."
That's it.
"But, with you, we feel you've got so much to offer  and we don't really wanna just say no and  and  and it would make you feel oh blow it I'm not gonna do it."
Mm.
"She said I feel that  there is a place for you in the health, in this mental health service."
But she said  what it is is basically we're all just starting from the bottom because this new idea of where they're buying small homes and making them small communities
Yeah.
erm  they're all starting from new.
They're all been institutionalized up till recently.
That's right yeah.
So they're gradually buying houses in certain areas.
And she said I'm sure you'll get in.
"But you see it's like everything else, we're in a recession."
"You, you go for a job and there's two hundred people going for that one job."
Mm.
Mm.
"That's right, yeah."
There's three hundred and eighty went for a job up the Hilly Home Where they have the spastic kids.
Ours is gonna us about a thousand pound for insurance.
Oh.
"Well, a thousand pounds not a lot, Karen, but er  it all depends what the, what what you gonna be insured for?"
It's not.
"I mean, even that, you're gonna you you gonna be insured for breaking in and break-ins and"
"Yeah, I think it's everything."
I think it's
"That's what I mean, so what you're actually getting for your, thousand pound isn't a lot of money."
No.
"I think it's covered for like, like you say, like for some reason, say you had a fire, and you had to stop work."
Yeah.
I think it's covered for that.
"Covered for personal injury, er, covered for hundred thousand, for like, that's what trailers,they've got  trailers in."
It's covered for everything.
"I mean, you imagine somebody breaking in and setting fire to a trailer."
"I mean, it's a lot of money when you think Norma's paying nine hundred pound just for her car."
For that Cabriolet.
"To me, you think phew a thousand pound, but cer I mean, it's it ain't really very much, no."
It's a high insurance for a car.
What for car?
yeah.
Right
"What how how comes that, then?"
"Because, well, Cabriolet's are classed as dangerous, aren't they, because they're  soft roofed."
"Oh, aye."
It's not got no
"Aye, this"
"Yeah,she's only been driving a year, two years."
"Soft top, yeah."
Yeah.
"Well, I mean, look at our Connie's."
Yeah.
I didn't know women were allowed to go.
"and er just at the very end all you could see was her  and your man, the hologram  and he'd just been killed about five minutes earlier."
So he could have saved himself but he didn't want to.
The hologram?
Aye.
And did he not save himself then?
No.
Did he die?
But then how can  go on.
Cos he's still he's still a hologram.
Hologram.
So that's how he died then?
Aye.
Well it's funny
Remember he tried to stab his wife
I cried my eyes out at that!
at the very start of last night there was this guy water skiing
"big massive fat woman right, and she was just walking about this conference, you know where she's not supposed to be, and all these shoulders  stab her right?"
And then
Shoulders?
"Soldiers, right, stab her and they're all dying and then you see the head like  it's just all dressed up in these things and it's Arnie underneath it  and he takes the head off"
and it closes up again and he goes  chew this or something  blows up and then Arnie gets
"No there's a scene in Terminator, he's like wood and metal, in this new Terminator"
Yeah
it is absolutely brilliant the way they do it.
What was that what was that
Well you'd run a mile
Oh aye.
That one er under the water
The Little Mermaid  no.
"it is fucking brilliant,in a monkey suit."
Oh a cartoon?
Yes.
Cos people
D seven was the acknowledgement
So.
So that was to say that we'd w
Yeah.
withdrawn D two point three.
Yeah.
And now you've reused it somewhere else?
And erm and subsequently we've actually withdrawn
Withdrawn
this particular D two stroke three.
So if you look in your manual you've now onl only got one D two stroke
Yeah.
three
"Rather than two D one, right."
"A a a and the, and the, and the D seven bit is, is in a different section?"
Is covered by part D two stroke one.
Right.
Thank you Dennis.
You're a
good lad.
Right.
Could I just quickly look through here?
"I, I did have a go through this core brief to see if there were any things that I should have picked out."
"There there is a good section, there's a good section on pensions"
by the way because our staff will be concerned about pension proposals after privatization.
Is it?
It's section one point five.
If you view files three to five.
The main message I would give is that
"the Board has responded to the government with regard to the pensions issue, and suggested a number of improvements to the government's proposals."
Do they still do it?
the P E teacher is supposedly collecting aluminium cans and  we've been through various daft schemes of stopping the children from throwing the cans everywhere because we've got this coke machine.
And we even had one where they paid a ten p deposit  on a can so they paid forty p instead of thirty or whatever.
And I got hardly any cans back.
Or they did was b buy them from the school canteen where they were still thirty!
And the coke machine wasn't used.
Well why not er encourage the canteen to charge forty
They didn't  but then they had
as well?
"Well, they won't because they they they have to make money in order to survive."
The more money they make the better for them.
They have to run it as a business now.
For profit I'm afraid.
Er oh I did have one Polish lad who's now left who used to go round looking for all the cans and he'd  then collect the ten p's!
scheme folded.
Through lack of support.
So what else is mentioned here?
I think that  still holds.
"And I can check, I will go and ."
And car batteries is the same.
Other batteries I'll check.
Pills er  you check
Yeah.
.
Furniture erm  yeah I think that's.
Is there a second hand furniture shop now in Bishop's Stortford?
There is one isn't there?
Is there one down by the Causeway?
Yes there is.
Who is going to check that?
Well I can check it.
Yeah.
Never seen that.
Well they all have.
It's customary to go to work dressed in black or white or suits or
Not at all.
It's navy blue with flowered blouse they've got.
I've never seen it.
Each bank's different.
Well they've had them for years.
Well in the Midland Bank and they were wearing them the last time you were there.
The electric board wears them.
The gas board wears them.
Woolworths wear them.
Mm.
"And so really it is no different, just that they are making a song about it."
But there's no need to go to that prices.
a name on.
You can have the firm's name and give them a brooch or something.
"Well they've got them anyway, haven't they?"
But  Val was on about it last summer.
They was talking about it then.
But she said that they had been so many months  or when everybody else had a pay rise they only had a little bit.
And the extra that they should have had is going to pay for these uniforms.
Oh.
didn't want the uniforms.
Well a percentage is taken out of your money for them.
There's no doubt about that.
Mm.
"Well that's what she was on about that, and and they was  they were going"
Well everybody has got to do that.
to go on strike because of it.
"And really, it would be a good thing for Val."
Why?
"Yeah but I mean it depends what sort of bloke he is, and I mean if he is like that"
He  you know what a big head he is.
Yeah but I mean you don't know what he's like to his kids do you?
Well she said he he's done nothing but bully them.
Well then the kid's right ain't he?
"Well  you heard what he said he wants his children to have a good education and he pushes them  all the time, they've gotta  if they do anything"
Yeah.
they've gotta be brilliant at it  But
Yeah.
you see some children ain't got it in them and  you know
Oh yeah.
but you heard what Ashley said about swimming.
Made them  yeah.
"Well, to me if a child has got a   by all means encourage along  but you shouldn't push them into anything cos  later on in life they get a bloody complex about everything  you know if they"
I don't know.
if they've got a job or something they're frightened they're not gonna do well and
"Where do you draw the line between  you know, not sort erm  encouraging and not"
Well I do it all look at  it's the way you say it.
"Well that's what I'm saying, so perhaps the kid was right in what he said."
Well yeah but I wouldn't
Been a bastard to him well
Well would you like your son to say  I think
Well no but I don't to think I am like that with Jonathan.
Well no.
Well I don't like
But he's always been like that with them kids you know yourself  if they do anything it's gotta be done
"Well you know how he is, if you say too much to him, don't do that, don't shout at me!"
He soons  starts squawking and  wiping his eye and stamping about the place  but if he's like that  all the while to them  so what is .
They've all gone off to Fiji.
Who has?
"The parents, he said he was going didn't he?"
Oh him as well?
The speed is increasing.
Sort of
Stop.
"sort of actually stops, and then it's going very slowly again for a bit, and then what happens here?"
"very, it just goes very fast"
Right.
"in a very short space of time then, but then carries on."
Very short space of time it's gone quite a distance.
"So that was a, that is at, that constant speed there is much faster than, than this one."
"And then, it's stationary"
It's
for a while.
And then
Just goes down there.
What's happening here?
Deceleration.
"Well let's make, let's make this bit a straight line, from there to about there."
That's a straight line.
"So, well let's go back to the physics."
We've just been going on timing it for one minute or something.
"And we time it again, one minute and one second"
It's reversed.
It's reversed.
How far away was it when I started the watch?
Thirty metres away.
"How, how far is it after another one second?"
Twenty metres away.
Ah.
Ah!
It's coming back.
Okay.
So that's going backwards.
Get it chopped up.
It's a great laugh!
Mm.
But we want one of those halogen jobs.
What are they called?
Hobs.
They are nice!
Mhm.
Not a bad price either.
What the halogen hobs?
Mm.
Oh you're joking!
About five hundred.
Not bad!
"You can't burn stuff on them either, can you?"
"On the halogen ones, no."
It's a
Exactly!
So that's a definite bonus!
"Well it wasn't, although they'd actually be going around burning ourselves anyway!"
"I do, you know those frying pans that you bought, the frying pans and saucepans?"
"An , you know the metal bit that's by the handle  that's a really poor safety device!"
Poor?
On the saucepans there's a metal rim  sort of piece at the end of the handle
Is there?
that that touches the actual saucepan
Yes.
when you pick that up you put your thumb on it!
I
And I burnt myself so many times on that!
Don't pick it up so close to the handle then!
Yeah but it's
Oh good.
and waiting for his next one to come
Oh marvellous.
Er
Is he selling them over there?
"No he's keeping them for just fun cars for himself, he's just got the money to burn over there"
Marvellous
"so  he's only, he's got a  one of the new  B M W seven three five that er no the big Merc, a big new Merc through that's right, not the  the latest Merc  so he says er er he's a bit disappointed with the brakes on the M G but  Dave said they were a phenomenal brake for an  M G he said"
Yes.
compare it against the latest Merc
That's right.
He's all
I expect
he's all been paid all his money and
"Mm but it's good in a way that he's got his money because he can sort of, sort of finance ours"
"Well yeah he is, he's got a little bit anyway"
"till we, yeah yeah, I should imagine he is."
quite a few bits and pieces.
It's getting Kevin in to finish it off.
"I phoned Kevin, I've got Kevin's mum and dad's phone number off Dave and phoned at home but he's gone out for the day or something they said."
"But he's got to strip the bonnet so Dave said well I'll get my lad to strip the bonnet this afternoon and er  you know,few hundred quid for the day we'll be glad to be able to finish off doing them and  He's got too many"
Yeah cos you haven't been able to
to play with really er we c to clear ten we've still got two and a half grand left
Have we?
and so there's twelve and a half grand we're owed
Yeah yeah
"so if he charges, you know, fifteen hundred for his bit and then another grand to finish it off we're still clearing ten, you know,"
Oh well that's good then.
we might even clear a little bit more than ten but
"Bit more than ten, yeah."
"I mean if he charges two and a half I wouldn't be disappointed cos it's been in his garage, he's pushed everything along and he's always  so"
"Yeah, oh and he's been pretty reasonable hasn't he?"
Where?
I have done I've
"Let me see then, round your kneecaps?"
"No I have, I have lost it, I tell you what, now listen"
Don't you start splattering at me mate
"Now look, this"
"had been a, a mark going around that, right  and that's what"
"I have lost it though, I have"
"There are, don't tip that over the cloth then"
"Alright then, come on then  you know I forgot I didn't have me keys with me this morning, of course the first one"
Didn't you have your sandwiches then?
"I just, I had erm soft bread you know get that cut that bread"
Did you?
Did you have that luncheon meat that's in there?
Yeah
You did
"there's two slices left, I shall have that tomorrow"
"no, no I'm not that keen on it  I just have a couple of biscuits and a cup of tea when I come home"
Yeah
oh yeah I'll get some more Thursday
"yes, what biscuits do you want, big ones?"
"Yeah, I think I'll borrow er one of Sue's one of"
"I, are"
"There's more on there than what they thought or something, apparently keeps her cakes in it, so I said"
come then
Are you on lates next week?
No
Mo
"Oh I just wondered, here are"
Ah?
I just wondered if you had anything planned for the weekend that  oh
What number is Nigel at then?
Well
"And I'll tell you what, what they're getting from us is infinitely better than they're getting from anybody else."
"You see even from Leeds North West  the outside party job and the P T pay monthly, so it's important that the client knows what he's gonna be facing."
But what we do is we estimate three months
Mm.
and divide by three.
Yeah.
"Then you get an average,"
Not bad.
"you know, and that's, that's the way"
What's that mean?
Mm?
No.
I think's it's quite generous
Don't be mean .
actually.
Next one Den.
Well.
There aren't any more.
Ther there have been quite a few that have come out recently which I haven't briefed.
Some of them are fairly minor and it's  to read them.
"Others which are perhaps a little bit of er a change from what we've been used to doing,"
Mm.
are currently being revised yet again.
So I'll pick them up at the next brief.
Right.
I think an hour of this is about enough isn't it?
Den that was great.
I mean I know there's been a lot of debate and I know that er you may feel it's been a bit of a waste of time
but  the fact that there's been so much debate
"If, if, if you say, Mary had a little lamb"
Mary had a
I like being in with my family.
He said I like being in with me boys.
"He said, and it's really good, he said, cos I'm, I'm celebrating my fortieth birthday, he said, and I ring my boys, he said, and they listen to the same sort of music I do."
"He said, whereas my mum over there in the corner, he said, if she had a bash I had to listen to bloody Frank Sinatra, wouldn't I?"
"And I'd go, yeah."
It's like yeah.
"He said, yeah, I like being home with the family."
"He said, but I'm only going back out there another  he said, so it won't be too long."
"I said, yeah."
it's not.
Fancy Jane going and having a bust-up down the
"I'm not surprised, Christ."
"She's relaying all marital problems, to everyone, wouldn't she."
"They're alike though, ain't they?"
Did you see her when she
Busting out of her dress.
"Erm, your, I think it was Dwayne or was it, it's either Dwayne, or erm, er Bob knocked a glass over, and er,Jane was like erm, trying to like, she was like going Edward move away, I'm trying to sh I'm trying, look, I'm trying to stop people dancing round here, and like, these, all this, this er, glass on the floor, right, Jane was standing there going like this, dancing round all this glass, and like she was going like this, and everyone that walked past, she was going,broken glass   and she was saying, and  she was, she kept on going broken glass, they done it."
"And she's still dancing, it's really funny ."
She's  ain't she?
Oh dear.
She started crying one
"Yeah, I know she did, I saw her."
Shouldn't keep smoking and fighting in the middle of the front room.
She was crying in the pub.
Talking about how much she hated
The bloke
"He's so drunk, he don't ."
"She goes,piss off ."
Yeah.
"So they had another big fight down there, didn't they?"
Oh dear.
"Yeah, I went in the kitchen, and"
"Right, so  me and Jim had a chat the other day  just looking at the  the roadside entries and the counts and I was sort of saying  if we work on the basis that we want between ten and twelve people, twelve people maximum"
Mm.
erm I think we're be able to do all the counts with that number of people including the  St David's roundabout and
Mm.
but we do need to clarify exactly what you want on that.
"Whether you want  samples doing cos that's gonna take more people, or whether you're just doing ins and outs  and stuff like that."
Well
And on the other roundabout for that matter.
Are you off?
Yeah I've got a  seminar in Manchester .
Oh right.
How did it go?
Fine.
Probably find that  traffic  percent
"we're just talking now this, this is, this is one we're discussing."
Oh well just south of Caernarvon on the first section erm between Caernarvon and ?
Yes.
Yeah.
Gwyneth haven't really started on doing any of that work yet.
work.
And they need to do traffic.
"And also they need to confirm the traffic erm turning  099 junction at er  I can never pronounce it, beginning with an L."
Yeah .
"And er maybe count, maybe  do their traffic counts out of that as well."
So the guy that was in charge of those schemes with Gwyneth
Yeah.
was at the meeting or came into the meeting to explain about the schemes.
What's his name?
Erm
Peter will know.
Peter's got his name down.
Cos that was one of the things we talked about
That's why he's
Yes.
"Oh, I'll have one off him, yeah"
"when it's done like, you know it's going"
"Oh yes, I'll have one him."
"Yeah, he's doing it."
Yes  yes.
We are struggling with judges aren't we?
"And what about, you know  about the judges, don't you?"
"Yes, but it doesn't"
"I just mentioned it er  we have we have had a suggestion from B class judges    that er  that the B class judges can show at er  an, an open show  providing, providing they declare beforehand"
Providing they declare their interests
"it is what I've always thought for a long time that  somebody like Brian   if he's not  if he's not showing at our fish  at our show, even as an A class judge, I, I  fail to see why he can't  judge at our show  it's, he goes to Skelm and, and judges there and our fish will be there or    strange really when we're struggling for judges that, that we don't do these things."
"Yeah, but we're looking at the financial side, aren't we really?"
W with Brian
"Well I know  I mean it  we're struggling to get judges, aren't we, and it's not going to get any better, it's going"
No.
"to get worse if anything, not better  the way things are going."
We're obviously  obviously  thinking along these lines
Is there?
"He, he was   apparently  and then  on the Saturday or Sunday h h he, he  started to reject so he had to go back in."
Oh.
Yeah.
Where did he used to live?
Yes.
Where was he from?
"So all, all the A class judges are getting a little bit long in the tooth now"
No more questions?
"No one, no more questions?"
I'd like er  to thank Alan  for being involved  erm  a proposer and seconder?
Proposed by  Steve   seconded by
Right er   please  can we have your report please.
Mm.
Yeah but they're like four interviews on a sheet and really sort of
Yeah.
But I mean who
"what, how w , what are w , have we got our current ones, our standard ones?"
Yeah.
Cos presumably it would be best to use those wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"I think  you could, you could accommodate it if you just reduced that sli the, what the normal one slightly, and there's t there's room to put the er translation on the top."
I'll do you a mock up of that and see what you
"Yes, good idea."
what you think.
I think either that or have it on a separate sheet.
But I would have thought it's best to put it on there if we can.
How many are we gonna want?
Three thousand?
Perhaps it's worth having a separate print run for that isn't it?
"Yeah, might be."
"It's not  I think if they use this offset thing, the masters last about five hundred so you're not  it's not, it's not a silly amount."
Yeah.
"Would it take, oh wait a minute!"
Three thousand interviews
What
"say, would you think three thousand interviews?"
I'm just trying to think what we were averaging.
But I mean that  one of them's not gonna  you're not gonna get as many  on that B road.
Will we  will we want those?
Oh I can't remember you know what we used for Ormskirk
It doesn't matter if we  if we get too many cos you can always use
Well that's it.
Can't you?
Yeah.
Cos I wasn't sure of some of the answers.
And that it it's saying which of the following days of action has the group participated in.
I mean cos we haven't really sort of really done a proper day of action have we?
We've done little bits and pieces.
I know we did the returnable bottles.
.
I mean cos and we did that stall on peat but we didn't really take part in the peat day of action did we?
.What do you think?
Fiona and I did the electricity
What  at the supermarket .
Is that the global warming and electricity privatization?
That one?
Was it?
It was erm efficiency  of
Oh fuel and efficiency.
Right that one then.
"Oh we didn't, we didn't do the ozone layer one did we?"
Did you do a stall  on that ozone layer?
We did do something.
With the
"Oh we did, yes."
"with the, with er snow remember?"
That was Christmas last year wasn't it?
Oh yes that was
That was ozone.
Yes it was we did
Oh so I'll put down for that then.
Oh it looks quite good .
Right.
Have you written to your MP about fuel efficiency?
Yes I did.
We did.
"I think they were frightening years ago when they, when we were kids so they're frightening places."
"Well we had no, we had no erm  nothing to stop the pain."
No.
"We had no injections, we were just put in a chair and, and it cost"
That's right
two guineas for every filling
"I know, it's a lot of money."
I mean
"Yeah, week's wages yeah."
"But we, he didn't get more than two or three guineas a week did he when we were first"
"That's right, yeah yes"
"Then we get, I know  our dentist was very good, we've always said that if we had a good dentist and a good doctors we're on our holidays, and we have, we've been lucky wherever we've been"
Mm.
Mm.
"we've had good dentists, good doctors."
Oh it pays you to get a sympathetic one and one that's er not on the
But this one is lovely.
"This one's  young and he's so gentle, you know he"
Yes.
Oh they're marvellous.
"I think that's what Tony's harking back to, the old style when you went and they were a bit er callous."
"Yes indeed well,young, how old is he?"
Twenty  five?
"He's only in his twenties, yeah he ought not, no it wouldn't be would it?"
No.
"Twenty years ago they were, they were alright weren't they?"
What am I thinking about?
No I'm thinking about
"Well you know the first time I went was  oh I dunno, before the war you know when I was about four or five and I went to get one out  I mean my parents"
"but it was terrible I was screaming, I was terrified and, and, and I can still see the place you know, there's something very foreboding about the, the place and the chair was like a"
And everything was hard
wasn't it?
Is it going in The Post?
No.
Didn't we tell you that?
"To have it in er  Daily Post, The Post is the morning one  The Echo's the evening  to have it in for one day in The Post and The Echo, how much?"
"Dunno, about eighty quid."
Three hundred and ninety six pound sixty four pence.
So you said we'll have it in all week?
How big was the advert?
Er about a hundred words in a box.
Two columns wide and  erm eight centimetres down.
We reckoned that was about quarter of a page.
It's a lot of money isn't it?
But see  the reason  I have to send this to Liverpool for them to put it in
Mhm.
cos it has to go through our advertising agents.
Cos we advertise in a special format don't we?
We have the  dash lines round the box
Mm.
and we have the logo on the bottom and that.
So they've had to do it so  I mean she quoted me
thirty six quid for this  thirty six eighty four or something for the local paper.
But erm  you know it might be more but that's
Mhm.
nothing to do with me.
But I mean like  I didn't think it was worth putting it in The Post to start off with anyway.
But if we don't get a good response to this I might stick it in for the day  in The Post.
Mhm.
Is the secretary at  dealing with it or is she gonna forward it all on to you?
No I've put our address.
I said that I didn't like that idea to start off with
No well it
because although it's only a small concern she's gonna have her own stuff to do.
"Right, so that's the temporary staff."
Yep.
"So what we haven't made any progress on  beyond, on that side of things is erm  if we do the coding over in Caernarvon, where that will be."
Yeah.
Erm like I think we all sort of ruled out er
I don't think it's big enough is it?
"Because of the size, no."
Er just out of interest I did ring  the other day
Yeah right.
"Er  the  the room, the smallest room they have is for twenty five to thirty people"
Mm.
which I mean even that may be too big for what we want.
Erm in any case that is in use every week on a Monday and a Wednesday.
So already you're only talking
There was a thing about exams.
Wasn't it  didn't you ring them up and they said we have exams on or something?
No.
That must be something
Something goes on in that room on a Monday and a Wednesday.
Which room is that?
"That's  the, I've got it in the file, a small conference room or something like that, or the committee room or something it's called."
Cos there is a room called the navigation room.
No that wasn't an  that wasn't an option.
There was this one for twenty five to thirty people and then there was another one for say forty or fifty and then it  zoomed up to like a hundred.
And even if we were to use this
"Oh I know now, yes."
"small room, you couldn't leave anything on the walls so it would all be a  come down at night, back up in the morning"
What erm er did you look in the file and see what they hired last time?
Erm  no.
Cos it may
I mean I've probably seen it
Yeah.
Sing Don't be cruel .
I'm not singing at all.
Why not?
Because I can't sing.
Oh hang on the ex-directory number's ringing.
That's the boss he'll be complaining.
So there's no chance of getting rid of all these coaches and getting people to walk round the er the guided tours and stuff like that?
Er well that would defeat the whole object of offering the open topped tours if people were actually walking.
Well it would defeat you making a few bob .
There is actually there is actually walking tours around the city for those people who wish to opt for
Mm.
for a walking tour.
So there is the option of doing both the walking tour or the bus tour.
Okay hang on just a minute.
Er Danny?
He's the bo he's what they call the editor of the programme.
Right.
Okay just in case you're wondering who I'm talking t Danny anything else you want me to ask her?
He cos he are you sure we've done this erm everything all right?
Okay right sing along with me Rachael.

Ah.
Yes.
"without a sink, he's got the only room without a sink"
"He, he said, I said is Joanne in, and he went, oh, I don't think she is, actually."
"And I went, there's a message here for her, if Rebecca phones, I went, yes, I'm Rebecca, oh, right, okay."
"You leave a message like, and it's like, erm, I'll pop over and see you,and I was like, I mean, he just paused for breath, and I went, well, what time, and he went, well hang on, the message hasn't finished yet."
"So I went sorry, sorry, and he went, it's alright, and he went in, oh, thanks for that, thanks very much."
"He went, okay, then."
"He said, I'll give her the message, I tell her that everything's fine."
"I said, yeah, tell her that I got the message, and that you know, it's all fine."
"Okay then, right, see you later."
Bye.
I spoke to him last night as well.
"I mean, when I think I was  with my bags and things and he went,Jo, the message has gone through, everything's fine  I went,your sister, I relayed that little message which I thought was  which I thought was rather comical, you see, and I said, oh did you, and he said yeah."
"He said, everything's okay, she's got measles."
He's a nice bloke.
Yeah.
He seems like fluid poems.
Her and Kate will come and see me at four o'clock  and her and Kate will come and visit you.
"They will not be coming to the cinema, and I was like, what time are they gonna come, and he was like, hang on, I haven't finished yet."
"four o'clock, and he was like read it and he   oh,only fed ten P in and I got all the information that I needed to know."
"Yeah, I've written it all out in block."
Mm.
"He was only seventeen, wasn't he?"
"No,"
What's  what stinks then?
"Oh I didn't want to tell you this Phil, but"
What?
it's the
you've gotta
"No, this isn't gonna smell, I like the condom it's wearing"
It's just the things you poke your hairs up on a sharp stick
You can do a blue movie with this thing

"Do shut up, what's that doing in there?"
Get it out

"Oh thank you, oh I love these, what you done to them?"
"Don't know, they're melting"

"That was a long word, congeal"
Here's another word conjugal
"I don't know why, good God what the hell's he doing over the road?"
He's not in the middle of the road

"I mean, that"
"You might, and then again, you might be a millionaire inside three months."
"Yes, I said to her, think about it, I I was that frightened, I frightened meself to death, and I I wouldn't I wouldn't."
I hated it.
That's what I used to do every time I thought about selling 'ouse
You just got to do it.
Yeah.
"I thought about it, and thought about it, and then then changed my mind."
But this time I decided it's what I want to do and bugger it.
"If we don't sell it, we we haven't lost anything."
Oh well.
sell it till we move.
I honestly think myself
As long as we're not worse off than what we were before we moved.
"I honestly think meself, that I might have a have a couple of hard months, maybe three, first three months might be a bit difficult for me."
"Oh, it probably will be."
"Well, I think, once he gets established, and once he starts getting work in, I think meself, that work will start, won't say rolling in, but I think the work'll start coming in after about three months and I can get established."

And it's something else that we need to get
we can't just sort of
No exactly
"We've got to get, we should get more publicity."
But it's ever so easy for somebody to sit at home and say well you should be doing this and you should be doing that
Oh yeah yeah.

"No I'm I'm not sa , I'm not saying."
I'm not saying you should be  doing anything I'm just er
"No I didn't mean you, I meant them!"
No well .
I well really  I don't think you should say  you're not doing enough!
No
I think last year more or less shows that we really have to concentrate on one thing.
Do it and then plan
Yeah.
plan the next .
Because otherwise we just
And then write about it if we want to.
Yeah.
So what what we'll do quickly  to write and inform them all that we're doing this stall and   won't we?

Yeah.
"But at least they were happy, you know what I mean."
'Cos they were with other birds.

Not like dogs and cats.
No.
"I mean Albert said,if we do get that bungalow, we are  'cos the owner, he said she'll disappear."

Yeah
"It were always fit and we were only there a fortnight, three weeks disappeared."
"I mean, if our Whisky died, I wouldn't be as upset about it, as I would about these."
But if she disappeared I'd be worried all time.
And yet
Aye.
"You know, like when our Dawn's kittens disappeared."
"It, they weren't bothered, I think Mick took them away meself."
Yeah.
I'm convinced he did.
I think he did.

without a break.
Well maybe sometimes it's not their fault.
Most of the time people don't want to be
Yeah.
on the street.
But how do you know that?
"I mean, how could you be so sure it isn't their fault?"
They tell us.
Well those people out on the streets tell me that all the time.

Of course I've seen the reports!
I'm not blind!
"Well the majority of them are a , abused or get thrown out of mental centres, I mean, some of them just run away from home because they want to  and that's only a minority, lots of them have"

The problem is we're buttoned down on deliveries on standard bearings cos of the balls up about .
Well okay so you've got to talk
.
you've got to talk your way through that.
It's the precision bearings that's really the prize.
I mean that's why .
Yes.
"And and and of course now that er now that we've got the total business beginning to operate as one, the chances of letting them down on standard bearings is very much smaller than it ever was before."
Yeah.
The problem the reason we've let her down on standard bearings is because of this changeover.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
You see it's got nothing to do with the with our
No no.
competence as a supplier.

Kelly.
You are once again doing it completely and utterly wrong.
at the wrong place again.
Kelly you have been using
"Kelly, you've done it again."
"Can you walk the right way, no, now do it right Kelly."
Let's see you actually do something for a change..
How do you do this one down here?
You should have.
What else have you been doing wrong Kelly?
. You've been using a brush instead of a spatula for spreading glue.
The spatula .
Right.
Now  I hope that  only Kelly has been doing things as desperately wrong  as Kelly has been doing them.
Looking around at all the  there are a whole lot of people who have left the same even border all the way round instead of having an even border top and sides and leaving a bigger border at the bottom.
Which you'll remember you were told to do so that there's a space For your name.
Sarah stand up and come over here.
"Sam, will you stop doing that please my love and come across here so that you two don't ."
I'm using a white colour pencil here  in order to  draw a line from  to the work that is being mounted on here.
And you might say that the word has not been mounted on there.
No it hasn't because we .
Can you see what I'm doing without me having to ?
Or are you baffled by what you see?
?
Mm?
No.
"it's a demonstration and the, the line itself  is like framed within a frame."
Yeah.
I just saw somebody put it on them on the .
I used to be quite good at
and I'll ask again on Tuesday when I ring.
It's supposed to be very good for you.
"I used to be very good at this, I use to  ."
So did I
"Yes, you did, yes."
We'll put it on the list and I'll try on Tuesday for you.
.
So that's all I've got with me after I've been to .
"Well, you've  anyway, so."
"If they're more than eighty, I, I can't have it anyway."
So you want to keep
"Yo-yo,."
Oh .
"I'm all ready if I got my handbag, but when I start walking because of the cars being broken into I don't carry a handbag, you see, I just carry money in my pocket."
"Oh, there's a lot had their cars broken into ."
"I've had mine done twice, mine done twice, mm, the police were up the other day lying in ambush, and I'd spotted them and phoned the local police station and said there's men lurking in the bushes of  are they policemen?, she said yes madam, they're policemen."
"I don't, I thought they looked to they looked to clean and, and well groomed"
Yeah.
"to be erm, sort of scroungers."
"Right, it doesn't pay to leave your handbag in the car."
No way.
Certainly doesn't.
It isn't the money because the insurance company pay me back the money
"Yeah, yeah."
"the car insurance mends my windows, but it's, it's your bank books, and your credit cards"
I know.
and your driving licence
I know.
"your insurance, all those little things you know, and you don't"
I know what's coming.
You you know what's coming.
George Miller called this the span of conception.
The capacity of the brain to conceive or hold on to any information.
You'll see there we've got three boxed a six number a ten number and a twelve number.
What I'm gonna do is just speak out a six digit number.
What I want you to do is try and hold on to it in your brain then when I've finished write it down in the appropriate box and see if you can hold on to it long enough to do that.
"So the first number, listen to this the first number and try and hold on to it."
Three eight one five six two.
Just write that down.
. Okay?
Let's try and ten digit number then.
Listen to ten digits try to hold on to them and then write them down.
"Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've gone wrong
"Okay, try a twelve digit, just for the experiment."
"Try and hold on to twelve numbers, here we go."
Listen to these.
"Nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven."
". Now that's it's interesting what Joanne said that you you lost it in the middle somewhere, yeah?"
I mean er let's just read them just see how you got on.
"Three, eight, one, five, six, two."
"Okay, Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've got the  mixed up
"Yeah and nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven"
say that one again
"nine, O, five,one, six, two, four, seven, three , eight, two, seven."
Nearly got it .
So but I mean where was it.
Was it generally in the middle or at one end or
"The first, the first two numbers"
yeah okay
And the they'll turn a week about.
"But the the there's not the call in this er place for, for women in the weaving department."
Mhm.
"But our department hasn't changed, the women are just doing the same job as they did sixty"
Mhm.
years ago.
And probably in the picking as well.
In the winding it's just  their lot hasn't changed a great deal.
"Mhm, mhm."
Except I would say the winders are  worse off cos they're doing three shifts .
"Right, mhm."
And I just couldn't hack that I don't think.
Aha.
Mm.
"So, erm have you got, do you have a lot of friends through work do you find, I mean do you sort of organize things after work, do you ever go for a drink ?"
"Well a lot, a lot of people er er do er ju just about three weeks ago two women from our department retired so we had er we had a night out up in , that's where they live, so there is that kind of thing,"
Aha.
"or if on the few occasions that someone gets married, they hold a night."
", aha."
Er and some of the girls do like make-up parties and things like that.
Some
Mhm.
of them go to the weight training at .
Mhm.
"But as I say I don't do that kind of thing, I, I prefer to go away to the hills,"
"Aha, are you a keen climber?"
"and, and do my thing."
Mhm.
My daughter thinks I'm mad.
"When it came to my fortieth birthday she said, what would you like for your birthday?"
"I said, I'd like a really good pair of trainers."
"And I'm no good at tying laces so she got me a pair of Adidas you know with the velcro,"
East end then.
Oh he's got a nice shirt on.
"in a pub he was, got drunk and for a twenty pound bet shaved off all his hair."
I still owe him the money.
But he is stupid cos he went hitchhiking once and left a day early to avoid traffic.
"Here, do you know what I fancy?"
I fancy an icecream.
She said well I'll go and get you one.
"He said no, you know what your memory's like, you're bound to forget."
"She said no I won't, what do you fancy?"
"He said well  I fancy  vanilla and strawberry icecream with chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, crushed nuts and a flake."
"She said right, vanilla and strawberry icecream, chocolate sauce, crushed nuts."
"said right, I shall be back in five minutes."
Two hours later she come back with a ham sandwich.
He said you silly cow!
You forgot the mustard.
East end.
This week on handy hints we are talking fishing.
I once went for a job as a fisherman.
"The boss said Connolly you've got the job, you start on Monday."
"I said that sounds alright, could I have a sub?"
He said no you're on a fishing boat like everybody else.
Well one of the greatest qualities a fisherman can have is of course patience.
And you can spend the whole day without a bite.
"As for me, I always take my packed lunch."
And pot noodles is one of my favourite dishes.
No.
I don't think  that the pub is open  the cafs aren't open  the amusements aren't open.
The bar's open.
No.
All locked up and in darkness.
?
See they'll maintain that
Yeah that's right!
Social security .

Well that's like when older people when they save for their  retirement and that  you know
Yeah.

No.
"Well  Well I think, I, I don't think it pays you to save up  er"
No.
for your retirement and so you'll be comfortable off  cos you might as well live off your state like everybody else.
Yeah.
You might

And a seconder?
Seconded.

I'll give you er  give you an extra cup of tea at supper time.
Thank you.
"Oh  hang on a minute, the secretary can go first."
Oh matters arising.
there's none arising.
No  correct.
No matters arising.
No.
propose  second
Yeah but Joe  Joe proposed
Yeah we've done that bit  we've done that bit
and Brian  seconded
we've done that bit
now we're on to matters arising.
"Yeah  minutes of the previous A G M proposed and seconded, right?"
It it's blue.
"I'm sure, she said it's blue."
It's got some cream in it as well ain't it.
"Well,more, so I couldn't see, but I just, to me it was just like er, thought it was like minky coloured."
"But mind ya,more like a, but what I was gonna say is,"
Suppose to be a  but I mean
"On back of it, on back of it, she's got like all them tapestry pictures laid over back of it."
Yeah.
"She got, same on chairs, all, you can hardly see the suite, 'cos she's got, she says, and er, I says to her, I says to her, oh it's nice your suite, innit."
"She says yeah, if I can keep it clean, she got all cushions covered up, well like er, er"
"Keep it clean, there's only them two buggers."
"I know, but what's the point of having a new suite, and having old covers on it like that."
"They make me laugh, when they sit in 'ouse with blanket round them, so they don't have to turn 'eating up."
I don't
"Aye, you go in there and it's empty that other"
That's empty.
"I know, I see it."
"I tell you what, you  to make mistakes in your life, I mean and, I just, well one of those things that  that I'm pleased about, is that I just  George when"
Don't work.
Aye.
When what?
When I stopped with Colin.
Oh well.
"You don't know how green, how green the grass is until you actually stand"
You can't go till your dad comes.
"Why, I'm going home all by myself, then."
"Well, get off there."
get on with it.
We do
You'll end up with a smack bum.
"Benjy, will you leave her alone."
Are you  have you told her to leave me alone?
no.
But she
Ov over a month ago.
"When they came on Sunday, when it were your anniversary, she'd got diarrhoea and sickness, Margaret."
I think she were off work last week.
Yeah.
"I I mean, you're anything like that, but not not for a month, I mean."
I got two toilet papers on .
Oh yeah.
"Well, put one in your pocket then,"
I  Margaret  last night.
"Oh I I bet  if you look at it,"
I don't Pete's been to me mum's for about six months.
Because I can't remembering him going.
He never goes without Margaret.
"She always goes herself, she were down there last night, by herself."
He were at pub.
Mm.
"Well, I said to her, told her about not having nowt to eat from that Wednesday morning, er Wednesday dinner time, till Thursday when they went"
Well she took away fish last night for her supper.
Oh.
"And that she she looked shocked, you know, she didn't didn't know me like, and er, well she was shocked, and then I said I said, right  well we'll have to get together and sort something out about stopping with her, and Pete said straight away."
"Margaret's there every day, she goes out every morning."
Right.
Not that he actually asked her.
years ago about Beryl.
I told you that's what he said.
"And I said, aye up, I don't mean in day-time."
"I says on a night-time, I said, you know, she can't leave her home now, I said, she can't manage to put coal on fire, and she can't manage to get up up to eat and drink and that, I said, I don't mind dropping off and taking me turn on the night-time but I mean, but it's hard, it's hard with me with kids every night."
It's  for you with kids.
"But I don't, certainly don't mind taking her down once a week or twice a week and taking me turn."
"Karen there's no need, no need, you're needed at bloody home."
Erm minus infinity.
"So, it's minus infinity or plus infinity."
When X is very large or very very small.
at minus a million.
Erm
What would that approximate to?
A million plus six.
No
"Do you  enter a big competition, and you could win a million pounds plus six."
"Compared to the million pounds nobody bothers much about the six, so"
Just a
"when it gets very large, Y is roughly equal to X squared."
"So if you know the graph of Y equals X squared which unfortunately I can't draw tonight it's  draw it for you, could draw it from the inside  keep telling everyone else."
Right.
"Now, there's a Y equals X squared."
Yeah.
"So around here, round this bit,there won't be any difference."
Hmm.
"Around  six plus six, let's say plus six in there."
"For, for some length, that'll be sort of almost flat, won't it?"
I mean
Mm.
"till we get to X equals a one and it starts making a bit of difference, so it'll probably go like this."
"Okay, so a lot of it, that's a very important, those are sort of very important parts of the graph."
Tend to
Mm.
get neglected.
People say oh I'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Right?
If we had something like Y equals erm X minus ten.
Right.
"Times  X minus erm or times ten minus X  like that, okay."
"It's gotten on to her land  and off her land and into the ditch, which is  you know the N R A"
Where is that?
Er  Roydon some way?
You know where all those nurseries are?
And because the oil is coming  to the ditch via her land they can't have a go at the primary source.
"This is what she said and I, to me it doesn't sound right."
She said nobody'll  Nob they all say they haven't got the power to prosecute and I said well the N R A has.
They've got more clout than anybody else.
Mm.
More clout than the District Council.
And then she keeps saying but you know what these councils are like.
"And I said I'm not talking about the council, I'm talking about the N R A!"
And now she wants me  to find out how can er found out about a solicitor or somebody who specialises in this sort of thing.
To take the District Council to court.
So that she's more expensive to them  than this other lot will be.
Apparently they're causing quite te dreadful pollution.
It's all this oil  from the boilers leaking on to her  into her soil and out into the ditch.
Well
Certainly is.
"But erm  in the back of my mind there comes  that she's saying to me  don't get involved, don't get involved."
"You know who owns all that land, it's the mafia."
And this could be why she's getting nowhere.
"You could give her er erm er wr , give her the address of Friends of the Earth, London."
Oh she's already .
That's how she got in contact with me!
You see they refer everybody on and then I
"Well but they should give her a soli , the name of a solicitor."
There must be green solicitors about.
I  have to write to them and ask them and about a month later they reply to me and I pass it on to her.
Because I don't know off hand.
"I've asked Jeffrey to ask a friend about it who's a  solicitor if he knows anybody but I c , I can't  I haven't got the in information."
I don't
Six.
So the gradient
Six .
"Wh when you do it to sort of fairly accurately like that, it  six."
"When we did it fairly roughly, it came to one point two?"
Yeah.
"Erm  six Because, because we didn't do this bit did we?"
That should have gone I think that was wrong.
That should have been six times nought point two over
Minu
Yeah.
Which again comes to six.
"So, that's more like it."
"What's the, what angle has a tan of six, then?"
Now it'll be in the seventy or eighties.
Eighty.
Eighty?
Good.
to be fifty.
Erm you can do that with any curve.
"If I gave you sort of X to the seventeen or something, well you could put two values in."
"And you could bring them fairly close together and say well I can't tell you exactly what the gradient is at that point, but if you draw a tiny little line and take the gradient of that."
Mm.
"That's er that's good enough, that's close enough."
That's a very good approximation.
Yeah.
"So gradients are a very important part of, of sketching a curve."
Erm you already pointed out some of the important points where the gradient gets to zero.
"Erm  does, does  things that might be interesting?"
Okay.
"You've already mentioned it earlier, actually, symmetry."
Not always symmetrical about this axis.
"No, I can't see the argument!"
"Well, to me you shouldn't have twenty five kids anyway!"
Well that's dictatorship
"Because because it, I would have a dictatorship on that!"
"I mean that's, I would have"
"Well that's, alright well  well that's"
"control of the world population, I se"
I would limit to two children.
"I would er, have control of the"
That's another argument!
world population.
Well fair enough!
But
Yeah.
that is another argument!
"It is, we're on the road ."
"That is er, that would mu , that would be my first priority."
Oh !
I thought your first one was everyone getting
I'm not go
the same pay!
"Yes, so everybody"
So
would need the same pay.
"But no matter what you'd, you know at the end of the week or the year or whatever"
"No, but I mean  I mean"
"there's all those people who have the same pay, that at the end of the year they would end up with different amounts  because people would manage money differently"
Differently
some would spend it
Of course they would!
as soon as they get it
Oh yeah.
Ten o'clock!
Oh hang on I'm leaving at ten cos I want to be there a little early  and start them but I hope to get some perks.
Nine okay?
Wake up at nine?
Yeah I'm going to Waitrose at nine.
So which fair is this  at school is it?
"Yeah, what do you think I'm talking about!"
"Oh I don't know I heard it's a craft fair, that's all I heard."
All this time Daddy thinks it's a like
No I said it's a  lovely craft fair.
It's called Christmas fair but you and Darren have got a stall so  ah
Why did you know what to do there then?
I already bought a children's  thirty five pee each.
Yeah.
Zoe  said  are they for your little   said which little fun are you talking about Zoe?
Said yes they're both for Paul ha ha!
Little   Look at those brilliant grafts Mum  double grafts they're called  Hobart and Darwin.
Why are they called double grafts?
They're not called double they've sort of got a  about rainfall and temperature.
"Oh and they show two things  so y you'll have to see if there's any correlation between the two  is there any correlation between rainfall and temperature, and is there?"
When rainfall goes up does temperature up and vice versa?
Dunno just gotta describe them.
"Well that's what you have to say, is there any correlation between"
What does correlation mean?
They all correlate.
Yeah.
It's connection isn't it Kev?
Mm.
Yeah  and you've gotta see
"That's level six, you should be doing that."
What's level six?
"Well correlation I've just done that with all my children, you should be level six, no good doing it, you should be it  Want you to do two pieces of work for Monday and  all the same level, so there's an extra  two you've got to do."
"Erm, no I haven't, Claire has, nick some of hers."
Yeah.
"I've got some Marmite, and I'm just"
Do you want some jam?
"Claire's got some Vitalite, I think."
Anything will do.
"Mike organized it, for me to go over there and then  I didn't need to be there at all, cos noth nobody turned up."
Ah.
So I've er
I'm sure they're really grateful for you
I don't think Maryanne even knows I've been there.
You don't think what?
Maryanne knows I've been.
No.
"Do you arrange it all, then?"
"I think, yeah, well he rang me, so erm, I think she was expecting, I think they, when they left the house this morning, he was thinking, he'd be able to get home in time for it, and erm, then he got to work and the day wasn't, hadn't worked out the way he expected."
"And like, did you hear about that unexploded bomb, in the Second World War, the two thousand pound bomb on the"
News last night.
No.
"Do you want tea or coffee,?"
"I'll have a coffee, please."
"There was two thousand pound, Second World War bomb, they found in Walton, which is right near the River Thames which is, like, past Hampton Court, and Mike said that he'd have to go out there today, and it's er erm, this guy who he works for, owns a Leisure Centre right beside where this bomb is."
So he'll need to go down there with his associates and had to evacuate the Leisure Centre.
"Oh, really?"
They just found this bomb and they were going to have a controlled explosion at the car park
Oh.
"So, that made the day a bit more interesting, but he's been stuck with er, all these upper class councillors that telling him what his job is, and"
Don't go down very well.
"He said, he's not impressed, and er, I think the idea that go   at a meeting today,"
"Yeah, turn that power off before you do any more to that  it's silly isn't it ?"
Erm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
right?
"So he's walking about, the shorts are this wide"
the rest of it's like this here  he runs into the water and he's    into the water like   Him and Bobby  used to
God love him.
dive off
Petey  and Bobbie  used to dive off the top board like
Aye.
head first.
Yes.
He's a total wanker .
Total wanker
"I mean there's Jody  and all those  like and they're a real dipstick, they have balls but that wee kid is just so  unbelievably stupid like, he was just like"
Who?
Petey
I know.
You just flip on your back like and
"you get these jocks that get up there, big  and they think they are so cool and then"
"Big fat massive hairy chest, hairy chest, tiny swimming trunks"
Yeah.
"that is my seat by the way, erm"
"hairy chest, bit of a sun tan, they've bee they were away last summer"
hanging over the
"oh like  totally over, that's why he doesn't need to wear t too many swimming trunks cos you can't see anything anyway"
"runs along  splash, doesn't even make it, make it round, he just  and goes like this and then, and then lands in the water like that."
Well this guy's jumped off the second board and done a belly flop
Ooh fuck!
Ooh
"and he  he got up and he was totally, totally red."
It was totally red
"oh  ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, and everybody in the whole pool heard it just go   everybody was going  ooh!"
Oh fuck!
One of them said er
when they start bringing the
"yes, yes that's right, lower"
lowering the taxes
"Everybody come here, this is the place to run a big business"
Yeah
cheap labour
Yeah
"you can fiddle all you want, get away with it, er"
I
Well Nor you can't help me on this me old son
Er
"it's a shame really, no he bought about erm"
I'm not even gonna volunteer to do
about erm ten of these and then the head
So apart from those three we said what else is there Ma
"No, well he's got a catalogue and we can send"
"No, that, that catalogue he had I rang them and he"
sent me one
Beeswax was it?
"Pure beeswax, what else?"
I bet that was a
It was pure restoration materials
Yes
I've forgotten now
I'm sure that's where he said he got it from the
wax
He said he got his waxes fifteen years ago and he's still using them
Oh
"I think he gets all his stuff from that guy at, he got the brochure didn't he from somewhere up North?"
"Yes, well Molly's just said she's rung them"
"Well yeah, well I've got the brochure"
"And this bit I do before the lesson and I do this, clean it up afterwards."
You don't have to do this bit.
"But notice that I'm pouring slowly and gently away from me into the dish which I shall then put in here, and I'm going to put the  the plate, which I described to you before, which has been covered with  what's on the back?"
Straw hat varnish.
What's on the front?
Hard wax.
Hard wax.
And scratched so the acid should bite through there.
Has anybody got a chronometer on them?
What?
you have haven't you?
What?
A watch.
Will you time er  two minutes please?
From the moment this goes into the acid.
You lower it in gently and sloosh it about so that the acid covers the surface.
"Right, you may troop by that and look down there, notice I wasn't wearing the goggles that was naughty of me wasn't it?"
I should have been  er while I go and get a turkey feather.
"Okay, you go and have a look at that covered up."
And try and see if we've got er   forming on the lines.
yes.
"That's what makes er these chemicals so dangerous, you don't know what they are."
What do you think I've got this for?
"Sorry, I can't hear you Paul."
So that er
I still can't hear you.
To scrape the zinc off.
To scrape the zinc off?
When it's ?
"Very good, yes."
That's correct.
As the zinc is eaten away  air bubbl er sorry not air bubbles  gas bubbles  I don't know what gas.
"` It is behind the oven , ' answered she ."
And again was silence .
"` Mother , dear mother , ' said the young man at last , ' I am almost afraid to ask you ; but I really have grown so stupid of late ."
Where did I hide my own money ? '
"But at this question the old woman flew into a passion , and vowed that if she could find a rod she would bring his memory back to him ."
"Luckily , no rod was within her reach , and the Sodno managed , after a little , to coax her back into good humour , and at length she told him that the youngest Stalo had buried his treasure under the very place where she was sitting ."
"` Dear mother , ' said Lyman , who had come in unseen , and was kneeling in front of the fire ."
"` Dear mother , do you know who it is you have been talking with ? '"
"The old woman started , but answered quietly : ` It is a Sodno , I suppose ? '"
"` You have guessed right , ' replied Lyma ."
"The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane , which she always used to kill her victims , but it was not there , for Lyma had put it in the fire ."
` Where is my iron cane ? '
asked the old woman .
` There ! '
"answered Lyma , pointing to the flames ."
"The old woman sprang forwards and seized it , but her clothes caught fire , and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes ."
"So the Sodno brothers found the treasure , and they carried it , and their sister and the reindeer , to their own home , and were the richest men in all Lapland ."
"Andras Baive -LSB- From Lapplandische Marchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings .
"The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion , and thought that there was no one like him in the world , till , by-and-by , it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp , Andras Baive by name , who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff ."
"Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that , and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense , why , let them !"
"The winter was long and cold , and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive , when suddenly , on a frosty day , he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso ."
"The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength , and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour ."
"As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore , and his face shone with pleasure ."
"` That is the very thing , ' laughed he , ' I will make him jump over that boat . '"
"Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge , and they soon settled the terms of the wager ."
"He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner , and would get a large sum of money as the prize ."
"So , followed by many of the villagers , the two men walked down to the sea ."
"An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play , and to hold the stakes , and Andras , as the stranger was told to jump first ."
"Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place , he ran forward , with his head well thrown back , and cleared the boat with a mighty bound ."
"The lookers-on cheered him , and indeed he well deserve it ; but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do ."
"On he came , taller than Andras by several inches , but heavier of build ."
`` I suppose that 's it .
"Well , I like it , and I shall keep on trying , for being loved by every one is about the nicest thing in the world ."
"Is n't it , Ed ? ''"
"asked Jack , with a gentle tweak of the ear as he put a question which he knew would get no answer , for Ed was so modest he could not see wherein he differed from other boys , nor believe that the sunshine he saw in other faces was only the reflection from his own ."
"Sunday evening Mrs. Minot sat by the fire , planning how she should tell some good news she had been saving up all day ."
"Mrs. Pecq knew it , and seemed so delighted that she went about smiling as if she did not know what trouble meant , and could not do enough for the family ."
"She was downstairs now , seeing that the clothes were properly prepared for the wash , so there was no one in the Bird Room but Mamma and the children ."
"Frank was reading up all he could find about some Biblical hero mentioned in the day 's sermon ; Jill lay where she had lain for nearly four long months , and though her face was pale and thin with the confinement , there was an expression on it now sweeter even than health ."
"Jack sat on the rug beside her , looking at a white carnation through the magnifying glass , while she was enjoying the perfume of a red one as she talked to him ."
"`` If you look at the white petals you 'll see that they sparkle like marble , and go winding a long way down to the middle of the flower where it grows sort of rosy ; and in among the small , curly leaves , like fringed curtains , you can see the little green fairy sitting all alone ."
"Your mother showed me that , and I think it is very pretty ."
"I call it a ` fairy , ' but it is really where the seeds are hidden and the sweet smell comes from . ''"
"Jill spoke softly lest she should disturb the others , and , as she turned to push up her pillow , she saw Mrs. Minot looking at her with a smile she did not understand ."
"`` Did you speak , 'm ? ''"
"she asked , smiling back again , without in the least knowing why ."
"`` No , dear ."
"I was listening and thinking what a pretty little story one could make out of your fairy living alone down there , and only known by her perfume . ''"
"`` Tell it , Mamma ."
"It is time for our story , and that would be a nice one , I guess , '' said Jack , who was as fond of stories as when he sat in his mother 's lap and chuckled over the hero of the beanstalk ."
"`` We do n't have fairy tales on Sunday , you know , '' began Jill regretfully ."
"`` Call it a parable , and have a moral to it , then it will be all right , '' put in Frank , as he shut his big book , having found what he wanted ."
"`` I like stories about saints , and the good and wonderful things they did , '' said Jill , who enjoyed the wise and interesting bits Mrs. Minot often found for her in grown-up books , for Jill had thoughtful times , and asked questions which showed that she was growing fast in mind if not in body ."
"`` This is a true story ; but I will disguise it a little , and call it ` The Miracle of Saint Lucy , ' '' began Mrs. Minot , seeing a way to tell her good news and amuse the children likewise ."
"Frank retired to the easy-chair , that he might sleep if the tale should prove too childish for him ."
"Jill settled herself among her cushions , and Jack lay flat upon the rug , with his feet up , so that he could admire his red slippers and rest his knee , which ached ."
`` Once upon a time there was a queen who had two princes . ''
`` Was n't there a princess ? ''
"asked Jack , interested at once ."
"`` No ; and it was a great sorrow to the queen that she had no little daughter , for the sons were growing up , and she was often very lonely ."
"`` Like Snowdrop 's mother , '' whispered Jill ."
"`` Now , do n't keep interrupting , children , or we never shall get on , '' said Frank , more anxious to hear about the boys that were than the girl that was not ."
"`` One day , when the princes were out -- ahem !"
We all seem to be getting on pretty well .
"The Newbridge people like Jane , I hear ; and I think White Sands is tolerably satisfied with your humble servant ... all except Mr. Andrew Spencer ."
I met Mrs. Peter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that Mr. Spencer did n't approve of my methods . ''
"`` Have you ever noticed , '' asked Anne reflectively , `` that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable ?"
Why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you ?
"Mrs. H. B. DonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it HER duty to inform me that Mrs. Harmon Andrew did n't approve of my reading fairy tales to the children , and that Mr. Rogerson thought Prillie was n't coming on fast enough in arithmetic ."
If Prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better .
"I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her , though I 've never been able to catch him red-handed . ''"
`` Have you succeeded in reconciling Mrs. DonNELL 's hopeful son to his saintly name ? ''
"`` Yes , '' laughed Anne , `` but it was really a difficult task ."
"At first , when I called him ` St. Clair ' he would not take the least notice until I 'd spoken two or three times ; and then , when the other boys nudged him , he would look up with such an aggrieved air , as if I 'd called him John or Charlie and he could n't be expected to know I meant him ."
So I kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him .
I told him his mother wished me to call him St. Clair and I could n't go against her wishes .
He saw it when it was all explained out ... he 's really a very reasonable little fellow ... and he said I could call him St. Clair but that he 'd ` lick the stuffing ' out of any of the boys that tried it .
"Of course , I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language ."
Since then I call him St. Clair and the boys call him Jake and all goes smoothly .
"He informs me that he means to be a carpenter , but Mrs. DonNELL says I am to make a college professor out of him . ''"
"The mention of college gave a new direction to Gilbert 's thoughts , and they talked for a time of their plans and wishes ... gravely , earnestly , hopefully , as youth loves to talk , while the future is yet an untrodden path full of wonderful possibilities ."
Gilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor .
"`` It 's a splendid profession , '' he said enthusiastically ."
`` A fellow has to fight something all through life ... did n't somebody once define man as a fighting animal ?
... and I want to fight disease and pain and ignorance ... which are all members one of another .
"I want to do my share of honest , real work in the world , Anne ... add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began ."
The folks who lived before me have done so much for me that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me .
It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race . ''
"`` I 'd like to add some beauty to life , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` I do n't exactly want to make people KNOW more ... though I know that IS the noblest ambition ... but I 'd love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me ... to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I had n't been born . ''
"`` I think you 're fulfilling that ambition every day , '' said Gilbert admiringly ."
And he was right .
Anne was one of the children of light by birthright .
"After she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across it like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it , for the time being at least , as hopeful and lovely and of good report ."
Finally Gilbert rose regretfully .
"Wait till I go , and then we will stay all day , and pick as many berries as you want . ''"
"`` You never do go , you are so busy , and I 'm tired of waiting ."
I 'd rather go and get the berries for you all myself .
"I love to pick 'em , and I want to fill my new pail dreffly , '' sobbed Rob ."
"The pathetic sight of great tears tinkling into the dear new pail , and threatening to fill it with salt water instead of huckleberries , touched all the ladies present ."
"His mother patted the weeper on his back ; Daisy offered to stay home with him ; and Nan said , in her decided way , `` Let him come ; I 'll take care of him . ''"
"`` If Franz was going I would n't mind , for he is very careful ; but he is haying with the father , and I 'm not sure about the rest of you , '' began Mrs. Bhaer ."
"`` It 's so far , '' put in Jack ."
"`` I 'd carry him if I was going wish I was , '' said Dan , with a sigh ."
"`` Thank you , dear , but you must take care of your foot ."
I wish I could go .
"Stop a minute , I think I can manage it after all ; '' and Mrs. Bhaer ran out to the steps , waving her apron wildly ."
"Silas was just driving away in the hay-cart , but turned back , and agreed at once , when Mrs. Jo proposed that he should take the whole party to the pasture , and go for them at five o'clock ."
"`` It will delay your work a little , but never mind ; we will pay you in huckleberry pies , '' said Mrs. Jo , knowing Silas 's weak point ."
"His rough , brown face brightened up , and he said , with a cheery `` Haw !"
haw ! ''
"`` Wal now , Mis ' Bhaer , if you go to bribin ' of me , I shall give in right away . ''"
"`` Now , boys , I have arranged it so that you can all go , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , running back again , much relieved , for she loved to make them happy , and always felt miserable when she had disturbed the serenity of her little sons ; for she believed that the small hopes and plans and pleasures of children should be tenderly respected by grown-up people , and never rudely thwarted or ridiculed ."
`` Can I go ? ''
"said Dan , delighted ."
`` I thought especially of you .
"Be careful , and never mind the berries , but sit about and enjoy the lovely things which you know how to find all about you , '' answered Mrs. Bhaer , who remembered his kind offer to her boy ."
`` Me too !
me too ! ''
"sung Rob , dancing with joy , and clapping his precious pail and cover like castanets ."
"`` Yes , and Daisy and Nan must take good care of you ."
"Be at the bars at five o'clock , and Silas will come for you all . ''"
"Robby cast himself upon his mother in a burst of gratitude , promising to bring her every berry he picked , and not eat one ."
"Then they were all packed into the hay-cart , and went rattling away , the brightest face among the dozen being that of Rob , as he sat between his two temporary little mothers , beaming upon the whole world , and waving his best hat ; for his indulgent mamma had not the heart to bereave him of it , since this was a gala-day to him ."
"Such a happy afternoon as they had , in spite of the mishaps which usually occur on such expeditions !"
"Of course Tommy came to grief , tumbled upon a hornet 's nest and got stung ; but being used to woe , he bore the smart manfully , till Dan suggested the application of damp earth , which much assuaged the pain ."
"Daisy saw a snake , and flying from it lost half her berries ; but Demi helped her to fill up again , and discussed reptiles most learnedly the while ."
Dick exclaimed .
`` Small blame to him .
"Ye look liker maid than man ; and I tell you more -- y ' are a strange-looking rogue for a boy ; but for a hussy , Jack , ye would be right fair -- ye would ."
Ye would be well favoured for a wench . ''
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , `` ye know right well that I am none . ''"
"`` Nay , I know that ; I do but jest , '' said Dick ."
"`` Ye 'll be a man before your mother , Jack ."
"What cheer , my bully !"
Ye shall strike shrewd strokes .
"Now , which , I marvel , of you or me , shall be first knighted , Jack ?"
"for knighted I shall be , or die for ` t. ` Sir Richard Shelton , Knight ' : it soundeth bravely ."
But ` Sir John Matcham ' soundeth not amiss . ''
"`` Prithee , Dick , stop till I drink , '' said the other , pausing where a little clear spring welled out of the slope into a gravelled basin no bigger than a pocket ."
"`` And O , Dick , if I might come by anything to eat !"
-- my very heart aches with hunger . ''
"`` Why , fool , did ye not eat at Kettley ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` I had made a vow -- it was a sin I had been led into , '' stammered Matcham ; `` but now , if it were but dry bread , I would eat it greedily . ''"
"`` Sit ye , then , and eat , '' said Dick , `` while that I scout a little forward for the road . ''"
"And he took a wallet from his girdle , wherein were bread and pieces of dry bacon , and , while Matcham fell heartily to , struck farther forth among the trees ."
"A little beyond there was a dip in the ground , where a streamlet soaked among dead leaves ; and beyond that , again , the trees were better grown and stood wider , and oak and beech began to take the place of willow and elm ."
"The continued tossing and pouring of the wind among the leaves sufficiently concealed the sounds of his footsteps on the mast ; it was for the ear what a moonless night is to the eye ; but for all that Dick went cautiously , slipping from one big trunk to another , and looking sharply about him as he went ."
"Suddenly a doe passed like a shadow through the underwood in front of him , and he paused , disgusted at the chance ."
"This part of the wood had been certainly deserted , but now that the poor deer had run , she was like a messenger he should have sent before him to announce his coming ; and instead of pushing farther , he turned him to the nearest well-grown tree , and rapidly began to climb ."
Luck had served him well .
"The oak on which he had mounted was one of the tallest in that quarter of the wood , and easily out-topped its neighbours by a fathom and a half ; and when Dick had clambered into the topmost fork and clung there , swinging dizzily in the great wind , he saw behind him the whole fenny plain as far as Kettley , and the Till wandering among woody islets , and in front of him , the white line of high-road winding through the forest ."
The boat had been righted -- it was even now midway on the ferry .
"Beyond that there was no sign of man , nor aught moving but the wind ."
"He was about to descend , when , taking a last view , his eye lit upon a string of moving points about the middle of the fen ."
"Plainly a small troop was threading the causeway , and that at a good pace ; and this gave him some concern as he shinned vigorously down the trunk and returned across the wood for his companion ."
"CHAPTER IV -- A GREENWOOD COMPANY Matcham was well rested and revived ; and the two lads , winged by what Dick had seen , hurried through the remainder of the outwood , crossed the road in safety , and began to mount into the high ground of Tunstall Forest ."
"The trees grew more and more in groves , with heathy places in between , sandy , gorsy , and dotted with old yews ."
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely ; and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."
"So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him , but this time it ran at him , and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat ."
"You must not think , however , that he was a coward , for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other , but the perambulator had gone , and he never saw any other one ."
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle .
"It was a child 's spade which he had found near St. Govor 's Well , and he thought it was a paddle ."
Do you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes ?
"If so , I think it rather silly of you ."
"What I mean is that , of course , one must pity him now and then , but to pity him all the time would be impertinence ."
"He thought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens , and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it ."
"He played without ceasing , while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"He could be neither of these things , for he had never heard of them , but do you think he is to be pitied for that ?"
"Oh , he was merry !"
"He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your father ."
"Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment ."
Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?
That is how Peter leaps them .
-LSB- Illustration : Fairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk -RSB- And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Thrush 's Nest ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- IV LOCK-OUT TIME It is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children ."
"Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was not a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies came trooping in that very evening ."
"They ca n't resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed to go , and also partly because they are so cunning ."
"They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !"
"-LSB- Illustration : They are so cunning -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well , and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood , which it is a great pity you ca n't write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy ."
"Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing looking at a fairy all the time ."
The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .
This is one of their best tricks .
For generosity 's sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head ; but I thought of it none the less .
"I thought of it all the more , too , when the bouman brought out a green purse with four guineas in gold , and the best part of another in small change ."
"True , it was more than I had ."
"But then Alan , with less than five guineas , had to get as far as France ; I , with my less than two , not beyond Queensferry ; so that taking things in their proportion , Alan 's society was not only a peril to my life , but a burden on my purse ."
But there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion .
"He believed he was serving , helping , and protecting me ."
"And what could I do but hold my peace , and chafe , and take my chance of it ?"
"`` It 's little enough , '' said Alan , putting the purse in his pocket , `` but it 'll do my business ."
"And now , John Breck , if ye will hand me over my button , this gentleman and me will be for taking the road . ''"
"But the bouman , after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front of him in the Highland manner -LRB- though he wore otherwise the Lowland habit , with sea-trousers -RRB- , began to roll his eyes strangely , and at last said , `` Her nainsel will loss it , '' meaning he thought he had lost it ."
`` What ! ''
"cried Alan , `` you will lose my button , that was my father 's before me ?"
"Now I will tell you what is in my mind , John Breck : it is in my mind this is the worst day 's work that ever ye did since ye was born . ''"
"And as Alan spoke , he set his hands on his knees and looked at the bouman with a smiling mouth , and that dancing light in his eyes that meant mischief to his enemies ."
"Perhaps the bouman was honest enough ; perhaps he had meant to cheat and then , finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place , cast back to honesty as being safer ; at least , and all at once , he seemed to find that button and handed it to Alan ."
"`` Well , and it is a good thing for the honour of the Maccolls , '' said Alan , and then to me , `` Here is my button back again , and I thank you for parting with it , which is of a piece with all your friendships to me . ''"
Then he took the warmest parting of the bouman .
"`` For , '' says he , `` ye have done very well by me , and set your neck at a venture , and I will always give you the name of a good man . ''"
"Lastly , the bouman took himself off by one way ; and Alan and I -LRB- getting our chattels together -RRB- struck into another to resume our flight ."
"CHAPTER XXII THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE MOOR Some seven hours ' incessant , hard travelling brought us early in the morning to the end of a range of mountains ."
"In front of us there lay a piece of low , broken , desert land , which we must now cross ."
"The sun was not long up , and shone straight in our eyes ; a little , thin mist went up from the face of the moorland like a smoke ; so that -LRB- as Alan said -RRB- there might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser ."
"We sat down , therefore , in a howe of the hill-side till the mist should have risen , and made ourselves a dish of drammach , and held a council of war ."
"`` David , '' said Alan , `` this is the kittle bit ."
"Shall we lie here till it comes night , or shall we risk it , and stave on ahead ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I am tired indeed , but I could walk as far again , if that was all . ''"
"`` Ay , but it isnae , '' said Alan , `` nor yet the half ."
This is how we stand : Appin 's fair death to us .
"To the south it 's all Campbells , and no to be thought of ."
"To the north ; well , there 's no muckle to be gained by going north ; neither for you , that wants to get to Queensferry , nor yet for me , that wants to get to France ."
"Well , then , we 'll can strike east . ''"
`` East be it ! ''
"Sharp as must have been his annoyance , Silver had the strength of mind to hide it ."
"`` Yes , sir , '' said he , `` this is the spot , to be sure , and very prettily drawed out ."
"Who might have done that , I wonder ?"
"The pirates were too ignorant , I reckon ."
"Aye , here it is : ` Capt. Kidd 's Anchorage ' -- just the name my shipmate called it ."
"There 's a strong current runs along the south , and then away nor ` ard up the west coast ."
"Right you was , sir , '' says he , `` to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island ."
"Leastways , if such was your intention as to enter and careen , and there ai n't no better place for that in these waters . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` I 'll ask you later on to give us a help .
You may go . ''
"I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island , and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself ."
"He did not know , to be sure , that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel , and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty , duplicity , and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm ."
"`` Ah , '' says he , `` this here is a sweet spot , this island -- a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on ."
"You 'll bathe , and you 'll climb trees , and you 'll hunt goats , you will ; and you 'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself ."
"Why , it makes me young again ."
"I was going to forget my timber leg , I was ."
"It 's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes , and you may lay to that ."
"When you want to go a bit of exploring , you just ask old John , and he 'll put up a snack for you to take along . ''"
"And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder , he hobbled off forward and went below ."
"Captain Smollett , the squire , and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck , and anxious as I was to tell them my story , I durst not interrupt them openly ."
"While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse , Dr. Livesey called me to his side ."
"He had left his pipe below , and being a slave to tobacco , had meant that I should fetch it ; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard , I broke immediately , `` Doctor , let me speak ."
"Get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me ."
I have terrible news . ''
"The doctor changed countenance a little , but next moment he was master of himself ."
"`` Thank you , Jim , '' said he quite loudly , `` that was all I wanted to know , '' as if he had asked me a question ."
And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two .
"They spoke together for a little , and though none of them started , or raised his voice , or so much as whistled , it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request , for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson , and all hands were piped on deck ."
"`` My lads , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I 've a word to say to you ."
This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for .
"Mr. Trelawney , being a very open-handed gentleman , as we all know , has just asked me a word or two , and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty , alow and aloft , as I never ask to see it done better , why , he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck , and you 'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck ."
"`` I did so , sir , for my sins , '' said I ; `` for it was by his means and the procurement of my uncle , that I was kidnapped within sight of this town , carried to sea , suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships , and stand before you to-day in this poor accoutrement . ''"
"`` You say you were shipwrecked , '' said Rankeillor ; `` where was that ? ''"
"`` Off the south end of the Isle of Mull , '' said I. `` The name of the isle on which I was cast up is the Island Earraid . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"says he , smiling , `` you are deeper than me in the geography ."
"But so far , I may tell you , this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that I hold ."
But you say you were kidnapped ; in what sense ? ''
"`` In the plain meaning of the word , sir , '' said I. `` I was on my way to your house , when I was trepanned on board the brig , cruelly struck down , thrown below , and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea ."
"I was destined for the plantations ; a fate that , in God 's providence , I have escaped . ''"
"`` The brig was lost on June the 27th , '' says he , looking in his book , `` and we are now at August the 24th ."
"Here is a considerable hiatus , Mr. Balfour , of near upon two months ."
It has already caused a vast amount of trouble to your friends ; and I own I shall not be very well contented until it is set right . ''
"`` Indeed , sir , '' said I , `` these months are very easily filled up ; but yet before I told my story , I would be glad to know that I was talking to a friend . ''"
"`` This is to argue in a circle , '' said the lawyer ."
`` I can not be convinced till I have heard you .
I can not be your friend till I am properly informed .
"If you were more trustful , it would better befit your time of life ."
"And you know , Mr. Balfour , we have a proverb in the country that evil-doers are aye evil-dreaders . ''"
"`` You are not to forget , sir , '' said I , `` that I have already suffered by my trustfulness ; and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that -LRB- if I rightly understand -RRB- is your employer ? ''"
"All this while I had been gaining ground with Mr. Rankeillor , and in proportion as I gained ground , gaining confidence ."
"But at this sally , which I made with something of a smile myself , he fairly laughed aloud ."
"`` No , no , '' said he , `` it is not so bad as that ."
"Fui , non sum ."
"I was indeed your uncle 's man of business ; but while you -LRB- imberbis juvenis custode remoto -RRB- were gallivanting in the west , a good deal of water has run under the bridges ; and if your ears did not sing , it was not for lack of being talked about ."
"On the very day of your sea disaster , Mr. Campbell stalked into my office , demanding you from all the winds ."
I had never heard of your existence ; but I had known your father ; and from matters in my competence -LRB- to be touched upon hereafter -RRB- I was disposed to fear the worst .
"Mr. Ebenezer admitted having seen you ; declared -LRB- what seemed improbable -RRB- that he had given you considerable sums ; and that you had started for the continent of Europe , intending to fulfil your education , which was probable and praiseworthy ."
"Interrogated how you had come to send no word to Mr. Campbell , he deponed that you had expressed a great desire to break with your past life ."
"Further interrogated where you now were , protested ignorance , but believed you were in Leyden ."
That is a close sum of his replies .
"I am not exactly sure that any one believed him , '' continued Mr. Rankeillor with a smile ; `` and in particular he so much disrelished me expressions of mine that -LRB- in a word -RRB- he showed me to the door ."
"We were then at a full stand ; for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain , we had no shadow of probation ."
"If she said ` Peter ' again , he meant to cry ` Mother ' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when he next peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said ` Peter , ' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , ' O Peter , how exquisitely you play ! '"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon . '
"I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , ' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , ' he said coaxingly . '"
"I promise to come back , ' he said solemnly , and meant it , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Butter is got from the roots of old trees -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
"Many nights , and even months , passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long ."
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as ` Never put off laying to-day because you can lay to-morrow , ' and ` In this world there are no second chances , ' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as ' I wish the grass was not so wet , ' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , ' I do wish you would keep time ! '"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , ' I wish -- ' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , ' I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , ' they had to tickle his shoulders and let him go ."
"So saying , the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door ."
"I was very uneasy and alarmed , as you may fancy , and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself ."
He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath ; and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat .
"At last in strode the captain , slammed the door behind him , without looking to the right or left , and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him ."
"`` Bill , '' said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big ."
"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us ; all the brown had gone out of his face , and even his nose was blue ; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost , or the evil one , or something worse , if anything can be ; and upon my word , I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick ."
"`` Come , Bill , you know me ; you know an old shipmate , Bill , surely , '' said the stranger ."
The captain made a sort of gasp .
`` Black Dog ! ''
said he .
`` And who else ? ''
"returned the other , getting more at his ease ."
"`` Black Dog as ever was , come for to see his old shipmate Billy , at the Admiral Benbow inn ."
"Ah , Bill , Bill , we have seen a sight of times , us two , since I lost them two talons , '' holding up his mutilated hand ."
"`` Now , look here , '' said the captain ; `` you 've run me down ; here I am ; well , then , speak up ; what is it ? ''"
"`` That 's you , Bill , '' returned Black Dog , `` you 're in the right of it , Billy ."
"I 'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here , as I 've took such a liking to ; and we 'll sit down , if you please , and talk square , like old shipmates . ''"
"When I returned with the rum , they were already seated on either side of the captain 's breakfast-table -- Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one , as I thought , on his retreat ."
He bade me go and leave the door wide open .
"`` None of your keyholes for me , sonny , '' he said ; and I left them together and retired into the bar ."
"For a long time , though I certainly did my best to listen , I could hear nothing but a low gattling ; but at last the voices began to grow higher , and I could pick up a word or two , mostly oaths , from the captain ."
"`` No , no , no , no ; and an end of it ! ''"
he cried once .
"And again , `` If it comes to swinging , swing all , say I. '' Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises -- the chair and table went over in a lump , a clash of steel followed , and then a cry of pain , and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight , and the captain hotly pursuing , both with drawn cutlasses , and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder ."
"Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut , which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow ."
You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day .
That blow was the last of the battle .
"Once out upon the road , Black Dog , in spite of his wound , showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute ."
"The captain , for his part , stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man ."
Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house .
"`` Jim , '' says he , `` rum '' ; and as he spoke , he reeled a little , and caught himself with one hand against the wall ."
`` Are you hurt ? ''
"Emil went to bed sick , and Dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week ."
"But the lawless lad had no thought of obeying , and soon transgressed again ."
"One Saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play , Tommy said , `` Let 's go down to the river , and cut a lot of new fish-poles . ''"
"`` Take Toby to drag them back , and one of us can ride him down , '' proposed Stuffy , who hated to walk ."
"`` That means you , I suppose ; well , hurry up , lazy-bones , '' said Dan ."
"Away they went , and having got the poles were about to go home , when Demi unluckily said to Tommy , who was on Toby with a long rod in his hand , `` You look like the picture of the man in the bull-fight , only you have n't got a red cloth , or pretty clothes on . ''"
"`` I 'd like to see one ; there 's old Buttercup in the big meadow , ride at her , Tom , and see her run , '' proposed Dan , bent on mischief ."
"`` No , you must n't , '' began Demi , who was learning to distrust Dan 's propositions ."
"`` Why not , little fuss-button ? ''"
demanded Dan .
`` I do n't think Uncle Fritz would like it . ''
`` Did he ever say we must not have a bull-fight ? ''
"`` No , I do n't think he ever did , '' admitted Demi ."
`` Then hold your tongue .
"Drive on , Tom , and here 's a red rag to flap at the old thing ."
"I 'll help you to stir her up , '' and over the wall went Dan , full of the new game , and the rest followed like a flock of sheep ; even Demi , who sat upon the bars , and watched the fun with interest ."
"Poor Buttercup was not in a very good mood , for she had been lately bereft of her calf , and mourned for the little thing most dismally ."
"Just now she regarded all mankind as her enemies -LRB- and I do not blame her -RRB- , so when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief flying at the end of his long lance , she threw up her head , and gave a most appropriate `` Moo ! ''"
"Tommy rode gallantly at her , and Toby recognizing an old friend , was quite willing to approach ; but when the lance came down on her back with a loud whack , both cow and donkey were surprised and disgusted ."
"Toby back with a bray of remonstrance , and Buttercup lowered her horns angrily ."
"`` At her again , Tom ; she 's jolly cross , and will do it capitally ! ''"
"called Dan , coming up behind with another rod , while Jack and Ned followed his example ."
"Seeing herself thus beset , and treated with such disrespect , Buttercup trotted round the field , getting more and more bewildered and excited every moment , for whichever way she turned , there was a dreadful boy , yelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip ."
"It was great fun for them , but real misery for her , till she lost patience and turned the tables in the most unexpected manner ."
"All at once she wheeled short round , and charged full at her old friend Toby , whose conduct cut her to the heart ."
"Poor slow Toby backed so precipitately that he tripped over a stone , and down went horse , matadore , and all , in one ignominious heap , while distracted Buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall , and galloped wildly out of sight down the road ."
"`` Catch her , stop her , head her off !"
"run , boys , run ! ''"
"shouted Dan , tearing after her at his best pace , for she was Mr. Bhaer 's pet Alderney , and if anything happened to her , Dan feared it would be all over with him ."
Such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as there was before she was caught !
"The fish-poles were left behind ; Toby was trotted nearly off his legs in the chase ; and every boy was red , breathless , and scared ."
"They found poor Buttercup at last in a flower garden , where she had taken refuge , worn out with the long run ."
Her cheek was swollen and her face ached .
"The schoolroom was cold and smoky , for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups ."
Anne sent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used before .
Anthony Pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seat-mate and then glance at her with a grin .
"Never , so it seemed to Anne , had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning ; and when Barbara Shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results ."
"The coal rolled to every part of the room , her slate was broken into fragments , and when she picked herself up , her face , stained with coal dust , sent the boys into roars of laughter ."
Anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing .
"`` Really , Barbara , '' she said icily , `` if you can not move without falling over something you 'd better remain in your seat ."
It is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward . ''
"Poor Barbara stumbled back to her desk , her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque ."
"Never before had her beloved , sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion , and Barbara was heartbroken ."
"Anne herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation , and the second reader class remember that lesson yet , as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed ."
Just as Anne was snapping the sums out St. Clair Donnell arrived breathlessly .
"`` You are half an hour late , St. Clair , '' Anne reminded him frigidly ."
`` Why is this ? ''
"`` Please , miss , I had to help ma make a pudding for dinner 'cause we 're expecting company and Clarice Almira 's sick , '' was St. Clair 's answer , given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates ."
"`` Take your seat and work out the six problems on page eighty-four of your arithmetic for punishment , '' said Anne ."
St. Clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate .
Then he stealthily passed a small parcel to Joe Sloane across the aisle .
Anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel .
Old Mrs. Hiram Sloane had lately taken to making and selling `` nut cakes '' by way of adding to her scanty income .
The cakes were specially tempting to small boys and for several weeks Anne had had not a little trouble in regard to them .
"On their way to school the boys would invest their spare cash at Mrs. Hiram 's , bring the cakes along with them to school , and , if possible , eat them and treat their mates during school hours ."
"Anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated ; and yet here was St. Clair Donnell coolly passing a parcel of them , wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper Mrs. Hiram used , under her very eyes ."
"`` Joseph , '' said Anne quietly , `` bring that parcel here . ''"
"Joe , startled and abashed , obeyed ."
He was a fat urchin who always blushed and stuttered when he was frightened .
Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment .
"`` Throw it into the fire , '' said Anne ."
Joe looked very blank .
"`` P ... p ... p ... lease , m ... m ... miss , '' he began ."
"`` Do as I tell you , Joseph , without any words about it . ''"
"That was all ; but brief as it was , and to me incomprehensible , it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight ."
"`` Livesey , '' said the squire , `` you will give up this wretched practice at once ."
Tomorrow I start for Bristol .
In three weeks ' time -- three weeks !
"-- two weeks -- ten days -- we 'll have the best ship , sir , and the choicest crew in England ."
Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy .
"You 'll make a famous cabin-boy , Hawkins ."
"You , Livesey , are ship 's doctor ; I am admiral ."
"We 'll take Redruth , Joyce , and Hunter ."
"We 'll have favourable winds , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in finding the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after . ''"
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` I 'll go with you ; and I 'll go bail for it , so will Jim , and be a credit to the undertaking ."
There 's only one man I 'm afraid of . ''
`` And who 's that ? ''
cried the squire .
"`` Name the dog , sir ! ''"
"`` You , '' replied the doctor ; `` for you can not hold your tongue ."
We are not the only men who know of this paper .
"These fellows who attacked the inn tonight -- bold , desperate blades , for sure -- and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger , and more , I dare say , not far off , are , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they 'll get that money ."
We must none of us go alone till we get to sea .
"Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you 'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol , and from first to last , not one of us must breathe a word of what we 've found . ''"
"`` Livesey , '' returned the squire , `` you are always in the right of it ."
I 'll be as silent as the grave . ''
"PART TWO -- The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea , and none of our first plans -- not even Dr. Livesey 's , of keeping me beside him -- could be carried out as we intended ."
"The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire was hard at work at Bristol ; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures ."
"I brooded by the hour together over the map , all the details of which I well remembered ."
"Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper 's room , I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; I explored every acre of its surface ; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass , and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects ."
"Sometimes the isle was thick with savages , with whom we fought , sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us , but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures ."
"So the weeks passed on , till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey , with this addition , `` To be opened , in the case of his absence , by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins . ''"
"Obeying this order , we found , or rather I found -- for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print -- the following important news : Old Anchor Inn , Bristol , March 1 , 17 -- Dear Livesey -- As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London , I send this in double to both places ."
The ship is bought and fitted .
"She lies at anchor , ready for sea ."
"You never imagined a sweeter schooner -- a child might sail her -- two hundred tons ; name , HISPANIOLA ."
"CHAPTER I PETER BREAKS THROUGH All children , except one , grow up ."
"They soon know that they will grow up , and the way Wendy knew was this ."
"One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden , and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother ."
"I suppose she must have looked rather delightful , for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried , ` Oh , why ca n't you remain like this for ever ! '"
"This was all that passed between them on the subject , but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up ."
You always know after you are two .
Two is the beginning of the end .
"Of course they lived at 14 , and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one ."
"She was a lovely lady , with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth ."
"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes , one within the other , that come from the puzzling East , however many you discover there is always one more ; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get , though there it was , perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner ."
"The way Mr. Darling won her was this : the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her , and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling , who took a cab and nipped in first , and so he got her ."
"He got all of her , except the innermost box and the kiss ."
"He never knew about the box , and in time he gave up trying for the kiss ."
"Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it , but I can picture him trying , and then going off in a passion , slamming the door ."
Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him .
He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares .
"Of course no one really knows , but he quite seemed to know , and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him ."
"Mrs. Darling was married in white , and at first she kept the books perfectly , almost gleefully , as if it were a game , not so much as a brussels sprout was missing ; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out , and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces ."
She drew them when she should have been totting up .
They were Mrs. Darling 's guesses .
"Wendy came first , then John , then Michael ."
"For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her , as she was another mouth to feed ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her , but he was very honourable , and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling 's bed , holding her hand and calculating expenses , while she looked at him imploringly ."
"She wanted to risk it , come what might , but that was not his way ; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper , and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again ."
"` Now do n't interrupt , ' he would beg of her . '"
"I have one pound seventeen here , and two and six at the office ; I can cut off my coffee at the office , say ten shillings , making two nine and six , with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven , with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven , -- who is that moving ?"
"-- eight nine seven , dot and carry seven -- do n't speak , my own -- and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door -- quiet , child -- dot and carry child -- there , you 've done it !"
-- did I say nine nine seven ?
"yes , I said nine nine seven ; the question is , can we try it for a year on nine nine seven ? '"
"` Of course we can , George , ' she cried ."
"But she was prejudiced in Wendy 's favour , and he was really the grander character of the two ."
"` Remember mumps , ' he warned her almost threateningly , and off he went again ."
`` Dear life and heart ! ''
"exclaimed Mrs. Emory , pausing in the act of scalding a milk-can when Murray emerged from a side door ."
"`` What on earth is the matter , Mr. Murray ?"
"You ai n't sick now , surely ?"
I told you them pond fogs was p ` isen after night !
"If you 've gone and got -- '' `` Nothing is the matter , dear lady , '' interrupted Murray , `` and I have n't gone and got anything except an acute attack of early rising which is not in the least likely to become chronic ."
"But at what hour of the night do you get up , you wonderful woman ?"
Or rather do you ever go to bed at all ?
"Here is the sun only beginning to rise and -- positively yes , you have all your cows milked . ''"
Mrs. Emory purred with delight .
"`` Folks as has fourteen cows to milk has to rise betimes , '' she answered with proud humility ."
"`` Laws , I do n't complain -- I 've lots of help with the milking ."
"How Mrs. Palmer manages , I really can not comperhend -- or rather , how she has managed ."
I suppose she 'll be all right now since her niece came last night .
I saw her posting to the pond pasture not ten minutes ago .
She 'll have to milk all them seven cows herself .
But dear life and heart !
Here I be palavering away and not a bite of breakfast ready for you ! ''
"`` I do n't want any breakfast until the regular time for it , '' assured Murray ."
`` I 'm going down to the pond to see the sun rise . ''
"`` Now do n't you go and get caught in the ma ` sh , '' anxiously called Mrs. Emory , as she never failed to do when she saw him starting for the pond ."
"Nobody ever had got caught in the marsh , but Mrs. Emory lived in a chronic state of fear lest someone should ."
"`` And if you once got stuck in that black mud you 'd be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment , like Adam Palmer 's cow , '' she was wont to warn her boarders ."
"Murray sought his favourite spot for pond dreaming -- a bloomy corner of the pasture that ran down into the blue water , with a dump of leafy maples on the left ."
He was very glad he had risen early .
A miracle was being worked before his very eyes .
"The world was in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness , instinct with all the marvellous fleeting charm of girlhood and spring and young morning ."
Overhead the sky was a vast high-sprung arch of unstained crystal .
"Down over the sand dunes , where the pond ran out into the sea , was a great arc of primrose smitten through with auroral crimsonings ."
"Beneath it the pond waters shimmered with a hundred fairy hues , but just before him they were clear as a flawless mirror ."
"The fields around him glistened with dews , and a little wandering wind , blowing lightly from some bourne in the hills , strayed down over the slopes , bringing with it an unimaginable odour and freshness , and fluttered over the pond , leaving a little path of dancing silver ripples across the mirror-glory of the water ."
"Birds were singing in the beech woods over on Orchard Knob Farm , answering to each other from shore to shore , until the very air was tremulous with the elfin music of this wonderful midsummer dawn ."
"'T was Bennet Hatch that burned it , now five years agone ."
"In sooth , 't was pity , for it was a fair house . ''"
"Down in the hollow , where no wind blew , it was both warm and still ; and Matcham , laying one hand upon Dick 's arm , held up a warning finger ."
`` Hist ! ''
he said .
"Then came a strange sound , breaking on the quiet ."
It was twice repeated ere they recognised its nature .
"It was the sound of a big man clearing his throat ; and just then a hoarse , untuneful voice broke into singing ."
"`` Then up and spake the master , the king of the outlaws : ` What make ye here , my merry men , among the greenwood shaws ? '"
"And Gamelyn made answer -- he looked never adown : ` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town ! ' ''"
"The singer paused , a faint clink of iron followed , and then silence ."
The two lads stood looking at each other .
"Whoever he might be , their invisible neighbour was just beyond the ruin ."
"And suddenly the colour came into Matcham 's face , and next moment he had crossed the fallen rafter , and was climbing cautiously on the huge pile of lumber that filled the interior of the roofless house ."
"Dick would have withheld him , had he been in time ; as it was , he was fain to follow ."
"Right in the corner of the ruin , two rafters had fallen crosswise , and protected a clear space no larger than a pew in church ."
Into this the lads silently lowered themselves .
"There they were perfectly concealed , and through an arrow-loophole commanded a view upon the farther side ."
"Peering through this , they were struck stiff with terror at their predicament ."
To retreat was impossible ; they scarce dared to breathe .
"Upon the very margin of the ditch , not thirty feet from where they crouched , an iron caldron bubbled and steamed above a glowing fire ; and close by , in an attitude of listening , as though he had caught some sound of their clambering among the ruins , a tall , red-faced , battered-looking man stood poised , an iron spoon in his right hand , a horn and a formidable dagger at his belt ."
"Plainly this was the singer ; plainly he had been stirring the caldron , when some incautious step among the lumber had fallen upon his ear ."
"A little further off , another man lay slumbering , rolled in a brown cloak , with a butterfly hovering above his face ."
"All this was in a clearing white with daisies ; and at the extreme verge , a bow , a sheaf of arrows , and part of a deer 's carcase , hung upon a flowering hawthorn ."
"Presently the fellow relaxed from his attitude of attention , raised the spoon to his mouth , tasted its contents , nodded , and then fell again to stirring and singing . ''"
"` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town , ' '' he croaked , taking up his song where he had left it ."
"`` O , sir , we walk not here at all an evil thing to do ."
But if we meet with the good king 's deer to shoot a shaft into . ''
"Still as he sang , he took from time to time , another spoonful of the broth , blew upon it , and tasted it , with all the airs of an experienced cook ."
"At length , apparently , he judged the mess was ready ; for taking the horn from his girdle , he blew three modulated calls ."
"The other fellow awoke , rolled over , brushed away the butterfly , and looked about him ."
"`` How now , brother ? ''"
It was Peter 's cockiness .
"This had got on Hook 's nerves ; it made his iron claw twitch , and at night it disturbed him like an insect ."
"While Peter lived , the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come ."
"The question now was how to get down the trees , or how to get his dogs down ?"
"He ran his greedy eyes over them , searching for the thinnest ones ."
"They wriggled uncomfortably , for they knew he would not scruple -LSB- hesitate -RSB- to ram them down with poles ."
"In the meantime , what of the boys ?"
"We have seen them at the first clang of the weapons , turned as it were into stone figures , open-mouthed , all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter ; and we return to them as their mouths close , and their arms fall to their sides ."
"The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose , passed like a fierce gust of wind ; but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate ."
Which side had won ?
"The pirates , listening avidly at the mouths of the trees , heard the question put by every boy , and alas , they also heard Peter 's answer ."
"`` If the redskins have won , '' he said , `` they will beat the tom-tom ; it is always their sign of victory . ''"
"Now Smee had found the tom-tom , and was at that moment sitting on it ."
"`` You will never hear the tom-tom again , '' he muttered , but inaudibly of course , for strict silence had been enjoined -LSB- urged -RSB- ."
"To his amazement Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom , and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order ."
"Never , probably , had this simple man admired Hook so much ."
"Twice Smee beat upon the instrument , and then stopped to listen gleefully ."
"`` The tom-tom , '' the miscreants heard Peter cry ; `` an Indian victory ! ''"
"The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above , and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter ."
"This puzzled the pirates , but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees ."
They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands .
"Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders : one man to each tree , and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart ."
Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES ?
The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better .
The first to emerge from his tree was Curly .
"He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco , who flung him to Smee , who flung him to Starkey , who flung him to Bill Jukes , who flung him to Noodler , and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate ."
"All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner ; and several of them were in the air at a time , like bales of goods flung from hand to hand ."
"A different treatment was accorded to Wendy , who came last ."
"With ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her , and , offering her his arm , escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged ."
"He did it with such an air , he was so frightfully DISTINGUE -LSB- imposingly distinguished -RSB- , that she was too fascinated to cry out ."
She was only a little girl .
"Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her , and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results ."
She even tried to make her heart go softly .
Will they reach the nursery in time ?
"If so , how delightful for them , and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief , but there will be no story ."
"On the other hand , if they are not in time , I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end ."
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them .
"Once again the stars blew the window open , and that smallest star of all called out : ` Cave , Peter ! '"
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose .
"` Come , ' he cried imperiously , and soared out at once into the night , followed by John and Michael and Wendy ."
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late .
The birds were flown .
"-LSB- Illustration : THE BIRDS WERE FLOWN -RSB- CHAPTER IV THE FLIGHT ` Second to the right , and straight on till morning . '"
"That , Peter had told Wendy , was the way to the Neverland ; but even birds , carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners , could not have sighted it with these instructions ."
"Peter , you see , just said anything that came into his head ."
"At first his companions trusted him implicitly , and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy ."
"John and Michael raced , Michael getting a start ."
They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room .
Not so long ago .
But how long ago ?
They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously .
John thought it was their second sea and their third night .
"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light , and now they were very cold and again too warm ."
"Did they really feel hungry at times , or were they merely pretending , because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them ?"
"His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them ; then the birds would follow and snatch it back ; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles , parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will ."
"But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter , nor even that there are other ways ."
"Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy , they were sleepy ; and that was a danger , for the moment they popped off , down they fell ."
The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny .
` There he goes again ! '
"he would cry gleefully , as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone ."
"` Save him , save him ! '"
"cried Wendy , looking with horror at the cruel sea far below ."
"Eventually Peter would dive through the air , and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea , and it was lovely the way he did it ; but he always waited till the last moment , and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life ."
"Also he was fond of variety , and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him , so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go ."
"We can count , I take it , on your own home servants , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
"`` As upon myself , '' declared the squire ."
"`` Three , '' reckoned the captain ; `` ourselves make seven , counting Hawkins here ."
"Now , about the honest hands ? ''"
"`` Most likely Trelawney 's own men , '' said the doctor ; `` those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver . ''"
"`` Nay , '' replied the squire ."
`` Hands was one of mine . ''
"`` I did think I could have trusted Hands , '' added the captain ."
`` And to think that they 're all Englishmen ! ''
broke out the squire .
"`` Sir , I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up . ''"
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' said the captain , `` the best that I can say is not much ."
"We must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout ."
"It 's trying on a man , I know ."
It would be pleasanter to come to blows .
But there 's no help for it till we know our men .
"Lay to , and whistle for a wind , that 's my view . ''"
"`` Jim here , '' said the doctor , `` can help us more than anyone ."
"The men are not shy with him , and Jim is a noticing lad . ''"
"`` Hawkins , I put prodigious faith in you , '' added the squire ."
"I began to feel pretty desperate at this , for I felt altogether helpless ; and yet , by an odd train of circumstances , it was indeed through me that safety came ."
"In the meantime , talk as we pleased , there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely ; and out of these seven one was a boy , so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen ."
PART THREE -- My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed .
"Although the breeze had now utterly ceased , we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast ."
Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface .
"This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands , and by many tall trees of the pine family , out-topping the others -- some singly , some in clumps ; but the general colouring was uniform and sad ."
The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock .
"All were strangely shaped , and the Spy-glass , which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island , was likewise the strangest in configuration , running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on ."
The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell .
"The booms were tearing at the blocks , the rudder was banging to and fro , and the whole ship creaking , groaning , and jumping like a manufactory ."
"I had to cling tight to the backstay , and the world turned giddily before my eyes , for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on , this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so , above all in the morning , on an empty stomach ."
"Perhaps it was this -- perhaps it was the look of the island , with its grey , melancholy woods , and wild stone spires , and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach -- at least , although the sun shone bright and hot , and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us , and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea , my heart sank , as the saying is , into my boots ; and from the first look onward , I hated the very thought of Treasure Island ."
"You see , sir , here it is ."
"I get a rough answer , do I not ?"
"Well , if I speak back , pikes will be going in two shakes ; if I do n't , Silver will see there 's something under that , and the game 's up ."
"Now , we 've only one man to rely on . ''"
`` And who is that ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` Silver , sir , '' returned the captain ; `` he 's as anxious as you and I to smother things up ."
"This is a tiff ; he 'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance , and what I propose to do is to give him the chance ."
Let 's allow the men an afternoon ashore .
"If they all go , why we 'll fight the ship ."
"If they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right ."
"If some go , you mark my words , sir , Silver 'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs . ''"
"It was so decided ; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men ; Hunter , Joyce , and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for , and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew ."
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` we 've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts ."
"A turn ashore 'll hurt nobody -- the boats are still in the water ; you can take the gigs , and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon ."
I 'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown . ''
"I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed , for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage ."
The captain was too bright to be in the way .
"He whipped out of sight in a moment , leaving Silver to arrange the party , and I fancy it was as well he did so ."
"Had he been on deck , he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation ."
It was as plain as day .
"Silver was the captain , and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it ."
The honest hands -- and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board -- must have been very stupid fellows .
"Or rather , I suppose the truth was this , that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders -- only some more , some less ; and a few , being good fellows in the main , could neither be led nor driven any further ."
It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men .
"At last , however , the party was made up ."
"Six fellows were to stay on board , and the remaining thirteen , including Silver , began to embark ."
Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives .
"If six men were left by Silver , it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship ; and since only six were left , it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance ."
It occurred to me at once to go ashore .
"In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat , and almost at the same moment she shoved off ."
"No one took notice of me , only the bow oar saying , `` Is that you , Jim ?"
"Though I had lived by the shore all my life , I seemed never to have been near the sea till then ."
The smell of tar and salt was something new .
"I saw the most wonderful figureheads , that had all been far over the ocean ."
"I saw , besides , many old sailors , with rings in their ears , and whiskers curled in ringlets , and tarry pigtails , and their swaggering , clumsy sea-walk ; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted ."
"And I was going to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure !"
"While I was still in this delightful dream , we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney , all dressed out like a sea-officer , in stout blue cloth , coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor 's walk ."
"`` Here you are , '' he cried , `` and the doctor came last night from London ."
Bravo !
The ship 's company complete ! ''
"`` Oh , sir , '' cried I , `` when do we sail ? ''"
`` Sail ! ''
says he .
`` We sail tomorrow ! ''
"8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver , at the sign of the Spy-glass , and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign ."
"I set off , overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen , and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales , for the dock was now at its busiest , until I found the tavern in question ."
It was a bright enough little place of entertainment .
The sign was newly painted ; the windows had neat red curtains ; the floor was cleanly sanded .
"There was a street on each side and an open door on both , which made the large , low room pretty clear to see in , in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke ."
"The customers were mostly seafaring men , and they talked so loudly that I hung at the door , almost afraid to enter ."
"As I was waiting , a man came out of a side room , and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John ."
"His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird ."
"He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling ."
"Indeed , he seemed in the most cheerful spirits , whistling as he moved about among the tables , with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests ."
"Now , to tell you the truth , from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney 's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow ."
But one look at the man before me was enough .
"I had seen the captain , and Black Dog , and the blind man , Pew , and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like -- a very different creature , according to me , from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord ."
"I plucked up courage at once , crossed the threshold , and walked right up to the man where he stood , propped on his crutch , talking to a customer ."
"`` Mr. Silver , sir ? ''"
"I asked , holding out the note ."
"`` Yes , my lad , '' said he ; `` such is my name , to be sure ."
And who may you be ? ''
"And then as he saw the squire 's letter , he seemed to me to give something almost like a start ."
"`` Budge , you skulk ! ''"
cried Pew .
`` Dirk was a fool and a coward from the first -- you would n't mind him .
They must be close by ; they ca n't be far ; you have your hands on it .
"Scatter and look for them , dogs !"
"Oh , shiver my soul , '' he cried , `` if I had eyes ! ''"
"This appeal seemed to produce some effect , for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber , but half-heartedly , I thought , and with half an eye to their own danger all the time , while the rest stood irresolute on the road ."
"`` You have your hands on thousands , you fools , and you hang a leg !"
"You 'd be as rich as kings if you could find it , and you know it 's here , and you stand there skulking ."
"There was n't one of you dared face Bill , and I did it -- a blind man !"
And I 'm to lose my chance for you !
"I 'm to be a poor , crawling beggar , sponging for rum , when I might be rolling in a coach !"
If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still . ''
"`` Hang it , Pew , we 've got the doubloons ! ''"
grumbled one .
"`` They might have hid the blessed thing , '' said another ."
"`` Take the Georges , Pew , and do n't stand here squalling . ''"
"Squalling was the word for it ; Pew 's anger rose so high at these objections till at last , his passion completely taking the upper hand , he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one ."
"These , in their turn , cursed back at the blind miscreant , threatened him in horrid terms , and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp ."
"This quarrel was the saving of us , for while it was still raging , another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet -- the tramp of horses galloping ."
"Almost at the same time a pistol-shot , flash and report , came from the hedge side ."
"And that was plainly the last signal of danger , for the buccaneers turned at once and ran , separating in every direction , one seaward along the cove , one slant across the hill , and so on , so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew ."
"Him they had deserted , whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not ; but there he remained behind , tapping up and down the road in a frenzy , and groping and calling for his comrades ."
"Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me , towards the hamlet , crying , `` Johnny , Black Dog , Dirk , '' and other names , `` you wo n't leave old Pew , mates -- not old Pew ! ''"
"Just then the noise of horses topped the rise , and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope ."
"At this Pew saw his error , turned with a scream , and ran straight for the ditch , into which he rolled ."
"But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash , now utterly bewildered , right under the nearest of the coming horses ."
"The rider tried to save him , but in vain ."
Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night ; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by .
"He fell on his side , then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more ."
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders .
"They were pulling up , at any rate , horrified at the accident ; and I soon saw what they were ."
"DAMON AND PYTHIAS Mrs. Bhaer was right ; peace was only a temporary lull , a storm was brewing , and two days after Bess left , a moral earthquake shook Plumfield to its centre ."
"Tommy 's hens were at the bottom of the trouble , for if they had not persisted in laying so many eggs , he could not have sold them and made such sums ."
"Money is the root of all evil , and yet it is such a useful root that we can not get on without it any more than we can without potatoes ."
"Tommy certainly could not , for he spent his income so recklessly , that Mr. Bhaer was obliged to insist on a savings-bank , and presented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice , with the name over the door , and a tall chimney , down which the pennies were to go , there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of trap-door in the floor ."
"The house increased in weight so rapidly , that Tommy soon became satisfied with his investment , and planned to buy unheard-of treasures with his capital ."
"He kept account of the sums deposited , and was promised that he might break the bank as soon as he had five dollars , on condition that he spent the money wisely ."
"Only one dollar was needed , and the day Mrs. Jo paid him for four dozen eggs , he was so delighted , that he raced off to the barn to display the bright quarters to Nat , who was also laying by money for the long-desired violin ."
"`` I wish I had 'em to put with my three dollars , then I 'd soon get enough to buy my fiddle , '' he said , looking wistfully at the money ."
`` P'raps I 'll lend you some .
"I have n't decided yet what I 'll do with mine , '' said Tommy , tossing up his quarters and catching them as they fell ."
`` Hi !
boys !
come down to the brook and see what a jolly great snake Dan 's got ! ''
called a voice from behind the barn .
"`` Come on , '' said Tommy ; and , laying his money inside the old winnowing machine , away he ran , followed by Nat ."
"The snake was very interesting , and then a long chase after a lame crow , and its capture , so absorbed Tommy 's mind and time , that he never thought of his money till he was safely in bed that night ."
"`` Never mind , no one but Nat knows where it is , '' said the easy-going lad , and fell asleep untroubled by any anxiety about his property ."
"Next morning , just as the boys assembled for school , Tommy rushed into the room breathlessly , demanding , `` I say , who has got my dollar ? ''"
`` What are you talking about ? ''
asked Franz .
"Tommy explained , and Nat corroborated his statement ."
"Every one else declared they knew nothing about it , and began to look suspiciously at Nat , who got more and more alarmed and confused with each denial ."
"`` Somebody must have taken it , '' said Franz , as Tommy shook his fist at the whole party , and wrathfully declared that , `` By thunder turtles !"
"if I get hold of the thief , I 'll give him what he wo n't forget in a hurry . ''"
"`` Keep cool , Tom ; we shall find him out ; thieves always come to grief , '' said Dan , as one who knew something of the matter ."
"`` May be some tramp slept in the barn and took it , '' suggested Ned ."
"`` No , Silas do n't allow that ; besides , a tramp would n't go looking in that old machine for money , '' said Emil , with scorn ."
`` Was n't it Silas himself ? ''
said Jack .
"`` Well , I like that !"
Old Si is as honest as daylight .
"You would n't catch him touching a penny of ours , '' said Tommy , handsomely defending his chief admirer from suspicion ."
"`` We 'll never get ashore at this rate , '' said I. `` If it 's the only course that we can lie , sir , we must even lie it , '' returned the captain ."
`` We must keep upstream .
"You see , sir , '' he went on , `` if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place , it 's hard to say where we should get ashore , besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs ; whereas , the way we go the current must slacken , and then we can dodge back along the shore . ''"
"`` The current 's less a ` ready , sir , '' said the man Gray , who was sitting in the fore-sheets ; `` you can ease her off a bit . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' said I , quite as if nothing had happened , for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves ."
"Suddenly the captain spoke up again , and I thought his voice was a little changed ."
`` The gun ! ''
said he .
"`` I have thought of that , '' said I , for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort ."
"`` They could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods . ''"
"`` Look astern , doctor , '' replied the captain ."
"We had entirely forgotten the long nine ; and there , to our horror , were the five rogues busy about her , getting off her jacket , as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed ."
"Not only that , but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind , and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad ."
"`` Israel was Flint 's gunner , '' said Gray hoarsely ."
"At any risk , we put the boat 's head direct for the landing-place ."
"By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing , and I could keep her steady for the goal ."
But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door .
I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck .
`` Who 's the best shot ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` Mr. Trelawney , out and away , '' said I. `` Mr. Trelawney , will you please pick me off one of these men , sir ?"
"Hands , if possible , '' said the captain ."
Trelawney was as cool as steel .
He looked to the priming of his gun .
"`` Now , '' cried the captain , `` easy with that gun , sir , or you 'll swamp the boat ."
All hands stand by to trim her when he aims . ''
"The squire raised his gun , the rowing ceased , and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance , and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop ."
"They had the gun , by this time , slewed round upon the swivel , and Hands , who was at the muzzle with the rammer , was in consequence the most exposed ."
"However , we had no luck , for just as Trelawney fired , down he stooped , the ball whistled over him , and it was one of the other four who fell ."
"The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore , and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats ."
"`` Here come the gigs , sir , '' said I. `` Give way , then , '' cried the captain ."
`` We must n't mind if we swamp her now .
I 'm sorry on your account ; but you need n't say a word at the cranky places .
I 'll do all the talking ... Mrs. Lynde would say I was well able to .
Mrs. Lynde does n't know whether to approve of our enterprise or not .
"She inclines to , when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of it ; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it ."
So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde 's eyes .
"Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting , and I expect it will be good , for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family ."
I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found out that Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla 's aunt .
It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote ` Edgewood Days ' and ` The Rosebud Garden . ' ''
`` Where does Mrs. Morgan live ? ''
`` In Toronto .
"And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit next summer , and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her ."
That seems almost too good to be true -- but it 's something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed . ''
The Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact .
"Gilbert Blythe was president , Fred Wright vice-president , Anne Shirley secretary , and Diana Barry treasurer ."
"The `` Improvers , '' as they were promptly christened , were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of the members ."
"It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many improvements so late in the season ; but they meant to plan the next summer 's campaign , collect and discuss ideas , write and read papers , and , as Anne said , educate the public sentiment generally ."
"There was some disapproval , of course , and ... which the Improvers felt much more keenly ... a good deal of ridicule ."
Mr. Elisha Wright was reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization would be Courting Club .
Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with geraniums .
Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after plans approved by the society .
Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill .
Eben Wright told Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to keep his whiskers trimmed .
Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace curtains in the cowstable windows .
"Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton Sloane , an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory , if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand hand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it ."
"In spite of ... or perhaps , human nature being what it is , because of ... this , the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall ."
"At the second meeting , in the Barry parlor , Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle and paint the hall ; Julia Bell seconded it , with an uneasy feeling that she was doing something not exactly ladylike ."
"Gilbert put the motion , it was carried unanimously , and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes ."
"The next thing was to appoint a committee , and Gertie Pye , determined not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels , boldly moved that Miss Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee ."
"This motion being also duly seconded and carried , Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie on the committee , along with Gilbert , Anne , Diana , and Fred Wright ."
The committee chose their routes in private conclave .
"Anne and Diana were told off for the Newbridge road , Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands road , and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road ."
"`` Because , '' explained Gilbert to Anne , as they walked home together through the Haunted Wood , `` the Pyes all live along that road and they wo n't give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them . ''"
"For the next two hours the girls wrote busily , forgetting all about the rainy day , and enjoying their epistolary labours to the full ."
It was dusk when all the letters were finished .
"`` Why , has n't the afternoon gone quickly after all ! ''"
exclaimed Carol .
`` I just let my pen run on and jotted down any good working idea that came into my head .
"Cyrilla Blair , that big fat letter is never for Miss Marshall !"
What on earth did you find to write her ? ''
"`` It was n't so hard when I got fairly started , '' said Cyrilla , smiling ."
"`` Now , let 's hunt up Nora Jane and send the letters around so that everybody can read his or hers before tea-time ."
We should have a choice assortment of smiles at the table instead of all those frowns and sighs we had at dinner . ''
"Miss Emily Marshall was at that moment sitting in her little back room , all alone in the dusk , with the rain splashing drearily against the windowpanes outside ."
Miss Marshall was feeling as lonely and dreary as she looked -- and as she had often felt in her life of sixty years .
She told herself bitterly that she had n't a friend in the world -- not even one who cared enough for her to come and see her or write her a letter now and then .
"She thought her boarding-house acquaintances disliked her and she resented their dislike , without admitting to herself that her ungracious ways were responsible for it ."
She smiled sourly when little ripples of laughter came faintly down the hall from the front room where The Trio were writing their letters and laughing over the fun they were putting into them .
"`` If they were old and lonesome and friendless they would n't see much in life to laugh at , I guess , '' said Miss Marshall bitterly , drawing her shawl closer about her sharp shoulders ."
`` They never think of anything but themselves and if a day passes that they do n't have ` some fun ' they think it 's a fearful thing to put up with .
I 'm sick and tired of their giggling and whispering . ''
In the midst of these amiable reflections Miss Marshall heard a knock at her door .
"When she opened it there stood Nora Jane , her broad red face beaming with smiles ."
"`` Please , Miss , here 's a letter for you , '' she said ."
`` A letter for me ! ''
Miss Marshall shut her door and stared at the fat envelope in amazement .
Who could have written it ?
The postman came only in the morning .
"Was it some joke , perhaps ?"
Those giggling girls ?
Miss Marshall 's face grew harder as she lighted her lamp and opened the letter suspiciously .
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , '' it ran in Cyrilla 's pretty girlish writing , `` we girls are so lonesome and dull that we have decided to write rainy-day letters to everybody in the house just to cheer ourselves up ."
So I 'm going to write to you just a letter of friendly nonsense . ''
"Pages of `` nonsense '' followed , and very delightful nonsense it was , for Cyrilla possessed the happy gift of bright and easy letter-writing ."
"She commented wittily on all the amusing episodes of the boarding-house life for the past month ; she described a cat-fight she had witnessed from her window that morning and illustrated it by a pen-and-ink sketch of the belligerent felines ; she described a lovely new dress her mother had sent her from home and told all about the class party to which she had worn it ; she gave an account of her vacation camping trip to the mountains and pasted on one page a number of small snapshots taken during the outing ; she copied a joke she had read in the paper that morning and discussed the serial story in the boarding-house magazine which all the boarders were reading ; she wrote out the directions for a new crocheted tidy her sister had made -- Miss Marshall had a mania for crocheting ; and she finally wound up with `` all the good will and good wishes that Nora Jane will consent to carry from your friend , Cyrilla Blair . ''"
"`` Then do go to sleep , '' said Nan , pettishly ."
`` I want my own bed .
"Oh , I wish I could see Teddy ! ''"
"cried Rob , painfully reminded of home by the soft chirp of birds safe in their little nests ."
"`` I do n't believe your mother will ever find us , '' said Nan , who was becoming desperate , for she hated patient waiting of any sort ."
`` It 's so dark she wo n't see us . ''
"`` It was all black in the ice-house , and I was so scared I did n't call her , but she saw me ; and she will see me now , no matter how dark it is , '' returned confiding Rob , standing up to peer into the gloom for the help which never failed him ."
`` I see her !
I see her ! ''
"he cried , and ran as fast as his tired legs would take him toward a dark figure slowly approaching ."
"Suddenly he stopped , then turned about , and came stumbling back , screaming in a great panic , `` No , it 's a bear , a big black one ! ''"
and hid his face in Nan 's skirts .
"For a moment Nan quailed ; ever her courage gave out at the thought of a real bear , and she was about to turn and flee in great disorder , when a mild `` Moo ! ''"
"changed her fear to merriment , as she said , laughing , `` It 's a cow , Robby !"
"the nice , black cow we saw this afternoon . ''"
"The cow seemed to feel that it was not just the thing to meet two little people in her pasture after dark , and the amiable beast paused to inquire into the case ."
"She let them stroke her , and stood regarding them with her soft eyes so mildly , that Nan , who feared no animal but a bear , was fired with a desire to milk her ."
"`` Silas taught me how ; and berries and milk would be so nice , '' she said , emptying the contents of her pail into her hat , and boldly beginning her new task , while Rob stood by and repeated , at her command , the poem from Mother Goose : `` Cushy cow , bonny , let down your milk , Let down your milk to me , And I will give you a gown of silk , A gown of silk and a silver tee . ''"
"But the immortal rhyme had little effect , for the benevolent cow had already been milked , and had only half a gill to give the thirsty children ."
`` Shoo !
get away !
"you are an old cross patch , '' cried Nan , ungratefully , as she gave up the attempt in despair ; and poor Molly walked on with a gentle gurgle of surprise and reproof ."
"`` Each can have a sip , and then we must take a walk ."
We shall go to sleep if we do n't ; and lost people must n't sleep .
Do n't you know how Hannah Lee in the pretty story slept under the snow and died ? ''
"`` But there is n't any snow now , and it 's nice and warm , '' said Rob , who was not blessed with as lively a fancy as Nan ."
"`` No matter , we will poke about a little , and call some more ; and then , if nobody comes , we will hide under the bushes , like Hop - ` o-my-thumb and his brothers . ''"
"It was a very short walk , however , for Rob was so sleepy he could not get on , and tumbled down so often that Nan entirely lost patience , being half distracted by the responsibility she had taken upon herself ."
"`` If you tumble down again , I 'll shake you , '' she said , lifting the poor little man up very kindly as she spoke , for Nan 's bark was much worse than her bite ."
`` Please do n't .
"It 's my boots they keep slipping so ; '' and Rob manfully checked the sob just ready to break out , adding , with a plaintive patience that touched Nan 's heart , `` If the skeeters did n't bite me so , I could go to sleep till Marmar comes . ''"
"`` Put your head on my lap , and I 'll cover you up with my apron ; I 'm not afraid of the night , '' said Nan , sitting down and trying to persuade herself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings all about her ."
said the eyes of one to the eyes of the other .
Meanwhile the swallows had spoken again .
` That was indeed good fortune ! '
cried they .
` And when the children are grown up they can return to their father and set their mother free . '
"` It will not be so easy as you think , ' answered the city swallow , shaking her head ; ` for they will have to prove that they are the king 's children , and also that their mother never went mad at all ."
"In fact , it is so difficult that there is only one way of proving it to the king . '"
` And what is that ? '
cried all the swallows at once .
` And how do you know it ? ' '
"I know it , ' answered the city swallow , ` because , one day , when I was passing through the palace garden , I met a cuckoo , who , as I need not tell you , always pretends to be able to see into the future ."
"We began to talk about certain things which were happening in the palace , and of the events of past years ."
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` the only person who can expose the wickedness of the ministers and show the king how wrong he has been , is the Bird of Truth , who can speak the language of men . '' '"
`` And where can this bird be found ? ''
I asked . '
"`` It is shut up in a castle guarded by a fierce giant , who only sleeps one quarter of an hour out of the whole twenty-four , '' replied the cuckoo ."
` And where is this castle ? '
"inquired the country swallow , who , like all the rest , and the children most of all , had been listening with deep attention ."
"` That is just what I do n't know , ' answered her friend ."
"` All I can tell you is that not far from here is a tower , where dwells an old witch , and it is she who knows the way , and she will only teach it to the person who promises to bring her the water from the fountain of many colours , which she uses for her enchantments ."
"But never will she betray the place where the Bird of Truth is hidden , for she hates him , and would kill him if she could ; knowing well , however , that this bird can not die , as he is immortal , she keeps him closely shut up , and guarded night and day by the Birds of Bad Faith , who seek to gag him so that his voice should not be heard . '"
"` And is there no one else who can tell the poor boy where to find the bird , if he should ever manage to reach the tower ? '"
asked the country swallow .
"` No one , ' replied the city swallow , ` except an owl , who lives a hermit 's life in that desert , and he knows only one word of man 's speech , and that is `` cross . ''"
"So that even if the prince did succeed in getting there , he could never understand what the owl said ."
"But , look , the sun is sinking to his nest in the depths of the sea , and I must go to mine ."
"Good-night , friends , good-night ! '"
"Then the swallow flew away , and the children , who had forgotten both hunger and weariness in the joy of this strange news , rose up and followed in the direction of her flight ."
"After two hours ' walking , they arrived at a large city , which they felt sure must be the capital of their father 's kingdom ."
"Seeing a good-natured looking woman standing at the door of a house , they asked her if she would give them a night 's lodging , and she was so pleased with their pretty faces and nice manners that she welcomed them warmly ."
"It was scarcely light the next morning before the girl was sweeping out the rooms , and the boy watering the garden , so that by the time the good woman came downstairs there was nothing left for her to do ."
"This so delighted her that she begged the children to stay with her altogether , and the boy answered that he would leave his sisters with her gladly , but that he himself had serious business on hand and must not linger in pursuit of it ."
"I know that Jem and Jerry are in the trenches -- that Ken and Walter will be soon -- that if one of them does not come back my heart will break -- yet I go on and work and plan -- yes , and even enjoy life by times ."
"There are moments when we have real fun because , just for the moment , we do n't think about things and then -- we remember -- and the remembering is worse than thinking of it all the time would have been ."
"`` Today was dark and cloudy and tonight is wild enough , as Gertrude says , to please any novelist in search of suitable matter for a murder or elopement ."
"The raindrops streaming over the panes look like tears running down a face , and the wind is shrieking through the maple grove ."
`` This has n't been a nice Christmas Day in any way .
"Nan had toothache and Susan had red eyes , and assumed a weird and gruesome flippancy of manner to deceive us into thinking she had n't ; and Jims had a bad cold all day and I 'm afraid of croup ."
He has had croup twice since October .
"The first time I was nearly frightened to death , for father and mother were both away -- father always is away , it seems to me , when any of this household gets sick ."
"But Susan was cool as a fish and knew just what to do , and by morning Jims was all right ."
That child is a cross between a duck and an imp .
"He 's a year and four months old , trots about everywhere , and says quite a few words ."
He has the cutest little way of calling me `` Willa-will . ''
"It always brings back that dreadful , ridiculous , delightful night when Ken came to say good-bye , and I was so furious and happy ."
Jims is pink and white and big-eyed and curly-haired and every now and then I discover a new dimple in him .
"I can never quite believe he is really the same creature as that scrawny , yellow , ugly little changeling I brought home in the soup tureen ."
Nobody has ever heard a word from Jim Anderson .
If he never comes back I shall keep Jims always .
Everybody here worships and spoils him -- or would spoil him if Morgan and I did n't stand remorselessly in the way .
Susan says Jims is the cleverest child she ever saw and can recognize Old Nick when he sees him -- this because Jims threw poor Doc out of an upstairs window one day .
"Doc turned into Mr. Hyde on his way down and landed in a currant bush , spitting and swearing ."
"I tried to console his inner cat with a saucer of milk but he would have none of it , and remained Mr. Hyde the rest of the day ."
Jims 's latest exploit was to paint the cushion of the big arm-chair in the sun parlour with molasses ; and before anybody found it out Mrs. Fred Clow came in on Red Cross business and sat down on it .
Her new silk dress was ruined and nobody could blame her for being vexed .
"But she went into one of her tempers and said nasty things and gave me such slams about ` spoiling ' Jims that I nearly boiled over , too ."
But I kept the lid on till she had waddled away and then I exploded . ''
"` The fat , clumsy , horrid old thing , ' I said -- and oh , what a satisfaction it was to say it . ''"
"` She has three sons at the front , ' mother said rebukingly . '' '"
"I suppose that covers all her shortcomings in manners , ' I retorted ."
But I was ashamed -- for it is true that all her boys have gone and she was very plucky and loyal about it too ; and she is a perfect tower of strength in the Red Cross .
It 's a little hard to remember all the heroines .
"Just the same , it was her second new silk dress in one year and that when everybody is -- or should be -- trying to ` save and serve . '"
`` I had to bring out my green velvet hat again lately and begin wearing it .
Isaac was a well-to-do old bachelor who had never had any notion of getting married until his sister died in the winter .
"And then , as soon as the spring planting was over , he began to look round for a wife ."
He came to me first and I said `` No '' good and hard .
"I liked Isaac well enough ; but I was snug and comfortable , and did n't feel like pulling up my roots and moving into another lot ; besides , Isaac 's courting seemed to me a shade too business-like ."
I ca n't get along without a little romance ; it 's my nature .
"Isaac was disappointed and said so , but intimated that it was n't crushing and that the next best would do very well ."
"The next best was Melissa , and he proposed to her after the decent interval of a fortnight ."
Melissa also refused him .
"I admit I was surprised at this , for I knew Melissa was rather anxious to marry ; but she has always been down on Isaac Appleby , from principle , because of a family feud on her mother 's side ; besides , an old beau of hers , a widower at Kingsbridge , was just beginning to take notice again , and I suspected Melissa had hopes concerning him ."
"Finally , I imagine Melissa did not fancy being second choice ."
"Whatever her reasons were , she refused poor Isaac , and that finished his matrimonial prospects as far as Jersey Cove was concerned , for there was n't another eligible woman in it -- that is , for a man of Isaac 's age ."
"I was the only widow , and the other old maids besides Melissa were all hopelessly old-maiden ."
"This was all three months ago , and Isaac had been keeping house for himself ever since ."
"Nobody knew much about how he got along , for the Appleby house is half a mile from anywhere , down near the shore at the end of a long lane -- the lonesomest place , as I did not fail to remember when I was considering Isaac 's offer ."
"`` I heard Jarvis Aldrich say Isaac had got a dog lately , '' said Melissa , when we finally came in sight of the house -- a handsome new one , by the way , put up only ten years ago ."
`` Jarvis said it was an imported breed .
I do hope it is n't cross . ''
"I have a mortal horror of dogs , and I followed Melissa into the big farmyard with fear and trembling ."
"We were halfway across the yard when Melissa shrieked : `` Anne , there 's the dog ! ''"
"There was the dog ; and the trouble was that he did n't stay there , but came right down the slope at a steady , business-like trot ."
"He was a bull-dog and big enough to bite a body clean in two , and he was the ugliest thing in dogs I had ever seen ."
Melissa and I both lost our heads .
"We screamed , dropped our parasols , and ran instinctively to the only refuge that was in sight -- a ladder leaning against the old Appleby house ."
"I am forty-five and something more than plump , so that climbing ladders is not my favorite form of exercise ."
But I went up that one with the agility and grace of sixteen .
"Melissa followed me , and we found ourselves on the roof -- fortunately it was a flat one -- panting and gasping , but safe , unless that diabolical dog could climb a ladder ."
I crept cautiously to the edge and peered over .
"The beast was sitting on his haunches at the foot of the ladder , and it was quite evident he was not short on time ."
The gleam in his eye seemed to say : `` I 've got you two unprincipled subscription hunters beautifully treed and it 's treed you 're going to stay .
That is what I call satisfying . ''
I reported the state of the case to Melissa .
`` What shall we do ? ''
"Even as I spoke on these grave subjects , my eye would take a glad bit of a run over the prospect , and my heart jump with pride ."
"About my clear duty to my friend , the lawyer had no doubt ."
"I must help him out of the county at whatever risk ; but in the case of James , he was of a different mind ."
"`` Mr. Thomson , '' says he , `` is one thing , Mr. Thomson 's kinsman quite another ."
"I know little of the facts , but I gather that a great noble -LRB- whom we will call , if you like , the D. of A. -RRB- * has some concern and is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter ."
"The D. of A. is doubtless an excellent nobleman ; but , Mr. David , timeo qui nocuere deos ."
"If you interfere to balk his vengeance , you should remember there is one way to shut your testimony out ; and that is to put you in the dock ."
"There , you would be in the same pickle as Mr. Thomson 's kinsman ."
"You will object that you are innocent ; well , but so is he ."
"And to be tried for your life before a Highland jury , on a Highland quarrel and with a Highland Judge upon the bench , would be a brief transition to the gallows . ''"
* The Duke of Argyle .
Now I had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply to them ; so I put on all the simplicity I could .
"`` In that case , sir , '' said I , `` I would just have to be hanged -- would I not ? ''"
"`` My dear boy , '' cries he , `` go in God 's name , and do what you think is right ."
It is a poor thought that at my time of life I should be advising you to choose the safe and shameful ; and I take it back with an apology .
"Go and do your duty ; and be hanged , if you must , like a gentleman ."
There are worse things in the world than to be hanged . ''
"`` Not many , sir , '' said I , smiling ."
"`` Why , yes , sir , '' he cried , `` very many ."
And it would be ten times better for your uncle -LRB- to go no farther afield -RRB- if he were dangling decently upon a gibbet . ''
"Thereupon he turned into the house -LRB- still in a great fervour of mind , so that I saw I had pleased him heartily -RRB- and there he wrote me two letters , making his comments on them as he wrote ."
"`` This , '' says he , `` is to my bankers , the British Linen Company , placing a credit to your name ."
"Consult Mr. Thomson , he will know of ways ; and you , with this credit , can supply the means ."
"I trust you will be a good husband of your money ; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson , I would be even prodigal ."
"Then for his kinsman , there is no better way than that you should seek the Advocate , tell him your tale , and offer testimony ; whether he may take it or not , is quite another matter , and will turn on the D. of A. Now , that you may reach the Lord Advocate well recommended , I give you here a letter to a namesake of your own , the learned Mr. Balfour of Pilrig , a man whom I esteem ."
It will look better that you should be presented by one of your own name ; and the laird of Pilrig is much looked up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord Advocate Grant .
"I would not trouble him , if I were you , with any particulars ; and -LRB- do you know ? -RRB-"
I think it would be needless to refer to Mr. Thomson .
"Form yourself upon the laird , he is a good model ; when you deal with the Advocate , be discreet ; and in all these matters , may the Lord guide you , Mr. David ! ''"
"Thereupon he took his farewell , and set out with Torrance for the Ferry , while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh ."
"As we went by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge , we kept looking back at the house of my fathers ."
"It stood there , bare and great and smokeless , like a place not lived in ; only in one of the top windows , there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back and forward , like the head of a rabbit from a burrow ."
I 'm all right .
"Do n't squeeze the breath out of me , please , '' expostulated Jack , looking so startled and innocent , as he struggled feebly , that they all laughed , and this plaintive protest caused him to be released ."
"But the next proceeding did not enlighten him much , for Frank kept waving a very inky paper before him and ordering him to read it , while Mamma made a charge at Jill , as if it was absolutely necessary to hug somebody ."
`` Hullo ! ''
"said Jack , when he got the letter into his own hand and read it ."
`` Now who put Bob up to this ?
"Nobody had any business to interfere -- but it 's mighty good of him , anyway , '' he added , as the anxious lines in his round face smoothed themselves away , while a smile of relief told how hard it had been for him to keep his word ."
`` I did ! ''
"cried Jill , clapping her hands , and looking so happy that he could not have scolded her if he had wanted to ."
`` Who told you he was in the scrape ? ''
"demanded Jack , in a hurry to know all about it now the seal was taken off his own lips ."
"`` You did ; '' and Jill 's face twinkled with naughty satisfaction , for this was the best fun of all ."
`` I did n't !
When ?
Where ?
It 's a joke ! ''
"`` You did , '' cried Jill , pointing to the rug ."
"`` You went to sleep there after the long walk , and talked in your sleep about ` Bob ' and ` All right , old boy , ' and ever so much gibberish ."
"I did n't think about it then , but when I heard that Bob was up there I thought may be he knew something about it , and last night I wrote and asked him , and that 's the answer , and now it is all right , and you are the best boy that ever was , and I 'm so glad ! ''"
"Here Jill paused , all out of breath , and Frank said , with an approving pat on the head , -- `` It wo n't do to have such a sharp young person round if we are going to have secrets ."
"You 'd make a good detective , miss . ''"
`` Catch me taking naps before people again ; '' and Jack looked rather crestfallen that his own words had set `` Fine Ear '' on the track .
"`` Never mind , I did n't mean to tell , though I just ached to do it all the time , so I have n't broken my word ."
"I 'm glad you all know , but you need n't let it get out , for Bob is a good fellow , and it might make trouble for him , '' added Jack , anxious lest his gain should be the other 's loss ."
"`` I shall tell Mr. Acton myself , and the Captain , also , for I 'm not going to have my son suspected of wrong-doing when he has only tried to help a friend , and borne enough for his sake , '' said Mamma , much excited by this discovery of generous fidelity in her boy ; though when one came to look at it calmly , one saw that it might have been done in a wiser way ."
"`` Now , please , do n't make a fuss about it ; that would be most as bad as having every one down on me ."
"I can stand your praising me , but I wo n't be patted on the head by anybody else ; '' and Jack assumed a manly air , though his face was full of genuine boyish pleasure at being set right in the eyes of those he loved ."
"`` I 'll be discreet , dear , but you owe it to yourself , as well as Bob , to have the truth known ."
"Both have behaved well , and no harm will come to him , I am sure ."
"I 'll see to that myself , '' said Mrs. Minot , in a tone that set Jack 's mind at rest on that point ."
"`` Now do tell all about it , '' cried Jill , who was pining to know the whole story , and felt as if she had earned the right to hear it ."
"`` Oh , it was n't much ."
"Alan wrote it , putting all thought of Lynde Oliver sternly out of his mind for the time being ."
He had no notion of falling in love with her .
He knew nothing of love and imagined that it counted for nothing in his life .
"He admitted that his curiosity was aflame about the girl , but it never occurred to him that she meant or could mean anything to him but an attractive enigma which once solved would lose its attraction ."
"The young women he knew in Rexton , whose simple , pleasant friendship he valued , had the placid , domestic charm of their own sweet-breathed , windless orchards ."
"Lynde Oliver had the fascination of the lake shore -- wild , remote , untamed -- the lure of the wilderness and the primitive ."
"There was nothing more personal in his thought of her , and yet when he recalled Isabel King 's sneer he felt an almost personal resentment ."
* * * * * During the following fortnight Alan made many trips to the shore -- and he always went by the branch road to the Four Winds point .
He did not attempt to conceal from himself that he hoped to meet Lynde Oliver again .
In this he was unsuccessful .
Sometimes he saw her at a distance along the shore but she always disappeared as soon as seen .
"Occasionally as he crossed the point he saw her working in her garden but he never went very near the house , feeling that he had no right to spy on it or her in any way ."
He soon became convinced that she avoided him purposely and the conviction piqued him .
He felt an odd masterful desire to meet her face to face and make her look at him .
Sometimes he called himself a fool and vowed he would go no more to the Four Winds shore .
Yet he inevitably went .
He did not find in the shore the comfort and inspiration he had formerly found .
"Something had come between his soul and the soul of the wilderness -- something he did not recognize or formulate -- a nameless , haunting longing that shaped itself about the memory of a cold sweet face and starry , indifferent eyes , grey as the lake at dawn ."
"Of Captain Anthony he never got even a glimpse , but he saw the old cousin several times , going and coming about the yard and its environs ."
"Finally one day he met her , coming up a path which led to a spring down in a firry hollow ."
She was carrying two heavy pails of water and Alan asked permission to help her .
"He half expected a repulse , for the tall , grim old woman had a rather stern and forbidding look , but after gazing at him a moment in a somewhat scrutinizing manner she said briefly , `` You may , if you like . ''"
"Alan took the pails and followed her , the path not being wide enough for two ."
"She strode on before him at a rapid , vigorous pace until they came out into the yard by the house ."
Alan felt his heart beating foolishly .
Would he see Lynde Oliver ?
"Would -- `` You may carry the water there , '' the old woman said , pointing to a little outhouse near the pines ."
`` I 'm washing -- the spring water is softer than the well water .
Thank you '' -- as Alan set the pails down on a bench -- `` I 'm not so young as I was and bringing the water so far tires me .
Lynde always brings it for me when she 's home . ''
"She stood before him in the narrow doorway , blocking his exit , and looked at him with keen , deep-set dark eyes ."
"In spite of her withered aspect and wrinkled face , she was not an uncomely old woman and there was about her a dignity of carriage and manner that pleased Alan ."
"It was because his boat had got wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice , through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle ."
"The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him , for they could not dance , so heavy were their hearts ."
"They forget all the steps when they are sad , and remember them again when they are merry ."
"David tells me that fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey . '"
"Well , they were looking very undancey indeed , when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers , caused by Brownie , who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke ."
"Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared , though she had really no hope ; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself , who , however , was absolutely confident ."
"She was led before his grace , and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart , which for convenience ' sake was reached by a little trap-door in his diamond shirt , had begun to say mechanically , ` Cold , qui -- , ' when he stopped abruptly ."
` What 's this ? '
"he cried , and first he shook the heart like a watch , and then he put his ear to it ."
` Bless my soul ! '
"cried the doctor , and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous , fairies fainting right and left ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They warned her -RSB- Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke , who was very much startled , and looked as if he would like to run away ."
` Good gracious me ! '
"the doctor was heard muttering , and now the heart was evidently on fire , for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth ."
The suspense was awful .
"Then in a loud voice , and bowing low , ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love . '"
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , ' O Brownie , how splendid ! '"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say , ` Oh dear ! '"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie ; too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates ; she heard the murmur of an angry multitude ; she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
"I got her through my old friend , Blandly , who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump ."
"The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest , and so , I may say , did everyone in Bristol , as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for -- treasure , I mean ."
"`` Redruth , '' said I , interrupting the letter , `` Dr. Livesey will not like that ."
"The squire has been talking , after all . ''"
"`` Well , who 's a better right ? ''"
growled the gamekeeper .
"`` A pretty rum go if squire ai n't to talk for Dr. Livesey , I should think . ''"
"At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on : Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA , and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle ."
There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly .
"They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money , that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him , and that he sold it me absurdly high -- the most transparent calumnies ."
"None of them dare , however , to deny the merits of the ship ."
So far there was not a hitch .
"The workpeople , to be sure -- riggers and what not -- were most annoyingly slow ; but time cured that ."
It was the crew that troubled me .
"I wished a round score of men -- in case of natives , buccaneers , or the odious French -- and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen , till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required ."
"I was standing on the dock , when , by the merest accident , I fell in talk with him ."
"I found he was an old sailor , kept a public-house , knew all the seafaring men in Bristol , had lost his health ashore , and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again ."
"He had hobbled down there that morning , he said , to get a smell of the salt ."
"I was monstrously touched -- so would you have been -- and , out of pure pity , I engaged him on the spot to be ship 's cook ."
"Long John Silver , he is called , and has lost a leg ; but that I regarded as a recommendation , since he lost it in his country 's service , under the immortal Hawke ."
"He has no pension , Livesey ."
Imagine the abominable age we live in !
"Well , sir , I thought I had only found a cook , but it was a crew I had discovered ."
"Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable -- not pretty to look at , but fellows , by their faces , of the most indomitable spirit ."
I declare we could fight a frigate .
Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged .
He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance .
"I am in the most magnificent health and spirits , eating like a bull , sleeping like a tree , yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan ."
"Seaward , ho !"
Hang the treasure !
It 's the glory of the sea that has turned my head .
"So now , Livesey , come post ; do not lose an hour , if you respect me ."
"`` Patience is a tired mare but she jogs on , '' said Susan ."
"`` While the steeds of Armageddon thunder , trampling over our hearts , '' retorted Miss Oliver ."
"`` Susan , tell me -- do n't you ever -- did n't you ever -- take spells of feeling that you must scream -- or swear -- or smash something -- just because your torture reaches a point when it becomes unbearable ? ''"
"`` I have never sworn or desired to swear , Miss Oliver dear , but I will admit , '' said Susan , with the air of one determined to make a clean breast of it once and for all , `` that I have experienced occasions when it was a relief to do considerable banging . ''"
"`` Do n't you think that is a kind of swearing , Susan ?"
"What is the difference between slamming a door viciously and saying d -- '' `` Miss Oliver dear , '' interrupted Susan , desperately determined to save Gertrude from herself , if human power could do it , `` you are all tired out and unstrung -- and no wonder , teaching those obstreperous youngsters all day and coming home to bad war news ."
But just you go upstairs and lie down and I will bring you up a cup of hot tea and a bite of toast and very soon you will not want to slam doors or swear . ''
"`` Susan , you 're a good soul -- a very pearl of Susans !"
"But , Susan , it would be such a relief -- to say just one soft , low , little tiny d -- '' `` I will bring you a hot-water bottle for the soles of your feet , also , '' interposed Susan resolutely , `` and it would not be any relief to say that word you are thinking of , Miss Oliver , and that you may tie to . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll try the hot-water bottle first , '' said Miss Oliver , repenting herself on teasing Susan and vanishing upstairs , to Susan 's intense relief ."
Susan shook her head ominously as she filled the hot-water bottle .
The war was certainly relaxing the standards of behaviour woefully .
Here was Miss Oliver admittedly on the point of profanity .
"`` We must draw the blood from her brain , '' said Susan , `` and if this bottle is not effective I will see what can be done with a mustard plaster . ''"
Gertrude rallied and carried on .
"Lord Kitchener went to Greece , whereat Susan foretold that Constantine would soon experience a change of heart ."
Lloyd George began to heckle the Allies regarding equipment and guns and Susan said you would hear more of Lloyd George yet .
"The gallant Anzacs withdrew from Gallipoli and Susan approved the step , with reservations ."
The siege of Kut-El-Amara began and Susan pored over maps of Mesopotamia and abused the Turks .
Henry Ford started for Europe and Susan flayed him with sarcasm .
"Sir John French was superseded by Sir Douglas Haig and Susan dubiously opined that it was poor policy to swap horses crossing a stream , `` though , to be sure , Haig was a good name and French had a foreign sound , say what you might . ''"
"Not a move on the great chess-board of king or bishop or pawn escaped Susan , who had once read only Glen St. Mary notes ."
"`` There was a time , '' she said sorrowfully , `` when I did not care what happened outside of P.E. Island , and now a king can not have a toothache in Russia or China but it worries me ."
"It may be broadening to the mind , as the doctor said , but it is very painful to the feelings . ''"
When Christmas came again Susan did not set any vacant places at the festive board .
Two empty chairs were too much even for Susan who had thought in September that there would not be one .
"`` This is the first Christmas that Walter was not home , '' Rilla wrote in her diary that night ."
"`` Jem used to be away for Christmases up in Avonlea , but Walter never was ."
I had letters from Ken and him today .
They are still in England but expect to be in the trenches very soon .
And then -- but I suppose we 'll be able to endure it somehow .
"To me , the strangest of all the strange things since 1914 is how we have all learned to accept things we never thought we could -- to go on with life as a matter of course ."
"But Dick still stood irresolute ; he was yet young to the more deplorable necessities of war , and the thought of old Lady Brackley checked the command upon his tongue ."
His own men became restive .
"Some of them cried on him by name ; others , of their own accord , began to shoot ; and at the first discharge poor Bennet bit the dust ."
Then Dick awoke .
`` On ! ''
he cried .
"`` Shoot , boys , and keep to cover ."
England and York ! ''
"But just then the dull beat of many horses on the snow suddenly arose in the hollow ear of the night , and , with incredible swiftness , drew nearer and swelled louder ."
"At the same time , answering tuckets repeated and repeated Hatch 's call ."
"`` Rally , rally ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` Rally upon me !
Rally for your lives ! ''
"But his men -- afoot , scattered , taken in the hour when they had counted on an easy triumph -- began instead to give ground severally , and either stood wavering or dispersed into the thickets ."
"And when the first of the horsemen came charging through the open avenues and fiercely riding their steeds into the underwood , a few stragglers were overthrown or speared among the brush , but the bulk of Dick 's command had simply melted at the rumour of their coming ."
"Dick stood for a moment , bitterly recognising the fruits of his precipitate and unwise valour ."
"Sir Daniel had seen the fire ; he had moved out with his main force , whether to attack his pursuers or to take them in the rear if they should venture the assault ."
His had been throughout the part of a sagacious captain ; Dick 's the conduct of an eager boy .
"And here was the young knight , his sweetheart , indeed , holding him tightly by the hand , but otherwise alone , his whole command of men and horses dispersed in the night and the wide forest , like a paper of pins in a bay barn ."
`` The saints enlighten me ! ''
he thought .
`` It is well I was knighted for this morning 's matter ; this doth me little honour . ''
"And thereupon , still holding Joanna , he began to run ."
"The silence of the night was now shattered by the shouts of the men of Tunstall , as they galloped hither and thither , hunting fugitives ; and Dick broke boldly through the underwood and ran straight before him like a deer ."
"The silver clearness of the moon upon the open snow increased , by contrast , the obscurity of the thickets ; and the extreme dispersion of the vanquished led the pursuers into wildly divergent paths ."
"Hence , in but a little while , Dick and Joanna paused , in a close covert , and heard the sounds of the pursuit , scattering abroad , indeed , in all directions , but yet fainting already in the distance ."
"`` An I had but kept a reserve of them together , '' Dick cried , bitterly , `` I could have turned the tables yet !"
"Well , we live and learn ; next time it shall go better , by the rood . ''"
"`` Nay , Dick , '' said Joanna , `` what matters it ?"
Here we are together once again . ''
"He looked at her , and there she was -- John Matcham , as of yore , in hose and doublet ."
"My eyes turned instinctively in that direction , and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine ."
"What it was , whether bear or man or monkey , I could in no wise tell ."
It seemed dark and shaggy ; more I knew not .
But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand .
"I was now , it seemed , cut off upon both sides ; behind me the murderers , before me this lurking nondescript ."
And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not .
"Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods , and I turned on my heel , and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder , began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats ."
"Instantly the figure reappeared , and making a wide circuit , began to head me off ."
"I was tired , at any rate ; but had I been as fresh as when I rose , I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary ."
"From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer , running manlike on two legs , but unlike any man that I had ever seen , stooping almost double as it ran ."
"Yet a man it was , I could no longer be in doubt about that ."
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals .
I was within an ace of calling for help .
"But the mere fact that he was a man , however wild , had somewhat reassured me , and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion ."
"I stood still , therefore , and cast about for some method of escape ; and as I was so thinking , the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind ."
"As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless , courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him ."
"He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk ; but he must have been watching me closely , for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me ."
"Then he hesitated , drew back , came forward again , and at last , to my wonder and confusion , threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication ."
At that I once more stopped .
`` Who are you ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ben Gunn , '' he answered , and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward , like a rusty lock ."
"`` I 'm poor Ben Gunn , I am ; and I have n't spoke with a Christian these three years . ''"
I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing .
"His skin , wherever it was exposed , was burnt by the sun ; even his lips were black , and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face ."
"Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied , he was the chief for raggedness ."
"He was clothed with tatters of old ship 's canvas and old sea-cloth , and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings , brass buttons , bits of stick , and loops of tarry gaskin ."
"About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt , which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement ."
`` Three years ! ''
I cried .
`` Were you shipwrecked ? ''
"`` Nay , mate , '' said he ; `` marooned . ''"
"At all events , though he told her grumpily that she had made a nice fool of herself , and would live to regret it , he said nothing worse , and Mrs. Joe put on her apron and went to work as usual , while Sir Wilfrid Laurier , who had a poor opinion of lighthouses for winter residences , went to sleep in his pet nook behind the woodbox , a thankful dog that he was done with war-weddings ."
"CHAPTER XIX `` THEY SHALL NOT PASS '' One cold grey morning in February Gertrude Oliver wakened with a shiver , slipped into Rilla 's room , and crept in beside her ."
`` Rilla -- I 'm frightened -- frightened as a baby -- I 've had another of my strange dreams .
Something terrible is before us -- I know . ''
`` What was it ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` I was standing again on the veranda steps -- just as I stood in that dream on the night before the lighthouse dance , and in the sky a huge black , menacing thunder cloud rolled up from the east ."
I could see its shadow racing before it and when it enveloped me I shivered with icy cold .
"Then the storm broke -- and it was a dreadful storm -- blinding flash after flash and deafening peal after peal , driving torrents of rain ."
"I turned in panic and tried to run for shelter , and as I did so a man -- a soldier in the uniform of a French army officer -- dashed up the steps and stood beside me on the threshold of the door ."
"His clothes were soaked with blood from a wound in his breast , he seemed spent and exhausted ; but his white face was set and his eyes blazed in his hollow face ."
"` They shall not pass , ' he said , in low , passionate tones which I heard distinctly amid all the turmoil of the storm ."
Then I awakened .
"Rilla , I 'm frightened -- the spring will not bring the Big Push we 've all been hoping for -- instead it is going to bring some dreadful blow to France ."
I am sure of it .
The Germans will try to smash through somewhere . ''
"`` But he told you that they would not pass , '' said Rilla , seriously ."
She never laughed at Gertrude 's dreams as the doctor did .
"`` I do not know if that was prophecy or desperation , Rilla , the horror of that dream holds me yet in an icy grip ."
We shall need all our courage before long . ''
"Dr. Blythe did laugh at the breakfast table -- but he never laughed at Miss Oliver 's dreams again ; for that day brought news of the opening of the Verdun offensive , and thereafter through all the beautiful weeks of spring the Ingleside family , one and all , lived in a trance of dread ."
There were days when they waited in despair for the end as foot by foot the Germans crept nearer and nearer to the grim barrier of desperate France .
"Susan 's deeds were in her spotless kitchen at Ingleside , but her thoughts were on the hills around Verdun ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she would stick her head in at Mrs. Blythe 's door the last thing at night to remark , `` I do hope the French have hung onto the Crow 's Wood today , '' and she woke at dawn to wonder if Dead Man 's Hill -- surely named by some prophet -- was still held by the `` poyloos . ''"
Susan could have drawn a map of the country around Verdun that would have satisfied a chief of staff .
"`` If the Germans capture Verdun the spirit of France will be broken , '' Miss Oliver said bitterly ."
"`` But they will not capture it , '' staunchly said Susan , who could not eat her dinner that day for fear lest they do that very thing ."
"`` In the first place , you dreamed they would not -- you dreamed the very thing the French are saying before they ever said it -- ` they shall not pass . '"
"I declare to you , Miss Oliver , dear , when I read that in the paper , and remembered your dream , I went cold all over with awe ."
It seemed to me like Biblical times when people dreamed things like that quite frequently .
"`` I know -- I know , '' said Gertrude , walking restlessly about ."
"`` I cling to a persistent faith in my dream , too -- but every time bad news comes it fails me ."
"From this on to the Revolution, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nova Scotia became a royal province. Nova Scotia is that way yet, and has to go to Boston for her groceries."
"The year 1692 is noted mostly for the Salem excitement regarding witchcraft. The children of Rev. Mr. Parris were attacked with some peculiar disease which would not yield to the soothing blisters and bleedings administered by the physicians of the old school, and so, not knowing exactly what to do about it, the doctors concluded that they were bewitched. Then it was, of course, the duty of the courts and selectmen to hunt up the witches. This was naturally difficult."
"Fifty-five persons were tortured and twenty were hanged for being witches; which proves that the people of Salem were fully abreast of the Indians in intelligence, and that their gospel privileges had not given their charity and Christian love such a boom as they should have done."
"One can hardly be found now, even in Salem, who believes in witchcraft; though the Cape Cod people, it is said, still spit on their bait. The belief in witchcraft in those days was not confined by any means to the colonists. Sir Matthew Hale of England, one of the most enlightened judges of the mother-country, condemned a number of people for the offence, and is now engaged in doing road-work on the streets of the New Jerusalem as a punishment for these acts done while on the woolsack."
"Blackstone himself, one of the dullest authors ever read by the writer of these lines, yet a skilled jurist, with a marvellous memory regarding Justinian, said that, to deny witchcraft was to deny revelation."
"""Be you a witch?"" asked one of the judges of Massachusetts, according to the records now on file in the State-House at Boston."
"""No, your honor,"" was the reply."
"""Officer,"" said the court, taking a pinch of snuff, ""take her out on the tennis-grounds and pull out her toe-nails with a pair of hot pincers, and then see what she says."""
"It was quite common to examine lady witches in the regular court and then adjourn to the tennis-court. A great many were ducked by order of the court and hanged up by the thumbs, in obedience to the customs of these people who came to America because they were persecuted."
"Human nature is the same even to this day. The writer grew up with an Irishman who believed that when a man got wealthy enough to keep a carriage and coachman he ought to be assassinated and all his goods given to the poor. He now hires a coachman himself, having succeeded in New York city as a policeman; but the man who comes to assassinate him will find it almost impossible to obtain an audience with him."
"If you wish to educate a man to be a successful oppressor, with a genius for introducing new horrors and novelties in pain, oppress him early in life and don't give him any reason for doing so. The idea that ""God is love"" was not popular in those days. The early settlers were so stern even with their own children that if the Indian had not given the forefather something to attract his attention, the boy crop would have been very light."
"Even now the philosopher is led to ask, regarding the boasted freedom of America, why some measures are not taken to put large fly-screens over it."
CHAPTER VI.
THE EPISODE OF THE CHARTER OAK.
The Colonies of Maine and New Hampshire were so closely associated with that of Massachusetts that their history up to 1820 was practically the same.
"Shortly after the landing of the Pilgrims, say two years or thereabouts, Gorges and Mason obtained from England the grant of a large tract lying between the Merrimac and Kennebec Rivers. This patent was afterwards dissolved, Mason taking what is now New Hampshire, and Gorges taking Maine. He afterwards sold the State to Massachusetts for six thousand dollars. The growth of the State may be noticed since that time, for one county cost more than that last November."
"In 1820 Maine was separated from Massachusetts. Maine is noted for being the easternmost State in the Union, and has been utilized by a number of eminent men as a birthplace. White-birch spools for thread, Christmas-trees, and tamarack and spruce-gum are found in great abundance. It is the home of an industrious and peace-loving people."
Bar Harbor is a cool place to go to in summer-time and violate the liquor law of the State.
"The Dutch were first to claim Connecticut. They built a trading-post at Hartford, where they swapped bone collar-buttons with the Indians for beaver-and otter-skins. Traders from Plymouth who went up the river were threatened by the Dutch, but they pressed on and established a post at Windsor."
"In 1635, John Steele led a company ""out west"" to Hartford, and Thomas Hooker, a clergyman, followed with his congregation, driving their stock before them. Hartford thus had quite a boom quite early in the seventeenth century. The Dutch were driven out of the Connecticut Valley, and began to look towards New York."
"Soon after this the Pequod War broke out. These Indians had hoped to form an alliance with the Narragansetts, but Roger Williams prevented this by seeing the Narragansett chief personally. Thus the Puritans had coals of fire heaped on their heads by their gentle pastor, until the odor of burning hair could be detected as far away as New Haven."
"The Pequods were thus compelled to fight alone, and Captain Mason by a coup d'état surrounded their camp before daylight and entered the palisades with the Indian picket, who cried out ""Owanux! Owanux!"""
"meaning ""Englishmen. Englishmen."" Mason and his men killed these Pequods and burned their lodges to the ground. There has never been a prosperous Pequod lodge since. Those who escaped to the forest were shot down like jack-rabbits as they fled, and there has been no Pequoding done since that time."
"The New Haven Colony was founded in 1638 by wealthy church members from abroad. They took the Bible as their standard and statute. They had no other law. Only church members could vote, which was different from the arrangements in New York City in after-years."
"The Connecticut Colony had a regular constitution, said to have been the first written constitution ever adopted by the people, framed for the people by the people. It was at once prosperous, and soon bought out the Saybrook Colony."
"In 1662 a royal charter was obtained which united the two above colonies and guaranteed to the people the rights agreed upon by them. It amounted to a duly-authenticated independence. A quarter of a century afterwards Governor Andros, in his other clothes and a reigning coat of red and gold trimmings, marched into the Assembly and demanded this precious charter."
"His heart was good, but his blood was bad,       Sing Glory hallelujah.""[3]"

CHAPTER VIII.
THE DUTCH AT NEW AMSTERDAM.
"Soon after the discovery of the Hudson, Dutch ships began to visit that region, to traffic in furs with the Indians. Some huts were erected by these traders on Manhattan Island in 1613, and a trading-post was established in 1615. Relics of these times are frequently turned up yet on Broadway while putting in new pipes, or taking out old pipes, or repairing other pipes, or laying plans for yet other pipes, or looking in the earth to see that the original pipes have not been taken away."
"Afterwards the West India Company obtained a grant of New Netherland, and New Amsterdam was fairly started. In 1626, Minuit, the first governor, arrived, and, as we have stated, purchased the entire city of New York of the Indians for twenty-four dollars."
"Then trouble sprang up between the Dutch and the Swedes on the Delaware over the possession of Manhattan, and when the two tribes got to conversing with each other over their rights, using the mother-tongue on both sides, it reminded one of the Chicago wheat market when business is good. The English on the Connecticut also saw that Manhattan was going to boom as soon as the Indians could be got farther west, and that property would be high there."
"Peter Stuyvesant was the last Dutch governor of New York. He was a relative of mine. He disliked the English very much. They annoyed him with their democratic ideas and made his life a perfect hell to him. He would be sorry to see the way our folks have since begun to imitate the English. I can almost see him rising in his grave to note how the Stuyvesants in full cry pursue the affrighted anise-seed bag, or with their coaching outfits go tooling along 'cross country, stopping at the inns on the way and unlimbering their portable bath-tubs to check them with the ""clark."""
"Pete, you did well to die early. You would not have been happy here now."
"While Governor Stuyvesant was in hot water with the English, the Swedes, and the Indians, a fleet anchored in the harbor and demanded the surrender of the place in the name of the Duke of York, who wished to use it for a game preserve. After a hot fight with his council, some of whom were willing even then to submit to English rule and hoped that the fleet might have two or three suits of tweed which by mistake were a fit and therefore useless to the owners, and that they might succeed in swapping furs for these, the governor yielded, and in 1664 New York became a British possession, named as above."
"The English governors, however, were not popular. They were mostly political hacks who were pests at home and banished to New York, where the noise of the streets soon drove them to drink. For nine years this sort of thing went on, until one day a Dutch fleet anchored near the Staten Island brewery and in the evening took the town."
"However, in the year following, peace was restored between England and Holland, and New Amsterdam became New York again, also subject to the Tammany rule."
"Andros was governor for a time, but was a sort of pompous tomtit, with a short breath and a large aquiline opinion of himself. He was one of the arrogant old pie-plants whose growth was fostered by the beetle-bellied administration at home. He went back on board the City of Rome one day, and did not return."
"New York had a gleam of hope for civil freedom under the rule of the Duke of York and the county Democracy, but when the duke became James II. he was just like other people who get a raise of salary, and refused to be privately entertained by the self-made ancestry of the American."
"He was proud and arrogant to a degree. He forbade legislation, and stopped his paper. New York was at this time annexed to the New England Colony, and began keeping the Sabbath so vigorously that the angels had great difficulty in getting at it."
"Nicholson, who was the lieutenant tool of iniquity for Andros, fled with him when democracy got too hot for them. Captain Leisler, supported by Steve Brodie and everything south of the Harlem, but bitterly opposed by the aristocracy, who were distinguished by their ability to use new goods in making their children's clothes, whereas the democracy had to make vests for the boys from the cast-off trousers of their fathers, governed the province until Governor Sloughter arrived."
"Sloughter was another imported Smearkase in official life, and arrested Leisler at the request of an aristocrat who drove a pair of bang-tail horses up and down Nassau Street on pleasant afternoons and was afterwards collector of the port. Having arrested Leisler for treason, the governor was a little timid about executing him, for he had never really killed a man in his life, and he hated the sight of blood; so Leisler's enemies got the governor to take dinner with them, and mixed his rum, so that when he got ready to speak, his remarks were somewhat heterogeneous, and before he went home he had signed a warrant for Leisler's immediate execution."
"When he awoke in the morning at his beautiful home on Whitehall Street, the sun was gayly glinting the choppy waves of Buttermilk Channel, and by his watch, which had run down, he saw that it was one o'clock, but whether it was one o'clock A.M. or P.M. he did not know, nor whether it was next Saturday or Tuesday before last. Oh, how he must have felt!"
"His room was dark, the gas having gone out to get better air. He attempted to rise, but a chill, a throb, a groan, and back he lay hastily on the bed just as it was on the point of escaping him. Suddenly a thought came to him. It was not a great thought, but it was such a thought as comes to those who have been thoughtless. He called for a blackamoor slave from abroad who did chores for him, and ordered a bottle of cooking brandy, then some club soda he had brought from London with him. Next he drank a celery-glass of it, and after that he felt better. He then drank another."
"""Keep out of the way of this bed, Julius,"" he said. ""It is coming around that way again. Step to one side, Julius, please, and let the bed walk around and stretch its legs. I never saw a bed spread itself so,"" he continued, seeming to enjoy his own Lancashire humor. ""All night I seemed to feel a great pain creeping over me, Julius,"" he said, hesitatingly, again filling his celery-glass, ""but I see now that it was a counterpane."""
"Eighty years after that, Sloughter was a corpse."
"We should learn from this not to be too hasty in selecting our birthplaces. Had he been born in America, he might have been alive yet."
"From this on the struggles of the people up to the time of the Revolution were enough to mortify the reader almost to death. I will not go over them again. It was the history of all the other Colonies; poor, proud, with large masses of children clustering about, and Indians lurking in the out-buildings. The mother-country was negligent, and even cruel. Her political offscourings were sent to rule the people. The cranberry-crops soured on the vines, and times were very scarce."
"It was during this period that Captain William Kidd, a New York ship-master and anti-snapper from Mulberry Street, was sent out to overtake and punish a few of the innumerable pirates who then infested the high seas."
"Studying first the character, life, and public services of the immoral pirate, and being perfectly foot-loose, his wife having eloped with her family physician, he determined to take a little whirl at the business himself, hoping thereby to escape the noise and heat of New York and obtain a livelihood while life lasted which would maintain him the remainder of his days unless death overtook him."
"Dropping off at Boston one day to secure a supply of tobacco, he was captured while watching the vast number of street-cars on Washington Street. He was taken to England, where he was tried and ultimately hanged. His sudden and sickening death did much to discourage an American youth of great brilliancy who had up to 1868 intended to be a pirate, but who, stumbling across the ""Life and Times of Captain Kidd, and his Awful Death,"" changed his whole course and became one of the ablest historians of the age in which he lived."
This should teach us to read the papers instead of loaning them to people who do not subscribe.
"“If others have tried it,” said Brother Lustig, “I will try it too.”"
"“Leave it alone,” said the host, “it will cost you your neck.” “It won’t kill me at once,” said Brother Lustig, “just give me the key, and some good food and wine.” So the host gave him the key, and food and wine, and with this Brother Lustig went into the castle, enjoyed his supper, and at length, as he was sleepy, he lay down on the ground, for there was no bed. He soon fell asleep, but during the night was disturbed by a great noise, and when he awoke, he saw nine ugly devils in the room, who had made a circle, and were dancing around him."
"Brother Lustig said, “Well, dance as long as you like, but none of you must come too close.” But the devils pressed continually nearer to him, and almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet. “Stop, you devils’ ghosts,” said he, but they behaved still worse. Then Brother Lustig grew angry, and cried, “Hola! but I will soon make it quiet,”"
"and got the leg of a chair and struck out into the midst of them with it. But nine devils against one soldier were still too many, and when he struck those in front of him, the others seized him behind by the hair, and tore it unmercifully. “Devils’ crew,” cried he, “it is getting too bad, but wait. Into my knapsack, all nine of you!” In an instant they were in it, and then he buckled it up and threw it into a corner. After this all was suddenly quiet, and Brother Lustig lay down again, and slept till it was bright day. Then came the inn-keeper, and the nobleman to whom the castle belonged, to see how he had fared; but when they perceived that he was merry and well they were astonished, and asked, “Have the spirits done you no harm, then?” “The reason why they have not,” answered Brother Lustig, “is because I have got the whole nine of them in my knapsack! You may once more inhabit your castle quite tranquilly, none of them will ever haunt it again.” The nobleman thanked him, made him rich presents, and begged him to remain in his service, and he would provide for him as long as he lived. “No,”"
"replied Brother Lustig, “I am used to wandering about, I will travel farther.” Then he went away, and entered into a smithy, laid the knapsack, which contained the nine devils on the anvil, and asked the smith and his apprentices to strike it. So they smote with their great hammers with all their strength, and the devils uttered howls which were quite pitiable. When he opened the knapsack after this, eight of them were dead, but one which had been lying in a fold of it, was still alive, slipped out, and went back again to hell. Thereupon Brother Lustig travelled a long time about the world, and those who know them can tell many a story about him, but at last he grew old, and thought of his end, so he went to a hermit who was known to be a pious man, and said to him, “I am tired of wandering about, and want now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.” The hermit replied, “There are two roads, one is broad and pleasant, and leads to hell, the other is narrow and rough, and leads to heaven.” “I should be a fool,” thought Brother Lustig, “if I were to take the narrow, rough road.” So he set out and took the broad and pleasant road, and at length came to a great black door, which was the door of Hell. Brother Lustig knocked, and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there. But when he saw Brother Lustig, he was terrified, for he was the very same ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack, and had escaped from it with a black eye. So he pushed the bolt in again as quickly as he could, ran to the devil’s lieutenant, and said, “There is a fellow outside with a knapsack, who wants to come in, but as you value your lives don’t allow him to enter, or he will wish the whole of hell into his knapsack. He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it.” So they called out to Brother Lustig that he was to go away again, for he should not get in there! “If they won’t have me here,” thought he, “I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven, for I must be somewhere.” So he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of Heaven, where he knocked. St. Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper. Brother Lustig recognised him at once, and thought, “Here I find an old friend, I shall get on better.” But St. Peter said, “I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven.” “Let me in, brother; I must get in somewhere; if they would have taken me into Hell, I should not have come here.” “No,” said St."
"Peter, “thou shalt not enter.” “Then if thou wilt not let me in, take thy knapsack back, for I will have nothing at all from thee.” “Give it here, then,” said St. Peter. Then Brother Lustig gave him the knapsack into Heaven through the bars, and St. Peter took it, and hung it beside his seat. Then said Brother Lustig, “And now I wish myself inside my knapsack,” and in a second he was in it, and in Heaven, and St. Peter was forced to let him stay there."
82 Gambling Hansel
"Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and for that reason people never called him anything but Gambling Hansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house and all that he had. Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night. Then Gambling Hansel said, “For my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat.” So the Lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which Gambling Hansel made no objection. Thereupon St. Peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker’s and fetch some bread. So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, “Hansel, do come in.” “Oh,” said he, “do you want to win the three groschen too?” On this they would not let him go. So he went in, and played away the three groschen also. Meanwhile St. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him. When Gambling Hansel came, however, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter, and kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but our Lord already knew that he had lost it in play. St. Peter again gave him three groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more, but fetched them the loaf. Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, “Alack, sir, the casks are all empty!” But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best wine was still there. For a long time he would not believe this, but at length he said, “Well, I will go down, but I know that there is none there.” When he turned the tap, however, lo and behold, the best of wine ran out! So he took it to them, and the two passed the night there. Early next day our Lord told Gambling Hansel that he might beg three favours. The Lord expected that he would ask to go to Heaven; but Gambling Hansel asked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything, for dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree whereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who had climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so. The Lord gave him all that he had asked, and departed with St. Peter."
"And now Gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real earnest, and before long he had gained half the world. Upon this St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on, he will win, and thou lose, the whole world. We must send Death to him.” When Death appeared, Gambling Hansel had just seated himself at the gaming-table, and Death said, “Hansel, come out a while.” But Gambling Hansel said, “Just wait a little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into that tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have something to munch on our way.” Thereupon Death climbed up, but when he wanted to come down again, he could not, and Gambling Hansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one died."
"So St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on. People no longer die; we must go ourselves.” And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down. So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him, “Come down,” and Death took him directly and put an end to him. They went away together and came to the next world, and then Gambling Hansel made straight for the door of Heaven, and knocked at it. “Who is there?” “Gambling Hansel.” “Ah, we will have nothing to do with him! Begone!” So he went to the door of Purgatory, and knocked once more. “Who is there?” “Gambling Hansel.” “Ah, there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him. We do not want to gamble, just go away again.” Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in. There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world."
And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again.
"Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do. And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack. So again St. Peter said, “Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.” And they let him in. But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. Therefore St. Peter once more said, “Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.” So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day."
83 Hans in Luck
"Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, “Master, my time is up; now I should be glad to go back home to my mother; give me my wages.” The master answered, “You have served me faithfully and honestly; as the service was so shall the reward be;” and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home."
"As he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse. “Ah!” said Hans quite loud, “what a fine thing it is to ride! There you sit as on a chair; you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and get on, you don’t know how.”"
"The rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, “Hollo! Hans, why do you go on foot, then?”"
"“I must,” answered he, “for I have this lump to carry home; it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.”"
"“I will tell you what,” said the rider, “we will exchange: I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump.”"
"“With all my heart,” said Hans, “but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it.”"
"The rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up; then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, “If you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, “Jup! Jup!”"
"Hans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free. After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, “Jup! Jup!”"
"The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway. The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him."
"Hans got his limbs together and stood up on his legs again, but he was vexed, and said to the countryman, “It is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one’s neck. Never again will I mount it. Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one’s milk, butter and cheese every day without fail. What would I not give to have such a cow.”"
"“Well,” said the countryman, “if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.” Hans agreed with the greatest delight; the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away."
"Hans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain. “If only I have a morsel of bread—and that can hardly fail me—I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like; if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk. Good heart, what more can I want?”"
"When he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great content ate up what he had with him—his dinner and supper—and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother’s village."
"As it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross. He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst. “I can find a cure for this,” thought Hans; “I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk.” He tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath; but try as he would, not a drop of milk came. And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was."
"By good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig. “What sort of a trick is this?”"
"cried he, and helped the good Hans up. Hans told him what had happened."
"The butcher gave him his flask and said, “Take a drink and refresh yourself. The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old beast; at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher.” “Well, well,” said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, “who would have thought it? Certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home; what meat one has! But I do not care much for beef, it is not juicy enough for me. A young pig like that now is the thing to have, it tastes quite different; and then there are the sausages!”"
"“Hark ye, Hans,” said the butcher, “out of love for you I will exchange, and will let you have the pig for the cow.” “Heaven repay you for your kindness!” said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound from the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his hand."
"Hans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as he wished; if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set right. Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They said good morning to each other, and Hans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such good bargains. The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast. “Just lift her,” added he, and laid hold of her by the wings; “how heavy she is—she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks. Whoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth.” “Yes,” said Hans, as he weighed her in one hand, “she is a good weight, but my pig is no bad one.”"
"The battle of Antietam was a very fierce one, and undecisive, yet it saved Washington from an invasion by the Confederates, who would have done a good deal of trading there, no doubt, entirely on credit, thus injuring business very much and loading down Washington merchants with book accounts, which, added to what they had charged already to members of Congress, would have made times in Washington extremely dull."
"General McClellan, having impressed the country with the idea that he was a good bridge-builder, but a little too dilatory in the matter of carnage, was succeeded by General Burnside."
"President Lincoln had written the Proclamation of Emancipation to the slaves in July, but waited for a victory before publishing it. Bull Run as a victory was not up to his standard; so when Lee was driven from Maryland the document was issued by which all slaves in the United States became free; and, although thirty-one years have passed at this writing, they are still dropping in occasionally from the back districts to inquire about the truth of the report."
CHAPTER XXVII.
"STILL MORE FRATERNAL BLOODSHED, ON PRINCIPLE. OUTING FEATURES DISAPPEAR, AND GIVE PLACE TO STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN COMBATANTS, WHO BEGIN TO MIX THINGS."
"On December 13 the year's business closed with the battle of Fredericksburg, under the management of General Burnside. Twelve thousand Union troops were killed before night mercifully shut down upon the slaughter."
"The Confederates were protected by stone walls and situated upon a commanding height, from which they were able to shoot down the Yankees with perfect sang-froid and deliberation."
"In the midst of all these discouragements, the red brother fetched loose in Minnesota, Iowa, and Dakota, and massacred seven hundred men, women, and children. The outbreak was under the management of Little Crow, and was confined to the Sioux Nation. Thirty-nine of these Indians were hanged on the same scaffold at Mankato, Minnesota, as a result of this wholesale murder."
This execution constitutes one of the green spots in the author's memory. In all lives now and then an oasis is liable to fall. This was oasis enough to last the writer for years.
"In 1863 the Federal army numbered about seven hundred thousand men, and the Confederates about three hundred and fifty thousand. Still it took two more years to close the war."
"It is held now by good judges that the war was prolonged by the jealousy existing between Union commanders who wanted to be President or something else, and that it took so much time for the generals to keep their eyes on caucuses and county papers at home that they fought best when surprised and attacked by the foe."
"General Grant moved again on Vicksburg, and on May 1, defeated Pemberton at Fort Gibson. He also prevented a junction between Joseph E. Johnston and Pemberton, and drove the latter into Vicksburg, securing the stopper so tightly that after forty-seven days the garrison surrendered, July 4."
"This fight cost the Confederates thirty-seven thousand prisoners, ten thousand killed and wounded, and immense quantities of stores. It was a warm time in Vicksburg; a curious man who stuck his hat out for twenty seconds above the ramparts found fifteen bullet-holes in it when he took it down, and when he wore it to church he attracted more attention than the collection."
"The North now began to sit up and take notice. Morning papers began to sell once more, and Grant was the name on every tongue."
"The Mississippi was open to the Gulf, and the Confederacy was practically surrounded."
"Rosecrans would have moved on the enemy, but learned that the foe had several head of cavalry more than he did, also a team of artillery. At this time John Morgan made a raid into Ohio. He surrounded Cincinnati, but did not take it, as he was not keeping house at the time and hated to pay storage on it. He got to Parkersburg, West Virginia, and was captured there with almost his entire force."
On September 19 and 20 occurred the battle of Chickamauga. Longstreet rushed into a breach in the Union line and swept it with a great big besom of wrath with which he had wisely provided himself on starting out. Rosecrans felt mortified when he came to himself and found that his horse had been so unmanageable that he had carried him ten miles from the carnage.
"But the left, under Thomas, held fast its position, and no doubt saved the little band of sixty thousand men which Rosecrans commanded at the time."
"His army now found itself shut up in intrenchments, with Bragg on the hills threatening the Union forces with starvation."
"On November 24-25 a battle near Chattanooga took place, with Grant at the head of the Federal forces. Hooker came to join him from the Army of the Potomac, and Sherman hurried to his standard from Iuka. Thomas made a dash and captured Orchard Knob, and Hooker, on the following day, charged Lookout Mountain."
"This was the most brilliant, perhaps, of Grant's victories. It is known as the ""battle of Missionary Ridge."" Hooker had exceeded his prerogative and kept on after capturing the crest of Lookout Mountain, while Sherman was giving the foe several varieties of fits, from the north, when Grant discovered that before him the line was being weakened in order to help the Confederate flanks. So with Thomas he crossed through the first line and over the rifle-pits, forgot that he had intended to halt and reform, and concluded to wait and reform after the war was over, when he should have more time, and that night along the entire line of heights the camp-fires of the Union army winked at one another in ghoulish glee."
"The army under Bragg was routed, and Bragg resigned his command."
"Burnside, who had been relieved of the command of the Army of the Potomac, was sent to East Tennessee, where the brave but frost-bitten troops of Longstreet shut him up at Knoxville and compelled him to board at the railroad eating-house there."
"Sherman's worn and weary boys were now ordered at once to the relief of Burnside, and Longstreet, getting word of it, made a furious assault on the former, who repulsed him with loss, and he went away from there as Sherman approached from the west."
"Hooker had succeeded Burnside in the command of the Army of the Potomac, and he judged that, as Lee was now left with but sixty thousand men, while the Army of the Potomac contained one hundred thousand who craved out-of-door exercise, he might do well to go and get Lee, returning in the cool of the evening. Lee, however, accomplished the division of his army while concealed in the woods and sent Jackson to fall on Hooker's rear. The close of the fight found Hooker on his old camping-ground opposite Fredericksburg, murmuring to himself, in a dazed sort of way, ""Where am I?"" Lee felt so good over this that he decided to go North and get something to eat. He also decided to get catalogues and price-lists of Philadelphia and New York while there. Threatening Baltimore in order to mislead General Meade, who was now in command of the Federals, Lee struck into Pennsylvania and met with the Union cavalry a little west of Gettysburg on the Chambersburg road. It is said that Gettysburg was not intended by either army as the site for the battle, Lee hoping to avoid a fight, depending as he did on the well-known hospitality of the Pennsylvanians, and Meade intending to have the fight at Pipe Creek, where he had some property."
"July 1-2-3 were the dates of this memorable battle. The first day was rather favorable to Lee, quite a number of Yankee prisoners being taken while they were lost in the crowded streets of Gettysburg."
"The second day was opened by Longstreet, who charged the Union left, and ran across Sickles, who had by mistake formed in the way of Meade's intended line of battle. They outflanked him, but, as they swung around him, Warren met them with a diabolical welcome, which stayed them."
"Sickles found himself on Cemetery Ridge, while the Confederates under Ewell were on Culp's Hill."
"When the Lord, who just then came by, saw that, he was angry, and said, “Henceforth shall the stalks of corn bear no more ears; men are no longer worthy of heavenly gifts.” The by-standers who heard this, were terrified, and fell on their knees and prayed that he would still leave something on the stalks, even if the people were undeserving of it, for the sake of the innocent birds which would otherwise have to starve."
"The Lord, who foresaw their suffering, had pity on them, and granted the request. So the ears were left as they now grow."
195 The Grave-Mound
"A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his fields and gardens. The corn was growing up vigorously and the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit. The grain of the year before still lay in such immense heaps on the floors that the rafters could hardly bear it. Then he went into the stable, where were well-fed oxen, fat cows, and horses bright as looking-glass. At length he went back into his sitting-room, and cast a glance at the iron chest in which his money lay."
"Whilst he was thus standing surveying his riches, all at once there was a loud knock close by him. The knock was not at the door of his room, but at the door of his heart. It opened, and he heard a voice which said to him, “Hast thou done good to thy family with it? Hast thou considered the necessities of the poor? Hast thou shared thy bread with the hungry? Hast thou been contented with what thou hast, or didst thou always desire to have more?” The heart was not slow in answering, “I have been hard and pitiless, and have never shown any kindness to my own family. If a beggar came, I turned away my eyes from him. I have not troubled myself about God, but have thought only of increasing my wealth. If everything which the sky covers had been mine own, I should still not have had enough.”"
"When he was aware of this answer he was greatly alarmed, his knees began to tremble, and he was forced to sit down."
"Then there was another knock, but the knock was at the door of his room. It was his neighbour, a poor man who had a number of children whom he could no longer satisfy with food. “I know,” thought the poor man, “that my neighbour is rich, but he is as hard as he is rich. I don’t believe he will help me, but my children are crying for bread, so I will venture it.” He said to the rich man, “You do not readily give away anything that is yours, but I stand here like one who feels the water rising above his head. My children are starving, lend me four measures* of corn.” The rich man looked at him long, and then the first sunbeam of mercy began to melt away a drop of the ice of greediness. “I will not lend thee four measures,” he answered, “but I will make thee a present of eight, but thou must fulfil one condition.” “What am I to do?” said the poor man. “When I am dead, thou shalt watch for three nights by my grave.” The peasant was disturbed in his mind at this request, but in the need in which he was, he would have consented to anything; he accepted, therefore, and carried the corn home with him."
"It seemed as if the rich man had foreseen what was about to happen, for when three days were gone by, he suddenly dropped down dead. No one knew exactly how it came to pass, but no one grieved for him. When he was buried, the poor man remembered his promise; he would willingly have been released from it, but he thought, “After all, he acted kindly by me. I have fed my hungry children with his corn, and even if that were not the case, where I have once given my promise I must keep it.”"
"At nightfall he went into the churchyard, and seated himself on the grave-mound. Everything was quiet, only the moon appeared above the grave, and frequently an owl flew past and uttered her melancholy cry."
"When the sun rose, the poor man betook himself in safety to his home, and in the same manner the second night passed quietly by. On the evening of the third day he felt a strange uneasiness, it seemed to him that something was about to happen. When he went out he saw, by the churchyard-wall, a man whom he had never seen before. He was no longer young, had scars on his face, and his eyes looked sharply and eagerly around. He was entirely covered with an old cloak, and nothing was visible but his great riding-boots. “What are you looking for here?”"
the peasant asked. “Are you not afraid of the lonely churchyard?”
"“I am looking for nothing,” he answered, “and I am afraid of nothing! I am like the youngster who went forth to learn how to shiver, and had his labour for his pains, but got the King’s daughter to wife and great wealth with her, only I have remained poor. I am nothing but a paid-off soldier, and I mean to pass the night here, because I have no other shelter.” “If you are without fear,” said the peasant, “stay with me, and help me to watch that grave there.”"
"“To keep watch is a soldier’s business,” he replied, “whatever we fall in with here, whether it be good or bad, we will share it between us.”"
"The peasant agreed to this, and they seated themselves on the grave together."
"All was quiet until midnight, when suddenly a shrill whistling was heard in the air, and the two watchers perceived the Evil One standing bodily before them. “Be off, you ragamuffins!” cried he to them, “the man who lies in that grave belongs to me; I want to take him, and if you don’t go away I will wring your necks!” “Sir with the red feather,”"
"said the soldier, “you are not my captain, I have no need to obey you, and I have not yet learned how to fear. Go away, we shall stay sitting here.”"
"The Devil thought to himself, “Money is the best thing with which to get hold of these two vagabonds.” So he began to play a softer tune, and asked quite kindly, if they would not accept a bag of money, and go home with it? “That is worth listening to,” answered the soldier, “but one bag of gold won’t serve us, if you will give as much as will go into one of my boots, we will quit the field for you and go away.”"
"“I have not so much as that about me,” said the Devil, “but I will fetch it. In the neighbouring town lives a money-changer who is a good friend of mine, and will readily advance it to me.” When the Devil had vanished the soldier took his left boot off, and said, “We will soon pull the charcoal-burner’s nose for him, just give me your knife, comrade.” He cut the sole off the boot, and put it in the high grass near the grave on the edge of a hole that was half over-grown. “That will do,” said he; “now the chimney-sweep may come.”"
"They both sat down and waited, and it was not long before the Devil returned with a small bag of gold in his hand. “Just pour it in,” said the soldier, raising up the boot a little, “but that won’t be enough.”"
"The Black One shook out all that was in the bag; the gold fell through, and the boot remained empty. “Stupid Devil,” cried the soldier, “it won’t do! Didn’t I say so at once? Go back again, and bring more.” The Devil shook his head, went, and in an hour’s time came with a much larger bag under his arm. “Now pour it in,” cried the soldier, “but I doubt the boot won’t be full.” The gold clinked as it fell, but the boot remained empty. The Devil looked in himself with his burning eyes, and convinced himself of the truth. “You have shamefully big calves to your legs!” cried he, and made a wry face. “Did you think,” replied the soldier, “that I had a cloven foot like you? Since when have you been so stingy? See that you get more gold together, or our bargain will come to nothing!” The Wicked One went off again. This time he stayed away longer, and when at length he appeared he was panting under the weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders. He emptied it into the boot, which was just as far from being filled as before. He became furious, and was just going to tear the boot out of the soldier’s hands, but at that moment the first ray of the rising sun broke forth from the sky, and the Evil Spirit fled away with loud shrieks. The poor soul was saved."
"The peasant wished to divide the gold, but the soldier said, “Give what falls to my lot to the poor, I will come with thee to thy cottage, and together we will live in rest and peace on what remains, as long as God is pleased to permit.”"
196 Old Rinkrank
"There was once on a time a King who had a daughter, and he caused a glass mountain to be made, and said that whosoever could cross to the other side of it without falling should have his daughter to wife. Then there was one who loved the King’s daughter, and he asked the King if he might have her. “Yes,” said the King; “if you can cross the mountain without falling, you shall have her.” And the princess said she would go over it with him, and would hold him if he were about to fall. So they set out together to go over it, and when they were half way up the princess slipped and fell, and the glass-mountain opened and shut her up inside it, and her betrothed could not see where she had gone, for the mountain closed immediately. Then he wept and lamented much, and the King was miserable too, and had the mountain broken open where she had been lost, and though the would be able to get her out again, but they could not find the place into which she had fallen. Meanwhile the King’s daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave. An old fellow with a very long gray beard came to meet her, and told her that if she would be his servant and do everything he bade her, she might live, if not he would kill her. So she did all he bade her. In the mornings he took his ladder out of his pocket, and set it up against the mountain and climbed to the top by its help, and then he drew up the ladder after him. The princess had to cook his dinner, make his bed, and do all his work, and when he came home again he always brought with him a heap of gold and silver. When she had lived with him for many years, and had grown quite old, he called her Mother Mansrot, and she had to call him Old Rinkrank. Then once when he was out, and she had made his bed and washed his dishes, she shut the doors and windows all fast, and there was one little window through which the light shone in, and this she left open. When Old Rinkrank came home, he knocked at his door, and cried, “Mother Mansrot, open the door for me.”"
"“No,” said she, “Old Rinkrank, I will not open the door for thee.” Then he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Wash my dishes, Mother Mansrot.”"
"“I have washed thy dishes already,” said she. Then again he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Make me my bed, Mother Mansrot.”"
"“I have made thy bed already,” said she. Then again he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Open the door, Mother Mansrot.”"
"Then he ran all round his house, and saw that the little window was open, and thought, “I will look in and see what she can be about, and why she will not open the door for me.” He tried to peep in, but could not get his head through because of his long beard. So he first put his beard through the open window, but just as he had got it through, Mother Mansrot came by and pulled the window down with a cord which she had tied to it, and his beard was shut fast in it. Then he began to cry most piteously, for it hurt him very much, and to entreat her to release him again. But she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain. Then, whether he would or not, he had to tell her where the ladder was. And she fastened a very long ribbon to the window, and then she set up the ladder, and ascended the mountain, and when she was at the top of it she opened the window. She went to her father, and told him all that had happened to her. The King rejoiced greatly, and her betrothed was still there, and they went and dug up the mountain, and found Old Rinkrank inside it with all his gold and silver. Then the King had Old Rinkrank put to death, and took all his gold and silver. The princess married her betrothed, and lived right happily in great magnificence and joy."
197 The Crystal Ball
"There was once an enchantress, who had three sons who loved each other as brothers, but the old woman did not trust them, and thought they wanted to steal her power from her. So she changed the eldest into an eagle, which was forced to dwell in the rocky mountains, and was often seen sweeping in great circles in the sky. The second, she changed into a whale, which lived in the deep sea, and all that was seen of it was that it sometimes spouted up a great jet of water in the air. Each of them only bore his human form for only two hours daily. The third son, who was afraid she might change him into a raging wild beast a bear perhaps, or a wolf, went secretly away. He had heard that a King’s daughter who was bewitched, was imprisoned in the Castle of the Golden Sun, and was waiting for deliverance. Those, however, who tried to free her risked their lives; three-and-twenty youths had already died a miserable death, and now only one other might make the attempt, after which no more must come. And as his heart was without fear, he caught at the idea of seeking out the Castle of the Golden Sun. He had already travelled about for a long time without being able to find it, when he came by chance into a great forest, and did not know the way out of it."
"On November 16, Sherman started, his army moving in four columns, constituting altogether a column of fire by night, and a pillar of cloud and dust by day. Kilpatrick's cavalry scoured the country like a mass meeting of ubiquitous little black Tennessee hornets."
"In five weeks Sherman had marched three hundred miles, had destroyed two railroads, had stormed Fort McAllister, and had captured Savannah."
"On the 5th and 6th of May, 1864, occurred the battle of the Wilderness, near the old battleground of Chancellorsville. No one could describe it, for it was fought in the dense woods, and the two days of useless butchery with not the slightest signs of civilized warfare sickened both armies, and, with no victory for either, they retired to their intrenchments."
"Grant, instead of retreating, however, quietly passed the flank of the Confederates and started for Spottsylvania Court-House, where a battle occurred May 8-12."
"Here the two armies fought five days without any advantage to either. It was at this time that Grant sent his celebrated despatch stating that he ""proposed to fight it out on this line if it took all summer."""
"Finally he sought to turn Lee's right flank. June 8, the battle of Cold Harbor followed this movement. The Union forces were shot down in the mire and brush by Lee's troops, now snugly in out of the wet, behind the Cold Harbor defences. One historian says that in twenty minutes ten thousand Yankee troops were killed; though Badeau, whose accuracy in counting dead has always been perfectly marvellous, admits only seven thousand in all."
"Grant now turned his attention towards Petersburg, but Lee was there before him and intrenched, so the Union army had to intrench. This only postponed the evil day, however."
"Things now shaped themselves into a siege of Richmond, with Petersburg as the first outpost of the besieged capital."
"On the 30th of July, eight thousand pounds of powder were carefully inserted under a Confederate fort and the entire thing hoisted in the air, leaving a huge hole, in which, a few hours afterwards, many a boy in blue met his death, for in the assault which followed the explosion the Union soldiers were mowed down by the concentrated fire of the Confederates. The Federals threw away four thousand lives here."
"On the 18th of August the Weldon Railroad was captured, which was a great advantage to Grant, and, though several efforts were made to recapture it, they were unsuccessful."
"General Early was delegated to threaten Washington and scare the able officers of the army who were stopping there at that time talking politics and abusing Grant. He defeated General Wallace at Monocacy River, and appeared before Fort Stevens, one of the defences of Washington, July 11. Had he whooped right along instead of pausing a day somewhere to get laundry-work done before entering Washington, he would easily have captured the city."
"Reinforcements, however, got there ahead of him, and he had to go back."
"He sent a force of cavalry into Pennsylvania, where they captured Chambersburg and burned it on failure of the town trustees to pay five hundred thousand dollars ransom."
"General Sheridan was placed in charge of the troops here, and defeated Early at Winchester, riding twenty miles in twenty minutes, as per poem."
At Fisher's Hill he was also victorious. He devastated the Valley of the Shenandoah to such a degree that a crow passing the entire length of the valley had to carry his dinner with him.
"It was, however, at the battle of Cedar Creek that Sheridan was twenty miles away, according to historical prose. Why he was twenty miles away, various and conflicting reasons are given, but on his good horse Rienzi he arrived in time to turn defeat and rout into victory and hilarity."
"Rienzi, after the war, died in eleven States. He was a black horse, with a saddle-gall and a flashing eye."
"He passed away at his home in Chicago at last in poverty while waiting for a pension applied for on the grounds of founder and lampers brought on by eating too heartily after the battle and while warm, but in the line of duty."
"The Red River campaign under General Banks was a joint naval and land expedition, resulting in the capture of Fort de Russy, March 14, after which, April 8, the troops marching towards Shreveport in very open order, single file or holding one another's hands and singing ""John Brown's Body,"" were attacked by General Dick Taylor, and if Washington had not been so far away and through a hostile country, Bull Run would have had another rival. But the boys rallied, and next day repulsed the Confederates, after which they returned to New Orleans, where board was more reasonable. General Banks obtained quite a relief at this time: he was relieved of his command."
"August 5, Commodore Farragut captured Mobile, after a neat and attractive naval fight, and on the 24th and 25th of December Commodore Porter and General Butler started out to take Fort Fisher. After two days' bombardment, Butler decided that there were other forts to be had on better terms, and returned. Afterwards General Terry commanded the second expedition, Porter having remained on hand with his vessels to assist. January 15, 1865, the most heroic fighting on both sides resulted, and at last, completely hemmed in, the brave and battered garrison surrendered; but no one who was there need blush to say so, even to-day."
At the South at this time coffee was fifty dollars a pound and gloves were one hundred and fifty dollars a pair. Flour was forty dollars a barrel; but you could get a barrel of currency for less than that.
"Money was plenty, but what was needed seemed to be confidence. Running the blockade was not profitable at that time, since over fifteen hundred head of Confederate vessels were captured during the war."
"The capture of Fort Fisher closed the last port of the South, and left the Confederacy no show with foreign Powers or markets."
"The Alabama was an armed steam-ship, and the most unpleasant feature of the war to the Federal government, especially as she had more sympathy and aid in England than was asked for or expected by the Unionists."
"However, England has since repaid all this loss in various ways. She has put from five to eight million dollars into cattle on the plains of the Northwest, where the skeletons of same may be found bleaching in the summer sun; and I am personally acquainted with six Americans now visiting England who can borrow enough in a year to make up all the losses sustained through the Alabama and other neutral vessels."
"Captain Semmes commanded the Alabama, and off Cherbourg he sent a challenge to the Kearsarge, commanded by Captain Winslow, who accepted it, and so worked his vessel that the Alabama had to move round him in a circle, while he filled her up with iron, lead, copper, tin, German silver, glass, nails, putty, paint, varnishes, and dye-stuff. At the seventh rotation the Alabama ran up the white flag and sunk with a low mellow plunk. The crew was rescued by Captain Winslow and the English yacht Deerhound, the latter taking Semmes and starting for England."
"This matter, however, was settled in after-years."
"The care of the sick, the dying, and the dead in the Union armies was almost entirely under the eye of the merciful and charitable, loyal and loving members of the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, whose work and its memory kept green in the hearts of the survivors and their children will be monument enough for the coming centuries."
"In July, 1864, the debt of the country was two billion dollars and twenty cents. Two dollars and ninety cents in greenbacks would buy a reluctant gold dollar."
"Still, Abraham Lincoln was re-elected against George B. McClellan, the Democratic candidate, who carried only three States. This was endorsement enough for the policy of President Lincoln."
"Cornwallis in this Virginia and Southern trip destroyed ten million dollars' worth of property, and then fortified himself at Yorktown."
"Washington decided to besiege Yorktown, and, making a feint to fool Clinton, set out for that place, visiting Mount Vernon en route after an absence of six and a half years, though only stopping two days."
"Washington was a soldier in the true sense, and, when a lad, was given a little hatchet by his father. George cut down some cherry-trees with this, in order to get the cherries without climbing the trees. One day his father discovered that the trees had been cut down, and spoke of it to the lad."
"""Yes,"" said George, ""I did it with my little hatchet; but I would rather cut down a thousand cherry-trees and tell the truth about it than be punished for it."""
"""Well said, my brave boy!"" exclaimed the happy father as he emptied George's toy bank into his pocket in payment for the trees. ""You took the words right out of my mouth."""
"In speaking of the siege of Yorktown, the historian says, ""The most hearty good will prevailed."" What more could you expect of a siege than that?"
"Cornwallis capitulated October 19. It was the most artistic capitulation he had ever given. The troops were arranged in two lines facing each other, British and American with their allies the French under Rochambeau."
"People came from all over the country who had heard of Cornwallis and his wonderful genius as a capitulator. They came for miles, and brought their lunches with them; but the general, who felt an unnecessary pique towards Washington, refused to take part in the exercises himself, claiming that by the advice of his physicians he would have to remain in his tent, as they feared that he had over-capitulated himself already."
"He therefore sent his sword by General O'Hara, and Washington turned it over to Lincoln, who had been obliged to surrender to the English at Charleston."
"The news reached Philadelphia in the night, and when the watchman cried, ""Past two o'clock, and Cornwallis is taken!"" the people arose and went and prayed and laughed like lunatics, for they regarded the war as virtually ended. The old door-keeper of Congress died of delight. Thanks were returned to Almighty God, and George Washington's nomination was a sure thing."
"England decided that whoever counselled war any further was a public enemy, and Lord North, then prime minister, when he heard of the surrender of Cornwallis through a New York paper, exclaimed, ""Oh, God!"
"it is all over!"""
"Washington now showed his sagacity in quelling the fears of the soldiers regarding their back pay. He was invited to become king, but, having had no practice, and fearing that he might run against a coup d'état or faux pas, he declined, and spoke kindly against taking violent measures."
"In 1783, September 3, a treaty of peace was signed in Paris, and Washington, delivering the most successful farewell address ever penned, retired to Mount Vernon, where he began at once to enrich his farm with the suggestions he had received during his absence, and to calmly take up the life that had been interrupted by the tedious and disagreeable war."
"The country was free and independent, but, oh, how ignorant it was about the science of government! The author does not wish to be personal when he states that the country at that time did not know enough about affairs to carry water for a circus elephant."
"It was heavily in debt, with no power to raise money. New England refused to pay her poll-tax, and a party named Shays directed his hired man to overturn the government; but a felon broke out on his thumb, and before he could put it down the crisis was averted and the country saved."
CHAPTER XIX.
THE FIRST PRESIDENT.
"It now became the duty of the new republic to seek out the man to preside over it, and George Washington seems to have had no rivals. He rather reluctantly left his home at Mount Vernon, where he was engaged in trying the rotation of crops, and solemnly took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States, which had been adopted September 17, 1787. His trip in April, 1789, from Mount Vernon to the seat of government in New York was a simple but beautiful ovation."
"Everybody tried to make it pleasant for him. He was asked at all the towns to build there, and 'most everybody wanted him ""to come and make their house his home."" When he got to the ferry he was not pushed off into the water by commuters, but lived to reach the Old Federal Hall, where he was sworn in."
"In 1791 the seat of government was removed to Philadelphia, where it remained for ten years, after which the United States took advantage of the Homestead Act and located on a tract of land ten miles square, known as the District of Columbia. In 1846 that part of the District lying on the Virginia side of the Potomac was ceded back to the State."
"President Washington did not have to escape from the capital to avoid office-seekers. He could get on a horse at his door and in five minutes be out of sight. He could remain in the forest back of his house until Martha blew the horn signifying that the man who wanted the post-office at Pigback had gone, and then he could return."
"How times have changed with the growth of the republic! Now Pigback has grown so that the name has been changed to Hogback, and the President avails himself of every funeral that he can possibly feel an interest in, to leave the swarm of jobless applicants who come to pester him to death for appointments."
The historian begs leave to say here that the usefulness of the President for the good of his country and the consideration of greater questions will some day be reduced to very little unless he may be able to avoid this effort to please voters who overestimate their greatness.
"It is said that Washington had no library, which accounted for his originality. He was a vestryman in the Episcopal Church; and to see his tall and graceful form as he moved about from pew to pew collecting pence for Home Missions, was a lovely sight."
As a boy he was well behaved and a careful student.
"At one time he was given a hatchet by his father, which"
But what has the historian to do with this morbid wandering in search of truth?
It is the only historical question regarding America not fully settled by this book.
"Nothing more was heard of him till he turned up in a thinking part in ""Rip Van Winkle."""
"Many claims regarding the discovery of various parts of the United States had been previously made. The Cabots had discovered Labrador, the Spaniards the southern part of the United States; the Norsemen had discovered Minneapolis, and Columbus had discovered San Salvador and gone home to meet a ninety-day note due in Palos for the use of the Pinta, which he had hired by the hour."
But we are speaking of the discovery of New York.
"About this time a solitary horseman might have been seen at West 209th Street, clothed in a little brief authority, and looking out to the west as he petulantly spoke in the Tammany dialect, then in the language of the blank-verse Indian. He began, ""Another day of anxiety has passed, and yet we have not been discovered! The Great Spirit tells me in the thunder of the surf and the roaring cataract of the Harlem that within a week we will be discovered for the first time."""
"As he stands there aboard of his horse, one sees that he is a chief in every respect and in life's great drama would naturally occupy the middle of the stage. It was at this moment that Hudson slipped down the river from Albany past Fort Lee, and, dropping a nickel in the slot at 125th Street, weighed his anchor at that place. As soon as he had landed and discovered the city, he was approached by the chief, who said, ""We gates. I am one of the committee to show you our little town. I suppose you have a power of attorney, of course, for discovering us?"""
"""Yes,"" said Hudson. ""As Columbus used to say when he discovered San Salvador, 'I do it by the right vested in me by my sovereigns.' 'That oversizes my pile by a sovereign and a half,' says one of the natives; and so, if you have not heard it, there is a good thing for one of your dinner-speeches here."""
"""Very good,"" said the chief, as they jogged down-town on a swift Sixth Avenue elevated train towards the wigwams on 14th Street, and going at the rate of four miles an hour. ""We do not care especially who discovers us, so long as we hold control of the city organization. How about that, Hank?"""
"""That will be satisfactory,"" said Mr. Hudson, taking a package of imported cheese and eating it, so that they could have the car to themselves."
"""We will take the departments, such as Police, Street-Cleaning, etc., etc., etc., while you and Columbus get your pictures on the currency and have your graves mussed up on anniversaries. We get the two-moment horses and the country châteaux on the Bronx. Sabe?"""
"""That is, you do not care whose portrait is on the currency,"" said Hudson, ""so you get the currency."""
"Said the man, ""That is the sense of the meeting."""
"Thus was New York discovered via Albany and Fort Lee, and five minutes after the two touched glasses, the brim of the schoppin and the Manhattan cocktail tinkled together, and New York was inaugurated."
"Obtaining a gentle and philanthropical gentleman who knew too well the city by gas-light, they saw the town so thoroughly that nearly every building in the morning wore a bright red sign which read"
+           +
|   BEWARE OF PAINT.   |
+           +
"Regarding the question as to who has the right to claim the priority of discovery of New York, I unite with one of the ablest historians now living in stating that I do not know."
"Here and there throughout the work of all great historians who are frank and honest, chapter after chapter of information like this will burst forth upon the eye of the surprised and delighted reader."
"Society at the time of the discovery of the blank-verse Indian of America was crude. Hudson's arrival, of course, among older citizens soon called out those who desired his acquaintance, but he noticed that club life was not what it has since become, especially Indian club life."
He found a nation whose regular job was war and whose religion was the ever-present prayer that they might eat the heart of their enemy plain.
"The Indian High School and Young Ladies' Seminary captured by Columbus, as shown in the pictures of his arrival at home and his presentation to the royal pair one hundred and seventeen years before this, it is said, brought a royal flush to the face of King Ferdie, who had been well brought up."
"This can be readily understood when we remember that the Indian wore at court a court plaster, a parlor-lamp-shade in stormy weather, made of lawn grass, or a surcingle of front teeth."
"They were shown also in all these paintings as graceful and beautiful in figure; but in those days when the Pocahontas girls went barefooted till the age of eighty-nine years, chewed tobacco, kept Lent all winter and then ate a brace of middle-aged men for Easter, the figure must have been affected by this irregularity of meals."
"Unless the Pocahontas of the present day has fallen off sadly in her carriage and beauty, to be saved from death by her, as Smith was, and feel that she therefore had a claim on him, must have given one nervous prostration, paresis, and insomnia."
"The Indian and the white race never really united or amalgamated outside of Canada. The Indian has always held aloof from us, and even as late as Sitting Bull's time that noted cavalry officer said to the author that the white people who simply came over in the Mayflower could not marry into his family on that ground. He wanted to know why they had to come over in the Mayflower."
"""We were here,"" said the aged warrior, as he stole a bacon-rind which I used for lubricating my saw, and ate it thoughtfully, ""we were here and helped Adam 'round up' and brand his animals. We are an old family, and never did manual labor. We are just as poor and proud and indolent as those who are of noble blood. We know we are of noble blood because we have to take sarsaparilla all the time. We claim to come by direct descent from Job, of whom the inspired writer says,"
"""Old Job he was a fine young lad,       Sing Glory hallelujah."
"Calfskin shoes up to the Revolution were the exclusive property of the gentry, and the rest wore cowhide and were extremely glad to mend them themselves. These were greased every week with tallow, and could be worn on either foot with impunity. Rights and lefts were never thought of until after the Revolutionary War, but to-day the American shoe is the most symmetrical, comfortable, and satisfactory shoe made in the world."
"The British shoe is said to be more comfortable. Possibly for a British foot it is so, but for a foot containing no breathing-apparatus or viscera it is somewhat roomy and clumsy."
"Farmers and laborers of those days wore green or red baize in the shape of jackets, and their breeches were made of leather or bed-ticking. Our ancestors dressed plainly, and a man who could not make over two hundred pounds per year was prohibited from dressing up or wearing lace worth over two shillings per yard. It was a pretty sad time for literary men, as they were thus compelled to wear clothing like the common laborers."
"Lord Cornwallis once asked his aidy kong why the American poet always had such an air of listening as if for some expected sound. ""I give it up,"" retorted the aidy kong. ""It is,"" said Lord Cornwallis, as he took a large drink from a jug which he had tied to his saddle, ""because he is trying to see if he cannot hear his bed-ticking."" On the following day he surrendered his army, and went home to spring his bon-mot on George III."
"Yet the laws were very stringent in other respects besides apparel. A man was publicly whipped for killing a fowl on the Sabbath in New England. In order to keep a tavern and sell rum, one had to be of good moral character and possess property, which was a good thing. The names of drunkards were posted up in the alehouses, and the keepers forbidden to sell them liquor. No person under twenty years of age could use tobacco in Connecticut without a physician's order, and no one was allowed to use it more than once a day, and then not within ten miles of any house. It was a common thing to see large picnic-parties going out into the backwoods of Connecticut to smoke."
(Will the reader excuse me a moment while I light up a peculiarly black and redolent pipe?)
"Only the gentry were called Mr. and Mrs. This included the preacher and his wife. A friend of mine who is one of the gentry of this century got on the trail of his ancestry last spring, and traced them back to where they were not allowed to be called Mr. and Mrs., and, fearing he would fetch up in Scotland Yard if he kept on, he slowly unrolled the bottoms of his trousers, got a job on the railroad, and since then his friends are gradually returning to him. He is well pleased now, and looks humbly gratified even if you call him a gent."
"The Scriptures were literally interpreted, and the Old Testament was read every morning, even if the ladies fainted."
"The custom yet noticed sometimes in country churches and festive gatherings of placing the males and females on opposite sides of the room was originated not so much as a punishment to both, as to give the men an opportunity to act together when the red brother felt ill at ease."
"I am glad the red brother does not molest us nowadays, and make us sit apart that way. Keep away, red brother; remain on your reservation, please, so that the pale-face may sit by the loved one and hold her little soft hand during the sermon."
"Church services meant business in those days. People brought their dinners and had a general penitential gorge. Instrumental music was proscribed, as per Amos fifth chapter and twenty-third verse, and the length of prayer was measured by the physical endurance of the performer."
"The preacher often boiled his sermon down to four hours, and the sexton up-ended the hourglass each hour. Boys who went to sleep in church were sand-bagged, and grew up to be border murderers."
"New York people were essentially Dutch. New York gets her Santa Claus, her doughnuts, crullers, cookies, and many of her odors, from the Dutch."
"The New York matron ran to fine linen and a polished door-knocker, while the New England housewife spun linsey-woolsey and knit ""yarn mittens"""
for those she loved.
"Philadelphia was the largest city in the United States, and was noted for its cleanliness and generally sterling qualities of mind and heart, its Sabbath trance and clean white door-steps."
"The Southern Colonies were quite different from those of the North. In place of thickly-settled towns there were large plantations with African villages near the house of the owner. The proprietor was a sort of country squire, living in considerable comfort for those days. He fed and clothed everybody, black or white, who lived on the estate, and waited patiently for the colored people to do his work and keep well, so that they would be more valuable. The colored people were blessed with children at a great rate, so that at this writing, though voteless, they send a large number of members to Congress. This cheers the Southern heart and partially recoups him for his chickens. (See Appendix.)"
"The South then, as now, cured immense quantities of tobacco, while the North tried to cure those who used it."
"Washington was a Virginian. He packed his own flour with his own hands, and it was never inspected. People who knew him said that the only man who ever tried to inspect Washington's flour was buried under a hill of choice watermelons at Mount Vernon."
"Along the James and Rappahannock the vast estates often passed from father to son according to the law of entail, and such a thing as a poor man ""prior to the war"" must have been unknown."
"Education, however, flourished more at the North, owing partly to the fact that the people lived more in communities. Governor Berkeley of Virginia was opposed to free schools from the start, and said, ""I thank God there are no free schools nor printing-presses here, and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years."" His prayer has been answered."
CHAPTER XIV.
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
William Pitt was partly to blame for the Revolutionary War. He claimed that the Colonists ought not to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail except by permission of Parliament.
"It was already hard enough to be a colonist, without the privilege of expressing one's self even to an Indian without being fined. But when we pause to think that England seemed to demand that the colonist should take the long wet walk to Liverpool during a busy season of the year to get his horse shod, we say at once that P. Henry was right when he exclaimed that the war was inevitable and moved that permission be granted for it to come."
"Then came the Stamp Act, making almost everything illegal that was not written on stamp paper furnished by the maternal country."
"John Adams, Patrick Henry, and John Otis made speeches regarding the situation. Bells were tolled, and fasting and prayer marked the first of November, the day for the law to go into effect."
"These things alarmed England for the time, and the Stamp Act was repealed; but the king, who had been pretty free with his money and had entertained a good deal, began to look out for a chance to tax the Colonists, and ordered his Exchequer Board to attend to it."
"Patrick Henry got excited, and said in an early speech, ""Cæsar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third  "" Here he paused and took a long swig of pure water, and added, looking at the newspaper reporters, ""If this be treason, make the most of it."" He also said that George the Third might profit by their example. A good many would like to know what he started out to say, but it is too hard to determine."
"hopefulness, vigor and growth of Protestant Christianity in these"
strenuous latter days.
[Sidenote: The Little Doll that Owns a Large Carriage.]
But we were soon to learn that the Roman Catholics did not think of the
infant Christ as lacking in power of a certain sort; on the contrary
they ascribe miraculous agency even to an image of the divine babe. On
"the afternoon of December 29th, as two of our party were returning to"
"our hotel, they passed at the foot of the Capitoline Hill a carriage,"
"out of the window of which hung a ribbon or sash of cloth of gold, and"
"they were not a little astonished to observe that, as this carriage"
"rolled along, people knelt reverently before it on the street. Inside"
they saw two bareheaded men holding a child on a pillow with a wealth
of lace about it. They thought perhaps it was the royal carriage with
"the baby princess, but they could not imagine why _men_ should be"
"nursing the baby, as that is usually the employment of women, nor why"
"the people should kneel so reverently before the young princess, a"
"thing which they never did even for the king himself. The fact is that,"
as they learned on the following afternoon when visiting the Church of
"Ara Coeli, on the Capitoline Hill, the carriage in question belonged to"
"a far more important personage in Rome than any princess, though that"
"personage was not even a living baby, but only a doll. It was the coach"
of the famous Bambino--_Il Santissimo Bambino_--which with its dress
"of gold and silver tissue and its magnificent diamonds, emeralds and"
"rubies, is the chief attraction of this church."
[Illustration: THE BAMBINO.]
[Sidenote: The Wealth and Power of the Miraculous Bambino.]
"Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his book on _The Roman Catholic Church in"
"suddenly turned back, with a quick warning cry to her cavalcade. The"
"donkey instantly stood still, patient amid its fagots as an image in a"
"church. The goats scattered like water poured on flat ground, and began"
"to crop stray blades of grass, invisible to any eyes but their own, amid"
wastes of cracked earth and deserts of grey water-worn pebbles.
"As she looked back, Sergeant Cardono was disappearing up among the"
"tumbled foot-hills and dry beds of winter torrents, which render the"
"lower spurs of the Guadarrama such a puzzle to the stranger, and such a"
paradise for the smuggler and _guerrillero_. In another moment he had
disappeared. With a long quiet sigh La Giralda stole back to the
"farmhouse. In spite of her race, and heathenish lack of creed, the spark"
of humanity was far from dead in her bosom. The thought of the open eyes
"of the little girl, which gazed even in death with fixed rapture upon"
"her wooden treasure, remained with her."
"""The woman is as old as I--she can bide her time!"" she muttered to"
"herself. ""But the child--these arms are not yet so shrunken that they"
"cannot dig up a little earth to lay the babe thereunder."""
"And at the chamber door La Giralda paused. Like her people, she was"
neither a good nor yet a bad Catholic. Consciously or unconsciously she
"held a more ancient faith, though she worshipped at no shrine, told no"
"beads, and uttered no prayers."
"""They have not been long dead,"" she said to herself, as she entered;"
"""the window is open and the air is sweet. Yet the plague, which snatches"
"away the young and strong, may look askance at old Giralda's hold on"
"life, which at the best is no stronger than the strength of a"
"basting-thread!"""
"Having said these words she advanced to the low trundle-bed, and,"
interest in normal stories is difficult to rouse. I will not here dwell
"on the deleterious effects of over dramatic stimulation, which has been"
"known to lead to crime, since I am keener to prevent the telling of too"
many sensational stories than to suggest a cure when the mischief is
done. Kate Douglas Wiggin has said:
"“Let us be realistic, by all means, but beware, O Story-teller, of"
being too realistic. Avoid the shuddering tale of ‘the wicked boy who
"stoned the birds,’ lest some hearer should be inspired to try the"
dreadful experiment and see if it really does kill.”
"I must emphasise the fact, however, that it is only the excess of"
this dramatic element which I deplore. A certain amount of excitement
is necessary; but this question belongs to the positive side of the
"subject, and I shall deal with it later on."
V.--_Stories presenting matters quite outside the plane of the child_
"(unless they are wrapped in mystery, which is of great educational"
value).
The element I wish to eliminate is the one which would make children
world-wise and old before their time.
A small American child who had entertained a guest in her mother's
"absence, when questioned as to whether she had shown all the"
"hospitality the mother would have considered necessary, said: “Oh! yes."
And I talked to her in the kind of ‘dressy’ tone _you_ use on your ‘At
Home’ days.”
"On one occasion I was lecturing in the town of Cleveland, and was to"
"stay in the house of a lady whom I had met only once, in New York, but"
with true American hospitality she had begged me to make her house my
"Now, Maung Kan's wife had born to him twin sons. They were born at"
"Okshitgon shortly before their parents had to run away, and they were"
"named, the eldest Maung Gyi, which is Brother Big-fellow, and the"
"younger Maung Ngè, which means Brother Little-fellow. These lads grew up"
"at Kabyu, and soon learned to talk; and as they grew up their parents"
"were surprised to hear them calling to each other at play, and calling"
"each other, not Maung Gyi and Maung Ngè, but Maung San Nyein and Ma"
"Gywin. The latter is a woman's name, and the parents remembered that"
these were the names of the man and wife who had died in Okshitgon about
the time the children were born.
So the parents thought that the souls of the man and wife had entered
"into the children, and they took them to Okshitgon to try them. The"
children knew everything in Okshitgon; they knew the roads and the
"houses and the people, and they recognised the clothes they used to wear"
"in a former life; there was no doubt about it. One of them, the younger,"
"remembered, too, how she had borrowed two rupees once of a woman, Ma"
"Thet, unknown to her husband, and left the debt unpaid. Ma Thet was"
"still living, and so they asked her, and she recollected that it was"
true she had lent the money long ago.
Shortly afterwards I saw these two children. They are now just over six
"years old. The elder, into whom the soul of the man entered, is a fat,"
"chubby little fellow, but the younger twin is smaller, and has a curious"
"dreamy look in his face, more like a girl than a boy. They told me much"
about their former lives. After they died they said they lived for some
"time without a body at all, wandering in the air and hiding in the"
"trees. This was for their sins. Then, after some months, they were born"
"again as twin boys. 'It used,' said the elder boy, 'to be so clear, I"
"could remember everything; but it is getting duller and duller, and I"
cannot now remember as I used to do.'
"""Bien, m'sieur,"" answered the woman, disappearing and closing the door"
after her.
My object in dismissing her was to make a thorough search of the
"apartment, in order to discover whether any of Yolande's private"
possessions were there.  She had been denounced by Kaye and Anderson as
"a spy, and it occurred to me that I might possibly discover the truth."
But she was dead.  The painful fact seemed absolutely incredible.
"The room was not a large one, but well furnished, with considerable"
"taste and elegance.  There was the broad, silk-covered couch, upon which"
Yolande had sat in the full possession of health and spirits only a
"couple of hours before; the skin rug, upon which her tiny foot had been"
"stretched so coquettishly; the small table, by which she had stood"
supporting herself after I had made the fatal announcement that Wolf was
in Paris.
As I stood there the whole of that strangely dramatic scene occurred to
me.  Yet she was dead--dead!  She had died with her secret in her heart.
"At any moment Dick Deane might arrive, but I desired to be the first to"
"make an examination of the room, and with that object crossed to the"
"little escritoire of inlaid olive-wood, one of those rather gimcrack"
pieces of furniture manufactured along the Ligurian coast for
unsuspecting winter visitors.  It was the only piece of incongruous
"furniture in the room, all the rest being genuine Louis Quatorze."
"One or two letters bearing conspicuous coats-of-arms were lying there,"
but all were notes of a private nature from one or other of her friends.
"One was an invitation to Vichy from the Baronne Deland, wife of the"
"great Paris financier; another, signed ""Rose,"" spoke of the gaiety of"
Cairo and the dances at Shepheard's during the past winter; while a

And so I first saw the great Gustavus Adolphus. It was said that he
"would at times fall into fits of Berserk rage, and that in the field"
"he was another man, keen as his sword, swift as fire, pitiless to"
"those who flinched, among the foremost in the charge, a very"
thunderbolt of war. But as I saw him taking papers from women's hands
"at the end of the Burg Strasse, he had rather the air of a quiet,"
"worthy prince--of Coburg or Darmstadt, it might be,--no dresser and no"
"brawler; nor would any one, to see him then, have thought that this"
was the lion of the north who had dashed the pride of Pappenheim and
flung aside the firebrands of the south. Or that even now he had on
his shoulders the burden of two great nations and the fate of a
million of men.
CHAPTER XXVI.
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.
After this it fared with us as it fares at last with the driftwood
that chance or the woodman's axe has given to a forest stream in
Heritzburg. After rippling over the shallows and shooting giddily down
"slopes--or perchance lying cooped for days in some dark bend, until"
the splash of the otter or the spring freshet has sent it dancing on
in sunshine and shadow--it reaches at last the Werra. It floats out on
"the bosom of the great stream, and no longer tossed and chafed by each"
"tiny pebble, feels the force of wind and stream--the great forces of"
"the world. The banks recede from sight, and one of a million atoms, it"
"is borne on gently and irresistibly, whither it does not know. So it"
was with us. From the day we fell in with Count Leuchtenstein and set
"this gift, he replied: “I wept with the man, so I feel I ought to _do_"
something for him.”
CHAPTER V.
ELEMENTS TO SEEK IN CHOICE OF MATERIAL.
IN “The Choice of Books” Frederic Harrison has said: “The most useful
"help to reading is to know what we shall _not_ read, ... what we"
shall keep from that small cleared spot in the overgrown jungle of
information which we can call our ordered patch of fruit-bearing
knowledge.”[24]
"Now, the same statement applies to our stories, and, having busied"
"myself, during the last chapter, with “clearing my small spot” by"
"cutting away a mass of unfruitful growth, I am now going to suggest"
what would be the best kind of seed to sow in the patch which I have
“reclaimed from the Jungle.”
"Again I repeat that I have no wish to be dogmatic, and that in offering"
"suggestions as to the stories to be told, I am only catering for a"
group of normal school-children. My list of subjects does not pretend
"to cover the whole ground of children's needs, and just as I exclude"
the abnormal or unusual child from the scope of my warning in subjects
"to avoid, so do I also exclude that child from the limitation in choice"
"of subjects to be sought, because you can offer almost any subject to"
"the unusual child, especially if you stand in close relation to him and"
"know his powers of apprehension. In this matter, _age_ has very little"
"their independence (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 375, 376; Geijer, pp."
"50, 81, 89, 97, 103), so that they ultimately enabled Gustavus Vasa"
to throw off the Danish yoke. Yet they had at first refused to
"recognise him, being satisfied with their own liberties; and"
"afterwards they gave him much serious trouble (Otté, _Scandinavian"
"History_, 1874, pp. 228, 235; Geijer, pp. 109, 112, 115, 116, 118,"
"120-24). Slavery, too, was definitely abolished in Sweden as early"
"as 1335 (Geijer, pp. 57, 86; Crichton and Wheaton, i, 316, 333). As"
"regards the regal power, the once dominant theory that the Swedish"
"kings in the thirteenth century obtained a grant of all the mines,"
"and of the province of the four great lakes (Crichton and Wheaton,"
"i, 332), appears to be an entire delusion (Geijer, pp. 51, 52)."
Such claims were first enforced by Gustavus Vasa (_id._ p. 129). As
"regards the clergy, they appear from the first, _quâ_ churchmen, to"
"have been kept in check by the nobles, who kept the great Church"
"offices largely in the hands of their own order (Geijer, p. 109),"
though Magnus Ladulas strove to strengthen the Church in his own
interest (_id._ pp. 52-53). Thus the nobles became specially
"powerful (_id._ pp. 50, 56, 108); and when in the fifteenth century"
"Sweden was subject to Denmark, they specially resented the"
"sacerdotal tyranny (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 356)."
"In Sweden, as in the other Scandinavian States, however, physical strife"
and mental stagnation were the ruling conditions. Down till the
"sixteenth century her history is pronounced ""a wretched detail of civil"
"wars, insurrections, and revolutions, arising principally from the"
"jealousies subsisting between the kings and the people, the one striving"
"to augment their power, the other to maintain their independence.""[670]"
"The same may be said of the sister kingdoms, all alike being torn and"
drained by innumerable strifes of faction and wars with each other. The
occasional forcible and dynastic unions of crowns came to nothing; and
"the Union of Calmar (1397), an attempt to confederate the three kingdoms"

ASIA MINOR.
The first Oriental religion adopted by the Romans was that of the goddess
"of Phrygia, whom the people of Pessinus and Mount Ida worshiped, and who"
received the name of _Magna Mater deum Idea_ in the Occident. Its history
"in Italy covers six centuries, and we can trace each phase of the"
transformation that changed it in the course of time from a collection of
very primitive nature beliefs into a system of spiritualized mysteries used
by some as a weapon against Christianity. We shall now endeavor to outline
the successive phases of that slow metamorphosis.
This religion is the only one whose success in the Latin world was caused
"originally by a mere chance circumstance. In 205 B. C, when Hannibal,"
"vanquished but still threatening, made his last stand in the mountains of"
"Bruttium, repeated torrents of stones frightened the Roman people. When the"
books were officially consulted in regard to this prodigy they promised
that the enemy would be driven from Italy if the Great Mother of Ida could
be brought to Rome. Nobody but the Sibyls themselves had the power of
averting the evils prophesied by them. They had come to Italy from Asia
"Minor, and in this critical situation their sacred poem recommended the"
practice of their native religion as a remedy. In token of his {47}
"friendship, King Attalus presented the ambassadors of the senate with the"
"black aerolite, supposed to be the abode of the goddess, that this ruler"
had shortly before transferred from Pessinus to Pergamum. According to the
mandate of the oracle the stone was received at Ostia by the best citizen
"of the land, an honor accorded to Scipio Nasica--and carried by the most"
"Brand had been to Jupiter on four different trips; and, as he walked"
"toward his quarters from Stone's office, he reviewed what he had"
learned on those trips.
"Jupiter, as he knew it, was a vast globe of vague horror and sharp"
contrasts.
"Distant from the sun as it was, it received little solar heat. But,"
"with so great a mass, it had cooled off much more slowly than any of"
"the other planets known, and had immense internal heat. This meant"
that the air--which closely approximated Earth's air in density--was
"cool a few hundred yards up from the surface of the planet, and dankly"
"hot close to the ground. The result, as the cold air constantly sank"
"into the warm, was a thick steamy blanket of fog that covered"
everything perpetually.
"Because of the recent cooling, life was not far advanced on Jupiter."
Too short a time ago the sphere had been but a blazing mass. Tropical
"marshes prevailed, crisscrossed by mighty rivers at warmer than blood"
"heat. Giant, hideous fernlike growths crowded one another in an"
"everlasting jungle. And among the distorted trees, from the blanket of"
"soft white fog that hid all from sight, could be heard constantly an"
ear-splitting chorus of screams and bellows and whistling snarls. It
made the blood run cold just to listen--and to speculate on what
gigantic but tiny-brained monsters made them.
"Now and then, when Brand had been flying dangerously low over the"
"surface, a wind had risen strong enough to dispel the fog banks for an"
"instant; and he had caught a flash of Jovian life. Just a flash, for"
"example, of a monstrous lizard-like thing too great to support its own"
"bulk: or a creature all neck and tail, with ridges of scale on its"
Majesty and His Majesty's ally.

Part VI.--OFFENCES.
"economic principle, that is of the world of nature, of feeling, of"
"passion, as a positive grade of the spiritual process, will probably"
"be counted as Croce's greatest achievement, by those who shall be able"
to look back on his work with an ampler perspective. It is through
"it that his philosophy of the spirit, and in this philosophy, the"
"consciousness of our day, has taken possession of that other world, of"
"that persistent transcendance, which we call nature. In this direction"
"lies, undoubtedly, the future course of the thought of an age, to"
"which, in this afterglow of a great conflagration, all problems seem to"
"gather into the one of the subjection to its better and higher self,"
"the utilization for its purer purposes, of its own cumbersome economic"
"body, of its nature and of its passions."

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
"Croce's Complete Works form a collection of twenty-eight volumes, in"
"four distinct series, published by Laterza e Figli, of Bari, who are"
"also the publishers of _La Critica_, and of the following collections"
"initiated or directed by Croce: _Scrittori d'Italia, Scrittori"
"Stranieri, Classici della Filosofia Moderna._"
"We give here a full list of the _Opere di Benedetto Croce_, adding to"
"the title of each volume the year of the last available edition, the"
years of their composition having already been indicated in the text:
"outline of the history of the Lake Superior region, the"
"deformations which it suffered, their relative severity, the times"
"when they occurred, and the erosion cycles marked by the"
successive unconformities.
OTHER PRE-CAMBRIAN AREAS IN NORTH AMERICA. Pre-Cambrian rocks are
"exposed in various parts of the continent, usually by the erosion"
of mountain ranges in which their strata were infolded. Large
areas occur in the maritime provinces of Canada. The core of the
"Green Mountains of Vermont is pre-Cambrian, and rocks of these"
systems occur in scattered patches in western Massachusetts. Here
belong also the oldest rocks of the Highlands of the Hudson and of
"New Jersey. The Adirondack region, an outlier of the Laurentian"
"region, exposes pre-Cambrian rocks, which have been metamorphosed"
and tilted by the intrusion of a great boss of igneous rock out of
which the central peaks are carved. The core of the Blue Ridge and
probably much of the Piedmont Belt are of this age. In the Black
Hills the irruption of an immense mass of granite has caused or
accompanied the upheaval of pre-Cambrian strata and metamorphosed
"them by heat and pressure into gneisses, schists, quartzites, and"
slates. In most of these mountainous regions the lowest strata are
"profoundly changed by metamorphism, and they can be assigned to"
the pre-Cambrian only where they are clearly overlain
unconformably by formations proved to be Cambrian by their
"fossils. In the Belt Mountains of Montana, however, the Cambrian"
"is underlain by Algonkian sediments twelve thousand feet thick,"
and but little altered.
MINERAL WEALTH OF THE PRE-CAMBRIAN ROCKS. The pre-Cambrian rocks
"are of very great economic importance, because of their extensive"
metamorphism and the enormous masses of igneous rock which they
involve. In many parts of the country they are the source of
"stooping, as I fancied, and more than once standing to listen, as if"
"he were not satisfied. I sank down still lower, and he passed me"
"without notice, and went on, and I heard his footsteps slowly"
retreating until they quite died away.
"But in a moment, before I had risen to my full height, I heard them"
"again. He came back, and passed me, breathing quickly and loudly. I"
wondered if he had detected our party and was going to give the alarm;
"and I stood up, anxious and uncertain, at a loss whether I should"
follow him or run back.
"At that instant a fierce yell broke the silence, and rent the darkness"
"as a flash of lightning might rend it. It came from behind me, from"
the brow of the hill; and I started as if I had been struck. Hard on
"it a volley of shouts and screams flared up in the same direction, and"
"while my heart stood still with terror and fear of what had happened,"
"I heard the thunder of hoofs come down the road, with a clatter of"
blows and whips. They were coming headlong--my lady and the rest. The
"danger was behind them, then. I had just time to turn and get to the"
side of the road before they were on me at a gallop.
"I could not see who was who in the darkness, but I caught at the"
"nearest stirrup, and, narrowly escaping being ridden down, ran on"
"beside the rider. The horses, spurred down the slope, had gained such"
an impetus that it was all I could do to keep up. I had no breath to
"ask questions, nor state my fear that there was danger ahead also. I"
had to stride like a giant to keep my legs and run.
Some one else was less lucky. We had not swept fifty yards from where
"I joined them, when a dark figure showed for a moment in the road"
before us. I saw it; it seemed to hang and hesitate. The next instant
"it was among us. I heard a shrill scream, a heavy fall, and we were"
"Huge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed"
above the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in
"the Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,"
"indicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair"
on a boom.
"Although, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information"
"and questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not"
resist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great
"cryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its"
own controls--the permissible ones--and could doubtless improvise a
hearing apparatus if it wanted to.
For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and
Maniacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.
This was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human
"brain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the"
rims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney
Island shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had
given instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This
"was the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased"
human judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.
_This was the machine that really thought--a million-plus!_
This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy
professional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the
"machine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push, _had_"
"built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and"
"girl-fondness, ""Maizie."""
"Gazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord"
"And, when they had read, they all looked at him again, not as they had"
"looked before, but, it seemed to him, with a curious wonder, half"
"mocking, half pitying, as one looks at a man who does not know the thing"
that touches him most nearly. He glanced up at the galleries: there too
was the ubiquitous sheet; the Chief Justice and the President of the
"Legislative Council were cheek by jowl over it, and it fell lightly from"
"Lady Eynesford's slim fingers, to be caught at eagerly by Eleanor"
Scaife.
"""What is it?"" he whispered impatiently to Norburn; but his absorbed"
"disciple only bewilderedly murmured ""What?"" and the Premier could not"
pause to tell him.
Now followed what Sir Robert maintained was the greatest feat of oratory
"he had ever witnessed. Gathering his wandering wits together, Medland"
"plunged again whole-heartedly into his speech, and slowly, gradually,"
"almost, it seemed, step by step and man by man, he won back the thoughts"
of his audience. He wrestled with that strange paper rival and overthrew
it. Man after man dropped it; its course was stayed; it fell underfoot
"or fluttered idly down the gangways. The nods ceased, the whispers were"
"hushed, the stir fell and rose no more. Once again he had them, and,"
"inspired by that knowledge, the surest spur of eloquence, there rang"
"from his lips the last burning words, the picture of the vision that"
"ruled his life, the hope for the days that he might not see."
"""Believe!"" he cried, in passionate entreaty, ""believe, and your sons"
"shall surely see!"""
"He sank in his seat, and the last echo of his resonant voice died away."
"First came silence, and then a thunder of applause. Men stood up and"
"waved what they had in their hands, hats or handkerchiefs or papers;"
"women sat with their eyes still on him, or, with a gasp, leant back and"
"good-bye to a caller, when Harold sauntered in, perfectly turned out as"
"usual, cool, suave, smiling that peculiar little half-smile that women"
found so fascinating.
"Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far; that had been the"
"trouble all along. No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and"
"such lips; it was uncanny. As for his mother, his sisters, and the"
"servants, it was not too much to say they made a young god of him; they"
"worshipped Harold, they forgave him everything; and he had needed some"
forgiving ever since the time when he was thirteen and he had stolen
"his mother’s purse, taken the money, and hidden the purse in the cook’s"
bedroom. Old Mr. Neave struck sharply with his stick upon the pavement
"edge. But it wasn’t only his family who spoiled Harold, he reflected,"
"it was everybody; he had only to look and to smile, and down they went"
before him. So perhaps it wasn’t to be wondered at that he expected the
"office to carry on the tradition. H’m, h’m! But it couldn’t be done. No"
"business—not even a successful, established, big paying concern—could"
be played with. A man had either to put his whole heart and soul into
"it, or it went all to pieces before his eyes...."
And then Charlotte and the girls were always at him to make the whole
"thing over to Harold, to retire, and to spend his time enjoying"
himself. Enjoying himself! Old Mr. Neave stopped dead under a group of
ancient cabbage palms outside the Government buildings! Enjoying
himself! The wind of evening shook the dark leaves to a thin airy
"cackle. Sitting at home, twiddling his thumbs, conscious all the while"
"that his life’s work was slipping away, dissolving, disappearing"
"through Harold’s fine fingers, while Harold smiled...."
"“Why will you be so unreasonable, father? There’s absolutely no need"
for you to go to the office. It only makes it very awkward for us when
people persist in saying how tired you’re looking. Here’s this huge
"The Girl smiled at the emphasis on the last word, for she knew that it"
"referred to her. Furthermore, she had divined pretty well what had been"
"his thoughts concerning his old life; but, being essentially a woman of"
"action and not words, she said nothing."
A moment or so later he asked her to read to him. The Girl looked as she
might have looked if he had asked her to go to the moon.
"Notwithstanding, she got up and, presently, returned with a lot of old"
"school-books, which she solemnly handed over for his inspection."
The invalid smiled at the look of earnestness on the Girl's face.
"""Not these?"" he gently inquired. ""Where is the Dante you were telling me"
"about?"""
Once more the Girl went over to the book-shelf; when she came back she
"handed him a volume, which he glanced over carefully before showing her"
the place where he wished her to begin to read to him.
At first the Girl was embarrassed and stumbled badly. But on seeing that
he seemed not to notice it she gained courage and acquitted herself
"creditably, at least, so she flattered herself, for she could detect, as"
"she looked up from time to time, no expression other than pleasure on"
"his face. It may be surmised, though, that Johnson had not merely chosen"
"a page at random; on the contrary, when the book was in his hand he had"
"quickly found the lines which the Girl had, so to say, paraphrased, and"
"he was intensely curious to see how they would appeal to her. But now,"
"apparently, she saw nothing in the least amusing in them, nor in other"
"passages fully as sentimental. In fact, no comment of any kind was"
"forthcoming from her--though Johnson was looking for it and, to tell the"
"truth, was somewhat disappointed--when she read that Dante had probably"
never spoken more than twice to Beatrice and his passion had no other
"form of line or mezzotint effects,[41] photogravure,[41] and the yet"
"more recent photo-intaglio process known as rotogravure,[41] and"
photo-mezzotint.
DIE CUTTING
"Dies,[41] generally required for stamping the covers of books in gilt"
"letters and designs, are cut in brass by hand or by finely adjusted"
"routing-machines, the design being drawn upon the metal by an artist,"
or transferred to it by photography. In the case of very elaborate
"designs, the dies are first etched by nitric acid or iron perchloride,"
"and the more open or less intricate spaces then deepened by hand, or by"
the routing-machines.
THE PAPER
"In selecting the paper for the book, the publisher must consider the"
"surface required by his plates, the weight necessary to give a proper"
"bulk in proportion to the size of his volume, and the quality as"
"regulated by the price. The average book, with no text illustrations,"
"is printed on wove[42] paper of antique finish, which is a fairly rough"
"surface, giving a maximum bulk. A 12mo[42] book should bulk 1 to 1⅛"
"inches, a 10mo[42] book, 1⅛ to 1¼ inches. If the book runs more than an"
"average length, a medium-or a plate-finish paper may be used, and the"
weight per ream is regulated by the number of pages in each volume and
the bulk required.
"Lineplates print satisfactorily on medium-finish paper, and even"
on antique-finish if the lines are not too fine. Halftones require
"English-finish,[42] super-calendered[42] or coated[42] paper."
"was a reinforcement of foot from Fulda, rank upon rank of shambling"
"men trailing long pikes, and footsore, and parched as they were,"
getting over the ground in a wonderful fashion. After them would come
"a long string of waggons, bearing corn, and hay, and malt, and wines;"
"all lurching slowly forward, slowly southward; often delayed, for"
"every quarter of a mile a horse fell or an axle broke, yet getting"
forward.
"And then the most wonderful sight of all, a regiment of Swedish horse"
"passed us, marching from Erfurt. All their horses were grey, and all"
"their head-pieces, backs and breasts of black metal, matched one"
another. As they came on through the dust with a tramp which shook the
"ground, they sang, company by company, to the music of drums and"
"trumpets, a hymn, 'Versage nicht, du Häuflein klein!' Behind them a"
"line of light waggons carried their wives and children, also singing."
"And so they went by us, eight hundred swords, and I thought it a"
marvel I should never see beaten.
"When they were gone out of sight, there were still droves of horses"
"and mighty flocks of sheep to come, and cargoes of pork, and more foot"
and horse and guns. Some companies wore buff coats and small steel
"caps, and carried arquebuses; and some marched smothered in huge"
headpieces with backs and breasts to match. And besides all the
things I have mentioned and the crowds of sutlers and horse-boys that
"went with them, there were munition waggons closely guarded, and"
"pack-horses laden with powder, and always and always waggons of corn"
and hay.
"And all hurrying, jostling, crawling southwards. It seemed to me that"
the world was marching southwards; that if we went on we must fall in
at the end of this with every one we knew. And the thought comforted
me.
"Netherlands, drawing thither the unearned revenues of the Americas, and"
"still contrived to keep Spain subject to his rule, the latter country"
"would have been thrown back on her great natural resources, her"
"industry, and her commerce, which, as it was, developed markedly during"
"his reign,[765] despite the heavy burdens of his wars. And in that case"
Spain might conceivably have become the Protestant and rebellious
"territory, and the Netherlands on the contrary have remained Catholic"
"and grown commercially decrepit, having in reality the weaker potential"
economic basis.
"The theorem that the two races were vitally opposed in ""religious"
"sentiment,"" and that ""it was as certain that the Netherlanders"
would be fierce reformers as that the Spaniards would be
"uncompromising persecutors"" (Motley, p. 31), is part of the common"
"pre-scientific conception of national development, and proceeds"
upon flat disregard of the historical evidence. It is well
established that there was as much heresy of the more rational
"Protestant and Unitarian sort in Spain, to begin with, as in"
Holland. Under Ferdinand and Isabella the Inquisition seems to
"have struck mainly at Judaic and Moorish monotheistic heresy, which"
"was not uncommon among the upper classes, while the lower were for"
"the most part orthodox (Armstrong, _Introd._ to Major Hume's"
"_Spain_, pp. 14, 18). Thus there is good ground for the surmise"
that Ferdinand's object was primarily the confiscation of the
"wealth of Jews and other rich heretics. (See U.R. Burke, _History"
"of Spain_, 1895, ii, 101; Hume's ed. 1900, ii, 74.) In Aragon,"
"Valencia, and Catalonia there was general resistance to the"
Inquisition; in Cordova there was a riot against it; in Saragossa
"the Inquisitor was murdered before the altar (Armstrong, p. 18;"
"Llorente, _Hist. crit. de l'Inquisition d'Espagne_, éd. 1818, i,"
"185-213; M'Crie, _Reformation in Spain_, ed. 1856, pp. 52-53. Cp."

"""Yes, Dicon, and perchance it had been better had the luck been worse."
"I love not such gains as these. Besides, there is somewhat in this"
"beyond my ken. Lord Sandford desired my friendship and company then, and"
"luck was with me.  Now that he desires it no more, the luck has changed,"
and that so strangely and desperately that one might almost say there
"was magic in it."""
"Dick’s jaw dropped; he longed to know more, but feared to intrude too"
"much upon his master’s secrets. Grey, however, knew how faithful and"
"attached was his stanch henchman, and as he went through his morning"
"toilet he told him a little of the events of the past three days, in as"
far as he himself could remember them.
"""I have offended Lord Sandford doubly,"" he said, ""though he will not"
openly admit it.  But I know—I feel the change.  I trow that he is my
"enemy. Nay, Dicon, look not so aghast; it will matter little in the"
"future, since to-day I take my leave of him, and most like in this great"
"whirling world our paths will not again cross, either for weal or woe."""
"""But how?—what?  He did seem to love you well."""
"""I think he did; but a mischance befell.  He did not tell me of his"
"troth-plight to a fair lady—a lady of surpassing beauty, and of a virtue"
and purity which make her like a bright particular star amid the painted
dames and mincing damsels of this giddy London town. Twice or thrice did
I meet her and pay homage to her wondrous beauty and goodness.  It was
"words she spoke to me that decided me, ere ever any ill-blood had been"
"aroused, to leave off from this life of pleasure-seeking and"
"distraction, and seek a nobler career than that of the butterfly dandy"
fluttering round the town.  But Lord Sandford thought that there was
somewhat more than this betwixt us.  Of that I am assured.  A flame of
grate the baton-like loaf with a farrier's hoof-rasp which he used in
"his culinary operations. ""But this,"" he added, as he turned over the"
"bird, ""is well stricken in years, and had better be given to the"
recruits. They have young teeth and have had practice upon dead
"artillery mules!"""
"So saying, he went casually to the edge of the little quarry, whistled a"
"peculiar note and tossed the bird downward to some person unseen, who"
appeared from nowhere in particular for the purpose of receiving it.
When the dinner was ready Sergeant Cardono announced it to Rollo as if
he had been serving a prince. And what was the young man's astonishment
"to find a table, covered with a decent white cloth, under the shelter of"
"a limestone rock, spread for three, and complete even to table napkins,"
which the sergeant had tied into various curious shapes.
"As they filed down the slope the sergeant stood at attention, but when"
El Sarria passed he quickly beckoned him aside with a private gesture.
"""You and I will eat after the foreigners,"" he explained."
"El Sarria drew himself up somewhat proudly, but Sergeant Cardono"
whispered in his ear two or three words which appeared to astonish him
"so much that he did as he was bid, and stood aside while John Mortimer"
and Etienne de Saint Pierre seated themselves.
"But Rollo, who had no great love for eating, and considered one man just"
"as much entitled to respect as another, would not sit down till El"
Sarria was accommodated also.
"""May it please your Excellency, Don Ramon and I have much to say to each"
"other,"" quoth the Sergeant, with great respect, ""besides your honour is"
the woman's son's soul is not in the animal. The woman is not entitled
to the deer because she cannot prove that it is. The deer will therefore
remain with the court until some properly authenticated claim is put
in.'
"So the two parties were turned out, the woman in bitter tears, and the"
"hunters angry and vexed, and the deer remained the property of the"
judge.
But this decision was against all Burmese ideas of justice. He should
"have given the deer to the woman. 'He wanted it for himself,' said a"
"Burman, speaking to me of the affair. 'He probably killed it and ate it."
Surely it is true that officials are of all the five evils the
"greatest.' Then my friend remembered that I was myself an official, and"
"he looked foolish, and began to make complimentary remarks about English"
"officials, that they would never give such an iniquitous decision. I"
turned it off by saying that no doubt the judge was now suffering in
"some other life for the evil wrought in the last, and the Burman said"
that probably he was now inhabiting a tiger.
"It is very easy to laugh at such beliefs; nothing is, indeed, easier"
than to be witty at the expense of any belief. It is also very easy to
"say that it is all self-deception, that the children merely imagine that"
"they remember their former lives, or are citing conversation of their"
elders.
"How this may be I do not know. What is the explanation of this, perhaps"
the only belief of which we have any knowledge which is at once a living
"belief to-day and was so as far back as we can get, I do not pretend to"
"say. For transmigration is no theory of Buddhism at all, but was a"
"leading tenet in the far older faith of Brahmanism, of which Buddhism"
"was but an offshoot, as was Christianity of Judaism."
"handkerchief edged with lace, unfolded it, and with the most ineffable"
"gesture in the world wiped the place the lady's hand had touched. Then,"
"with the same abiding calm, he restored the cambric to his pocket, bowed"
"low to the Queen, and lounged majestically towards the door."
Maria Cristina watched him at first with a haughty and unmoved
"countenance. Her hands clenched themselves close to her side, as if she"
wished the blow had been bestowed with the shut rather than with the
open digits.
"But as her husband (for so he really was, though the relationship was"
"not acknowledged till many years after, and at the feet of the Holy"
"Father himself in the Vatican) approached the door, opened it, and was"
"on the point of departing without once turning round, Cristina suddenly"
"broke into a half hysterical cry, ran after him, threw her arms tenderly"
"about his neck, and burst out weeping on his broad bosom."
"The gentleman, without betraying the least emotion, patted her"
"tolerantly on the shoulder, and murmured some words in her ear, at the"
same time looking over her head at the men of the company with a sort of
half-comic apology.
"""Oh! Fernando, forgive me,"" she cried, ""life of my life--the devil must"
have possessed me! I will cut off the wicked hand that did the deed.
"Give me a knife, good people--to strike the best and handsomest--oh, it"
"was wicked--cruel, diabolical!"""
"Whatever may have been the moral qualities of the royal blow, Rollo felt"
that in their present circumstances time enough had been given to its
"consideration, so he interposed."
"""Your Majesty, the gipsies may be upon us at any moment. It would be as"
Rossiter and the indignation of the W.S.P.U. became so alarming that
the agitated Secretary of State--not at all sure how we were going
"to come out of the War--gave way, and an order was signed for"
Vivie's release on the 11th of August; on the understanding that she
would immediately proceed abroad; an understanding to which she
would not subscribe but which in her slowly-formed hatred of the
British Government she resolved to carry out.
"Mrs. Warren, assured by Praed and Rossiter that Vivie's release was"
"a mere matter of a few days, had left for Brussels on the 5th of"
August. If--as was then hoped--the French and Belgian armies would
"suffice to keep the Germans at bay on the frontier of Belgium, she"
would prefer to resume her life there in the Villa de Beau-séjour.
If however Belgium was going to be invaded it was better she should
"secure her property as far as possible, transfer her funds, and make"
her way somehow to a safe part of France. Vivie would join her as
soon as she could leave the prison.
CHAPTER XVI
BRUSSELS AND THE WAR: 1914
The Lilacs in Victoria Road had been disposed of--through
"Honoria--as soon as possible, after the sentence of Three years'"
imprisonment had been pronounced on Vivie; and the faithful
"Suffragette maid had passed into Honoria's employ at Petworth, a"
fact that was not fully understood by Colonel Armstrong until he had
become General Armstrong and perfectly indifferent to the Suffrage
"Having arrived in the vicinity of the post, he prowled out on foot with"
"his only friend. It was early, for he must do his deed while yet the"
"lights were lit. Any one moving about after ""taps"" would surely be"
investigated by the guard. The country was not yet tranquil enough to
"permit of laxity in the matter of sentry duty, and the soldiers counted"
"""ten"" very fast after they challenged. He had laid aside his big hat,"
"and was wrapped in his blanket. Many Indians were about, and he was less"
"apt to be spoken to or noticed. He moved forward to the scout fire,"
"which was outside of the guard-line, and stood for a time in some"
"brushwood, beyond the play of the flames. He was closely enveloped in"
"his blanket, and although Indians passed quite near him, he was not"
"noticed. Suddenly he heard a detail of wagons clanking up the road, and"
conjectured rightly that they would go into the post. He ran silently
"toward them, and stooping low, saw against the skyline that the cavalry"
"guard had worked up in front, impatient to shave the time when they"
should reach their quarters.
"It was a wood train, and it clanked and ground and jingled to the"
"quartermaster's corral, bearing one log on the last wagon which was John"
Ermine and his fortunes. This log slid to the ground and walked swiftly
away.

"The time for ""taps"" was drawing near, and the post buzzed in the usual"
expectation of that approaching time of quiet. A rifle-shot rang loud
"and clear up on the officers' row; it was near Major Searles's house,"
"every one said as they ran. Women screamed, and Tongue River cantonment"
laid its legs to the ground as it gathered to the place. Officers came
"with revolvers, and the guard with lanterns. Mrs. Searles and her"
"daughter were clasped in each other's arms, while Mary, the cook, put"
her apron over her head. Searles ran out with his gun; the shot had been
"it, along the line of shivering women, and, pulling myself heavily"
"into the branches, managed to scramble up a few feet. The tree swayed"
"under my weight, but it bore me."
"The first dawn was whitening the sky and casting a faint, reflected"
"light on the glistening sea of osiers, that seemed to my eyes--for I"
was not high enough to look beyond it--to stretch far and away on
"every side. Here and there a large willow, rising in a round, dark"
"clump, stood out above the level; and in one place, about a hundred"
"paces away on the riverside of us, a group of these formed a shadowy"
"mound. I marked the spot, and dropped gently into the water."
"'I have found it,' I said. 'I will go first, and do you bring my lady,"
Steve. And mind the stumps. It will be rough work.'
"It was rough work. We had to wind in and out, leading and coaxing the"
"frightened horses, that again and again stumbled to their knees. Every"
minute I feared that we should find the way impassable or meet with a
"mishap. But in time, going very patiently, we made out the willows in"
"front of us. Then the water grew more shallow, and this gave the"
"animals courage. Twenty steps farther, and we passed into the shadow"
"of the trees. A last struggle, and, plunging one by one up the muddy"
"bank, we stood panting on the eyot."
It was such a place as only despair could choose for a refuge. In
"shape like the back of some large submerged beast, it lay in length"
"about forty paces, in breadth half as many. The highest point was a"
poor foot above the water. Seven great willows took up half the space;
"it was as much as our horses, sinking in the moist mud to the fetlock,"
could do to find standing-room on the remainder. Coarse grass and
reeds covered it; and the flotsam of the last flood whitened the
"trunks of the willows, and hung in squalid wisps from their lower"
"Figure 207, a strong unconformity parts the schists and the"
Algonkian. The floor on which the Algonkian rests is remarkably
"even, and here again is proved an interval of incalculable length,"
during which an ancient land mass of Archean rocks was baseleveled
before it received the cover of the sediments of the later age.
THE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION. In eastern Canada an area of pre-
"Cambrian rocks, Archean and Algonkian, estimated at two million"
"square miles, stretches from the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence"
"River northward to the confines of the continent, inclosing Hudson"
"Bay in the arms of a gigantic U. This immense area, which we have"
"already studied as the Laurentian peneplain, extends southward"
"across the Canadian border into northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and"
Michigan. The rocks of this area are known to be pre-Cambrian; for
"the Cambrian strata, wherever found, lie unconformably upon them."
The general relations of the formations of that portion of the
area which lies about Lake Superior are shown in Figure 262. Great
"unconformities, UU' separate the Algonkian both from the Archean"
"and from the Cambrian, and divide it into three distinct systems,"
"--the LOWER HURONIAN, the UPPER HURONIAN, and the KEWEENAWAN. The"
Lower and the Upper Huronian consist in the main of old sea muds
"and sands and limy oozes now changed to gneisses, schists,"
"marbles, quartzites, slates, and other metamorphic rocks. The"
"Keweenawan is composed of immense piles of lava, such as those of"
"Iceland, overlain by bedded sandstones. What remains of these rock"
systems after the denudation of all later geologic ages is
"enormous. The Lower Huronian is more than a mile thick, the Upper"
"Huronian more than two miles thick, while the Keweenawan exceeds"
nine miles in thickness. The vast length of Algonkian time is
shown by the thickness of its marine deposits and by the cycles of
erosion which it includes. In Figure 262 the student may read an

The obstacles in the path of the fuller development of the national
resources of Panama have sprung wholly from the nature of its
"population. The Indian is, of course, not primarily an agriculturist,"
not a developer of the possibilities of the land he inhabits. The
Spanish infusion brought to the native population no qualities of
"energy, of well-directed effort, of the laborious determination to build"
up a new and thriving commonwealth. Spanish ideals run directly counter
"to those involved in empire building. Such energy, such determination as"
built up our great northwest and is building in British Columbia the
"greatest agricultural empire in the world, despite seven months annually"
"of drifting snow and frozen ground, would make of the Panama savannas"
and valleys the garden spot of the world. That will never be
"accomplished by the present agrarian population, but it is incredible"
that with population absorbing and overrunning the available
"agricultural lands of other zones, the tropics should long be left"
dormant in control of a lethargic and indolent people.

"Benjamin Kidd, in his stimulative book, “Social Evolution”, says on this"
subject:
“With the filling up to the full limit of the remaining territories
"suitable for European occupation, and the growing pressure of population"
"therein, it may be expected that the inexpediency of allowing a great"
"without me. With bad luck and bad weather, I might have had to wait"
"a few weeks, if not months in Nabwageta. I could perhaps have sailed"
"in a native canoe, but this could only be done without bedding, tent,"
"or even writing outfit and photographic apparatus, and so my travelling"
would have been quite useless. It was a piece of great good luck that
"a day or two afterwards, a motor launch, whose owner had heard about"
"my staying in the Amphletts, anchored in front of Nabwageta village,"
"and within an hour I was speeding towards the Trobriands again,"
following the tracks of the Kula fleet.

"On the next morning, as we slowly made our way along the channels"
"in the opalescent, green lagoon, and as I watched a fleet of small,"
"local canoes fishing in their muddy waters, and could recognise on"
"the surrounding flat shores a dozen well-known villages, my spirits"
"rose, and I felt well pleased to have left the picturesque, but"
"ethnographically barren Amphletts for the Trobriands, with their"
scores of excellent informants.
"Moreover, the Amphletts, in the persons of their male inhabitants"
"were soon to join me here. I went ashore in Sinaketa, where everybody"
was full of the great moment which was soon to arrive. For the Dobuan
"fleet was known to be coming, though on that morning, so far, no news"
"had reached them of its whereabouts. As a matter of fact, the Dobuans,"
"who had left Nabwageta forty-eight hours ahead of me, had made a slow"
"journey with light winds, and sailing a course to the East of mine,"
had arrived that morning only in Vakuta.
"old enemy of his, and the sight of the fellow’s humiliation had inclined"
the riverman even more strongly toward the man who had brought it about.
"But that was over now, he told himself furiously as he stamped along the"
"stream, hands clenched and face set in a black scowl. He hated"
Bainbridge! The man had no right to jump on him that way. How did he
know what had been the cause of Kollock’s behavior? He had asked no
"questions, given Curly no chance to explain even had the latter been"
inclined to lower himself to that extent. He had taken it for granted
that the river jack was loafing in spite of the fact that record as a
worker was equal to that of the best.
This was where the sting lay. Kollock was aggrieved and disgruntled
"because of what was, to him, a very good reason. There had been a"
definite object in his pause by that stone. The night before he had
"received a brief note from Bill, in which he was urged to “make use of"
any chance you git to do--you know what.”
Curly did know “what” very well. It meant that he was to thwart and
delay the progress of the drive by any means in his power. _Any_ means!
"The simplest, of course, was to cause some to happen to Bainbridge"
himself. Bill had not hesitated to suggest several ways by which this
happy end could be reached. None of them appealed particularly to Curly.
"He was not overscrupulous, but he disliked doing up a man in cold blood"
"without giving him even a ghost of a show. Still, Bill had done him good"
"turns more than once when he was out of work; and, last but not least,"
there was the financial side of the affair. Curly had never been told
"who or what was back of these attacks on the independent lumber company,"
but he knew there was plenty of money in it.
All this he had been thinking over as he sat smoking that cigarette. In
the end he decided to have nothing to do with it. Bainbridge had trusted
"Again, in Eugene Field's “Hushaby Lady,” the language of which is most"
"simple, the child is carried away by the beauty of the sound."
I remember hearing some poetry repeated by the children in one of
the elementary schools in Sheffield which made me feel that they had
realised romantic possibilities which would prevent their lives from
"ever becoming quite prosaic again, and I wish that this practice"
were more usual. There is little difficulty with the children. I can
"remember, in my own experience as a teacher in London, making the"
experiment of reading or repeating passages from Milton and Shakespeare
"to children from nine to eleven years of age, and the enthusiastic"
"way they responded by learning those passages by heart. I have taken,"
"with several sets of children, such passages from Milton as “Echo"
"Song,” “Sabrina,” “By the rushy fringed Bank,” “Back, shepherds, back,”"
"from _Comus_, “May Morning,” “Ode to Shakespeare,” “Samson on his"
"blindness,” etc. I even ventured on several passages from _Paradise"
"Lost_, and found “Now came still evening on” a particular favourite"
with the children.
"It seemed even easier to interest them in Shakespeare, and they learned"
"quite readily and easily many passages from “As You Like It,” “Merchant"
"of Venice,” “Julius Cæsar”; from “Richard II,” “Henry IV,” and “Henry"
V.”
The method I should recommend in the introduction of both poets
occasionally into the Story-hour would be threefold.
"First, to choose passages which appeal for beauty of sound or beauty"
"of mental vision called up by those sounds: such as, “Tell me where is"
"Fancy bred,” Titania's Lullaby, “How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon"
this bank.”
tightened and I stopped breathing altogether. But the explosion that
"followed was fainter than the last. Then there was another, still"
further off. All my muscles gradually relaxed and a delicious feeling of
relief pervaded my whole being. The buzzing noise became more and more
"feeble. I got up and walked back to the marquee, trembling and weak at"
the knees. The others followed.
"Most of us went to bed, but a few continued to pace up and down in great"
agitation. One man picked up his blankets in a bundle and went off in
"order to sleep in the open fields, far away from the camp."
An hour had hardly passed before distant anti-aircraft fire broke out
"again. Anxiety began to renew its tortures. We heard the dull, sullen"
roar of bombs exploding at intervals. Then fourteen burst in rapid
succession as though a gigantic ball of solid iron had bounced fourteen
times with thundering reverberations on a resonant surface. But the
sound of firing died down and soon all was quiet. And then sleep came
upon us and our troubles were over for a time.
The next morning was windless and clear. All day we kept looking at the
"sky, but not a cloud was to be seen."
"The evening approached, darkness fell, and the stars shone. ""Lights Out"""
"was sounded and we extinguished our candles. None of us said a word, but"
everybody knew what everybody else was thinking of. And soon we heard
"the familiar buzz. At first it only came from one propeller, but others"
"arrived and the sound multiplied and increased in volume, and at the"
same time it rose and fell in irregular gusts and regular pulsations.
Anti-aircraft firing burst out suddenly and for a few minutes there was
"a blending of whining, whistling, rushing sounds overhead punctuated by"
"faint reports. The firing ceased, but the droning noises continued"
louder than ever. The German aeroplanes seemed to be above us like a
"his family and friends, but, finding a certain demand for the fruit,"
later began to import it systematically. From this casual start the
United Fruit Company and its hustling competitors have grown. The whole
business is the development of a few decades and people still young can
"remember when bananas were sold, each wrapped in tissue paper, for five"
"or ten cents, while today ten or fifteen cents a dozen is a fair price."
"The fruit can be prepared in a multitude of fashions, particularly the"
"coarser varieties of plantains, and the Fruit Company has compiled a"
"banana cook book but has taken little pains to circulate it, the demand"
for the fruit being at times still in excess of the supply. There seems
every indication that the demand is constant and new banana territory is
being steadily developed.
[Illustration: DRYING THE COFFEE BEANS]
Several companies share with the United Fruit Company the Panama market.
The methods of gathering and marketing the crop employed by all are
"practically the same, but the United Fruit Company is used as an"
illustration here because its business is the largest and because it has
so closely followed the Isthmian Canal Commission in its welfare work.
The banana country lies close to the ocean and mainly on the Atlantic
"side of the Isthmus. The lumber industry nestles close to the rivers,"
mainly in the Bayano region. Cocoanuts need the beaches and the sea
"breezes. Native rubber is found in every part of the Republic, though at"
"present it is collected mainly in the Darien, which is true also of"
vegetable ivory. The only gold which is mined on a large scale is taken
from the neighborhood of the Tuyra River in the Darien. But for products
requiring cultivation like cacao and coffee the high lands in the
Chiriqui province offer the best opportunity.

"of encouragement to her. At last, she ordered the Indian to lead the"
"way, and they started."
"The trail curved and twisted around the mountain, and in places they had"
to use the greatest care lest a misstep should carry them over a
"precipice with a drop of hundreds of feet. It was a perilous descent,"
"inasmuch as the path was covered with snow. Moreover, it was necessary"
that as little noise as possible should be made while they were making
"their way past the buildings of the camp below, for the Mexican had not"
"been wrong when he stated that Ashby's men were quartered at, or in the"
"immediate vicinity of, The Palmetto. Fortunately, they passed through"
"without meeting anyone, and before long they came to the edge of the"
plateau beneath which was the ravine which Johnson had to cross to reach
the spot where it had been agreed that Castro should be waiting with
horses for his master. It was also the place where the Girl was to leave
"her lover to go on alone, and so they halted. A few moments passed"
"without either of them speaking; at length, the man said in as cheery a"
voice as he could summon:
"""I must leave you here. I remember the way well. All danger is past."""
The Girl's lips were quivering; she asked:
"""An' when will you be back?"""
"The man noted her emotion, and though he himself was conscious of a"
choking sensation he contrived to say in a most optimistic tone:
"""In two weeks--not more than two weeks. It will take all that time to"

stiff prude seats compel me to order--tell me harshly that I must not
"be dreaming overmuch, nor thinking--which is next door to dreaming--but"
"nag me to be up and doing, boiling pots or eggs or hitting something"
or pushing at things. I don’t seem to fit in anywhere. The medieval
rigours warn me to be done with visions and the reading of the visions
of others; and their hard oaken seats rise up and assault me where I
would sit upon them.... But that is nothing. They have left me not even
my books. I am bewildered--bewildered--wholly bewildered.”

To establish this machinery the United Fruit Company has invested more

desirable step.

"something about Luther. Luther's writings, he says, have given the"
Louvain obscurants plenty of reason to inveigh against the _bonae
"literae_, to decry all scholars. He himself does not know Luther and has"
"glanced through his writings only cursorily as yet, but everyone praises"
his life. How little in accordance with theological gentleness it is to
"condemn him offhand, and that before the indiscreet vulgar! For has he"
"not proposed a dispute, and submitted himself to everybody's judgement?"
"No one has, so far, admonished, taught, convinced him. Every error is"
not at once heresy.
"The best of Christianity is a life worthy of Christ. Where we find that,"
we should not rashly suspect people of heresy. Why do we so uncharitably

"Why do we rather want to conquer than cure, suppress than instruct?"

question. Luther does not know the tragedies which his writings have
caused at Louvain. People here think that Erasmus has helped him in
composing them and call him the standard bearer of the party! That
"The husband died, and Mary once again donned male attire and enlisted in a"
"regiment in Holland. Soon tiring of this, she deserted, and shipped"
herself aboard a vessel bound for the West Indies. This ship was taken by
"an English pirate, Captain Rackam, and Mary joined his crew as a seaman."
"She was at New Providence Island, Bahama, when Woodes Rogers came there"
"with the royal pardon to all pirates, and she shipped herself aboard a"
privateer sent out by Rogers to cruise against the Spaniards. The crew
"mutinied and again became pirates. She now sailed under Captain Rackam,"
"who had with him another woman pirate, Anne Bonny. They took a large"
"number of ships belonging to Jamaica, and out of one of these took"
"prisoner ""a young fellow of engaging behaviour"" with whom Mary fell deeply"
"in love. This young fellow had a quarrel with one of the pirates, and as"
the ship lay at anchor they were to go to fight it out on shore according
"to pirate law. Mary, to save her lover, picked a quarrel with the same"
"pirate, and managed to have her duel at once, and fighting with sword and"
pistol killed him on the spot.
"She now married the young man ""of engaging behaviour,"" and not long after"
was taken prisoner with Captain Rackam and the rest of the crew to
"Jamaica. She was tried at St. Jago de la Vega in Jamaica, and on November"
"28th, 1720, was convicted, but died in prison soon after of a violent"

One method of trapping these monsters which affords keen delight was
"related to me. The requirements are an electric battery, some rope, a"
"few feet of electric wire, a cartridge, and an empty box, with a chunk"
"or two of bad meat. The cartridge is fitted with an electric primer,"
the wire of which stretches to the battery. This cartridge is buried
"in a hunk of meat, the whole being dangled from a box--an empty cask is"
"better--which serves as a float, while a rope is stretched from the box"
"to the shore, with the electric wire spirally wound round it. A short"
"length of chain is preferable, if available, to attach the bait to the"
"float, but a short piece of rope will do. This novel line is thrown"
"into the water, and the man keeps his eye on the float, with one finger"
"on the battery. The hungry shark, espying the tempting morsel, makes a"
"grab and swallows it, but the chain prevents him tearing away with it."
"The pull causes the float to disappear, the man’s finger presses the"
"button, and the trick is done. There is an explosion, and pieces of"
shark and showers of water fly into the air. The incident is all over
too quickly for the fish to marvel about the strange indigestibility
of the tainted meat he grabbed so greedily. The men enjoy this sport
"hugely when it can be followed, as they regard the shark with intense"
detestation.

"Despite the vigilance of the various Powers, slave-running is still a"
lucrative business on these forbidding coasts. Now and again a forced
await this hour; there might one find the treasures of the Forty
"Thieves. And so I quarried on slowly, with bated breath, savouring"
"the interest. Believe me, I had little palate left for the jelly; and"
"though I preferred the taste when I took cream with it, I used often to"
go without because the cream dimmed the transparent fractures.”
"In his work on Imagination, Ribot says: “The free initiative of"
children is always superior to the imitations we pretend to make for
them.”
The passage from Robert Stevenson becomes more clear from a scientific
point of view when taken in connection with one from Karl Groos' book
on the “Psychology of Animal Play”:
"“The Child is wholly absorbed in his play, and yet under the ebb and"
"flow of thought and feeling like still water under wind-swept waves, he"
has the knowledge that it is pretence after all. Behind the sham ‘I’
"that takes part in the game, stands the unchanged ‘I’ which regards the"
sham ‘I’ with quiet superiority.”
Queyrat speaks of play as one of the distinct phases of a child's
"imagination; it is “essentially a metamorphosis of reality, a"
transformation of places and things.”
"Now to return to the point which Mrs. Ewing makes, namely, that we"
should develop in normal children the power of distinguishing between
Truth and Falsehood.
I should suggest including two or three stories which would test that
"power in children, and if they fail to realise the difference between"
romancing and telling lies then it is evident that they need special
attention and help along this line. I give the titles of two stories of
"she read very stiltedly, with a strange exotic accent for the love"
"passages or the death scenes. As Lady Victoria Freebooter said, she"
would have been _priceless_ at a music-hall matinée which was
"raising funds for war charities, if only she could have been induced"
to read passages from Miss Yonge in _that_ voice for a quarter of an
hour. Even the Queen would have had to laugh.
"But as that could not be brought off, it was decided that working"
parties at her house led to too much giddiness from suppressed
giggles or torpor from too much food. So she relapsed once more into
loneliness. Unfortunately air-raids were now becoming events of
"occasional fright and anxiety in London, and this deterred Cousin"
"Sophie from Darlington, Cousin Matty from Leeds, Joseph's wife from"
"Northallerton or old, married schoolfellows from other northern or"
"midland towns coming to partake of her fastuous hospitality. Also,"
"they all seemed to be busy, either over their absent husbands'"
"business, or their sons', or because they were plunged in war work"
"themselves. ""And really, in these times, I couldn't stand Linda for"
"more than five minutes,"" one of them said."
"As to the air-raids, she was not greatly alarmed at them. Of course"
"it was very uncomfortable having London so dark at night, but then"
"she only went out in the afternoon, and never in the evening. And"
the Germans seemed to be content and discriminating enough not to
"bomb what she called ""the resi_den_tial"" parts of London. The"
nearest to Portland Place of their attentions was Hampstead or
"Bloomsbury. ""We are protected, my dear, by the open spaces of"
"Regent's Park. They wouldn't like to waste their bombs on poor me!"""
However her maid didn't altogether like the off chance of the
Germans or our air-craft guns making a mistake and trespassing on
"the residential parts of London, so she persuaded her mistress to"
"""Eighty yards short,"" came the wireless report of the observing"
"seaplane that, hovering a bare five hundred feet above the German"
"mobile battery, had marked the point of impact of the shells."
Again a salvo was let loose. This time came the encouraging statement
"that the hostile guns were knocked clean out of action, and that"
swarms of artillerymen and infantry were scurrying across the dunes.
The next discharge practically annihilated the fugitives. In one
"minute and twenty-five seconds the ""Sunderland's"" particular task was"
"accomplished. It was but the beginning, for acting upon orders from"
the flagship she was ordered to engage a battery at close range.
"Meanwhile, the rest of the battleships and cruisers had not been"
idle. A perfect tornado of shell was being directed upon the Belgian
shore.
"""Hard aport!"" shouted the captain of the ""Sunderland."""
"Round swung the cruiser, only just avoiding the tell-tale line of"
bubbles that marked the track of a torpedo. With consummate daring a
German submarine had dived under a part of the torpedo-boat destroyer
"flotilla, and had discharged a weapon at the British cruiser. The"
"torpedo, having missed the ""Sunderland,"" was tearing straight for one"
"of the monitors, which, having to go full speed astern to avoid a"
"collision with a couple of damaged destroyers, was now practically"
stationary.
Owing to the light draught the weapon passed six feet beneath her
"keel, and finishing its run rose to the surface three hundred yards"
"beyond; for, instead of the torpedo sinking at the end of its course,"
honourable and dangerous service which I had no choice but to accept.
My dreams of love had gone to wreck. I could have deceived the woman
"whom I loved, for she would have trusted me and believed any story of"
"me that I had chosen to tell. But could I, an officer, a gentleman by"
"birth and I hope by practice, a secret enemy of England and a spy upon"
"her in the hour of her sorest trial, could I remain the lover of an"
English girl without telling her fully and frankly exactly what I was?
Could I have committed this frightful treason to love and remained
other than an object of scorn and loathing to honest men? I could not.
"In soul and heart she was mine; I was her man, and she was my woman."
"With her there were no reserves in love. She was mine, yet I fled from"
"her with never a word, even of good-bye. I made my plans, obtained"
"certificates of my proficiency in the _Vernon_, kissed my dear love"
"quietly, almost coldly, without a trace of the passion that I felt,"
"and fled. It was the one thing left me to do. My friend, that was two"
years ago. She knows not whether I am alive or am dead; I know not

"about four o'clock to escort her. Was not that the hour, baron?"""
"""Yes, your Grace,"" I answered, bowing. ""I accompanied my cousin to"
"her father's house, returned later to fetch her back to the palace,"
"but she did not care to face the storm, so I remained till ten o'clock,"
"returned to Whitehall, and slept till morning. Here is another witness,"""
"I continued, laughing, as I turned to John Churchill, who was standing"
"near the king. ""Step forward, Churchill, and testify. I left him making"
"his suit to one of the most interesting ladies in London."""
"The king turned with an inquiring look, and Churchill answered: ""Yes,"
"your Majesty, it is all true. I was making my suit until near the hour"

It is a curious illustration of Romish wrong-headedness that women
"are never allowed to enter the Chapel of St. Helena, in the Church"
"of S. Croce, except on the festival of the Saint, August 18th,"
"notwithstanding the fact that St. Helena herself was a woman, and that"
the church owes its existence to her and is also indebted to her for
"the piece of the true cross which it boasts, and which has given it its"
"name. So while men are permitted to go inside the chapel of St. Helena,"
women are stopped at the entrance and only allowed to peer through the
railing. The same degrading discrimination is made in the Church of S.

"when he had fallen into their hands and was about to be put to death,"
"he was rescued by a marvellous intervention of celestial light."""
Females are never allowed to enter this chapel except upon Sundays in
"Lent, but are permitted to look at the relic through a grating.[12]"

The mention of this column reminds me of the two columns in the Church
"of S. Maria Transpontina, on the other side of the Tiber, near St."
"Peter's, which bear inscriptions stating that they were the pillars to"
"which St. Peter and St. Paul were fastened, respectively, when they"

The most angry of them all was Curly Kollock. He had double cause for
"wrath, having received that morning a letter from the very town of"
Lancaster toward which they were striving so hard to push the drive.
"Brief it was, and to the point. He had played the traitor, Bill wrote"
scathingly. There was only one way by which he could rid himself of the
"stigma, and return to the good graces of the gang. He must come at once"
"to a certain house on the outskirts of the town, prepared to place"
himself absolutely in his brother’s hands.
When the younger Kollock read those lines he swore roundly. That even
Bill should dare write in such a manner made him rage. He was no man’s
"slave, and there were bounds beyond which even a brother could step. He"
"was on the point of asking for time off to come to a definite, final"
settlement with the crowd when the attempted shooting occurred. At first
"this cowardly deed only added to his rage, but swiftly in its wake came"
unwonted gravity.
"Disagreeable, even serious, as all those other persecutions had been,"
not one of them held the weight of this last culminating effort to put
Bob Bainbridge out of the running. That Bill was mixed up in it Curly
"had no doubt, and the realization frightened him. He had always looked"
"up to his older brother with admiration and a little awe, and he could"
not bear now to think of him mixed up in anything so contemptible. There
"was the danger involved, too, and altogether the youngster felt as if he"
must see Bill at once and try to make him cut the gang and get away. His
"efforts might have no effect, but there was at least a chance."
"That night--or rather early in the morning, while it was still pitch"
black--he slipped quietly out of camp without a word to any one. He
"reached Lancaster at four in the afternoon, having made most of the"
journey in a scow doing about six miles an hour. Going at once to the
"I had no authority to compel him to go on, so gave up the struggle."
But I realised more than ever how imperative it was to endeavour
"to reach Robat without a moment's unnecessary delay, and start"
"conclusions with the Raiders, whose menace was growing more dangerous"
every day.
"We were, therefore, on the road very early next morning, for I hoped"
"to make Saindak that night. I had intended to go by Borgar, but now"
"that I knew--for I had verified the contractor's statements, and"
believed them to be correct--that that place was in the hands of
"the Raiders, I elected to go by an alternative route, known as the"
"_Webb-Ware_ route, which is practically out of use nowadays, hoping,"
"thereby, to avoid the enemy."
It was still dark when we set off on the most strenuous part of our
"journey; climbing, making détours, digging the car out again and"
again till we were all three worn out in body and temper. We hardly
"halted that day, for the necessity for speed was as fully realised by"
Allan as by myself.
"When night fell we had not yet sighted Saindak, but I knew we could"
"not be very far off, and cursed the coming of the night which made"
it impossible to see where we were. I knew we had got off the camel
"track somehow, for the ground was even more bumpy than it had been,"
"and was frequently intersected by nullahs or rocky ravines, which"
made the going positively dangerous. If the car were knocked right
out of action our difficulties would reach the last stage of disaster.
"At last, in despair, Allan stopped, saying it was useless going on"
any further. We might overturn the car at any moment and smash it as
well as ourselves. He submitted that the only sane thing would be to
"The event increased our uneasiness. After each ""bombing-stunt"" we"
"thought: ""We were lucky this time--it will be our turn next though."""
"Moreover, we began to realize our helplessness. We were compelled to"
remain in our tents during a raid and there was no possibility of taking
shelter. We could have put on our steel helmets--they would at least
"have afforded some head protection, but hardly any of us had the courage"
to do anything that might be regarded by the others as a sign of fear.
The discussion about the bombing of hospitals had made us all think of
air-raids. We had nearly finished our day's work when we noticed a few
clouds on the horizon. We felt relieved. Perhaps the sky would be
overcast and we would have an undisturbed night.
"""I can't stick night raids,"" said one of our number. ""They don't put my"
"wind up a bit, but they interfere with my sleep and make me feel tired"
"in the mornings."""
A man who had been in the war from the beginning answered:
"""I can see you haven't been out here long, and have never been in a"
proper raid. I'll never forget the last time we were bombed. We were out
on rest about fifteen miles behind the line. Fritz came over and I had
the wind up so badly that I left the tent to go into the open fields.
"(I'd had a taste of it before, you know, and that makes all the"
difference.) Then he bombed us before I knew where I was. I ran for my
life. There was a hell of a crash behind me and a bit caught me in the
shoulder and knocked me down. When it was all over I got up and went
"back, although my shoulder hurt like anything. A lot of our fellows were"
"running about and shouting. Where my tent used to be, there was a big"
bomb-hole and my mates were lying dead all round--fourteen of them. I
"didn't recognize most of them, they were so smashed up. Fritz had"
dropped one right on the tent. I reckon I was lucky to get off with a
The time of our Dover journey was one of extreme depletion in the privy
purse. The king had borrowed from every person and every city within the
"realm who, by threats or cajolery, could be induced to part with money."
But now he had reached the end of his tether.
"When matters were thus in extremis, some one, probably Castlemain,"
"suggested the sale of England's possessions on the continent, chief of"
"which was the rich city of Dunkirk, situate on the French side of the"
"Straits of Dover. This fortified city, within a few leagues of Calais,"
"had cost the English nation heavily in blood and gold to gain, and still"
"more heavily to hold, but its value to England commercially and"
politically was beyond measure.
"Since Queen Mary had lost Calais, Dunkirk was the only important foothold"
England had on continental soil; therefore it was almost as dear to the
"English people as the city of London itself. Because of its importance,"
"it was greatly coveted by the French king, who shortly before the time"
of our journey to Dover had made overtures to buy it.
"Charles turned a deaf ear to King Louis's first proposal to buy Dunkirk,"
"not because he loved the city, or cared a farthing for its value to his"
"people, but because he feared the storm of indignation its sale would"
"raise. The Lord Chancellor objected to the sale of Dunkirk, and tried"
to show Charles the great folly of entertaining the offer. He was the
"only wise, honest man in the king's council, and, by reason of his"
"wonderful knowledge of mankind, was called ""the Chancellor of Human"
"Nature."" But the king needed money, so after a time he listened to"
"Berkeley, Crofts, Castlemain, and others of like character, whose"
"strongest argument consisted in accusing the king, most offensively,"
of being afraid of his people.
"""Are you not king?"" asked Castlemain. ""Does not Dunkirk belong to you,"
"lock the Pope into his chamber, and take the key with her!"" She finally"
"""deserted him on his death-bed, making off with the accumulated spoils"
"of his ten years' papacy, which enabled her son, Don Camillo, to build"
"the Palazzo Doria Pamfili, in the Corso, and the beautiful Villa Doria"
"Pamfili,"" west of the Janiculan Hill. This villa, with its casino,"
"garden, lake, fountain, pine-shaded lawns and woods, and its fine view"
"of St. Peter's standing out against the green Campagna beyond, and"
"the blue Sabine mountains in the distance, is to this day one of the"
"loveliest villas in Italy, and the favorite resort of the latter-day"
Romans and visitors to their city on the two afternoons of the week on
which it is open to pedestrians and two-horse carriages.
"The notorious Simony practiced by the popes, in which, as we have just"
"seen, Olympia became such an adept, gave rise to the biting Latin"
couplet--
"""An Petrus Romæ fuerit, sub judice lis est;"
"Simonem Romæ nemo fuisse negat."""
Some of the modern methods of making use of the Pope for purposes
of gain are less objectionable than those of Olympia. Dr. Alexander
"Robertson, in his _Roman Catholic Church in Italy_, just published,"
"says: ""One of the very latest novelties of the 'Pope's Shop' is a"
penny-in-the-slot blessing machine. Specimens of this were lately to be
"seen in the Corso, Rome, about half way between the Piazza Colonna and"
"the Piazza del Popolo. A penny is dropped into it. The cinematograph,"
"or wheel of life, goes round, when, lo! there appears a long procession"
"of richly clothed cardinals and monsignori, and then the Pope in a"
"sedan chair, accompanied by his Swiss Guards. As he is carried past"
"the spectator, he turns towards the window of his chair, a smile"
"overspreads his face, he raises his hands, and gives his blessing. On"
these machines there is an inscription to the effect that the blessing

"Witt's friend, Pierre Delacourt; De Witt, however, contributing two"
"chapters), and much attention was given to it here and on the Continent."
In addition to the many and copious histories written in the eighteenth
"century in Dutch, three or four voluminous and competent histories of"
"the Low Countries were written in French--_e.g._, those of Dujardin"
"(1757, etc., 8 vols. 4to), Cerisier (1777, etc., 10 vols. 12mo), Le"
"Clerc (1723-28, 3 vols. folio), Wicquefort (1719, folio, proceeding from"
"Peace of Münster). Of late years, though the lesson is as important as"
"ever, it appears to be less generally attended to. In our own country,"
"however, have appeared Davies' _History of Holland_ (1841, 3 vols.), a"
"careful but not often an illuminating work, which oddly begins with the"
"statement that ""there is scarcely any nation whose history has been so"

"(1861-68), which deal minutely with only a period of fifty-five years of"
"Dutch history, and of which, as of the work of Davies, the sociological"
value is much below the annalistic. All three are impaired as literature
by their stale rhetoric. The same malady infects the second volume of
"the _Industrial History of the Free Nations_ (1846), by W. Torrens"
"M'Cullagh (afterwards M'Cullagh Torrens); but this, which deals with"
"Holland, is the better section of that treatise, and it gives distinct"
"help to a scientific conception of the process of Dutch history, as does"
"J.R. M'Culloch's _Essay on the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Commerce"

"were cold. The condition of the abdomen was unaltered, but the"

His condition still seemed to preclude any chance of successful
"intervention, but none the less life was retained until the"

"times, although for the most part wandering, and was so"
restless that no covering could be kept upon him. Vomiting was
"continuous, so that no nourishment could be retained; the"
"bowels acted frequently involuntarily, and little or no urine"
"was passed. Meanwhile, the abdomen became flat, then sunken, an"
area of induration and tenderness about 6 inches in diameter
developing around the wound of entry. Slight variations in the

It was this syncretic religion that came to Rome after having enjoyed
popularity in the eastern Mediterranean. Sicily and the south of Italy were
"more than half Hellenized, and the Ptolemies had diplomatic relations with"
"these countries, just as the merchants of Alexandria had commercial"
relations with them. For this reason the worship of Isis spread as rapidly
in those regions as on the coasts of Ionia or in the Cyclades.[22] It was
introduced into Syracuse and Catana during the earliest years of the third
"century by {81} Agathocles. The Serapeum of Pozzuoli, at that time the"
"busiest seaport of Campania, was mentioned in a city ordinance of the year"
"105 B. C.[23] About the same time an Iseum was founded at Pompeii, where"
the decorative frescos attest to this day the power of expansion possessed
by the Alexandrian culture.
"After its adoption by the southern part of the Italian peninsula, this"
religion was bound to penetrate rapidly to Rome. Ever since the second
"century before our era, it could not help but find adepts in the chequered"
multitude of slaves and freedmen. Under the Antonines the college of the
_pastophori_ recalled that it had been founded in the time of Sulla.[24] In
vain did the authorities try to check the invasion of the Alexandrian gods.
"Five different times, in 59, 58, 53, and 48 B. C., the senate ordered their"
"altars and statues torn down,[25] but these violent measures did not stop"
the diffusion of the new beliefs. The Egyptian mysteries were the first
example at Rome of an essentially popular religious movement that was
triumphant over the continued resistance of the public authorities and the
official clergy.
Why was this Egyptian worship the only one of all Oriental religions to
"suffer repeated persecutions? There were two motives, one religious and one"
political.

"She saw that he did not intend to tell her any more in the meantime, and"
"was glad to see him go. Then she called Ambrizette in for company, and"
"sat down by the window again, to try to sort out for herself the"
bewildering tangle that life had once more become within a few hours.
"Gazing out across the familiar sea with wistful, far-away eyes, she"
mused for a time over what Captain Dove had told Mr. Jobling of her
"history, and strove to piece together with that all she herself could"
recall of that dim and always more mysterious past out of which she had

"to take the hotel manager and his minions by the coat collar, fling"
"_them_ into the street, and assert her right to go up to her room."
"But now her violence was spent and she was a broken, weeping woman"

The burial for various reasons had to take place in the Cemetery of
"St. Josse-ten-Noode, near the shuddery National Shooting Range where"
Edith Cavell and numerous Belgian patriots had recently been
"executed. Minna von Stachelberg left her hospital, with some one"
"else in charge, and insisted on accompanying Vivie to the interment."
"This might have been purely ""laïc""; not on account of any harsh"
dislike to the religious ceremony on Vivie's part; only due to the
fact that she knew no priest or pastor. But there appeared at the
grave-side to make a very suitable and touching discourse and to
"utter one or two heartfelt prayers, a Belgian Baptist minister, a"
relation of Mme. Trouessart.
Waterloo left many curious things behind it. Not only a tea-shop or
"two; but a Nonconformist nucleus, that intermarried, as Sergeant"
"Walker or Walcker had done, with Belgian women and left descendants"
"who in the third generation--and by inherent vigour, thrift,"
matrimony and conversion--had built up quite a numerous
"congregation, which even grew large enough and rich enough to"

"steel stairs, was the one he needed to penetrate. It contained all the"
"computer gear: flight control, navigation, and most importantly, the"
artificial intelligence (AI) system for pilot interface and backup.
He suddenly found himself thinking a strange thought. Since no air-
"breathing vehicle had ever flown hypersonic, every component in this"
"plane was, in a sense, untested. To his mind, though, that was merely"
one more argument for shutting down the damned AI system's override
"functions before he went hypersonic. If something did go wrong, he"
wanted this baby on manual. He only needed the computer to alert him to
potential problems. The solutions he'd have to work out with his own
"brain. And balls. After all, that's why he was there."
"As he walked down the steel steps, he thumbed through the magnetic"
"cards, praying he had the one needed to open the lower bay and access"
the computers. Then he began inserting them one by one into the green
"metallic slot, trying to keep his hand steady in the freezing cold."
"Finally one worked. The three encoded diodes blinked, and a hydraulic"
"arm automatically slid the port open. Next the interior lights came on,"
an orange high-voltage sodium glow illuminating the gray walls.
"This third bay, like the two above it, was big enough to stand in. As"
"he stepped in, he glanced back up the stairs, then quickly resealed the"
"door. Off went the lights again, so he withdrew his penlight and turned"
to start searching for what he wanted.
Directly in front of him was a steel monolith with banks of toggle

whimperings and by laying their rough heads caressingly against La
Giralda's short and primitive skirt and leather-cased legs.
In a few moments after they had reached the pavilion the Princess came
"shouting back. She was certainly a most jovial little person, Spanish at"
"all points, with great dark eyes and cheeks apple-red with good health"
and the sharp airs of the Guadarrama. Doña Susana had walked a little in
"front of La Giralda and her flock, to show the superiority of her"
"position, and also, it may be, to display the amplitude of her several"
"chins, by holding them in the air in a manner as becoming as it was"
dignified.
"""Milk them! Milk them quickly! Let me see!"" the Princess shouted,"
clanging the pails joyously together. The walls of the pavilion in which
La Giralda found herself were decorated with every kind of household
"utensil, but not such as had ever been used practically. Everything was"
of silver or silver-gilt. There was indeed a complete _batterie de
"cuisine_--saucepans, patty-pans, graters, a mincing machine with the"
"proper screws and handles, shining rows of lids, and a complete"
graduated series of cooking spoons stuck in a bandolier. Salad dishes of
"sparkling crystal bound with silver ornamented the sideboard, while"
various earthen pots and pans of humbler make stood on a curiously
designed stove under whose polished top no fire had ever burned. At
"least so it appeared to La Giralda, who, much impressed by the"
"magnificence of the installation, would promptly have driven her goats"
out again.
But this the little Isabel would by no means permit.
"""Here--here!"" she commanded, ""this is mine--my very own. My mother has a"
"fell down dead upon the stage, and so was carried thence away by"
"his lords and gentlemen, and then the music ceased. Hereby was"
"signified, that as glass by nature holdeth no poison, but is clear"
"and may easily be seen through, ne boweth by any art; so a faithful"
"counsellor holdeth no treason, but is plain and open, ne yieldeth"
"to any indiscreet affection, but giveth wholesome counsel, which"
the ill advised prince refuseth. The delightful gold filled with
"poison betokeneth flattery, which under fair seeming of pleasant"
"words beareth deadly poison, which destroyeth the prince that"
"receiveth it. As befel in the two brethren, Ferrex and Porrex, who,"
"refusing the wholesome advice of grave counsellors, credited these"
"young parasites, and brought to themselves death and destruction"
thereby.
But it is time to set forth the plot in more detail. The importance of
_Gorboduc_ as an example of English 'classical' tragedy prompts us to
"follow it through, scene by scene."
"_Act I, Scene 1._--Queen Videna discovers to her favourite and elder"
"son, Ferrex, the king's intention, grievous in her eyes, of dividing his"
kingdom equally between his two sons. _Scene 2._--King Gorboduc submits
"his plan to the consideration of his three counsellors, whose wise and"
lengthy reasonings he listens to but elects to disregard.
"_Act II, Scene 1._--The division having been carried out, Ferrex, in his"
"part of the kingdom, is prompted by evil counsel to suspect aggressive"
"rivalry from his brother, and decides to collect forces for his own"
defence. _Scene 2._--Ferrex's misguided precautions having been
"maliciously represented to Porrex as directed against his power, that"
prince resolves upon an immediate invasion of his brother's realm.
_Act III._--The news of these counter-moves and of the imminent
accompanied by the duchess and a gentleman in waiting. The visit was made
incognito.
"As a result of this royal visit, which was made for the purpose of seeing"
"Frances, a part of Sir Richard's estates near St. Albans were restored to"
"him, and from poverty he rose at once to a comfortable income of, say, a"
thousand or twelve hundred pounds a year.
"Immediately all of Sir Richard's hatred of Charles II fell away, and once"
more the king shone in the resplendent light of his divine appointment.
"While Frances estimated the king's generosity at its true value, she was"
"glad her father had received even a small part of what was his just due,"
"and although she knew the restoration had been made to please, and, if"
"possible, to win her, she was glad to have spoiled the royal Philistine,"
"and despised him more than ever before, if that were possible."
"Sir Richard's good fortune brought a gleam of joy to Frances, but it also"
"brought a pang of regret, because it had come too late. Her only purpose"
in going to Whitehall had been to marry a rich nobleman and thereby raise
"the fallen fortunes of her house. Now that reason existed no longer, and"
"if George were here, she could throw herself away upon him with injury to"
"no one but herself. But George was not here, and liberty to throw herself"
away had come too late to be of any value.
"Every day during the fortnight that Frances remained at home, she asked"
"if I had any news from court, meaning the French court, but using the"
form of inquiry to avoid acquainting her father and Sarah with the real
cause of her solicitude.
"But my answers were always, ""Oh, nothing but Castlemain's new tantrum,"""
"or ""The duke's defeat at pall-mall."""
is the decisive revolution that overtook the sustaining conviction of
"the Church. The central conception, that the universe was called into"
"existence only to further its Creator's purpose toward man, became"
incredible (by the light of the new thought). What seems to careless
"observers a mere metaphysical dispute was in truth, _and still is, the"
decisive quarter of the great battle between theology and a philosophy
"reconcilable with science_.""--Morley."
"""The man _who ventured to use his mind_ [Diderot] was thrown into the"
"dungeon at Vincennes.""--Ibid."

reason; reasoning well leads to acting well; justness in the mind
becomes justice in the heart. Those toilers for progress labored
usefully.... The French Revolution was their soul. It was their radiant
manifestation. It came from them; we find them everywhere in that blest
"and superb catastrophe, which formed the conclusion of the past and the"
"opening of the future.... The new society, the desire for equality"
"and concession, and that beginning of fraternity which called itself"
"tolerance, reciprocal good-will, the just accord of men and rights,"

"said, 'for intruding on their privacy.' But what they would do to him"
after the confiscation no one seemed to be quite sure. I asked the
"official who was with me, a fine handsome Burman who had been with us in"

"there were two very sacrilegious men, hunters by profession, only more"
"abandoned than even the majority of hunters, and they went into this"
"wood to hunt 'They didn't care for Nats,' they said. They didn't care"
"for anything at all apparently. 'They were absolutely without reverence,"
"worse than any beast,' said my companion."
"So they went into the wood to shoot, and they never came out again. A"
"few days later their bare bones were found, flung out upon the road near"
the enchanted wood. The Nats did not care to have even the bones of such
"scoundrels in their wood, and so thrust them out. That was what happened"
"to them, and that was what might happen to us if we went in there. We"
did not go.
Though the Nats of the forest will not allow even one of their beasts to
"be slain, the Nats of the rivers are not so exclusive. I do not think"
fish are ever regarded in quite the same light as animals. It is true
CHAPTER II
WANDERJAHRE--SOCIAL LIFE IN SCOTLAND--BEGINNING OF HIS LITERARY LIFE
In the present century in Germany we have seen a period of almost
unparalleled literary glory succeeded by a time of great commercial
prosperity and national enthusiasm. But when Ferrier visited that
country in 1834 the era of its intellectual greatness had hardly passed
"away; some, at least, of its stars remained, and others had very"
"recently ceased to be. Goethe had died just two years before, but Heine"
"lived till many years afterwards; amongst the philosophers, though Kant"
"and Fichte, of course, were long since gone, Schelling was still at"
"work at Munich, and Hegel lived at Berlin till November of 1831, when"
he was cut off during an epidemic of cholera. Most of the great men had
"disappeared, and yet the memory of their achievements still survived,"
and the impetus they gave to thought could not have been lost. The
traditional lines of speculation consistently carried out since
"Reformation days had survived war and national calamity, and it"
remained to be seen whether the greater tests of prosperity and success
would be as triumphantly undergone.
We can imagine Ferrier's feelings when this new world opened up before
"him, a Scottish youth, to whom it was a new, untrodden country. It may"
be true that it was his literary rather than his speculative affinities
that first attracted him to Germany. To form in literature he always
"attached the greatest value, and to the end his interest in letters was"
only second to his attachment to philosophy. German poetry was to him
"There is a song well known to all the Burmese, the words of which are"
"taken from the sacred writings. It is called the story of Ma Pa Da, and"
"it was first told to me by a Burmese monk, long ago, when I was away on"
the frontier.
It runs like this:
"In the time of the Buddha, in the city of Thawatti, there was a certain"
"rich man, a merchant, who had many slaves. Slaves in those days, and,"
"indeed, generally throughout the East, were held very differently to"
"slaves in Europe. They were part of the family, and were not saleable"
"without good reason, and there was a law applicable to them. They were"
"not _hors de la loi_, like the slaves of which we have conception. There"
"are many cases quoted of sisters being slaves to sisters, and of"
"brothers to brothers, quoted not for the purpose of saying that this"
"was an uncommon occurrence, but merely of showing points of law in such"
cases.
"One day in the market the merchant bought another slave, a young man,"
"handsome and well mannered, and took him to his house, and kept him"
there with his family and the other slaves. The young man was earnest
"and careful in his work, and the merchant approved of him, and his"
"fellow-slaves liked him. But Ma Pa Da, the merchant's daughter, fell in"
"love with him. The slave was much troubled at this, and he did his best"
"to avoid her; but he was a slave and under orders, and what could he do?"
"When she would come to him secretly and make love to him, and say, 'Let"
"us flee together, for we love each other,' he would refuse, saying that"
"he was a slave, and the merchant would be very angry. He said he could"
"not do such a thing. And yet when the girl said, 'Let us flee, for we"
"love each other,' he knew that it was true, and that he loved her as she"
loved him; and it was only his honour to his master that held him from

white patch of a sail showed vaguely through the gathering gloom.
Their black armor stood out ghostly against the ascetic trunks of the
"trees. Grim silence prevailed, and so immobile was their attitude,"
"that they might have been taken for stone images of a dead, gone age."
"The wind cried restlessly amid the trees, gusty at intervals, but"
tuning its mood to a desolate and constant moan. The woods seemed full
of a vague woe and of troubled breathings. The trees seemed to sway to
"one another, to fling strange words with the tossing of hair and"
"outstretched hands. The furze in the valley, swept and harrowed,"
undulated like a green lagoon.
"Between the hills and the cliff lay the marshes, threaded by a meagre"
stream that quavered through the green. A poison mist hung over them
despite the wind. The mournful clangor of a bell came up from the
"valley, with a vague sound as of voices chanting."
After a time the bell ceased pulsing. In its stead sounded a faint
"eerie whimper, an occasional shrill cry that startled the moorlands,"
leaped out of silence like a bubble from a pool where death has been.
The men were shaken from their strained vigilance as by a wind. The
"utter gray of the hour seemed to stifle them, then a sound stumbled"
"out of the silence and set them listening. It dwindled and grew again,"
came nearer: it was the smite of hoofs in the wood-ways. The rider
"dismounted, tethered his foam-flecked steed to a tree and stumbled up"
"to where the Duke of Spoleto and Francesco stood, their gaze riveted"
upon the ghostly masonry of Astura.
Panting and exhausted he faced the twain.
"""They have all died on the scaffold,"" he said with a hoarse, rasping"
"be of Orphic origin. They were buried with the dead, and for this"
reason were more outspoken in their references to the mystic doctrines
than was permissible in epitaphs exposed to the vulgar gaze. The most
"complete of these tablets is one which was found near Sybaris, and,"
"with the exception of the last sentence of all, the inscription is in"
"hexameter verse. Miss Harrison, to whose work I am wholly indebted for"
"this valuable evidence, translates as follows[1505]:"
"‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,"
Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.
"For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,"
But Fate laid me low and the other Gods immortal
... starflung thunderbolt.
I have flown out of the sorrowful weary Wheel.
I have passed with eager feet to the Circle desired.
"I have sunk beneath the bosom of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld."
I have passed with eager feet from the Circle desired.
"Happy and Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal."
A kid I have fallen into milk.’
The gist of the document which the dead man takes with him is then
briefly this. He claims to have been pure originally and of the same
"race as his gods; but as a man he was mortal and exposed to death,"
and in this respect differed from his gods. He states however that he
has performed certain ritual acts which entitle him to be re-admitted
to the pure fellowship of the gods now that death is passed. And the
"answer comes, ‘Thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
Now here I wish to consider one only of these ritual acts--that one of
which the meaning is clearest--Δεσποίνας δ’ ὑπὸ κόλπον ἔδυν χθονίας
"βασιλείας, which means, if I may give my own rendering, ‘I was admitted"
"to the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the under-world.’ The phrase"
It may be added that neither in the one Lagoon nor in the other are
"there any private, proprietary rights to coral outcrops. The whole"
"community of Sinaketa have their fishing grounds in the Lagoon,"
"within which every man may hunt for his spondylus shell, and catch"
"his fish at times. If the other spondylus fishing community, the"
"Vakutans, encroached upon their grounds, there would be trouble,"
"and in olden days, fighting. Private ownership in coral outcrops"
"exists in the Northern villages of the Lagoon, that is in Kavataria,"
and the villages on the island of Kayleula.
III
We must now follow the later stages of the kaloma industry. The
technology of the proceedings is so mixed up with remarkable
sociological and economic arrangements that it will be better to
indicate it first in its main outlines. The spondylus consists of a
"shell, the size and shape of a hollowed out half of a pear, and of a"
"flat, small lid. It is only the first part which is worked. First"
it has to be broken into pieces with a binabina or an utukema
(green stone imported from Woodlark Island) as shown on Plate L
"(A). On each piece, then, can be seen the stratification of the"
"shell: the outside layer of soft, chalky substance; under this, the"
"layer of red, hard, calcareous material, and then the inmost, white,"
crystalline stratum. Both the outside and inside have to be rubbed
"off, but first each piece has to be roughly rounded up, so as to form"
"a thick circular lump. Such a lump (see foregrounds of Plates L (A),"
L (B)) is then put in the hole of a cylindrical piece of wood. This
latter serves as a handle with which the lumps are rubbed on a piece
of flat sandstone (see Plate L (B)). The rubbing is carried on so far
"""Thanks for the compliment, Breck, but I'm your computer for this trip,"
"anyway. Newton, the good old egg, knows what you fellows are up against"
"and is going to do something about it, if he has to lick all the rest of"
the directors to do it. He knew that I was loose for a couple of weeks
and asked me to come along this trip to see what I could see. I'm to
check the observatory data--they don't know I'm aboard--take the peaks
"and valleys off your acceleration curve, if possible, and report to"
Newton just what I find out and what I think should be done about it.
"How early am I?"" While the newcomer was talking, he had stripped the"
covers from a precise scale model of the solar system and from a large
and complicated calculating machine and had set to work without a wasted
motion or instant--scaling off upon the model the positions of the
various check-stations and setting up long and involved integrals and
equations upon the calculator.
"The older man studied the broad back of the younger, bent over his"
"computations, and a tender, almost fatherly smile came over his careworn"
face as he replied:
"""Early? You? Just like you always were--plus fifteen seconds on the"
"deadline. The final dope is due right now."" He plugged the automatic"
"recorder and speaker into a circuit marked ""Observatory,"" waited until"
"a tiny light above the plug flashed green, and spoke."
"""IPV _Arcturus_; Breckenridge, Chief Pilot; trip number forty-three"

the plane of the ecliptic. The ether will be clear for you along route
"human weakness, though you might not think it. I joined the ship on"
"Thursday afternoon, slipping in as one of a detachment of fifty"
R.M.L.I. who had been wired for from Chatham. They were an emergency
lot; we hadn't enough in the ship for the double sentry go that I
"wanted. All my plans were made with the Commander and Major Boyle, and"
they both did exactly what I told them. It isn't often that a private
of Marines has the ordering about of two officers. But Dawson is
"Dawson; no common man. They did as I told them, and were glad to do"
it. I had extra light bulbs put on all over the lower decks and every
dark corner lit up--except one. Just one. And this one was where the
four gun-cables ran out of the switch-room and lay alongside one
another before they branched off to the fore and after turrets and to
the port and starboard side batteries. That was the most likely spot
"which any one wanting to cut the gun-wires would mark down, and I"
meant to watch it pretty closely myself. We had double sentries at the
"magazines. The _Malplaquet_ is an oil-fired ship, so we hadn't any"
bothering coal bunkers to attract fancy bombs. I was pretty sure that
after the _Antinous_ and the _Antigone_ we had mostly wire-cutting to
"fear. When a man has done one job successfully, and repeated it almost"
"successfully, he is pretty certain to have a third shot. Besides, if"
"one is out to delay a ship, cutting wires is as good a way as any. I"
"had an idea that my man was not a bomber."""
"""I thought that you scorned theories,"" I put in dryly. ""When they are"
"wrong they mislead you, and when they are right they are no help."""
"Dawson frowned. ""Shut up, Copplestone,"" snapped Cary."
"""We were in no danger from the lighting, heating, and telephone wires,"
for any defect would have been visible at once. It was the gun and
gunnery control cables that were the weak spots. So I had L.T.O.'s
"posted in the spotting top, the conning tower, the transmission room,"
CHAPTER XVII
THE GERMANS IN BRUSSELS: 1915-1916
"In the early spring of 1915, Vivie, anxious not to see her mother in"
"utter penury, and despairing of any effective assistance from the"
Americans (very much prejudiced against her for the reasons already
"mentioned), took her mother's German and Belgian securities of a"
"face value amounting to about £18,000 and sold them at her Belgian"
"bank for a hundred thousand francs (£4,000) in Belgian or German"
"bank notes. She consulted no one, except her mother. Who was there"
to consult? She did not like to confide too much to Colonel von
"Giesselin, a little too prone in any case to ""protect"" them. But as"
"she argued with Mrs. Warren, what else were they to do in their"
"cruel situation? If the Allies were eventually victorious, Mrs."
Warren could return to England. There at least she had in safe
"investments £40,000, ample for the remainder of their lives. If"
"Germany lost the War, the German securities nominally worth two"
hundred thousand marks might become simply waste paper; even now
they were only computed by the bank at a purchase value of about one
fifth what they had stood at before the War. If Germany were
"victorious or agreed to a compromise peace, her mother's shares in"
Belgian companies might be unsaleable. Better to secure now a lump
sum of four thousand pounds in bank notes that would be legal
"currency, at any rate as long as the German occupation lasted. And"
"as one never knew what might happen, it was safer still to have all"
"this money (equivalent to a hundred thousand francs), in their own"
"keeping. They could live even in war time, on such a sum as this"
"for four, perhaps five years, as they would be very economical and"
Vivie would try to earn all she could by teaching. It was useless to
hope they would be able to return to Villa Beau-séjour so long as
"""My lord,"" he said, ""I have to thank you for many acts of kindness and"
"courtesy, and a certain liberality of treatment which I have received at"
"your hands and within your doors.  In taking my farewell, I wish freely"
to acknowledge all this debt.  But other matters which I need not
"specify, yet which are well understood by your lordship, have transpired"
to change the relations betwixt us; and I wish to add that I desire to
be beholden to no man.  In the rooms allotted to me in your lordship’s
"house there is a quantity of wearing apparel, jewels, trinkets, for"
"which I have no more use.  I pray you have them sold, and the amount"
thus realized will reimburse you for all charges you have been at in my
maintenance during the time I have dwelt beneath your roof. That is all
"I have to say.—Gentlemen, I wish you a very good day."""
"And lifting his hat with quiet dignity and grace, Grey made them a"
general salute and turned upon his heel.
"But Lord Sandford’s voice came thundering after him. ""Do you desire to"
"insult me, sir?  Am I a beggarly inn-keeper, that I should sell a"
guest’s belongings to pay my bill?  What do you mean by such words?  Do
"you desire that I should demand satisfaction for them at your hands?"""
Grey did not know whether this man desired to fasten a quarrel upon him
"or not, and, truth to tell, he did not care.  He just turned his head"
"over his shoulder, and threw back an answer in tones of scarcely veiled"
contempt.
"""That is for your lordship to decide.  I shall have pleasure in giving"
"any satisfaction demanded at any time, and in any place appointed.  For"
"the rest, a man who has sought to compass the death of a comrade by a"
foul trick need scarcely fear to soil his hands by the touch of his
"gold.  Again I wish you good-day, my lord."""
beliefs remain.
It is true that the taking of life is against Buddhist commands. No life
at all may be taken by him who adheres to Buddhistic teaching. Neither
"for sport, nor for revenge, nor for food, may any animal be deprived of"
the breath that is in it. And this is a command wonderfully well kept.
"There are a few exceptions, but they are known and accepted as breaches"
"of the law, for the law itself knows no exceptions. Fish, as I have"
"said, can be obtained almost everywhere. They are caught in great"
"quantities in the river, and are sold in most bazaars, either fresh or"
salted. It is one of the staple foods of the Burmese. But although they
"will eat fish, they despise the fisherman. Not so much, perhaps, as if"
"he killed other living things, but still, the fisherman is an outcast"
from decent society. He will have to suffer great and terrible
punishment before he can be cleansed from the sins that he daily
"commits. Notwithstanding this, there are many fishermen in Burma."
A fish is a very cold-blooded beast. One must be very hard up for
something to love to have any affection to spare upon fishes. They
"cannot be, or at all events they never are, domesticated, and most of"
them are not beautiful. I am not aware that they have ever been known to
"display any attachment to anyone, which accounts, perhaps, for the"
comparatively lenient eye with which their destruction is contemplated.
"For with warm-blooded animals it is very different. Cattle, as I have"
"said, can never be killed nor their meat sold by a Burman, and with"
other animals the difficulty is not much less.
"I was in Upper Burma for some months before the war, and many a time I"
could get no meat at all. Living in a large town among prosperous
"people, I could get no flesh at all, only fish and rice and vegetables."
"When, after much trouble, my Indian cook would get me a few fowls, he"
"own methods of salvation for Corsica were rejected, he tore himself"
away and threw his undivided energies into the Revolution.
Yet the records of his early life show that in his character there was
a strain of true sentiment and affection. In him Nature carved out a
"character of rock-like firmness, but she adorned it with flowers of"
human sympathy and tendrils of family love. At his first parting from
"his brother Joseph at Autun, when the elder brother was weeping"
"passionately, the little Napoleon dropped a tear: but that, said the"
"tutor, meant as much as the flood of tears from Joseph. Love of his"
relatives was a potent factor of his policy in later life; and slander
has never been able wholly to blacken the character of a man who loved
"and honoured his mother, who asserted that her advice had often been"
"of the highest service to him, and that her justice and firmness of"
spirit marked her out as a natural ruler of men. But when these
"admissions are freely granted, it still remains true that his"
character was naturally hard; that his sense of personal superiority
"made him, even as a child, exacting and domineering; and the sequel"
"was to show that even the strongest passion of his youth, his"
"determination to free Corsica from France, could be abjured if"
"occasion demanded, all the force of his nature being thenceforth"
concentrated on vaster adventures.

CHAPTER II
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND CORSICA
"largely, if not entirely, by reason of its reversion to classical"
principles and devices.
"We have insisted on the difference between Tragedy and Pathos, and"
criticized the weakening effect of the latter upon the former. To escape
the penalty that awaits general criticism we may add here that Tragedy
is never greater than when her handmaid is ready to do her _modest_
"service. Sophocles puts into the mouth of Oedipus, at the moment of his"
"departure into blind and desolate exile, tender injunctions regarding"
the care of his young daughters:
"But my poor maidens, hapless and forlorn,"
"Who never had a meal apart from mine,"
"But ever shared my table, yea, for them"
"Take heedful care; and grant me, though but once,"
"Yea, I beseech thee, with these hands to feel,"
"Thou noble heart! the forms I love so well,"
And weep with them our common misery.
"Oh, if my arms were round them, I might seem"
To have them as of old when I could see.[52]
"Shakespeare, too, knew well how to kindle the soft radiance which,"
"fading again, makes the ensuing darkness darker still. Ophelia, the"
"sleeping Duncan, Cordelia rise to our minds. Nor need we quote the"
famous words of Webster's Ferdinand. It is enough that the greatest
scene in _Gorboduc_ is precisely that scene where pathos softens by a
momentary dimness of vision our horror at a mother's crime.
"_The Misfortunes of Arthur_ (1587), by Thomas Hughes, though twenty-five"
"years later, may be placed next to _Gorboduc_ in our discussion of the"
rise of tragedy. It will serve as an illustration of the kind of tragedy
that was being evolved from Senecan models by plodding uninspired
"Mr. Justin Carthew, on the other hand, is related to the family in a"
"very different and distant degree, and there are, as y'r ludship has"
"been good enough to agree, no other survivors."
"""I beg leave now to request that y'r ludship will rescind the authority"
"granted to Mr. Justin Carthew, and admit my client's petition _ad"
"referendum_."""
"""Produce your proofs,"" ordered his lordship, and Mr. Spettigrew"
extracted from a capacious black bag a pile of papers at which Mr.
Justice Gaunt looked with no little disgust.
"""What are they, in chief?"" asked Mr. Justice Gaunt, turning over page"
"after page of closely written law-script, as gingerly as if he believed"
that one might perhaps explode and blow him to pieces. And Mr.
"Spettigrew launched forth again into a long list of certificates,"
"records, researches, findings, orders of court, sworn statements and"
"affidavits, by Captain Dove--""Then trading in his own ship, m'lud, now"
"retired and devoting his time to mission-work among deep-sea sailors;"""
"by Mr. Jasper Slyne, gentleman; by Mr. Jobling, whom he did not pause"
"to describe; by a couple of dozen other people, living or dead, at home"
or abroad; all in due legal form and not to be controverted.
"""I think you'll find them in perfect order, and absolutely conclusive,"
"m'lud,"" counsel came to a finish triumphantly, and sat down, greatly to"
the relief of all present.
"""H'm!"" said his lordship, still gravely regarding Sallie: whose eyes had"
"nothing to conceal from him. ""And so this is the long-lost Lady"
"Josceline!"""
"His searching glance travelled slowly to Captain Dove's face, and then"
"were reprinted by Froben. On his return journey, Erasmus, whose work had"
"been hampered all through the summer by indisposition, and who had, on"
"that account, been unable to finish it, fell seriously ill. He reached"
"Louvain with difficulty (21 September 1518). It might be the pestilence,"
"and Erasmus, ever much afraid of contagion himself, now took all"
precautions to safeguard his friends against it. He avoided his quarters
"in the College of the Lily, and found shelter with his most trusted"
"friend, Dirck Maertensz, the printer. But in spite of rumours of the"
"plague and his warnings, first Dorp and afterwards also Ath came, at"
"once, to visit him. Evidently the Louvain professors did not mean so"
"badly by him, after all."
[Illustration: XVIII. Title-page of the New Testament printed by Froben
in 1520]
But the differences between Erasmus and the Louvain faculty were deeply
"rooted. Lee, hurt by the little attention paid by Erasmus to his"
"objections, prepared a new critique, but kept it from Erasmus, for the"
"present, which irritated the latter and made him nervous. In the"
"meantime a new opponent arose. Directly after his return to Louvain,"
Erasmus had taken much trouble to promote the establishment of the
"_Collegium Trilingue_, projected and endowed by Jerome Busleiden, in his"
"testament, to be founded in the university. The three biblical"
"languages, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, were to be taught there. Now when"
"James Latomus, a member of the theological faculty and a man whom he"
"esteemed, in a dialogue about the study of those three languages and of"
"theology, doubted the utility of the former, Erasmus judged himself"
"concerned, and answered Latomus in an _Apologia_. About the same time"
(spring 1519) he got into trouble with the vice-chancellor himself.
Erasmus thought that Ath had publicly censured him with regard to his
"'Praise of Marriage', which had recently appeared. Though Ath withdrew"
"at once, Erasmus could not abstain from writing an _Apologia_, however"
"would be a further reduction. That was quite true. Bob knew, because he"
had had a vast deal of experience with the trust’s method of doing
"business. They would ruin him, no matter how great the cost, because he"
was dangerous to their continued well-being. With Bainbridge in the
"ring, and fighting vigorously against the graft and wholesale theft of"
"timberlands, those juicy melon cuttings which had been so pleasing to"
the stockholders would cease--therefore Bainbridge must go.
"Presently Bob’s eyes fell again to the letter, and somehow that single"
sentence seemed to stand out as if written in capitals: “It hurts like
"sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left to do but give in and make"
the best terms we can.”
"For a second Bob stared, the blood rushing into his face, a crimson"
"flood. Make terms with Crane? Go on his knees to that scoundrel, who had"
long ago parted with the last shred of decency and self-respect? Not
much!
"They must have resources enough to meet that note, at least. The trust"
could not keep the price of lumber down indefinitely. They must weather
"the storm in some way. And when this drive was safe at the mills, ready"
"to be cut into lumber, they would have the laugh on Elihu Crane."
"Oblivious to the men about him, even to the fact that the cook had some"
"time ago announced supper, Bainbridge began to search his mind for means"
of staving off the evil day. Most of the stocks and bonds constituting
his private fortune had been already pledged as collateral for loans to
the firm. He still had a few thousand dollars’ worth of Steel Preferred
"which could be sold; and there was Pinecrest, the beautiful and costly"
"home on the outskirts of Bangor, which had been left him by his father."
"It should not be difficult to raise a mortgage of ten thousand, at"
"least, on the place."
controlled himself for a whole week then there was a touching farewell
"scene between the two friends, which ended as a rule in the"
"eating-house of Vaviloff.  The teacher did not spend all his money, but"
spent at least half on the children of the main street.  The poor are
"always rich in children, and in the dirt and ditches of this street"
"there were groups of them from morning to night, hungry, naked and"
"dirty.  Children are the living flowers of the earth, but these had the"
"appearance of flowers that have faded prematurely, because they grew in"
ground where there was no healthy nourishment.  Often the teacher would
"gather them round him, would buy them bread, eggs, apples and nuts, and"
take them into the fields by the river side.  There they would sit and
"greedily eat everything he offered them, after which they would begin"
"to play, filling the fields for a mile around with careless noise and"
"laughter.  The tall, thin figure of the drunkard towered above these"
"small people, who treated him familiarly, as if he were one of their"
"own age.  They called him ""Philip,"" and did not trouble to prefix"
"""Uncle"" to his name. Playing around him, like little wild animals, they"
"pushed him, jumped upon his back, beat him upon his bald head, and"
"caught hold of his nose. All this must have pleased him, as he did not"
"protest against such liberties.  He spoke very little to them, and when"
he did so he did it cautiously as if afraid that his words would hurt
or contaminate them.  He passed many hours thus as their companion and
"plaything, watching their lively faces with his gloomy eyes.  Then he"
would thoughtfully and slowly direct his steps to the eatinghouse of
"Vaviloff, where he would drink silently and quickly till all his senses"
left him.

"Almost every day after his reporting he would bring a newspaper, and"
then gather round him all these creatures that once were men.
He was near singing more than once. The place was astir with the sound
"of Betty’s skirts, the echo of her gaiety, the sound of her light"
footstep. The air was sweet with the breath of her uncomplaining
good-nature.
"He shut up the bag, tied a label upon it, put on his cloak and hat,"
"blew out the candle, and softly let himself out of the room."
In the darkness Noll stood upon the bridge at the end of the Boule
"Miche, the pleasant highway of youth. But he now knew no indecisions."
He realized that his mere intellect had led him into the veriest
pedantries--had nearly led him into irretrievable blunders. He saw that
"man’s highest was rooted in the body, that heaven was no fantastic"
"dream, but here and now for the winning on this healthy brown earth."
"He had been letting it slip by him, whilst he dreamed of pasteboard"
nothingnesses.
He realized that the emotion felt was nearer to the centre of life than
"all thought. He cast from him the devil of mere intellect, and it went"
"out of him demurely into the darkness, like some poor thin-souled nun,"
who crushes down into barrenness the splendid emotions of the life
"within her which are her very godhood, in fantastic hope to win an"
"eternity of vague bliss, she who by the very act shows her inability"
"to enjoy bliss--for, heaven and hell and all the eternities shall"
yield her no such bliss as the dear human loves may do--the æons of
immortality shall never bring her the delight that she might know in an
hour of a lover’s embrace or the dear touch of a nestling child at her
lean breasts.
"As the awakened youth stood there, the black night passed over the edge"
merely repeated what was whispered to her; hence a chat with her was
"always interesting to one who, like myself, was paid to keep his ears"
open and report from time to time the direction of the political wind.
"Tournier, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his wife were her"
most intimate friends; hence she was frequently aware of facts which
"were of considerable importance to us.  Indeed, once or twice her"
friendliness for myself had caused her to drop hints which had been of
the greatest use to Lord Barmouth in the conduct of his difficult
diplomacy at that time when the boulevard journals were screaming
"against England and the filthy prints were caricaturing Her Majesty,"
with intent to insult.  Even the _Figaro_--the moderate organ of the
French Foreign Office--had lost its self-control in the storm of abuse
"following the Fashoda incident, and had libelled and maligned ""les"
"English.""  I therefore seized the opportunity for a chat with the"
"wizen-faced old lady, who seemed in a particularly good-humour, and"
deftly turned the conversation into the political channel.
"""Now, tell me, Baronne,"" I said, after we had been chatting some little"
"time, and I had learnt more than one important fact regarding the"
"intentions of Tournier, ""what is your opinion regarding the occupation"
"of Ceuta?"""
"She glanced at me quickly, as though surprised that I should be aware of"
what she had believed to be an entire secret.
"""Of Ceuta?"" she echoed.  ""And what do you at your Embassy know regarding"
"it?"""
"""We've heard a good deal,"" I laughed."
"""No doubt you've heard a good deal that is untrue,"" the clever old lady"
Abyedok was always the first to propose dreadful plans to effect the
"desired end, but the Captain, always first in every other argument, did"
"not join in this one.  They also spoke much and impudently about women,"
"but the teacher always defended them, and sometimes was very angry when"
"they went so far as to pass the limits of decency.  They all, as a"
"rule, gave in to him, because they did not look upon him as a common"
"person, and also because they wished to borrow from him on Saturdays"
the money which he had earned during the week.  He had many privileges.
"They never beat him, for instance, on these occasions when the"
conversation ended in a free fight.  He had the right to bring women
"into the dosshouse; a privilege accorded to no one else, as the Captain"
had previously warned them.
"""No bringing of women to my house,"" he had said. ""Women, merchants and"
"philosophers, these are the three causes of my ruin.  I will horsewhip"
anyone bringing in women.  I will horsewhip the woman also....  And as
"to the philosopher I'll knock his head off for him.""  And"
"notwithstanding his age he could have knocked anyone's head off, for he"
"possessed wonderful strength.  Besides that, whenever he fought or"
"quarrelled, he was assisted by Martyanoff, who was accustomed during a"
"general fight to stand silently and sadly back to back with Kuvalda,"
when he became an all-destroying and impregnable engine of war.  Once
"when Simtsoff was drunk, he rushed at the teacher for no reason"
"whatever, and getting hold of his head tore out a bunch of hair."
"Kuvalda, with one stroke of his fist in the other's chest sent him"
"spinning, and he fell to the ground.  He was unconscious for almost"
"half-an-hour, and when he came to himself, Kuvalda compelled him to eat"
"the hair he had torn from the teacher's head. He ate it, preferring"
this to being beaten to death.
"Besides reading newspapers, fighting and indulging in general"
"conversation, they amused themselves by playing cards.  They played"
"he was, notwithstanding, a rather notable figure as he stood looking"
gravely and thoughtfully downwards; there was something very graceful in
"his attitude, and in the carriage of his head, and his features were so"
remarkably handsome that Lady Romaine turned her eyes upon him many
"times, and exerted all her artifices to draw him back to her immediate"
"neighbourhood.  But he was perfectly unconscious of this, not hearing"
"the chatter which went on about him, lost in some reverie of his own,"
which brought a peculiar dreamy softness into his eyes.
"Lord Sandford, following the direction of Geraldine’s glance, looked at"
"this motionless figure, then back at the girl, and laughed."
"""Lady Geraldine, pray permit me to present to you my newly-made friend"
"and comrade, Sir Grey Dumaresq, who, I doubt not, is dying to make his"
"bow to so fair a lady."""
"She flashed him a glance half merry, half reproachful, and he suddenly"
"laid his hand upon his lips, a laugh rolling from them hearty and full."
"""I’ faith I had forgot!  How shall I teach my rebel tongue a new"
"language?  But Sir Grey will atone for all my defects.—Here is a lady,"
"if you will believe it, O friend, who loves not the sugared and honeyed"
"phrase of adulation, but seeks in all things truth, virtue, and I know"
not what else beside.  It is whispered to me that she is a mistress of
"all the _belles lettres_, and perchance a poetess herself."""
"""Nay, my lord,"" answered Geraldine, with a blush and a smile—""only one"
"who loves the poesy of those who have lived before, and left their"
"treasures for us who come after, and would fain drink in all the beauty"
"of their thoughts and of their lives."""
"Lord Sandford good-naturedly yielded his seat to Grey, whose sensitive"
"the paved floor of the miniature kitchen. Having arrived in which place,"
"her anger completely vanished, for a tankardful of rich warm goat's milk"
"was handed to her by La Giralda, and in this flowing bowl she soon"
forgot her woes.
"""You must come down to the palace and be paid,"" said the little girl;"
"""we are most of us very hungry there, and those who are not hungry are"
"thirsty. The waggons from Madrid have been stopped on the way, and all"
"the guards have gone to bring them back!"""
At this Doña Susana looked quickly across to the old goatherdess and
signalled that the little Princess was not to be informed of anything
she might happen to know.
"""You have not been in the town, I trust!"" said Doña Susana."
Now La Giralda could conscientiously have declared that she had never
"been within the gates of San Ildefonso in her life, but thinking that in"
"the circumstances the statement might appear a suspicious one, she"
modified it to a solemn declaration that she had come directly down from
"her farm on the mountain-side, as, indeed, they themselves had seen."
"Satisfied of her veracity, Doña Susana took her very independent and"
difficult charge by the hand and led the way towards the palace of La
"Granja, glimpses of which could be obtained through the foliage which"
was still everywhere verdant and abundant with the first freshness of
"spring--so high did the castle lie on the hill-slopes, and so enlivening"
"were the waste waters downthrown from the rocky crests of Peñalara,"
"whose snows glimmered through the trees, as it seemed, but a bowshot"
above their heads.
"The goats, each expecting their turn of milking, followed at her heels"
the Vakutans have never fished for kaloma in the Sanaroa Lagoon.
Now let us describe the technicalities and the ceremonial connected
with the fishing for kaloma. It will be better to give an account
"of how this is done in the Lagoon of Sinaketa, round the sandbank"
"of Nanoula, as this is the normal and typical form of kaloma"
"fishing. Moreover, when the Sinaketans do it in Sanaroa, the"
"proceedings are very much the same, with just one or two phases"
missed out.
The office of magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma) is hereditary in
"two sub-clans, belonging to the Malasi clan, and one of them is that"
"of the main chief of Kasi'etana. After the Monsoon season is over,"
"that is, some time in March or April, ogibukuvi (i.e., in the season"
of the new yams) the magician gives the order for preparations. The
"community give him a gift called sousula, one or two bringing a"
"vaygu'a, the rest supplying gugu'a (ordinary chattels), and some"
"food. Then they prepare the canoes, and get ready the binabina stones,"
with which the spondylus shell will be knocked off the reef.
"Next day, in the morning, the magician performs a rite called"
"'kaykwa'una la'i,' 'the attracting of the reef,' for, as in the"
"case of several other marine beings, the main seat of the kaloma is"
"far away. Its dwelling place is the reef Ketabu, somewhere between"
"Sanaroa and Dobu. In order to make it move and come towards Nanoula,"
it is necessary to recite the above-named spell. This is done by the
magician as he walks up and down on the Sinaketa beach and casts
"his words into the open, over the sea, towards the distant seat"
of the kaloma. The kaloma then 'stand up' (itolise) that is start
from their original coral outcrop (vatu) and come into the Lagoon of
"Sinaketa. This spell, I obtained from To'udavada, the present chief"
"of Kasi'etana, and descendant of the original giver of this shell,"
Somehow I suspected her of a deliberate intention to mislead me in this
"matter.  She was a shrewd woman, who only disclosed her secrets when it"
was to her own interests or the interests of her friends at the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to do so.  In Paris there is a vast network of French
"intrigue, and it behoves the diplomatist always to be wary lest he"
should fall into the pitfalls so cunningly prepared for him.  The
dividing line between truth and untruth is always so very difficult to
define in modern diplomacy.  It is when the European situation seems
most secure that the match is sufficiently near to fire the mine.
"Fortunate it is that the public, quick to accept anything that appears"
"in the daily journals, can be placed in a sense of false security by"
articles inspired by one or other of the embassies interested.  If it
"were not so, European panics would certainly be of frequent occurrence."
"My Chief sauntered by, chatting with his close personal friend, Prince"
"Olsoufieff, the Russian Ambassador, who looked a truly striking figure"
"in his white uniform, with the Cross of St. Andrew glittering at his"
"throat.  The latter, as he passed, exclaimed confidentially in Russian"
"to my Chief, who understood that language, having been first Secretary"
of Embassy in Petersburg earlier in his career:
"""Da, ya po-ni-mai-u.  Ya sam napishu.""  (""Yes, I understand.  I will"
"write for you myself."")"
"Keen antagonists in diplomacy though they very often were, yet in"
private life a firm friendship existed between the pair--a friendship
dating from the days when the one had been British Attache in Petersburg
and the other had occupied a position in the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs--that large grey building facing the Winter Palace.
"""The lion and the bear strolling together,"" laughed the toothless old"
"Baronne, after they had passed.  ""Olsoufieff is a charming man, but he"
"for me and I mustn't delay him. How long will you be?"""
"""What sort of news is it?"" asked Sallie, no less dubious than her maid"
"had been; and called her maid in, notwithstanding her well-founded"
doubts as to the nature of any news he could bring. For Slyne had held
"out to her the same lure that the serpent offered to Eve, and her"
womanly curiosity would not allow her to order him at once from her
domain.
"Slyne smiled slightly as he sat down in a basket-chair, to look about"
him while she was still busy within. The little after-saloon which had
"been her home for so long was finely furnished; more so, perhaps, than"
"was apparent to Slyne, whose taste in that respect inclined to the"
florid. But he could not help noticing how dainty and neat and feminine
"was its entire effect, with its cushioned cosy corners, snow-white"
curtains and draperies. Its purely fragrant atmosphere stirred even
Slyne's conscience a little.
"He lay back in his seat, and, gazing about him, recalled to mind all he"
had been able to learn as to Sallie's strange past. It all fitted in so
perfectly with the fabric of his wonderful new plans that he could find
no possible flaw in them. And when Sallie herself at length came out to
"him from her cabin, he was optimistically disposed to be very generous"
in his dealings with her.
"Fresh from her bath and doubly bewitching in her clinging, intimate"
"draperies, she met Slyne's glad, eager glance with grave, doubtful eyes,"
and ignored entirely the hand he held out to her as he sprang from his
"chair. But he affected not to notice her attitude of distrust, and,"
"greeting her gaily, saved his face by laying his outstretched hand on"
"another chair, which he set a little nearer his own."
"_Wounds of the omentum._--Here, again, I am unable to express any"
"opinion, although the supposition that hæmorrhage from this source took"
place is natural.
"Prolapse of omentum was comparatively rare, except in cases with large"
wounds; it was apparently seen with some frequency among patients who
"died rapidly on the field of battle. I only saw it twice, and on each"
occasion in shell wounds. The wounds from small-calibre bullets were as
a rule too small to allow of external prolapse.
"Fig. 89, however, illustrates a very interesting observation. A patient"
"in the German Ambulance in Heilbron, under Dr. Flockemann, died as a"
result of suppuration and hæmorrhage secondary to an injury to the
colon. At the autopsy a portion of the omentum was found adherent in the
"wound of exit, but it had not reached the external surface. The chief"
interest of the observation lies in the light it throws on the mechanism
of these injuries. It is impossible to conceive that a small-calibre
bullet coming into direct contact with the omentum could do anything but
"perforate it. It, therefore, appears clear that in a displacement like"
"that figured, only lateral impact occurred with the omentum, which was"
"carried along by the spin and rush of the bullet into the canal of exit,"
where it lodged.
[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Great Omentum carried by the bullet into an
exit track leading from the abdominal cavity. A. Outline of opening in
the peritoneum]
_Results of injury to the intestine._ 1. _Escape of contents and
infection of the peritoneal cavity._--I think there is little special to
be said on this subject. The escape of contents into the peritoneal
"cavity was by no means free, unless the injury was multiple. Thus in one"
"“Then I’ll go,” Frank decided. “I don’t like the idea of sitting around"
"the camp and letting you boys have all the fun. Besides,” he continued,"
"“if it is the messenger who is making the signals, you’ll need all the"
help you can get.”
"“Come running, then!” advised Jack, starting down the slope."
"As the reader will remember, the signal observed by the boys had been"
"built by Jimmie in the hope of attracting the attention of Ned, or of"
"Norman, the boy who had made himself so conspicuous that morning. In"
building the fires and creating the columns of dense white smoke by
"heaping on green boughs, the boy had not given serious thought to the"
effect his action might have on his chums.
"In fact, at the time of his leaving camp, he had not fully decided what"
"course to pursue, and for this reason he had not informed the boys of"
his intention to set a signal for the benefit of the mysterious Boy
"Scout. Even at the time of making the signal, he had no idea that it"
would actually draw his three chums away from the camp.
"He might have known what the effect would be, but, though he did stop to"
"consider for a moment, he did not take in the whole situation. Jimmie"
"usually acted on impulse, and so the signal lifted to the sky without"
any explanation having been made to the Boy Scouts who were certain to
see it.
It will be remembered that when Jimmie descended from the elevation
where the fires had been built he did so in order to hasten in the
direction of a smoke signal which he saw to the north. The result of
this was that he was out of the vicinity of the fires long before the
boys reached that point.
"The ledge was narrow, and as the bunch clung together where the leader"
"and his opponent still struggled, one of them slipped over the edge of"
the declivity and started downward. Naturally he caught hold of the
"first object within his reach, and this happened to be the shoe of the"
"outlaw nearest to him. This man, in turn, caught another, and two more"
"tried to pull up the falling ones, with the result that in about half a"
minute five of the half-breeds were rolling and tumbling heels over head
down the rocky slope.
"The boys were not far out of their path, but they managed to elude the"
downrushing bodies as they swung by. Notwithstanding the gravity of the
"situation, the boys shrieked with laughter as the clumsy fellows went"
"tumbling down, uttering vicious curses at the boys, at the mountain and"
at each other.
“I wish I had a gun now!” shouted Frank.
As he spoke a formidable weapon which seemed to be half revolver and
"half sawed-off shotgun, flew out of the hands of one of the involuntary"
acrobats and landed against Frank’s side with a great thud.
Frank seized the weapon and backed away. By this time the leader was on
his feet shouting wrathful commands for the boys to return.
"“Easy, now,” Frank shouted, moving away to the south. “If any of you"
"ginks lift a finger until we get into the timber line, I’ll empty this"
load of slugs into the thick of you.”
"The leader, more daring than the others, sprang down the slope, his"
great boots scattering fragments of rock and sending them hurtling down
upon the heads of the half-breeds below. Frank was about to fire when
the man lost his balance and joined the procession of those making for
"she had recharged her piece, and hearing that she wanted nothing and was"
"ready for all emergencies, he departed upon his rounds without the least"
leave-taking or approach to love-making. In her heart Concha respected
"him for this, but at the same time she could not help feeling that a"
Spaniard would have been somewhat warmer in his acknowledgments.
Nevertheless she comforted herself with the thought that he had trusted
"her with one of the most important posts in the whole defence, and she"
prayed fervently to the Virgin that she might be able to do her duty
there.
"She thought also that, when the morning came, perhaps he would have more"
"time. For her, she could wait--here she smiled a little. Yes, she"
"acknowledged it. She who had caught so many, was now taken in her own"
net. She would go to the world's end for this young Scot. Nor in her
heart of hearts was she ashamed of it. Above and beyond all courtesies
"and sugared phrases she loved his free-handed, careless, curt-spoken,"
"hectoring way. After his one kiss, he had treated her exactly like any"
"other of his company. He did not make love well, but--she liked him none"
the worse for that. In such matters (sayeth the Wise Man) excellence is
apt to come with experience.
"And he would learn. Yes, decidedly he might yet do credit to his"
"teacher. To-morrow morning would arrive, and for the present, well--she"
would keep her finger upon the trigger and a pair of remarkably
clear-sighted eyes upon the grey space of greensward crossed by black
trellises of railing immediately before her. That in the mean time was
"her duty to her love and (she acknowledged it), her master."
"Apart from these details of his feeling for Concha, however (which gave"
"him little concern), Rollo was far from satisfied with the condition of"
affairs. He would rather (so he confided to the Sergeant) have defended
"a sheepfold or a simple cottage than this many-chambered, many-passaged,"
moment that he was indeed the thrice-famous José Maria of Ronda. None
"asked a question as to his whence or whither. He was José Maria, and"
therefore entitled not only to be taken at once into the secrets of
"Egypt, but also, and it pleased him, to keep his own."
And very desperate and bloody some of 'his own' were. In the present
"instance, plunder and bloodshed were to proceed hand in hand. No quarter"
was to be given to old or young. The plague-stricken sick man and the
"watcher by the bed, the woman feeding her fire of sticks under her"
"_puchero_, the child asleep on its pillow, the Queen in the palace, the"
"Princess in her nursery--all were to die, quickly and suddenly. These"
men had sworn it. The dead were no tale-tellers. That was the way of
Egypt--the ancient way of safety. Were they not few and feeble in the
midst of innumerable hordes of the _Busne_? Had they not been driven
"like cattle, abused like dogs, sent guiltless to the scaffold, shot in"
"batches by both warring parties? Now in this one place at least, they"
would do a deed of vengeance at which the ears of the world would
tingle.
The Sergeant sat and smoked and listened. He was no stranger to such
talk. It was the way of his double profession of Andalucian bandit and
"Carlist _guerrilero_, to devise and execute deeds of terror and death."
But nothing so cold-blooded as this had José Maria ever imagined. He had
indeed appropriated the governmental mails till the post-bags almost
"seemed his own property, and the guards handed them down without"
"question as to a recognised official. He had, in his great days,"
captured towns and held them for either party according to the good the
matter was likely to do himself. But there was something revolting in
this whole business which puzzled him.
"""Whose idea was all this?"" he asked at last. ""I would give much to see"
"the _Gitano_ who could devise such a stroke."""
another without a word spoken. There was no sign of surprise or fear
"in his face, just a queer little smile. Suddenly he moved, made a"
"snatch at the front of his overalls, and put something into his mouth."
"I guessed what it was, but did not try to stop him; it was the best"
"thing that he could do."""
Dawson stopped and pulled savagely at his cigar. He jabbed the end
"with his knife, though the cigar was drawing perfectly well, and gave"
forth a deep growl which might have been a curse or a sob.
"""Have you ever watched an electric bulb fade away when the current is"
"failing?"" he asked. ""The film pales down from glowing white to dull"
"red, which gets fainter and fainter, little by little, till nothing"
but the memory of it lingers on your retina. His eyes went out exactly
"like that bulb. They faded and faded out of his face, which still kept"
"up that queer, twisted smile. I've seen them ever since; wherever I"
"turn. I shall be glad of that bout of influenza, and shall begin it"
with a stiff dose of veronal.... When the light had nearly gone out of
"his eyes and he was rocking on his feet, I spoke for the first time. I"
"spoke loud too. 'Good-bye,' I called out; 'I'm Dawson.' He heard me,"
for his eyes answered with a last flash; then they faded right out and
he fell flat on the steel deck. He had died on his feet; his will kept
"him upright to the end; that was a Man. He lived a Man's life, doing"
"what he thought his duty, and he died a Man's death.... I blew my"
whistle twice; up clattered a Sergeant with the Marine Guard and
stopped where that figure on the deck barred their way. 'Get a
"stretcher,' I said, 'and send for the doctor. But it won't be any use."
"The man's dead.' The Sergeant asked sharply for my report, and sent"
"off a couple of men for a stretcher. 'Excuse me, Sergeant,' I said, in"
"my best detective officer voice, 'I will report direct to your Major"
and the Commander. I am Chief Inspector Dawson.' He showed no surprise
"nor doubt of my word--if you want to understand discipline, gentlemen,"
"Thus, even at the beginning of the Paleozoic, the continental"
plateau of North America had already been left by crustal
movements in relief above the abysses of the great oceans on
"either side. The mediterraneans which lay upon it were shallow, as"
"their sediments prove. They were EPICONTINENTAL SEAS; that is,"
"they rested UPON (Greek, EPI) the submerged portion of the"
continental plateau. We have no proof that the deep ocean ever
occupied any part of where North America now is.
The Middle and Upper Cambrian strata are found together with the
Lower Cambrian over the area of both the eastern and the western
"mediterraneans, so that here the sea continued during the entire"
period. The sediments throughout are those of shoal water. Coarse
cross-bedded sandstones record the action of strong shifting
currents which spread coarse waste near shore and winnowed it of
finer stuff. Frequent ripple marks on the bedding planes of the
strata prove that the loose sands of the sea floor were near
enough to the surface to be agitated by waves and tidal currents.
Sun cracks show that often the outgoing tide exposed large muddy
"flats to the drying action of the sun. The fossils, also, of the"
strata are of kinds related to those which now live in shallow
waters near the shore.
The sediments which gathered in the mediterranean seas were very
"thick, reaching in places the enormous depth of ten thousand feet."
"Hence the bottoms of these seas were sinking troughs, ever filling"
with waste from the adjacent land as fast as they subsided.
LATE CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. The formations of the Middle and Upper
Cambrian are found resting unconformably on the pre-Cambrian rocks
from New York westward into Minnesota and at various points in the
servile to be capable of feeling humiliation and too stupid to
"understand what danger is--that's the man who makes a good, steady"
soldier. We've seen men so horribly smashed up by bombs that it makes
"you sick to look at them, and then people expect us not to be afraid of"
"air-raids. The civvies haven't seen that sort of thing, so they may well"
"show plenty of pluck, although I believe there are a good many with"
"enough imagination to have the wind up when there's an air-raid on."""
"""Bloody true. You know, if there was a lot o' civvies an' a lot of"
"Tommies in a Blighty air-raid, I reckon the civvies'd show more pluck"
than the Tommies. My mate who's workin' on munitions told me 'e saw
'underds o' soldiers rushin' to take shelter in the last raid on London.
"O' course there was crowds o' civvies doin' the same, but 'e says there"
was a lot what didn't seem to care a damn. The other day we 'ad a bloody
parson spoutin' to us--'e said war brings out a man's pluck an' makes an
"'ero of 'im. I reckon that's all bloody tosh! War makes cowards of yer,"
"that's the 'ole truth o' the matter, I don't care what yer say. I didn't"
"know what fear was afore I joined the army. I know now, you bet! I'm a"
bloody coward now--I don't mind admittin' it. There's things I used ter
do what I wouldn't dare do now. When we go up the line I'm in a blue
funk from the time I 'ears the first shell burst to the time we goes
over the top. An' when we goes over I forgets everythink an' don't know
what I'm doin'. P'raps I'll get a V.C. some day wi'out knowin' what I
done ter get it. And I'm not the only one like that. Anyone 'oo's bin
out 'ere a few months an' says 'e ain't windy up the line's a bloody
"liar, there now...."""
"""By the way,"" I interrupted, ""how did that orderly who works in the"
theatre get his Military Medal--he had the wind up more than any of us
"the other night?"""
"""I know whom you mean,"" answered a private of the R.A.M.C. ""He got it"
"fall into the Gulf of Perdition, unless God interposes.”"
"Now, apart from the folly of this story, we must condemn it on moral"
grounds. Could we imagine a lower standard of a Deity than that
presented here to the child?
To-day the teacher would commend Jane for a laudable interest in
"botany, but might add a word of caution about choosing inclined planes"
"as a hunting-ground for specimens and a popular, lucid explanation of"
the inexorable law of gravity.
Here we have an instance of applying a moral when we have finished our
"story, but there are many stories where nothing is left to chance in"
"this matter, and where there is no means for the child to use ingenuity"
or imagination in making out the meaning for himself.
Henry Morley has condemned the use of this method as applied to Fairy
Stories. He says: “Moralising in a Fairy Story is like the snoring of
Bottom in Titania's lap.”
"But I think this applies to all stories, and most especially to those"
by which we do wish to teach something.
"John Burroughs says in his article,[22] “Thou shalt not preach”:"
“Didactic fiction can never rank high. Thou shalt not preach or teach;
"though shalt pourtray and create, and have ends as universal as"
nature.... What Art demands is that the Artist's personal convictions
"and notions, his likes and dislikes, do not obtrude themselves at all;"
"that good and evil stand judged in his work by the logic of events,"
"as they do in nature, and not by any special pleading on his part. He"
does not hold a brief for either side; he exemplifies the working of
ship was taken by the Welsh pirate Howel Davis. At first Roberts was
"disinclined for the pirate life, but soon changed his mind."
On the death of Davis there were several candidates for the post of
"commander, all brisk and lively men, distinguished by the title of"
"""Lords,"" such as Sympson, Ashplant, Anstis, and others. One of these"
"""Lords,"" Dennis, concluded an eloquent harangue over a bowl of punch with"
a strong appeal for Roberts to be the new chief. This proposal was
"acclaimed with but one dissenting voice, that of ""Lord"" Sympson, who had"
"hopes of being elected himself, and who sullenly left the meeting swearing"
"""he did not care who they chose captain so it was not a papist."" So"
Roberts was elected after being a pirate only six weeks; thus was true
merit quickly appreciated and rewarded amongst them.
[Illustration: CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW ROBERTS.
To face p. 262.]
"Roberts's speech to his fellow-pirates was short but to the point, saying"
"""that since he had dipped his hands in muddy water, and must be a pyrate,"
"it was better being a commander than a common man,"" not perhaps a graceful"
"nor grateful way of expressing his thanks, but one which was no doubt"
understood by his audience.
"Roberts began his career in a bright manner, for to revenge the perfectly"
"justifiable death of their late captain he seized and razed the fort,"
"bombarded the town, and setting on fire two Portuguese ships so as to act"
"as torches, sailed away the same night. Sailing to Brazil they found in"
the Bay of Bahia a fleet of forty-two Portuguese ships ready laden and on
"the point of leaving for Lisbon, and Roberts, with the most astounding"
"boldness, sailed right in amongst them until he found the deepest laden,"
"which he attacked and boarded, although his was a much smaller ship. He"
seemed as if the knots would barely hold. But the work had been well
"done, and in less than half a minute Steve had secured the sack to the"
"chair-back. It was as good as a gag, and safer. Then we took up the"
"chair between us, and lifting it into the back room, put it down and"
locked the door upon our captive.
"As we turned from it Steve looked at me. 'If he catches us after this,"
"Master Martin,' he said, 'it won't be an easy death we shall die!'"
'Heaven forbid!' I muttered. 'Let us be off!'
He gave the word and we stole out into the darkness at the back of the
"house, Steve, who had surveyed the ground, going first. My lady"
followed him; then came the Waldgrave; after him the two women and
"Fraulein Max, with Jacob and Ernst; last of all, Marie and I. It was"
"no time for love-making, but as we all stood a minute in the night,"
"while Steve listened, I drew Marie's little figure to me and kissed"
"her pale face again and again; and she clung to me, trembling, her"
eyes shining into mine. Then she put me away bravely; but I took her
"bundle, and with full hearts we followed the others across the field"
at the back and through the ditch.
"That passed, we found ourselves on the edge of the village, with the"
lights of the camp forming five-sixths of a circle round us. In one
"direction only, where the swamp and creek fringed the place, a dark"
gap broke the ring of twinkling fires. Towards this gap Steve led the
"way, and we, a silent line of gliding figures, followed him. The moon"
had not yet risen. The gloom was such that I could barely make out the
third figure before me; and though all manner of noises--the chorus of
"a song, the voice of a scolding hag, even the rattle of dice on a"
"drumhead--came clearly to my ears, and we seemed to be enclosed on all"
"sides, the darkness proved an effectual shield. We met no one, and"
Blighty! I was in hospital six weeks and then I got ten days' sick leave
"in London. Fritz came over one night--Christ, I didn't half have the"
"wind up! We were sitting in the kitchen, mother and father didn't seem"
to mind much--they didn't know what it meant. Fritz had never dropped
"any our way before. I never heard such a barrage, at least not for"
aeroplanes. It wasn't so bad as out here all the same--you could take
"shelter, anyhow. Air-raids are bloody awful things, they put my wind up"
"much more than shell-fire."""
We finished our work as the sun was setting. The clouds on the horizon
"had vanished. One by one the stars came out. It was ""an ideal night for"
"a raid."""
Soon after dark a man was brought into the station with a crushed knee.
Immediate operation was necessary. He was carried into the theatre and
laid on to one of the tables. He received an anæsthetic and became
unconscious. With his scalpel the surgeon made a deep cut in the
knee-joint and searched the cavity with his finger. There was a Sister
standing by. Also an orderly who had won the Military Medal for bravery
in an air-raid some months before. Suddenly there was an outburst of
anti-aircraft firing and a tumultuous whistling of shells overhead. It
"lasted for several seconds and then with a deafening, reverberating"
"thunder-clap that shook the entire theatre, the first bomb fell. Before"
our ears had ceased drumming another bomb exploded and then another. The
"orderly, who had held his hands in front of his face, now gave way to"
fear. He darted madly to and fro and then scuttled beneath a table. The
"Sister, who had remained quite calm, said in an amused voice: ""Pull"
"yourself together, it's all over now."" The orderly got up trembling, his"
face very white. The surgeon had not moved away. He had just grasped the
"edge of the table tightly and had bent his head forward, while his"
muscles seemed stiff with a violent but successful effort at
"self-control. The anæsthetist, too, had remained on his stool, but was"
"The temperature inside was a constant 5 degrees Celsius, kept just"
above freezing to extend the life of the sensitive electronic gear in
the next three bays. The high-voltage sodium lamps along the sides of
the fuselage now switched on automatically as the door swung inward. He
"fleetingly thought about turning them off, then realized they weren't"
manually operated.
Through the clouds of his condensing breath he could see that the
"interior of the entry bay was a pale, military green. The color"
"definitely seemed appropriate, given what he now knew about this"
vehicle.
"He quickly turned and, after making sure the outer door could be"
"reopened from the inside, closed it behind him. When it clicked secure,"
the sodium lights automatically shut off with a faint hum.
"Just like a damned refrigerator, he thought."
But the dark was what he wanted. He withdrew a small penlight from his
pocket and scanned the three bulkhead hatches leading to the forward
"bays. The portside bay, on the left, contained electronics for the"
"multimode phased array radar scanner in the nose, radar processors,"
"radar power supply, radar transmitters and receivers, Doppler"
"processor, shrouded scanner tracking mechanism, and an RF oscillator."
He knew; he'd checked the engineering diagrams.
"He also knew the starboard equipment bay, the one on the right,"
"contained signal processors for the inertial navigation system (INS),"
"the instrument landing system (ILS), the foreplane hydraulic actuator,"
"the structural mode control system (SMCS), station controller, and the"
pilot's liquid-oxygen tanks and evaporator.
"by Russia and France, to come out to the Far East, especially because"
the Russian fleets have ceased to exist. I admit that the German fleet
"is strong, but I do not believe it is powerful enough for one to say"
"with certainty that it can easily crush Japan. At all events, what"
pretext has Germany to enter into war in the Far East? Among other
things also she would have to count on the opinion and sentiments of two
"countries at least, I mean England and the United States. I do not,"
"therefore, consider a new combination possible. Japan cannot be"
intimidated by mere barking.
"If, however, Europe should choose to take such a course, we should"
gravely reflect. I do not believe your country for example would ever
undertake an expedition against Japan. You have disapproved a small
expedition to Tonkin and we are a little more serious than the
"Tonkinese. France might no doubt, if her honour demanded it, judge it"
"worth the pain to engage in a war with Japan, but under no other"
circumstance do I believe her disposed to take such a part.
Japan will always continue to advance on the lines of occidental
civilisation. I do not see the reason which will prevent Japan from
"acting in concert with France or Germany, provided of course these"
powers do not enter upon an action which may appear to her altogether
"unjust or iniquitous, in which case she may not be able to march with"
them hand-in-hand.
Would Japan be offended by France introducing civilisation into
Indo-China?
We are not at all opposed to your introducing Western civilisation into
"your colonies. On the contrary we shall be quite contented, but in"
introducing your civilisation into your colonies you have to be prepared
that it signifies an amelioration of the condition of the natives. If it
"Frances and Bettina to the payment of the extraordinary admission fee,"
"and when we left the next morning, curiosity prompted them to pass near"
"the garter rack in the tap-room, where garters were hanging which had"
been taken from maids whose great granddaughters had become great
"grandmothers. The garters that had belonged to Frances and Bettina, being"
"the latest contributions, hung at the bottom of the rack, neatly dated"
"and labelled, and, as I left the room, I overheard Bettina whisper to"
Frances:--
"""I'm glad mine was of silk."""
"We made a short drive to Maidstone, where we stopped over night. The next"
"day a longer journey brought us to Canterbury, where we spent two nights"
"and a day, visiting the cathedral both by sunlight and moonlight; the"
combination of moonlight and Bettina being very trying to me.
"From Canterbury we drove in the rain to Dover, where we lodged at that"
"good inn, the Three Anchors, to await a fair wind for Calais."
"During the next three days the wind was fair, but it was blowing half a"
"gale, and therefore the passage was not to be attempted. Though I was"
"enjoying myself, I was anxious to post our letters, as mine gave a full"
account of several matters at court concerning which I knew George ought
to be informed.
"Among other news, I told him that King Charles had sent a messenger"
"into France carrying a personal letter to King Louis, asking his help"
"in finding the man Hamilton, who had threatened Charles's life. I also"
suggested in my letter that the king of France was trying to buy the
"city of Dunkirk from King Charles, and that because of the friendly"
"negotiations then pending, Louis might give heed to our king's request."
"In that case, it might be well, I thought, for Hamilton to leave France"
shameful secret.
A sound--the sound of a man in great pain checked her hysterical sobs.
"Dazed, she passed her hand over her face as if to clear away the dark"
shades that were obstructing her vision. Another groan--and like a flash
she was down on her knees lavishing endearments upon the road agent.
"Never before, it is true, had the Girl had any experience in gun-shot"
"wounds. She had played the part of nurse, however, more than once when"
the boys met with accidents at the mines. For the women of the
California camps at that time had endless calls upon them. It was a
"period for sacrifices innumerable, and help and sympathy were never"
"asked that they were not freely given. So, if the Girl did not know the"
"very best thing to do, she knew, at least, what not to do, and it was"
only a few minutes before she had cut the coat from his back.
The next thing to be done--the dragging of the unconscious man to the
"bed--was hard work, of course, but being strong of arm, as well as stout"
"of heart, she at last accomplished it."
"Now she cut away his shirt in order to find the wound, which proved to"
be in his breast. Quickly then she felt with her fingers in an endeavour
"to find the ball, but in this she was unsuccessful. So after a moment's"
deliberation she made up her mind that the wound was a flesh one and
that the ball was anywhere but in the man's body--a diagnosis that was
"largely due to the cheerful optimism of her nature and which,"
"fortunately, proved to be true."
Presently she went to a corner of the room and soon returned with a
basin of water and some hastily torn bandages. For a good fifteen
"minutes after that she washed the gash and, finally, bandaged it as well"
"as she knew how. And now, having done all that her knowledge or instinct"
always prefer rules to principles of conduct. But in vain do we
clamour against intellectual complications which are the inevitable
"endowment of these days. Life is necessarily intricate, subtle and"
"anxious, and Democracy has made of each man a ruler and governor in"
his degree. Is it possible to point to a single principle which shall
"be a motive and a standard of duty, which shall establish a synthetic"
method after the ruthless analysis of the later Victorian days?
How searching that analysis has been! Fifty years ago the man in the
"street might rarely read the Bible, but he had a tolerably assured"
"conviction that the Bible was infallible, however resolutely he might"
refuse its interpretation by an infallible church.
Then
“...the Essays and Reviews debate Begins to tell on the
"public mind, and Colenso’s views have weight.”"
Plain people were taught to look on the Old Testament as a library of
"Hebrew literature containing not only poetry and history, but romance."
"When Colenso’s book first appeared, Matthew Arnold deprecated its"
publication since it brought criticisms familiar to men of culture
"before the notice of the public, without considering how the beliefs"
of “the vulgar” might be upset.
"The supercilious apostle of “sweetness and light,” himself contributed"
"largely in later years to the general confusion in men’s minds, and"
the New Testament criticism has been introduced to the general public
by Mr. Arnold’s accomplished niece.
"Our friend, the man in the street, was all unprepared!"
The stereo pattern in the Information Center of Commodore Ted Wilson's
flagship was slowly being filled with the hazy white that indicated
"that these volumes had been combed carefully. As he watched, he could"
"see how the search was progressing, and it was painfully obvious that"
the search was not going good at all.
The flights of spacecraft in set patterns back and forth through the
stereo had covered nearly all of the truncated space cone. The random
search ships were slowly cutting secondary lines through the regions
already covered. There was a green sphere combing the stereo pattern
"now, indicating the new infrawave detector ship and its expected volume"
of detector coverage.
Space was filled to overflowing with the fast patter of the
"communications officers, using infrawave for talks between flights, and"
ordinary radio for talks between ships of the same flight.
Wilson had appointed Chief Communications Officer Haggerty to police
"the bands. Haggerty had done a fine job, removing the howling confusion"
and interference caused from too many calls on the same channel. But
the result was still a high degree of constant call and reply and
"cross talk. Most of the chatter came from the infrawave detector ship,"
sending the scout craft flitting hither and thither on the trail of
spurious responses.
It was almost impossible to grasp the extent of the operation. Only in
"the stereo pattern could anybody begin to follow the complex operation,"
and those who watched the stereo knew that their pattern was only an
idealized space map of what they hoped was going on.
It was worse than combing the area of an ocean from maps that contained
a neat grid of cross rules. Much worse. For the uncharted ocean is
the creative energy.... The great artist works _in_ and _through_ and
_from_ moral ideas; his works are indirectly a criticism of life. He
"is moral without having a moral. The moment a moral obtrudes itself,"
that moment he begins to fall from grace as an artist.... The great
distinction of Art is that it aims to see life steadily and to see it
whole.... It affords the one point of view whence the world appears
harmonious and complete.”
"It would seem, then, from this passage, that it is of _moral_"
importance to put things dramatically.
In Froebel's “Mother Play” he demonstrates the educational value of
"stories, emphasising that their highest use consists in their ability"
"to enable the child, through _suggestion_, to form a pure and noble"
idea of what a man may be or do. The sensitiveness of a child's mind
"is offended if the moral is forced upon him, but if he absorbs it"
"unconsciously, he has received its influence for all time."
To me the idea of pointing out the moral of the story has always seemed
as futile as tying a flower on to a stalk instead of letting the flower
"_grow out_ of the stalk, as Nature intended. In the first case, the"
"flower, showy and bright for the moment, soon fades away. In the second"
"instance, it develops slowly, coming to perfection in fulness of time"
because of the life within.
"X.--Lastly, the element to avoid is _that which rouses emotions which"
cannot be translated into action_.
"Mr. Earl Barnes, to whom all teachers owe a debt of gratitude for the"
"inspiration of his education views, insists strongly on this point."
"The sole effect of such stories is to produce a form of hysteria,"
"fortunately short-lived, but a waste of force which might be directed"
voices. It seemed to him that he recognised Nick's voice. But whoever it
"was, he spoke in whispers, and though the wounded man strove to hear, he"
was unsuccessful.
After a while he heard the door close and then the tension was somewhat
"relaxed, for he knew that she was keeping his presence in her cabin a"
secret with all the wiles of a clever and loving woman. And more and
more he determined to gain an honoured place for her in some
"community--an honoured place for himself and her. Vague, very vague, of"
"course, were the new purposes and plans that had so suddenly sprang up"
"because of her influence, but the desire to lead a clean life had"
"touched his heart, and since his old calling had never been pleasing to"
"him, he did not for a moment doubt his ability to succeed."
"The morning was half gone when the Girl returned to her patient. Then,"
"in tones that did her best to make her appear free from anxiety, she"
"told him that it was the barkeeper, as he had surmised, with whom she"
had been talking and that she had been obliged to take him into her
"confidence. The man made no comment, for the situation necessarily was"
"in her hands, and he felt that she could be relied upon not to make any"
"mistake. Four people, he was told, knew of his presence in the cabin. So"
"far as Rance was concerned she had absolute faith in his honour, gambler"
though he was; there was nothing that Nick would not do for her; and as
"for the Indians, the secret was sure to be kept by them, unless"
"Jackrabbit got hold of some whisky--a contingency not at all likely, for"
"Nick had promised to see to that. In fact, all could be trusted to be as"
silent as the grave.
"The invalid had listened intently; nevertheless, he sighed:"
"""It's hard to lie here. I don't want to be caught _now_."""
"no longer to him, as to the man of the Middle Ages, as crystals mounted"
"in gold, or as stars in the firmament. 'I like assertions so little that"
I would easily take sides with the sceptics whereever it is allowed by
the inviolable authority of Holy Scripture and the decrees of the
Church.' 'What is exempt from error?' All subtle contentions of
theological speculation arise from a dangerous curiosity and lead to
impious audacity. What have all the great controversies about the
Trinity and the Virgin Mary profited? 'We have defined so much that
without danger to our salvation might have remained unknown or
undecided.... The essentials of our religion are peace and unanimity.
These can hardly exist unless we make definitions about as few points as
possible and leave many questions to individual judgement. Numerous
problems are now postponed till the oecumenical Council. It would be
much better to put off such questions till the time when the glass shall
"be removed and the darkness cleared away, and we shall see God face to"
face.'
'There are sanctuaries in the sacred studies which God has not willed
"that we should probe, and if we try to penetrate there, we grope in ever"
"deeper darkness the farther we proceed, so that we recognize, in this"
"manner, too, the inscrutable majesty of divine wisdom and the imbecility"
of human understanding.'
CHAPTER XIV
ERASMUS'S CHARACTER
Erasmus's character: Need of purity and cleanliness--
"Delicacy--Dislike of contention, need of concord and"
know more of this man and his life held Grey’s soul in thrall.  He had
"always experienced a vivid curiosity to taste life in its various forms,"
"to know and understand the thoughts, the feelings, the aspirations, the"
ambitions of other men.  His travels had given him insight into many
matters; but he felt that these new experiences were likely to be more
"searching, more exciting, more full of keen personal interest.  He had"
"been, as it were, a spectator heretofore; now he was to be a"
participator.
He had not meant to be any man’s guest; he had meant to take a modest
"lodging of his own, and look about him for something in the way of"
"employment, but Lord Sandford had roared with laughter over such a"
notion.
"""What!  Sir Grey Dumaresq going cap in hand to some proud place-giver to"
"ask for patronage, or I know not what!  Gadzooks, man, with that face,"
"that figure, that horse, and a purse full of guineas, you can do better"
than that!  Trust yourself to me. I’ll show you where fame and fortune
lie.  You shall redeem your rat-infested old house in a very brief
"while, if you will but trust yourself to my guidance.  You be Damon to"
"my Pythias—or is it t’other way round, eh?—and I’ll show you the royal"
"road to the goal you want."""
"For lack of any definite plans, Grey had consented for the nonce to"
"accept Lord Sandford’s advice, and had quickly found himself installed"
"in some gloomy and stately yet luxurious chambers in a vast house, of"
"which only a portion was open for use, and the rest given over to a"
neglect and decay that Hartsbourne itself could scarcely rival.
"""But we shall change all that some day,"" spoke Lord Sandford, with a"
"careless laugh, as Grey expressed his surprise at the vast rooms and"
"long galleries shut up and infested by rats and spiders. ""Oh yes, we"
The change in the aspect of affairs would have made a greater difference
to most companies of adventurers than it did to that of which Master
Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the shire of Fife was the leader. In the
morning they had all risen with the expectation of being shot with the
sun-rising. At ten of the clock they were speeding southward on good
"horses, holding acknowledged rank and position in the army of the only"
Catholic and religious sovereign.
But they were a philosophic quartette. Rollo drew in the morning air and
blew it back again through his nostrils without thinking much of how
nearly he had come to kissing the brown earth of Luis Fernandez's garden
with a dozen bullets through his heart. Mortimer meditated somewhat
"sulkily upon his lost onions, rustling pleasantly back there in the cool"
_patio_ of the nunnery. Etienne sorrowed for his latest love idyll
"ruthlessly cut short, and as to El Sarria, he thought of nothing save"
that Dolóres had come back to him and that he had yet to reckon with the
Fernandez family. The next time he would attend to the whole matter
"himself, and there would be no mistakes."
It was not without sadness that Rollo looked his last on the white
walls of the convent of the Holy Innocents. He was glad indeed to have
"placed Dolóres in safety--glad that she and her child were together, and"
that the good sisters were responsible for them. Between them the four
"had made up a purse to be sent by Concha to the Mother Superior, to be"
"applied for the behoof of her guests till the better days should come,"
and Ramon Garcia be able to claim his wife and first-born son.
But Concha had refused point-blank.
"""The babe came through the wicket. The mother arrived by night, a"

One loses track of time while sailing in south Florida waters. There is
a lassitude that laughs at clocks; the lotus floats over the waves even
"as over the land, and a poetic languor steals into the soul breeding an"
"indifference to hours and days--wretched things, at best, that were only"
"meant for slaves! Neither of us realized our passing into Barnes Sound,"
"and saw only that the _Whim_, sails gracefully drawing, cut the water as"
cleanly as a knife.
"Another day passed during which we shot at sharks, or trawled, or lay on"
deck smoking and occasionally gazing over the side at displays of fish
and flora twenty feet beneath us. But upon the third morning I asked:
"""Where are we bound, Gates?"""
"""Mr. Thomas says Key West, sir, and then Havana."""
"""Mr. Thomas, indeed,"" I laughed, for it was exactly like Tommy to take"
"over the command of a ship, or anything else that struck his fancy."
Before leaving Miami he had received a twenty page letter from the
Bluegrass region of Kentucky which threw him into a state of such
volatile ineptitude that I was well satisfied to let him give what
"orders he would, sending us to the world's end for all I cared. In a"
"very large measure Tommy's happiness was my own, as I knew that mine"
would always be dear to him.
"During our most trying hours in France, thoughts of this wonderful girl,"
"whose name was Nell, unfailingly kept his spirits high. In moments of"
confidence that come to pals on the eve of battle I saw that some day
"they might be eternal ""buddies""--certainly if he had his way; and toward"
"this achievement he had been, since graduating from the University of"
He assisted her to carry the inert old woman across the street and a
"short distance along the opposite pavement. Here, there was a"
"pleasant, modest-looking tea-shop with the name of Walcker over the"
"front, and embedded in the plate glass were the words ""Tea Rooms."""
"These of course dated from long before the war, when the best"
Chinese tea was only four francs the demi-kilo and the fashion for
afternoon tea had become established in Brussels. Vivie and her
mother had often entered Walcker's shop in happier days for a cup of
"tea and delicious forms of home-made pastry. Besides the cakes,"
"which in pre-war times were of an excellence rarely equalled, they"
had been drawn to the pleasant-looking serving woman. She was so
"English in appearance, though she only spoke French and Flemish."
Behind the shop was a cosy little room where the more intimate
clients were served with tea; a room with a look-out into a little
square of garden. Thither Mrs. Warren was carried or supported. She
"regained consciousness slightly as she was placed on a chair,"
"opened her eyes, and said ""Thank you, my dears."" Then her head fell"
over to one side and she was dead--seemingly....
The _agent de police_ went away to fetch a doctor and to disperse
the crowd of _ketjes_[1] and loafers which had transferred itself
"from the hotel to the tea-shop. The shop woman, who was one of those"
angels of kindness that turn up unexpectedly in the paths of unhappy
"people, called in a stout serving wench from the kitchen, and the"
three of them carried Mrs. Warren out of the inner tea-room into the
"back premises and a spare bedroom. Here she was laid on the bed,"
partially undressed and all available and likely restoratives
applied.

Germans and maddened them by mimicking their military manoeuvres!]
Champagne contains about 10 per cent of absolute alcohol and carbonic
"acid gas, which acts as a local sedative upon the stomach. Ale, stout"
"and beers contain from 4 to 8 per cent of alcohol, together with bitters"
and malt extracts.
Cider contains 5 to 9 per cent of absolute alcohol. Imported sherry (B.
P.) contains 15 to 20 per cent of absolute alcohol.
"Alcohol is the solvent most commonly employed in pharmacy, dissolving"
"alkaloids, resins, volatile oils, balsams, oleo-resins, tannin, sugar,"
some fats and fixed oils.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 3 to 6 oz.; sheep and pigs, 1 to 3 oz.; dogs,"
2 dr. to 1 oz.
ACTIONS.--Alcohol is a cerebral excitant and finally becomes a
depressant and a narcotic poison.
"It is anesthetic, antiseptic, antiparasitic, rubefacient (if confined),"
"mild astringent, coagulate albumen; a local refrigerant by virtue of its"
"rapid evaporation, unless confined by bandage, oiled silk, etc., when it"
is absorbed by the tissues and causes a sensation of warmth.
In medical doses it is a powerful general stimulant; it is very
"diffusible, and is partly oxidized by the organism, and partly excreted;"
thus alcohol acts as a food.
"Small doses relax the blood vessels, stimulate the gastric glands,"
promote appetite and digestion; lessen the elimination of waste
"products, by preventing rapid tissue waste; causes a feeling of warmth,"
"and temporarily, though slightly, raises the body temperature. It"
one comes to fill the place.” And she went to her desk at once and hung
the black turban hat with the gold-green macaw wing in its accustomed
place.
He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during
a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology.
The poet sings of the “crowded hour of glorious life.” The broker’s
"hour is not only crowded, but the minutes and seconds are hanging to"
all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms.
And this day was Harvey Maxwell’s busy day. The ticker began to reel
"out jerkily its fitful coils of tape, the desk telephone had a chronic"
attack of buzzing. Men began to throng into the office and call at him
"over the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously, excitedly. Messenger"
boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams. The clerks in the
office jumped about like sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher’s face
relaxed into something resembling animation.
On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and
"glaciers and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were"
reproduced in miniature in the broker’s offices. Maxwell shoved his
chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a
"toe dancer. He jumped from ticker to ’phone, from desk to door with the"
trained agility of a harlequin.
In the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became
suddenly aware of a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding
"canopy of velvet and ostrich tips, an imitation sealskin sacque and a"
"string of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near the floor with a"
silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with
these accessories; and Pitcher was there to construe her.

"Erasmus at Louvain, 1517--He expects the renovation of the"
Church as the fruit of good learning--Controversy with Lefèvre
"d'Étaples--Second journey to Basle, 1518--He revises the edition"
"of the New Testament--Controversies with Latomus, Briard and"
Lee--Erasmus regards the opposition of conservative theology
merely as a conspiracy against good learning
When Erasmus established himself at Louvain in the summer of 1517 he had
"a vague presentiment that great changes were at hand. 'I fear', he"
"writes in September, 'that a great subversion of affairs is being"
"brought about here, if God's favour and the piety and wisdom of princes"
do not concern themselves about human matters.' But the forms which that
great change would assume he did not in the least realize.
He regarded his removal as merely temporary. It was only to last 'till
"we shall have seen which place of residence is best fit for old age,"
which is already knocking'. There is something pathetic in the man who
"desires nothing but quiet and liberty, and who through his own"
"restlessness, and his inability not to concern himself about other"
"people, never found a really fixed abode or true independence. Erasmus"
"is one of those people who always seem to say: tomorrow, tomorrow! I"
"must first deal with this, and then ... As soon as he shall be ready"
with the new edition of the New Testament and shall have extricated
"himself from troublesome and disagreeable theological controversies, in"
"which he finds himself entangled against his wish, he will sleep, hide"
"himself, 'sing for himself and the Muses'. But that time never came."
"Where to live when he shall be free? Spain, to which Cardinal Ximenes"
"called him, did not appeal to him. From Germany, he says, the stoves and"
which the queen was giving that night. It was an unfortunate time for me
"to see Mary. My heart was full, not to overflowing, but to sinking, with"
my love of Bettina and her love of me. There was nothing I would not have
given at that time to be able to take her as my wife. I should have been
"glad to give my title, estates, and position--everything--to be a simple"
tradesman or an innkeeper so that I might take Bettina with happiness to
her and without the damning sin of losing caste to me.
It was true the king's brother had made a marriage of comparatively the
"same sort, but it is almost as impossible for a prince to lose caste as"
it is difficult for a mere baron to keep it. Bettina would not be happy
"in my sphere of life, nor could I live in hers, so what was there for me"
"to do but to keep my engagement with Mary Hamilton and, if I could, lose"
my love for Bettina.
*        *        *        *        *
"The queen's ball was to be held that night at St. James's Palace, and"
I was glad to have the walk from Whitehall across the park. The night was
"perfect. A slim moon hung in the west, considerately withholding a part"
of her light that the stars might twinkle the brighter in their vain
"effort to rival Bettina's eyes. The night wind came to me, odor-laden"
"from the roses, only to show me how poor a thing it was compared with"
Bettina's breath upon my cheek and its sweetness in my nostrils. Now and
"then a belated bird sang its sleepy song, only to remind me of the melody"
"of her lullabies, and the cooing dove moaned out its plaintive call lest"
I forget the pain in her breast while selfishly remembering the ache in
"my own. Then I thought of what the Good Book says about ""bright clouds,"""
and I prayed that my pain might make me a better man and might lead me to
"help Bettina in the days of her sorrowing, which I knew were at hand."
"Soon after I had kissed the hands of the king and the queen, I met"
"“Thank you,” said the girl, softly but heartily. “I am sure you need"
not trouble yourself any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe
heels are horridly common-sense; I can’t blame them at all.”
Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest.
She was pretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind.
She was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a
sort of uniform such as shop girls wear. Her glossy dark-brown hair
showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament
was a velvet ribbon and bow. She could have posed as a model for the
self-respecting working girl of the best type.
A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask
this girl to dine with him. Here was the element that his splendid but
solitary periodic feasts had lacked. His brief season of elegant luxury
would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady’s society. This
"girl was a lady, he was sure—her manner and speech settled that. And in"
spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to
sit at table with her.
"These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask"
"her. It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes"
wage-earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind. They
were generally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their own
"judgment than they did of useless conventions. His ten dollars,"
"discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The"
dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull
routine of the girl’s life; and her lively appreciation of it would add
to his own triumph and pleasure.
"“I think,” he said to her, with frank gravity, “that your foot needs a"
"longer rest than you suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in which"
We went down the fortress-stair to the eating-room. Here was a long
table with soup-plates upside down and a lamp burning an uncanny naked
"acetylene flame. We sat at the cold table, and the lamp immediately"
"began to wane. The room--in fact the whole of Sardinia--was stone cold,"
"stone, stone cold. Outside the earth was freezing. Inside there was no"
"thought of any sort of warmth: dungeon stone floors, dungeon stone walls"
"and a dead, corpse-like atmosphere, too heavy and icy to move."
"The lamp went quite out, and the q-b gave a cry. The brown woman poked"
her head through a hole in the wall. Beyond her we saw the flames of the
"cooking, and two devil-figures stirring the pots. The brown woman came"
and shook the lamp--it was like a stodgy porcelain mantelpiece
"vase--shook it well and stirred up its innards, and started it going"
"once more. Then she appeared with a bowl of smoking cabbage soup, in"
which were bits of macaroni: and would we have wine? I shuddered at the
"thought of death-cold red wine of the country, so asked what else there"
"was. There was malvagia--malvoisie, the same old malmsey that did for"
"the Duke of Clarence. So we had a pint of malvagia, and were comforted."
"At least we were being so, when the lamp went out again. The brown woman"
"came and shook and smacked it, and started it off again. But as if to"
"say ""Shan't for you"", it whipped out again."
"Then came the host with a candle and a pin, a large, genial Sicilian"
with pendulous mustaches. And he thoroughly pricked the wretch with the
"pin, shook it, and turned little screws. So up flared the flame. We were"
"a little nervous. He asked us where we came from, etc. And suddenly he"
"asked us, with an excited gleam, were we Socialists. Aha, he was going"
to hail us as citizens and comrades. He thought we were a pair of
Bolshevist agents: I could see it. And as such he was prepared to
"embrace us. But no, the q-b disclaimed the honor. I merely smiled and"
shook my head. It is a pity to rob people of their exciting illusions.

In discussing dreams of flying I have referred to a dream in which a
slight disturbance of the heart's action was transformed by sleeping
consciousness into the image of an athlete manipulating an elastic ball.
"This objectivation of what are really the dreamer's subjective sensations,"
"although he is not conscious of them as subjective, is, indeed, a"
"phenomenon which we have encountered many times. It is, however, so"
"important a feature of dream psychology, and probably of such significant"
"weight in its influence on waking life, that it is worth while to deal"
with it separately.
"The dramatisation of subjective elements of the personality, which"
"contributes so largely to render our dreams vivid and interesting, rests"
"on that dissociation, or falling apart of the constituent groups of"
"psychic centres, which is so fundamental a fact of dream life. That is to"
"because the war with Spain ""threw open to her attack the whole"
"boundless possessions of her antagonist in the New World, which"
would have been closed to her in peace. By conquest she made for
"herself an empire, and this empire made her rich."" In the first"
place it was not in the New World that she mainly sought her
"empire, but in the East Indies, in the sphere of the Portuguese"
"conquests. Her hold of Brazil lasted only from 1621 to 1654, and"
"was not a great source of wealth, though she captured much Spanish"
"and Portuguese shipping. But even her eastern trade was, as we have"
"seen, small in quantity, and as a source of wealth was not to be"
compared with the herring fishery. In 1601 John Keymor declared
"that more wealth was produced by the northern fisheries ""in one"
"year than the King of Spain hath in four years out of the Indies"""
(_Observations made upon the Dutch Fishing about the Year
"1601_--reprint in _Phoenix_, 1707, i, 225). The Dutch takings in"
"six months' fishing were then reckoned at 3,600,000 barrels, valued"
at as many pounds sterling (_id._ p. 224); the fishing fleet
"numbered 4,100 sail of all kinds, with over 3,000 tenders, out of a"
"roughly estimated total of 20,000; while the whole Indian fleet is"
"stated at only 40 or 50, employing 5,000 or 6,000 men (_id._ p."
"223), as against a total of some 200,000 of Dutch seafaring"
"population. Howell, writing in 1622 (ed. Bennett, 1891, vol. i,"
"205), also puts the Amsterdam ships in the Indian trade at 40."
Professor Seeley's statement cannot have proceeded on any
comparison of the European Dutch trade with the revenue from the
"conquered ""empire."" It stands for an endorsement of the vulgar"
"delusion that ""possessions"" are the great sources of a nation's"
"wealth, though Seeley elsewhere (p. 294) protests against the"
"""bombastic language of this school,"" and notes that ""England is"
"not, directly at least, any the richer"" for her connection with her"
"""dependencies."""
churches were ringing; some had services. I had to push my way to
reach Herr Krapp's house in time; but once there the crowd of passers
"served my purpose by screening me, as I loitered, from farther remark;"
"while I took care, by posting myself in a doorway opposite the window,"
to make it easy for any one who expected me to find me.
And then I waited with my heart beating. The clocks were striking a
"half after seven when I took my place, and for a time I stood in a"
"ferment of excitement, now staring with bated breath at the casement,"
"where I had seen Marie, now scanning all the neighbouring doorways,"
and then again letting my eyes rove from window to window both of
Krapp's house and the next one on either side. As the latter were
"built with many quaint oriels, and tiny dormers, and had lattices in"
"side-nooks, where one least looked to find them, I was kept expecting"
"and employed. I was never quite sure, look where I would, what eyes"
were upon me.
"But little by little, as time passed and nothing happened, and the"
"strollers all went by without accosting me, and no faces save strange"
"ones showed at the windows, the heat of expectation left me. The chill"
of disappointment took its place. I began to doubt and fear. The
clocks struck eight. The sun had been down an hour. Half that time I
had been waiting.
"To remain passive was no longer bearable, and sick of caution, I"
"stepped out and began to walk up and down the street, courting rather"
than avoiding notice. The traffic was beginning to slacken. I could
see farther and mark people at a distance; but still no one spoke to
"me, no one came to me. Here and there lights began to shine in the"
"houses, on gleaming oak ceilings and carved mantels. The roofs were"
growing black against the paling sky. In nooks and corners it was
"dark. The half-hour sounded, and still I walked, fighting down doubt,"
branches.
"For the first time we saw one another's faces, and how pale and"
"woe-begone, mudstained and draggled we were! The cold, grey light,"
"which so mercilessly unmasked our refuge, did not spare us. It helped"
even my lady to look her worst. Fraulein Anna sat a mere lifeless lump
in her saddle. The waiting-women cried softly; they had cried all
"night. The Waldgrave looked dazed, as if he barely understood where he"
was or why he was there.
"To think over-much in such a place was to weep. Instead, I hastened to"
"get them all off their horses, and with Steve's help and a great"
"bundle of osiers and branches which we cut, I made nests for them in"
"the lower boughs of the willows, well out of reach of the water. When"
"they had all taken their places, I served out food and a dram of"
"Dantzic waters, which some of us needed; for a white mist, drawn up"
"from the swamp by the rising sun, began to enshroud us, and, hanging"
"among the osiers for more than an hour, prolonged the misery of the"
night.
"Still, even that rolled away at last--about six o'clock--and let us"
see the sun shining overhead in a heaven of blue distance and golden
"clouds. Larks rose up and sang, and all the birds of the marsh began"
to twitter and tweet. In a trice our mud island was changed to a
bower--a place of warmth and life and refreshment--where light and
"shade lay on the dappled floor, and the sunshine fell through green"
leaves.
"Then I took the cloaks, and the saddles, and everything that was wet,"
and spread them out on branches to dry; and leaving the women to make
themselves comfortable in their own way and shift themselves as they
"pleased, we two, with the Waldgrave and the two servants, went away to"
grandchildren--was chuntering her head off because it was _her_
seat--why she had left it she didn't say. And under my legs was her
"bundle of bread. She nearly went off her head. And over my head, on the"
"little rack, was her bercola, her saddle-bag. Fat soldiers laughed at"
"her good-naturedly, but she fluttered and flipped like a tart,"
featherless old hen. Since she had another seat and was quite
"comfortable, we smiled and let her chunter. So she clawed her bread"
"bundle from under my legs, and, clutching it and a fat child, sat tense."
*       *       *       *       *
It was getting quite dark. The conductor came and said that there was no
"more paraffin. If what there was in the lamps gave out, we should have"
to sit in the dark. There was no more paraffin all along the line.--So
"he climbed on the seats, and after a long struggle, with various boys"
"striking matches for him, he managed to obtain a light as big as a pea."
"We sat in this _clair-obscur_, and looked at the sombre-shadowed faces"
"round us: the fat soldier with a gun, the handsome soldier with huge"
"saddle-bags, the weird, dark little man who kept exchanging a baby with"
"a solid woman who had a white cloth tied round her head, a tall"
"peasant-woman in costume, who darted out at a dark station and returned"
"triumphant with a piece of chocolate: a young and interested young man,"
who told us every station. And the man who spat: there is always one.
"Gradually the crowd thinned. At a station we saw our fat friend go by,"
"bitterly, like a betrayed soul, his bulging saddle-bag hanging before"
"and after, but no comfort in it now--no comfort. The pea of light from"
"the paraffin lamp grew smaller. We sat in incredible dimness, and the"
"smell of sheeps-wool and peasant, with only our fat and stoic young man"
to tell us where we were. The other dusky faces began to sink into a
"dead, gloomy silence. Some took to sleep. And the little train ran on"
"and on, through unknown Sardinian darkness. In despair we drained the"
"whose names were unknown to Grey, but who evidently were characters well"
known to the others of the company.
"""There is no such thing as justice left, or purity of taste, or any such"
"thing!"" shouted a handsome, well-proportioned fellow, whose face had"
"attracted Grey’s notice several times, and seemed dimly familiar to him."
"""Look at the mouthing mountebanks that walk the boards now!  They strut"
"like peacocks, they gibber like apes.  They have neither voice, nor"
"figure, nor talent, nor grace.  But, forsooth, because some fine dame"
"has smiled upon them, or they are backed by a nobleman’s patronage, they"
"can crow it over the rest of us like a cock upon his dunghill, and we,"
"who have the talent and the gifts, may rot like rats in our holes!"""
"""Shame! shame! shame!"" cried an admiring chorus."
"""Look at me!"" thundered the young man, his eyes flashing.  ""Who dares"
"say I cannot act?  Have I not held spellbound, hanging on my lips, whole"
houses of beauty and fashion?  Have I lost my skill or cunning?  Has my
"voice or has my grace departed from me?  Wherefore, then, do I sit here"
"idle and hungry, whilst men not fit to black my boots hold the boards"
"and fill their pouches with gold?  Why such injustice, I say?"""
A chorus of indignation again arose; but out of the shadows came a deep
voice.
"""The answer is easy, friend Lionel; arrogance and drink have been the"
cause of your downfall.  How could any manager continue to engage you?
How many times has it happened that you have come to the theatre sodden
with drink?  How many representations have you spoiled by your bestial
"folly? They were patient with you.  Oh yes, they were very patient; for"
they knew your gifts and recognized them.  But you met friendly rebuke
or warning with haughtiness and scorn.  You would listen to no counsel;
"of all virtue. The type is well-known, and can be found at resorts and"
"boarding-houses, where it grows and flourishes."
"In spite of her wasted adolescence, her examination and her"
"""independence,"" she has been coming home from her office stool or her"
teacher's desk more or less exhausted; suddenly she finds herself in the
"midst of a sweet and unlimited idleness, with quantities of tinned food"
"for her meals. The company round her is continually changing, tourists"
"come and go, and she passes from hand to hand for walks and talks; the"
"tone is ""country informality."" This is sheer loose living; this is a life"
stripped of all purpose. She does not even sleep enough because she hears
"through the thin wall every sound made by her neighbor in the next room,"
while arriving or departing Englishmen bang doors all night. In a short
"time she has become a neurotic, sated with company, surfeited with herself"
and the place. She is ready to go off with the next halfway respectable
organ grinder that happens along. And so she pairs off with the most
"casual visitors, flirts with the guide, hovering about him and making"
"bandages for his fingers, and at last throws herself into the arms of a"
nameless nobody who has arrived at the house today.
This is the Torsen type.
"And now, at this very moment, she retires to her room to collect the"
"fragments of herself, in preparation for her departure--at the end of the"
"summer. It takes time; there are so many fragments, one in every corner."
But perhaps it consoles her to think that she knows the genitive of
_mensa_.
"Things are not quite so bad for the actor. He has staked nothing, is"
"committed to nothing. No part of his life is destroyed, nor anything"
"within him. As he came, so he goes, cheerful, empty, nice. In fact he is"
even something more of a man because he has really made a conquest. He has
stood beside Socrates. And Beatus Rhenanus devotes to him a life of
earnest admiration and helpfulness that was to prove of much more value
than these exuberant panegyrics. There is an element of national
exaltation in this German enthusiasm for Erasmus: it is the violently
stimulated mood into which Luther's word will fall anon.
"The other nations also chimed in with praise, though a little later and"
"a little more soberly. Colet and Tunstall promise him immortality,"
"Étienne Poncher exalts him above the celebrated Italian humanists,"
Germain de Brie declares that French scholars have ceased reading any
"authors but Erasmus, and Budaeus announces that all Western Christendom"
resounds with his name.
This increase of glory manifested itself in different ways. Almost every
"year the rumour of his death was spread abroad, malignantly, as he"
"himself thinks. Again, all sorts of writings were ascribed to him in"
"which he had no share whatever, amongst others the _Epistolae obscurorum"
virorum_.
"But, above all, his correspondence increased immensely. The time was"
long since past when he asked More to procure him more correspondents.
"Letters now kept pouring in to him, from all sides, beseeching him to"
reply. A former pupil laments with tears that he cannot show a single
note written by Erasmus. Scholars respectfully sought an introduction
"from one of his friends, before venturing to address him. In this"
"respect Erasmus was a man of heroic benevolence, and tried to answer"
"what he could, although so overwhelmed by letters every day that he"
"hardly found time to read them. 'If I do not answer, I seem unkind,'"
"says Erasmus, and that thought was intolerable."
"We should bear in mind that letter-writing, at that time, occupied more"
"or less the place of the newspaper at present, or rather of the literary"
"Europe, we had seen crowns which far surpassed this one in costliness"
"and beauty, but none of which, nor all of which combined, had ever"
excited a thousandth part of the interest attaching to this old crown
in Monza.
[Sidenote: Why the Crown is so Sacred.]
The explanation is this: within that ring of jointed plates of gold
"runs a thin band of iron, which priestly tradition says was made of one"
of the spikes that fastened the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ to the
"cross. It was this band of iron that we tiptoed to see, hardly noticing"
the bejewelled rim of gold around it. It was on account of this band of
iron that the priest and his attendant swung their censer and performed
their ceremony as we entered. It was this band of iron that gave to the
crown its sacred place above the altar. It was for the safe keeping of
"this band of iron that the steel case, with its numerous locks, was"
"made. It was from this band of iron that the diadem received its name,"
the Iron Crown of Lombardy.
[Sidenote: How it was Used by Charlemagne and Napoleon.]
"And what were the historical uses of it, referred to above, which made"
it so much more interesting to us than the many other so-called nails
"of the true cross elsewhere? Well, this among others: on the last"
"Christmas day of the eighth century, while Charlemagne was kneeling"

"which feared him,"" standing in the vast marble cathedral at Milan,"

"At the sound of this new voice, speaking out of the shadows of the"
"ingle-nook, a great hush had fallen upon the room.  Grey leaned forward"
"to obtain a view of the speaker, and the firelight played upon the"
striking features and iron-gray hair of a very remarkable-looking old
"man of leonine aspect, whose voice was of that penetrating quality which"
makes itself heard without being raised; and it was plain that something
"in the personality of the man lifted him above his fellows, for all"
"listened in silence whilst he spoke, and even the arrogant young actor"
looked for the moment abashed.
"""Who is it?"" whispered Grey to the man next him; and the answer came"
"readily, though spoken in a cautious whisper."
"""His name is Jonathan Wylde.  Once he, too, was a famous actor; but long"
"illness crippled his limbs, and he has fallen into poverty.  He is"
"always called the Old Lion, and methinks the name suits him well.  He is"
"a very lion for courage, else would he not dare to rebuke Master Lionel"
"Field.  For he is one who is ready with his fist, or with knife or"
"bludgeon, and it is ill work meeting him when he is in his cups."""
Grey looked with interest and attention at the old man in the shadows;
"but he was leaning back again, and spoke no more.  The talk surged round"
him again from the rest; they spoke of the plays that were being enacted
"at the various theatres, and of those who were playing the various"
_rôles_.  Some of them stood up and rolled forth bits of Congreve’s
"wildly, a bell in terror. Yellow gleams streaked the fretted waters,"
"and again the trumpet challenged the dark walls, like the cry of a"
sea-bird driven by the storm.
The duke and Francesco looked meaningly at each other. The sound
needed no words to christen it; they knew that the Pisans had
"attacked. They heard the roar and the cries from the rampart, the"
cataractine thunder of a distant battle.
"Pushing on more swiftly as the woods thinned, the din grew more"
"definite, more human, more sinister in detail. It stirred the blood,"
"challenged the courage, racked conjecture with the infinite chaos it"
portended. Victory and despair were trammelled up together in its
sullen roar; life and death seemed to swell it with the wind sound of
"their wings. It was stupendous, chaotic, a tempest cry of steel and"
passions inflamed.
The duke's face kindled to the sound as he shouted to his men to
"gallop on. Yet another furlong, and the spectral trunks dwindled, the"
"sombre boughs seemed to mingle with the clouds, while gray, indefinite"
"before them, engulfing the lightnings of heaven, loomed the great"
"swell of the Tyrrhene, dark and restless under the thunderclouds, that"
came nearer and nearer. Ghostly the plains of Torre del Greco
"stretched towards the Promontory of Circé, and, solitary and"
"impregnable, the Castello of Astura rose upon its chalk-cliffs, white"
in the lightnings which hissed around its summit.
"The duke's men had come up, forming a wide semicircle around the"
"leaders. At their feet opened a deep ravine, leading into the plain;"
"half a furlong beyond, although it seemed less than a lance's throw"
"across, rose the castle of the Frangipani, washed by the waves of the"
"Tyrrhene. The Pisans had attacked the southern acclivity, and the"
The inhabitants of the street were divided into two parties according
"to their sympathies.  One was in favour of Kuvalda, who was thought ""a"
"good soldier, clever, and courageous,"" the other was convinced of the"
"fact that the teacher was ""superior"" to Kuvalda.  The latter's admirers"
"were those who were known to be drunkards, thieves, and murderers, for"
whom the road from beggary to prison was inevitable.  But those who
"respected the teacher were men who still had expectations, still hoped"
"for better things, who were eternally occupied with nothing, and who"
were nearly always hungry.
The nature of the teacher's and Kuvalda's relations towards the street
may be gathered from the following:
Once in the eating-house they were discussing the resolution passed by
"the Corporation regarding the main street, viz., that the inhabitants"
"were to fill up the pits and ditches in the street, and that neither"
manure nor the dead bodies of domestic animals should be used for the
"purpose, but only broken tiles, etc., from the ruins of other houses."
"""Where am I going to get these same broken tiles and bricks?  I could"
"not get sufficient bricks together to build a hen-house,"" plaintively"
"said Mokei Anisimoff, a man who hawked kalaches (a sort of white bread)"
which were baked by his wife.
"""Where can you get broken bricks and lime rubbish?  Take bags with you,"
and go and remove them from the Corporation buildings. They are so old
"that they are of no use to anyone, and you will thus be doing two good"
"deeds; firstly, by repairing the main street; and secondly, by adorning"
"the city with a new Corporation building."""
"""If you want horses get them from the Lord Mayor, and take his three"
"daughters, who seem quite fit for harness. Then destroy the house of"
"all that about Gaspard and the society came out, would they not call him"
"an accessory before the fact? The noose seemed really rather near, and"
"in his frightened fancy, as he lay sleepless beside his snoring wife,"
the rope dangled over his head. The poor wretch was between the devil
and the deep sea--between stern law and cruel Rule 3. He dared not toss
"about, his wife would ask him what ailed him; he lay as still as he"
"could, bitterly cursing his folly for mingling in such affairs, bitterly"
cursing the Frenchman who led him on into the trap and left him fast
there. How could he save his neck? And he restlessly rent the band of
"his coarse night-shirt, that pressed on his throat with a horrible"
suggestion of what might be. Where was that Gaspard? Had he fled over
"the sea? Ah, if he could be sure of that, and sure that the dreaded man"
"would not return! Or was he lurking in some secret hole, ready to steal"
out and avenge a violation of Rule 3? The doorkeeper had always feared
"the man; in the lurid light of this deed, Gaspard's image grew into a"
"monster of horror, threatening sudden and swift revenge for disobedience"
"or treachery. No; he must stand firm. But what of the police? Well, men"
"sleep somehow, and at last he fell asleep, holding the band of the"
night-shirt away from his throat: if he fell asleep with that pressing
"on him, God knew what he might dream."
"""It's very lucky,"" remarked the Superintendent of Police, who had a"
"happy habit of looking at the bright side of things, to one of his"
"subordinates, ""that this Benham seems to have had no relations and"
"precious few friends."""
"""No widows coming crying about,"" observed the subordinate, with an"
assenting nod.
"""Nothing known of him except that he came to Kirton a few months back,"
"did nothing, seemed to have plenty of money, took his liquor, played a"
"hand at cards, hurt nobody, seemingly knew nobody."""
"the Germans, in direct contravention of the laws of naval warfare,"
had closed the sinking valve so that the torpedo virtually became a
floating mine.
"In this instance the trick did not avail, for a well-directed shot"
from one of the monitor's quick-firers exploded the war-head and sent
the missile into a thousand fragments.
"""A feeble reply,"" observed Oswestry to Terence. ""These fellows seem"
"afraid to stand to their guns."""
Even as he spoke the air was torn by a terrific salvo of shells from
powerful batteries hitherto well concealed in the dunes. The
"""Sunderland,"" being fairly close, seemed the special mark, for in six"
seconds she received as many direct hits. One of her funnels showed a
jagged gash ten feet in length and was only prevented from toppling
"overboard by the steel-wire guys. A three-pounder gun, that"
"fortunately was not manned, was blown completely from its mountings,"
while the rest of the shells passed clean through the unprotected
"parts of the ship, totally wrecking the ward-room and the stokers'"
mess-deck.
Terence felt a strong desire to make a hasty rush for the shelter of
"the conning-tower, for splinters were flying and wafts of pungent"
"smoke from the hostile shells were drifting over the bridge, but the"
sight of his captain standing cool and collected and without a
vestige of protection tended to restore his confidence.
With unabated fury her guns replied to the German fire. The
"""Sunderland"" proved that she could receive as well as give hard"
knocks.
"""It _has_ been a pleasant evening,"" she said, inanely."
"""I saw you for the first time to-night, Cherry. I think I have begun to"
"know you."""
"Again she felt her heart leap. Reaching out to say good-bye, his hand"
"slipped down over her arm, like a caress, until her palm lay in his."
"With trembling, gentle hands she pushed him from her; but even when the"
"sound of his footsteps had died away, she stood with eyes straining"
"into the gloom, in her breast a gladness so stifling that she raised"
her hands to still its tumult.
"Emerson, with the glow still upon him, felt a deep contentment which he"
did not trouble to analyze. It has been said that two opposite impulses
"may exist side by side in a man's mind, like two hostile armies which"
"have camped close together in the night, unrevealed to each other until"
the morning. To Emerson the dawn had not yet come. He had no thought of
"disloyalty to Mildred, but, after his fashion, took the feeling of the"
"moment unreflectively. His mood was averse to thought, and, moreover,"
the darkness forced him to give instant attention to his path. While
"the waters of the bay out to his right showed a ghostly gray, objects"
beneath the bluff where he walked were cloaked in impenetrable shadow.
"The air was damp with the breath of coming rain, and at rare intervals"
he caught a glimpse of the torn edges of clouds hurrying ahead of a
wind that was yet unfelt.
"When the black bulk of Marsh's cannery loomed ahead of him, he left the"
"gravel beach and turned up among the buildings, seeking to retrace his"
"former course. He noticed that once he had left the noisy shingle, his"
"feet made no sound in the soft moss. Thus it was that, as he turned the"
"corner of the first building, he nearly ran against a man who was"
known the post-Renaissance Jesus. Which is rather an eye-opener.
"Not that they are suspicious or uneasy. On the contrary, noisy,"
"assertive, vigorous presences. But with none of that implicit belief"
"that everybody will be and ought to be good to them, which is the mark"
of our era. They don't expect people to be good to them: they don't want
"it. They remind me of half-wild dogs that will love and obey, but which"
won't be handled. They won't have their heads touched. And they won't be
fondled. One can almost hear the half-savage growl.
"The long stocking caps they wear as a sort of crest, as a lizard wears"
"his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on"
"their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young"
"beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises"
over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot
over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes
his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then he shifts
"it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points,"
"like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression"
these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear
"them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black"
stockinette stuff.
The conductor comes to issue them their tickets. And they all take out
rolls of paper money. Even a little mothy rat of a man who sits opposite
me has quite a pad of ten-franc notes. Nobody seems short of a hundred
francs nowadays: nobody.
They shout and expostulate with the conductor. Full of coarse life they
"are: but so coarse! The handsome fellow has his sleeved waistcoat open,"
"and his shirt-breast has come unbuttoned. Not looking, it seems as if he"
"wears a black undervest. Then suddenly, one sees it is his own hair. He"
"After reading the letter, I felt sure that the Abbé du Boise was George"
Hamilton. I could hardly bring myself to believe that he would be so
"foolhardy as to visit Whitehall, though I knew the adventure was of a"
nature likely to appeal to his reckless disregard of consequences. I
"knew also that, if successful, he would win the reward without which"
life had little value to him.
I was sure that Hamilton had fully weighed the danger of his perilous
"mission, and that he was deliberately staking his life on a last"
desperate chance to win fortune and Frances Jennings.
"Though perhaps Lilly was a charlatan in many respects, he was to be"
trusted; still I did not feel that it was my place to impart George's
"secret to him, though I had in mind a plan whereby he might be of great"
help to the Abbé du Boise in influencing King Charles. The king consulted
"him secretly in many important affairs, and I was sure that if the good"
"Doctor should be called in by his Majesty in the Dunkirk affair, the"
stars would tell a story in accord with our desires if we made it to
Lilly's interest.
"However, all of that must wait for the Abbé du Boise. Of one thing I was"
sure; I must tell Frances at once so that she might be paving the way to
"the king with her smiles. It would be a disagreeable task, but I knew she"
"would do it gladly, and I also knew that no woman could do it better."
While I had expressed my doubts to Frances concerning Hamilton's
"emigration to Canada, I had not felt entirely sure there was nothing in"
"it, and she, womanlike, taking the worst for granted, had accepted it as"
"true. But the coming of the Abbé du Boise changed everything, and when I"
"saw her at her father's house and told her of my suspicions, and showed"
"her Le Blanc's letter, she was so greatly alarmed that she said she would"
plunder the palace from top to bottom and to give all within the
neighbouring town of San Ildefonso to the sword.
"The programme, as thus baldly announced, was indeed one to strike all"
"men with horror, even those who had been hardened by years of"
fratricidal warfare in which quarter was neither given nor expected.
"Besides the plunder of the palace and its occupants, the leaders of the"
gipsies expected that they would obtain great rewards from Don Carlos
for thus removing the only obstacles to his undisputed possession of the
throne of Spain.
The heart of Rollo beat violently. His Scottish birth and training gave
"him a natural reverence for the sanctity of sickness and death, and the"
"idea of these men plotting ghoulishly to utilise ""the onlaying of the"
"hand of Providence"" (as his father would have phrased it) for the"
"purposes of plunder and rapine, unspeakably revolted him."
"Immediately he called a council of war, at which, in spite of the frowns"
"of Sergeant Cardono, little Concha Cabezos had her place."
"La Giralda was summoned also, but excused herself saying, ""It is better"
"that I should not know what you intend to do. I am, after all, a"
"black-blooded Gitana, and might be tempted to reveal your secrets if I"
knew them. It is better therefore that I should not. Let me keep my own
"place as a servitor in your company, to cut the brushwood for your fire"
and to bring the water from the spring. In those things you will find me
"faithful. Trust the gipsy no further!"""
"Rollo, remembering her loyalty in the matter of Dolóres at the village"
"of El Sarria, was about to make an objection, but a significant gesture"
from the Sergeant restrained him in time.
"follow, and then occurs the sentence--unhappily a stereotyped one in"
our day--“_This is the lowest rate recorded in any quarter since civil
registration began._”
Now and again a blue-book upon the subject of the birth-rate is
dissected by a journalist and the result appears in his newspaper as a
series of startling figures. The story of England’s decadence is set
out in the plainest language for every one to read.
"At rarer intervals still, some prominent clergyman or sociologist"
"writes or lectures in order to call attention to what is going on, and"
thus to bring home the spiritual and economic dangers of our racial
suicide.
A few people read or listen and are convinced. A good many other
people are too utterly ignorant of either the Philosophy of
Christianity or the Science of Sociology to understand in the least
what the point of view of the protesters is. According to their
"temperament, they smile quietly and dismiss the subject, or bellow"
their disgust at such a subject being mentioned at all.
"“He who far off beholds another dancing,"
And all the time

Thinks him a madman.”
"A party which has the fools at its back is always in the majority, and"

and the great number of honest folk who call themselves both Patriots

money--in order that the dishonest men may not get it all.
boy; throughout the whole incident of the gentle lady whose fate melts
even the Vice to tears; and in the outburst of a mother's grief over her
child's corpse. We quote the last.
"O blissful babe, O joy of womb, heart's comfort and delight,"
"For counsel given unto the king, is this thy just requite?"
"O heavy day and doleful time, these mourning tunes to make!"
"With blubb'red eyes into my arms from earth I will thee take,"
And wrap thee in my apron white: but O my heavy heart!
"The spiteful pangs that it sustains would make it in two to part,"
"The death of this my son to see: O heavy mother now,"
That from thy sweet and sug'red joy to sorrow so shouldst bow!
What grief in womb did I retain before I did thee see;
"Yet at the last, when smart was gone, what joy wert thou to me!"
"How tender was I of thy food, for to preserve thy state!"
How stilled I thy tender heart at times early and late!
"With velvet paps I gave thee suck, with issue from my breast,"
And danced thee upon my knee to bring thee unto rest.
"Is this the joy of thee I reap? O king of tiger's brood,"
"O tiger's whelp, hadst thou the heart to see this child's heart-blood?"
"Nature enforceth me, alas, in this wise to deplore,"
"To wring my hands, O wel-away, that I should see this hour."
"Thy mother yet will kiss thy lips, silk-soft and pleasant white,"
With wringing hands lamenting for to see thee in this plight.
"My lording dear, let us go home, our mourning to augment."
"The second play, _Appius and Virginia_ (1563), by R.B. (not further"
"identified), is, in some respects, weaker; though, by avoiding the"
"crowded plot which spoilt _Cambyses_, it attains more nearly to tragedy."
"The low characters, Mansipulus and Mansipula, the Vice (Haphazard), and"
"the abstractions, Conscience, Comfort and their brethren, reappear with"
as little success. But the singleness of the theme helps towards that
geologists.
THE ALGONKIAN
In some regions there rests unconformably on the Archean an
"immense body of stratified rocks, thousands and in places even"
"scores of thousands of feet thick, known as the ALGONKIAN. Great"
"unconformities divide it into well-defined systems, but as only"
the scantiest traces of fossils appear here and there among its
"strata, it is as yet impossible to correlate the formations of"
different regions and to give them names of more than local
application. We will describe the Algonkian rocks of two typical
areas.
THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO. We have already studied a very
ancient peneplain whose edge is exposed to view deep on the walls
of the Colorado Canyon. The formation of flat-lying sandstone
which covers this buried land surface is proved by its fossils to
"belong to the Cambrian,--the earliest period of the Paleozoic era."
The tilted rocks on whose upturned edges the Cambrian sandstone
"rests are far older, for the physical break which separates them"
from it records a time interval during which they were upheaved to
mountainous ridges and worn down to a low plain. They are
therefore classified as Algonkian. They comprise two immense
series. The upper is more than five thousand feet thick and
consists of shales and sandstones with some limestones. Separated
"from it by an unconformity which does not appear in Figure 207,"
"the lower division, seven thousand feet thick, consists chiefly of"
massive reddish sandstones with seven or more sheets of lava
interbedded. The lowest member is a basal conglomerate composed of
pebbles derived from the erosion of the dark crumpled schists
"beneath,--schists which are supposed to be Archean. As shown in"
Then suddenly the affair altered its complexion.
The oncoming tug was barely twice its length from the scow when Boyd
saw Big George cease his violent antics and level a revolver directly
at the wheel-house of the opposing craft. Two puffs of smoke issued
"from weapon, then out from the glass-encased structure the steersman"
"plunged, scrambled down the deck and into the shelter of the house."
"Instantly the bow of the tug swung off, and she came on sidewise,"
"striking Balt's scow a glancing blow, the sound of which rose above the"
"shouts, while its force threw the big fellow and his companions to"
their knees and shattered the glass in the pilot-house windows. The
"boats behind fouled each other, then drifted down upon the scow, and"
"the tide, seizing the whole flotilla, began to spin it slowly. Rushing"
"to the ladder, Emerson leaped into another launch which fortunately was"
"at hand, and the next instant as the little craft sped out from the"
"side of _The Bedford Castle_, he saw that a fight was in progress on"
"the lighter. It was over quickly, and before he reached the scene the"
"current had drifted the tows apart. George, it seemed, had boarded the"
"tug, dragged the captain off, and beaten him half insensible before the"
man's companions had come to his rescue.
"""Is the scow damaged?"" Emerson cried, as he came alongside."
"""She's leaking, but I guess we can make it,"" George reassured him."
"They directed the second launch to make fast, and, towed by both tugs,"
they succeeded in beaching their cargo a mile below the landing.
"""We'll calk her at low tide,"" George declared, well satisfied at this"
outcome of the misadventure. Then he fell to reviling the men who had
caused it.
"had not seen the half. The city, all roofs and spires and bridges,"
"girt with a wall of seventy towers, roared beneath us; and that I had"
expected. But outside the wall I now saw a second city of huts and
"tents, with a great earthwork about it, and bastions and demilunes and"
picquets posted.
This was the Swedish Lager. It lay principally to the south of the
"city proper, though on all sides it encircled it more or less. They"
told me that there lay in it about forty thousand soldiers and twenty
"thousand horses, and twenty thousand camp followers; but the number"
"was constantly increasing, death and disease notwithstanding, so that"
it presently stood as high as sixty thousand fighting men and half as
"many followers, to say nothing of the garrison that lay in the city,"
"or the troops posted to guard the approaches. It seemed to me, gazing"
"over that mighty multitude from the top of the hill, that nothing"
could resist such a force; and I looked abroad with curiosity for the
enemy.
I expected to view his army cheek by jowl with us; and I was
"disappointed when I saw beyond our camp to southward, where I was told"
"he lay, only a clear plain with the little river Rednitz flowing"
"through it. This plain was a league and more in width, and it was"
"empty of men. Beyond it rose a black wooded ridge, very steep and"
hairy.
My lady explained that Wallenstein's army lay along this
"ridge--seventy thousand men, and forty thousand horses, and"
"Wallenstein himself. His camp we heard was eight miles round, the"
"front guarded by a line of cannon, and taking in whole villages and"
castles. And now I looked again I saw the smoke hang among the trees.
They whispered in Nuremberg that no man in that army took pay; that
all served for booty; and that the troopers that sacked Magdeburg and
"such-and-such solicitors, and to Lewis Maitland Praed A.R.A. in Hans"
Place.
She went to the Brussels bank a fortnight after her mother's death
whilst still availing herself of the hospitality of Madame
Trouessart: to withdraw the jewellery and plate which she had
deposited there on her mother's account. But there she found herself
"confronted with the red tape of the Latin which is more formidable,"
"even, than that of the land of Dora at the present day. These"
deposited articles were held on the order of Mrs. Warren; they could
not be given up till her will was proved and letters of
administration had been granted. So _that_ small resource in funds
"was withheld, at any rate till some time after peace had been"
declared. However she had a thousand pounds (in notes) between her
"and penury, and the friendship of Minna von Stachelberg. She would"
resume her evening lessons in English--Madame Trouessart had found
her several pupils--and she would lodge--as they kindly invited her
to do--with the Baptist pastor and his wife in the Rue Haute. And
"she would help Minna at the hospital, and hope to be rewarded with"
the opportunity of bringing comfort and consolation to the wounded
British prisoners.
"Thus, with no unbearable misery, she passed the year 1916. There"
"were short commons in the way of food, and the cold was sometimes"
cruel. But Madame Walcker was a wonderful cook and could make soup
"from a sausage skewer, and heaped _édredons_ on Vivie's bed. Vivie"
sighed a little over the Blue Placards which announced endless
German victories by land and sea; and she gasped over the dreadful
Red Placards with their lists of victims sentenced to death by the
military courts. She ground her teeth over the announcement of
"Gabrielle Petit's condemnation, and behind the shut door of Minna's"
small sitting-room--and she only shut the door not to compromise
"At all events, the Sergeant and La Giralda went off calmly enough in the"
"direction of the town of San Ildefonso, driving their donkey before"
"them. For a minute, as they gained the crest, their figures stood out"
black and clear against the coppery sunrise. The next they had
"disappeared down the slope, the flapping peak of Cardono's Montera cap"
being the last thing to be lost sight of.
"The long, dragging, idle day was before the party in the dry ravine."
"Etienne went to his saddle-bags, and drawing his breviary from the"
"leathern flap, began to peruse the lessons for the day with an attentive"
piety which was not lessened by the fact that he had forgotten most of
"the Latin he had learned at school. John Mortimer, on the other hand,"
"took out his pocket-book, and was soon absorbed by calculations in which"
wine and onions shared the page with schemes for importing into Spain
Manchester goods woven and dyed to suit the taste of the country
housewives.
El Sarria sat down with a long sigh to his never-failing resort of
"cleaning and ordering his rifle and pistols. He had a phial of oil, a"
"feather, and a fine linen rag which he carried about with him for the"
purpose. Afterwards he undertook the same office for the weapons of
Rollo. Those of the other members of the expedition might take care of
themselves. Ramon Garcia had small belief in their ability to make much
"use of them, at any rate--the sergeant being alone excepted."
"These three being accounted for, there remained only Rollo and Concha."
"Now there was a double shelf a little way from the horses, from which"
the chief of the expedition could keep an eye on the whole encampment.
"The pair slowly and, as it were, unconsciously gravitated thither, and"
"in a moment Rollo found himself telling ""the story of his life"" to a"
"earlier. As a founder of a dynasty that overthrew a previous one, Azag-Bau"
"must have engaged in hostilities with other centres, so that the second"
interpretation that 'the king's country will be seized' may well refer to
"some historical event of the same general period. Be that as it may, the"
important point for us is that we have here another proof of the practical
purpose served by the observation of birth-omens.
IV
Passing now to some illustrations of birth-omens from the collections of
"the =bârû=-priests, let us first take up some texts dealing with omens"
"from the young of animals. Naturally, the animals to which attention was"
"directed were the domesticated ones--sheep, goats, cows, dogs, horses and"
"pigs. Among these the most prominent is the sheep, corresponding to the"
"significance attached to the sheep in liver divination where it is, in"
"fact, the only animal whose liver is read as a means of forecasting the"
future[33]. As a result of this particularly prominent position taken by
"the sheep in birth-omens, the word =isbu=, designating the normal or"
abnormal foetus--human or animal--when introduced without further
qualification generally indicates the foetus of a sheep[34].
"A text[35] dealing with a double foetus, i. e., of a sheep[36], reads in"
part as follows:
"'If it is a double foetus with slits (?) on the head and tail, the"
land will be secure.
"If it is a double foetus and enclosed[37], confusion in the country,"
Edward refuses hot bread at breakfast. His hostess asks whether he
"likes it. “Yes, I am extremely fond of it.” “Why did you refuse it?”"
“Because I know that my papa does not approve of my eating it. Am I to
"disobey a Father and Mother I love so well, and forget my duty, because"
"they are a long way off? I would not touch the cake, were I sure nobody"
"could see me. I myself should know it, and that would be sufficient.”"
"“Nobly replied!” exclaimed Mrs. C. “Act always thus, and you must be"
"happy, for although the whole world should refuse the praise that is"
"due, you must enjoy the approbation of your conscience, which is beyond"
anything else.”
Here is a quotation of the same kind from Mrs. Sherwood:
"“Tender-souled little creatures, desolated by a sense of sin, if"
they did but eat a spoonful of cupboard jam without Mamma's express
"permission.... Would a modern Lucy, jealous of her sister Emily's doll,"
break out thus easily into tearful apology for her guilt?--‘I know
"it is wicked in me to be sorry that Emily is happy, but I feel that"
I cannot help it.’ And would a modern mother retort with heartfelt
"joy?--'My dear child, I am glad you have confessed. Now I shall tell"
you why you feel this wicked sorrow'--proceeding to an account of the
depravity of human nature so unredeemed by comfort for a childish mind
of common intelligence that one can scarcely imagine the interview
ending in anything less tragic than a fit of juvenile hysteria.”
Description of a Good Boy. “A good boy is dutiful to his Father and
"Mother, obedient to his master and loving to his playfellows. He is"
"diligent in learning his book, and takes a pleasure in improving"

Sidney literally blinked before the picture Pola drew--blinked and
blushed that she had dared angle for Mr. Dugald herself like the
forty-to-fourteen single ladies. Mr. Dugald belonged to a world that
"was foreign to the Romley girls, Pola's dazzling, peacock-world."
Sidney felt immensely flattered that Pola had taken her in among her
"peacocks. (Secretly, too, she considered that she carried herself well"
"among them. She was most careful of her dress, now!) She did not know"
"that Pola's sort instinctively seeks out someone to dazzle, that Pola's"
generosity was a part of the dazzling process. She thought Pola
"wonderful to accept so casually her gilded privileges. Why, if Pola"
didn't like a dress or a hat or a pair of shoes she simply didn't wear
it; she could buy anything she wanted from any one of the priceless
bits of jewelry in the shops at Hyannis to the delectable sweets in the
tea-rooms on Commercial Street. She could do just as she pleased--even
"more than Mart, for _she_ never had to darn or mend or wipe dishes or"
dust or hang up her clothes or brush them. Realizing all this Sidney
came to forgive that first condescension that had stung; she thought
Pola little short of an angel to be so prettily friendly with them all.
So engrossed was Sidney in basking in Pola's favor that for a time she
felt no compunctions at deserting Mart and Lavender; in fact she did
not even think of them. Both Mart and Lavender had become suddenly very
"busy with affairs that kept them out of sight. If, once in awhile,"
Sidney wondered what they were doing something of Pola's or something
Pola said quickly crowded the thought from her head. But one afternoon
they encountered Mart as they strolled toward the Green Lantern to sit
under its gay awnings and drink tea. Sidney introduced Mart to Pola and
"to cover Pola's rude stare she added quickly: ""We're going down to the"
"Green Lantern, Mart. Won't you come with us?"" conscious as she said it"
that her voice sounded stilted.
Mr. Watson Cheyne[19] published a very remarkable instance of one of the
"dangers of an injury from a spent bullet, in which, in spite of"
"non-penetration of the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was"
ruptured in two places.
I believe the majority of the wounds designated as explosive were the
"result of the passage of large leaden bullets, either of the"
Martini-Henry or Express type. The small opportunity of observing such
injuries in the hospitals of course depended on the fact that the
majority were rapidly fatal.
_Nature of the anatomical lesion in wounds of the intestine._--The
openings in the parietal peritoneum tended to assume the slit or star
"forms, probably on account of the elasticity of the membrane. A diagram"
of one of these forms is appended to fig. 89. In this instance the
"opening in the peritoneum was made from the abdominal aspect, prior to"
"the escape of the bullet from the cavity, and on the impact of the tip,"
the long axis of the bullet was oblique to the surface of the abdominal
wall.
In the intestinal wall the openings varied in character according to the
mode of impact.
In some cases the gut was merely contused by lateral contact of the
passing bullet. The result of this was evidenced later by the presence
of localised oval patches of ecchymosis. These were identical in
appearance with the patches shown surrounding the wounds in fig. 87.

"But what wonder is it that little Concha, in her passionate Spanish"
"fashion understanding but one way of love, and being little interested"
"in brothers, felt the tears come to her eyes as Rollo's step waxed"
"fainter in the distance, and said over and over to herself with smiling"
"pleasure, ""He loves me--he loves me! Oh, if only my mother had lived, I"
might have been worthier of him. Then I would not have played with men's
"hearts for amusement to myself, as alas, I have too often done. God"
"forgive me, there was no harm, indeed. But--but--I am not worthy of"
"him--I know I am not!"""
So Rollo's hasty kiss on the dark balcony was provocative of a healthy
self-reproach on both sides--which at least was so much to the good.
Concha peered out into the darkness towards the south where a few stars
were blinking sleepily through the ground-mist. She could dimly discern
"the outline of the town lying piled beneath her, without a light,"
"without a sound, without a sign of life. From beyond the hills came a"
"weird booming as of a distant cannonade. But Concha, the careless maiden"
"who had grown into a woman in an hour, did not think of these things."
"For to the Spanish girl, whose heart is touched to the core, there is"
"but one subject worthy of thought. Wars, battles, sieges, the distresses"
"of queens, the danger of royal princesses--all are as nothing, because"
her lips have been kissed.
"""All the same,"" she muttered to herself, ""he ought not have done it--and"
"when I have a little recovered I will tell him so!"""
"But at that moment, poised upon the topmost spike of the great gate in"
"front of her, she saw the silhouette of a man. He was climbing upwards,"
"with his hand on the cross-bar of the railing, and cautiously"
"insinuating a leg over the barrier, feeling meanwhile gingerly for a"
foothold on the palace side.
window is playing in the middle of the square. A _jet d'eau_ indeed!!
"It may do very well for a Frenchman to call it that, but we must call"
it a perfect volcano of water. A huge column goes hissing up as high as
"a steeple, with the speed and force of a rocket, and comes down in"
"thunder, and little rainbows are flitting about in the showery spray."
"It being Sunday, every thing and person is gayer than usual. Bands are"
"playing and soldiers are parading all through the town; everything,"
"indeed, is military, and yet little is foppish--a statement which to"
English ears will sound like a direct contradiction.'
Our traveller had been given letters to certain Berlin Professors from
"young Blackie, afterwards Professor of Greek in Edinburgh University,"
who had just translated Goethe's _Faust_ into the English tongue. 'I
went about half an hour ago to call upon a sort of Professor here to
whom I had a letter and a _Faust_ to present from Blackie--found him
"ill and confined to bed--was admitted, however, very well received, and"
shall call again when I think there is a chance of his being better. I
have still another Professor to call on with a letter and book from
"Blackie, and there my acquaintance with the society of Berlin is likely"
to terminate.' One other introduction to Ferrier on this expedition to
"Germany is mentioned in a note from his aunt, Miss Susan Ferrier, the"
only letter to her nephew that has apparently been preserved: whether
"or not he availed himself of the offer, history does not record. It"
runs as follows:--
"'EDINR., _1st August_."
'I could not get a letter to Lord Corehouse's German sister
"(Countess Purgstall), as it seems she is in bad health, and not fit"
to entertain vagabonds; but I enclose a very kind one from my
"friend, Mrs. Erskine, to the ambassadress at Munich, and if you"
"don't go there you may send it by post, as it will be welcome at"
"""Of course, you can do nothing abrupt; but you'll gradually withdraw"
"from their acquaintance, won't you?"""
"Alicia had escaped without a promise, pleading for time to think in the"
same breath that she denied any concern in the matter. She was by way of
"thinking now, and all that Lady Eynesford had said repeated itself in"
her mind as she looked out on the garden and the glimpses of the town
"beyond. She understood now Dick's banishment, her sister-in-law's"
"unresting hostility to the Medlands, and the reason why she had been"
"pressed to go to Australia. She spared a minute to grief for Daisy, but"
"her own sorrow would not be denied, and engrossed her again. In the"
"solitude she had sought, she cried to herself, ""Why didn't they tell me"
"before? What's the use of telling me now?"" Then she would fly back to"
"the hope that the thing was not true, that her friends had clutched too"
"hastily at anything which would save her from what they dreaded, and,"
"she confessed to herself, rightly dreaded. No, she would not believe it"
"yet; and, if it were not true, why should she not be happy? Why should"
"she not, even though she did what Dick had not dared to do, and what,"
"when Coxon asked her, she had laughed at for an absurdity?"
There began to be more movement outside the gates. The first note of
"band-music was wafted to her ear, and the roll of wheels announced the"
return of the church-goers. She roused herself and went to meet them.
"They were agog with excitement, partly about the meeting, partly about"
the murder. While Eleanor was trying to tell her of the state of
"popular feeling, the Governor seized her arm and began to detail the"
story of the discovery.
"""You remember the man?"" he asked. ""He was at our flower-show--had a sort"
"of row with Medland, you know. Well, he's been found murdered (so the"
police think) in a low part of the town! The woman who keeps the house
on his bent neck and promptly slithered inside his collar and down
his back.
Unfortunately the commander was a man of a most ticklish temperament.
The contact of the metal disc with his back caused him to writhe like
a lost soul in torment. He had recently unflinchingly faced death in
"a hotly-contested engagement in the North Sea, but this rear attack"
completely unnerved him. His grotesque efforts to capture the elusive
coin was too much for the rest of the officers and men. They were
unable to conceal their amusement. Finally the commander dived down
below and divested himself of his uniform.
"Just then the ship's steward appeared with the tin of condensed milk,"
and handed the unopened can to a seaman. Away aloft the man made his
"way till he gained the cross-trees. Owing to the ""Sunderland"""
"altering her course she was swinging considerably to starboard, and"
"the motion made the man advance cautiously, his feet sliding along"
the foot-ropes while he held on grimly with his free hand to the
spar.
Mephisto eyed the approaching delicacy with marked approval. Letting
"the remaining coins drop, some of which tinkled on deck although most"
"of them fell overboard, he whisked along the yard-arm, and before the"
"seaman realized the brute's intention, snatched the can from his"
grasp.
A snarl warned the bluejacket that if he advanced it would be at his
"peril, and unwilling to risk an encounter with an agile monkey on the"
"swaying yard, he followed the precept of discretion being the better"
"part of valour, and regained the deck, leaving the spoils in the"
hands of the elated ape.
"rejected. Generally, it was against the regulations and, particularly,"
it was injudicious. Down pillows would not be a factor in Unity Blake's
after-life.
"“Besides,” she remarked, “she is not the only orphan in the infirmary.”"
“Why not call it a sick-room or sick-ward instead of that prison term?”
asked John.
"“It's the name given to it by the governing body,” she replied."
After this John became a regular visitor. Every time he kicked his heels
for ten minutes in the shabby and depressing parlour and every time he
was received with glacial politeness by the Sister superintendent.
By blunt questioning he learned the history of the institution. The
Sisterhood of Saint Martha was an Angelican body with headquarters in
"Kent, which existed for meditation and not for philanthropic purposes."
The creation and conduct of the orphanage had been thrust upon the
sisterhood by the will of a member long since deceased. It was unpopular
"with the sisterhood, who resented it as an excrescence, but bore it as"
an affliction decreed by divine Providence. Among the cloistered inmates
of the Kentish manor-house there was no fanatical impulse towards
Willesden.
"They were good, religious women; but they craved retirement, and not"
"action, for the satisfying of their spiritual needs. Otherwise they"
would have joined some other sisterhood in which noble lives are spent
"in deeds of charity and love. But there are angels of wrath, angels of"
"mercy, and mere angels. These were mere angels. The possibility of being"
chosen by the Mother Superior to go out into the world again and take
"charge of the education, health, and morals of twenty sturdy and squalid"
little female orphans lived an abiding terror in their gentle breasts. A
An apology seems to be called for from anyone who gives to the world a
new Life of Napoleon I. My excuse must be that for many years I have
sought to revise the traditional story of his career in the light of
facts gleaned from the British Archives and of the many valuable
materials that have recently been published by continental historians.
To explain my manner of dealing with these sources would require an
"elaborate critical Introduction; but, as the limits of my space"
"absolutely preclude any such attempt, I can only briefly refer to the"
most important topics.
"To deal with the published sources first, I would name as of chief"
"importance the works of MM. Aulard, Chuquet, Houssaye, Sorel, and"
"Vandal in France; of Herren Beer, Delbrück, Fournier, Lehmann, Oncken,"
and Wertheimer in Germany and Austria; and of Baron Lumbroso in Italy.
I have also profited largely by the scholarly monographs or
"collections of documents due to the labours of the ""Société d'Histoire"
"Contemporaine,"" the General Staff of the French Army, of MM. Bouvier,"
"Caudrillier, Capitaine ""J.G.,"" Lévy, Madelin, Sagnac, Sciout, Zivy,"
"and others in France; and of Herren Bailleu, Demelitsch, Hansing,"
"Klinkowstrom, Luckwaldt, Ulmann, and others in Germany. Some of the"
recently published French Memoirs dealing with those times are not
"devoid of value, though this class of literature is to be used with"
caution. The new letters of Napoleon published by M. Léon Lecestre and
M. Léonce de Brotonne have also opened up fresh vistas into the life
of the great man; and the time seems to have come when we may safely
revise our judgments on many of its episodes.
"But I should not have ventured on this great undertaking, had I not"
been able to contribute something new to Napoleonic literature. During
"a study of this period for an earlier work published in the ""Cambridge"
"Historical Series,"" I ascertained the great value of the British"
records for the years 1795-1815. It is surely discreditable to our
Athwart the raptures of a vision'd bliss.
"""I'll seek no joy that is not linked with thine,"
"No touch of hope, no taste of holy wine,"
"And after death, no home in any star,"
"That is not shared by thee, supreme, afar"
As here thou'rt first and foremost of all things!
"Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings"
"That wait on thought, when, in thy spirit-sway,"
"Thou dost invest a realm unknown to kings!"""
"Had not she, Edris, consigned him to his ""own disdain, Athwart the"
"raptures of a visioned bliss?"" Ay! truly and deservedly!--and this"
"disdain of himself had now reached its culminating point,--namely, that"
"he did not consider himself worthy of her love,--or worthy to do aught"
than sink again into far spaces of darkness and perpetually
"retrospective Memory, there to explore the uttermost depths of anguish,"
"and count up his errors one by one from the very beginning of life, in"
"every separate phase he had passed through, till he had penitently"
"striven his best to atone for them all! Christ had atoned! yes,--but"
was it not almost base on his part to shield himself with that Divine
Light and do nothing further? He could not yet thoroughly grasp the
"amazing truth that ONE ABSOLUTELY PURE act of faith in Christ, blots"
"out Past Sin forever,--it seemed too marvellous and great a boon!"
When he retired to rest that night he was fully and firmly PREPARED TO
DIE. With this expectation upon him he was nevertheless happy and
"tranquil. The line--""Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings"""
"haunted him, and he repeated it over and over again without knowing"
why. Wings! the brilliant shafts of radiance that part angels from
"mortals,--wings, that, after all, are not really wings, but lambent"
true. It is for man not to quarrel with circumstances but bravely accept
them; and we belong to that race and dynasty who had accomplished great
things with simple means.
FAILURE AND SUCCESS
"This day twenty-three years ago, I resolved that as far as the"
"whole-hearted devotion and faith of one man counted, that would not be"
wanting and within six months it came about that some of the most
difficult problems connected with Electric Waves found their solution in
"my Laboratory and received high appreciation from Lord Kelvin, Lord"
Rayleigh and other leading physicists. The Royal Society honoured me by
"publishing my discoveries and offering, of their own accord, an"
appropriation from the special Parliamentary Grant for the advancement
of knowledge. That day the closed gates suddenly opened and I hoped that
"the torch that was then lighted would continue to burn brighter, and"
brighter. But man's faith and hope require repeated testing. For five
"years after this, the progress was interrupted; yet when the most"
generous and wide appreciation of my work had reached almost the highest
point there came a sudden and unexpected change.
LIVING AND NON-LIVING
In the pursuit of my investigations I was unconsciously led into the
border region of physics and physiology and was amazed to find boundary
lines vanishing and points of contact emerge between the realms of the
Living and Non-living. Inorganic matter was found anything but inert; it
also was a thrill under the action of multitudinous forces that played
"on it. A universal reaction seemed to bring together metal, plant and"
animal under a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same
"rear with scales. The vertebrae were not ossified, for no trace of"
them has been found.
DEVONIAN FISHES. The TRUE FISHES of the Devonian can best be
understood by reference to their descendants now living. Modern
fishes are divided into several groups: SHARKS and their allies;
"DIPNOANS; GANOIDS, such as the sturgeon and gar; and TELEOSTS,--"
"most common fishes, such as the perch and cod."
SHARKS. Of all groups of living fishes the sharks are the oldest
and still retain most fully the embryonic characters of their
Paleozoic ancestors. Such characters are the cartilaginous
"skeleton, and the separate gill slits with which the throat wall"
is pierced and which are arranged in line like the gill openings
of the lamprey. The sharks of the Silurian and Devonian are known
"to us chiefly by their teeth and fin spines, for they were"
"unprotected by scales or plates, and were devoid of a bony"
skeleton. Figure 299 is a restoration of an archaic shark from a
somewhat higher horizon. Note the seven gill slits and the
lappetlike paired fins. These fins seem to be remnants of the
"continuous fold of skin which, as embryology teaches, passed from"
fore to aft down each side of the primitive vertebrate.
Devonian sharks were comparatively small. They had not evolved
into the ferocious monsters which were later to be masters of the
seas.
"DIPNOANS, OR LUNG FISHES. These are represented to-day by a"
few peculiar fishes and are distinguished by some high structures
which ally them with amphibians. An air sac with cellular spaces
is connected with the gullet and serves as a rudimentary lung. It
"corresponds with the swim bladder of most modern fishes, and"

[Sidenote: What the Italians now Think about it.]
"""But,"" some one may say, ""the pasquinades were written long ago, and,"
"while they are doubtless true descriptions of the papacy of the past,"
"surely no one would take the same view now."" For answer I may quote"
"the statement of Dr. Raffaelle Mariano, Professor of Philosophy in the"
"University of Naples, who is not a Protestant, but, as he tells us, was"
"""born in the Roman Catholic Church,"" and was ""a fervent Catholic from"
"infancy."" Speaking of the vast difference which he found between the"
teachings of the church and those of the New Testament as to what is
"necessary to salvation, he says, ""Therefore, Roman Catholicism is not"
"only not Christianity, but it is the very antithesis of Christianity,"""
a statement every whit as strong as Pasquino's. Some American
"Protestants, especially those who have personal friends in the Roman"
Catholic Church whom they honor and love--and there are many people in
"that church who are richly worthy of honor and love, and who do not"
approve of the evils we have been describing any more than we do--are
sometimes disposed to think that Protestant writers are too severe in
"their condemnation of the Romish Church as a system. A visit to Italy,"
"the centre of Romanism, would quickly disabuse these overcharitable"
Protestants of that impression. We have all read of such things as
"are described above in connection with the relics and legends, but"
"they seem far away and unreal, and almost impossible, until we come"
to the home of Romanism and find them all around us. Then it ceases
to surprise us that so large a proportion of the most intelligent men
"numbed by the nerve-racking concussion. Then, as the smoke drifted"
"away, he could discern the débris of the bridge. Charthouse,"
"stanchions, semaphore, signal-lockers--all had vanished, and with"
them the captain and those of the officers and men who had dared fate
"by rejecting the shelter afforded by the conning-tower, which,"
"stripped of its surroundings, stood out a gaunt, fire-pitted steel"
box.
"The shell, a 42-centimetre, had literally cleared the forepart of the"
"ship, from the for'ard 6-inch gun to the second funnel. Everything in"
"its path had been literally pulverized, with the exception of the"
conning-tower. Had the projectile burst on or below the main deck the
"fate of the ""Sunderland"" would have been sealed; as it was, she was"
still intact under the waterline.
Instinctively Aubyn realized that the ship was not under control.
"Steaming rapidly she was heading towards the ""Bradford""--her sister"
ship--which was steering in a north-easterly direction at about five
cables' distance on her port bow.
With a tremendous effort of will-power Terence cleared at a bound the
formidable glowing plate of metal that obstructed his path. Making
"his way across the scorched and splintered planks, some of which gave"
"under his weight, he reached the entrance to the conning-tower."
The steel citadel was full of acrid-smelling smoke that eddied in the
air-currents which drifted in through the observation slits.

Terence entered. As he did so he stumbled over the body of the

"A city watchman, with a pipe in his mouth, looked drowsily and frowsily"
out of the town-hall or _ayuntamiento_. He was retreating again to his
settle when it suddenly struck him that this intruder had paid no duty
"upon her milk and firewood. True, he was not the functionary appointed"
"by law to receive the tax; but since he was on the spot, and for lack of"
"other constituted the representative of civic state, he felt he must"
undertake the duty.
"So, laying aside his pipe and seizing his halberd and cocked hat, he"
sallied grumblingly forth to intercept the bold contravener of municipal
"laws. But the active limbs of the old gipsy, the lightened udders of the"
"she-goats, and the ass with his meek nose pointed homeward, took the"
party out of the village gate before the man in authority could
over-take La Giralda.
"Soon, therefore, the roofs of San Ildefonso and the white palace again"
lay beneath her as the gipsy reascended by her track of the morning. So
long had she occupied in her various adventures that the evening shadows
were already lengthening when she returned to the corrie where the party
had spent in restful indolence the burden and heat of the day. The
"Sergeant had not yet arrived, and La Giralda delayed her story till he"
should give her leave to speak. For not even to the gipsies of the
Guadarrama was José Maria a greater personage than Sergeant Cardono to
La Giralda of Sevilla.
"In the mean time she busied herself, with Concha's help, in preparing"
"the evening meal, as quick upon her legs as if she had done nothing but"
lounge in the shade all day. It was almost sundown when the Sergeant
"came in, dropping unannounced over the precipice as if from the clouds."
"the four turrets, and at the side batteries. Every few minutes they"
put through tests which would have shown up at once any wires that had
been tampered with. After the shore party had cleared out about nine
"o'clock on the Thursday, no officer or man was allowed to leave the"
ship without a special permit from the Commander. This was all dead
"against the sanitary regulations of the harbour, but I had the"
"Admiral's authority to break any rules I pleased. By the way, you two"
ought never to have been allowed on board yesterday afternoon--I saw
"you, though you didn't see me; it was contrary to my orders. I spoke"
to the Admiral pretty sharp last night. 'Who is responsible for the
"ship?' says I. 'You or me?' 'You,' says he. 'I leave it at that,' says"
"I."""
"""One moment, Dawson,"" I put in. ""If the shore party had all gone, how"
"was it that I saw Petty Officer Trehayne in the ship?"""
"""He had orders to stay and keep watch--though he didn't know I was on"
"board myself. Two pairs of police eyes are better than one pair, and"
fifty times better than all the Navy eyes in the ship. Of all the
"simple-minded, unsuspicious beggars in the world, give me a pack of"
naval ratings! I wouldn't have one of them for sentries--that is why
"the fifty emergency Marines were sent for."" Dawson's limitless pride"
"in his old Service, and deep contempt for the mere sailor, had come"
back in full flood with the uniform of his Corps.
"""I started my own sentry duty in the dark corner I told you of as soon"
"as I had seen to the arrangements all over the _Malplaquet_, and I was"
"there, with very few breaks of not more than five minutes each for a"
"bite of food, for twenty-six hours. Two Marine sentries took my place"
"whenever I was away. I had my rifle and bayonet, and stood back in a"
corner of a bulkhead where I couldn't be seen. The hours were awful
long; I stood without hardly moving. All the pins and needles out of
up with a typewriter at which the military clerk sat tapping. The
Colonel's personal luggage had been placed in his bedroom. A soldier
was even sweeping up all traces of the invasion of armed men and
making everything tidy. It all seemed like a horrid dream that was
going to end up happily after all. Presently Vivie would wake up
"completely and there would even be no Oberst, no orderly; only the"
peaceful life of the farm that was going on yesterday. Here a sound
of angry voices interrupted her musings. The cows returning by
themselves from the pasture were being intercepted by soldiers who
were trying to secure them. Vivie in her indignation ran out and
"ordered the soldiers off, in English. To her surprise they obeyed"
"silently, but as they sauntered away to their quarters she was"
saddened at seeing them carrying the bodies of most of the turkeys
and fowls and even the corpse of the poor tailless peacock. They had
waited for sundown to rob the hen-roosts.
Very much disillusioned she ran to the morning room and burst in on
"the Colonel's dictation to his clerk. ""Excuse me, but if you don't"
keep your soldiers in better order you will have very little to eat
whilst you are here. They are killing and carrying off all our
"poultry."""
The Colonel flushed a little at the peremptory way in which she
"spoke, but without replying went out and shouted a lot of orders in"
German. His orderly summoned soldiers from the barn and together
they drove the cows into the cow-sheds. All the Flemish servants
"having disappeared in a panic, the Germans had to milk the cows that"
"evening; and Vivie, assisted by the orderly, cooked the evening"
"meal in the kitchen. He was, like his Colonel, a Saxon, a"
"pleasant-featured, domesticated man, who explained civilly in the"
Thuringian dialect--though to Vivie there could be no discrimination
"between varieties of High German--that the Sachsen folk were ""Eines"
within his reach.
"Since her return, Rosek had begun to come again, very careful not to"
"repeat his mistake, but not deceiving her at all.  Though his"
"self-control was as great as Fiorsen's was small, she felt he had not"
"given up his pursuit of her, and would take very good care that Daphne"
Wing was afforded every chance of being with her husband. But pride never
"let her allude to the girl.  Besides, what good to speak of her?  They"
"would both lie--Rosek, because he obviously saw the mistaken line of his"
"first attack; Fiorsen, because his temperament did not permit him to"
suffer by speaking the truth.
"Having set herself to endure, she found she must live in the moment,"
"never think of the future, never think much of anything. Fortunately,"
nothing so conduces to vacuity as a baby.  She gave herself up to it with
"desperation.  It was a good baby, silent, somewhat understanding.  In"
"watching its face, and feeling it warm against her, Gyp succeeded daily"
"in getting away into the hypnotic state of mothers, and cows that chew"
"the cud.  But the baby slept a great deal, and much of its time was"
"claimed by Betty.  Those hours, and they were many, Gyp found difficult."
"She had lost interest in dress and household elegance, keeping just"
"enough to satisfy her fastidiousness; money, too, was scarce, under the"
"drain of Fiorsen's irregular requirements.  If she read, she began almost"
"at once to brood.  She was cut off from the music-room, had not crossed"
its threshold since her discovery.  Aunt Rosamund's efforts to take her
"into society were fruitless--all the effervescence was out of that, and,"
"though her father came, he never stayed long for fear of meeting Fiorsen."
"In this condition of affairs, she turned more and more to her own music,"
"and one morning, after she had come across some compositions of her"
"girlhood, she made a resolution. That afternoon she dressed herself with"
"pleasure, for the first time for months, and sallied forth into the"
February frost.
"The eminent statesman, Baron Suyematsu, kindly dictated in English to"
one of our editors answers relating to certain questions with regard to
"the relation between Japan and Europe, especially France and Germany."
"With the disclosure of the alleged Kodama report in view, how far"
may one give credit to the alleged Japanese plan of invasion of
Indo-China?
I know all that has been written in France on the subject. All those
"rumours appear to me to have come originally from Russia, and to have"
been put into circulation in order to excite French opinion against
"Japan, in other words, it is nothing else than a mere repetition of the"
Yellow Peril cry.
Japan does not covet Indo-China. I have shown elsewhere that the French
colonies in the Far East have no perceptible influence upon the
"situation of Japan, either from a political or an economical point of"
"view. Japan has sufficient to do at home, she does not want to plunge"
"into external adventures, such as meddling with Indo-China or picking a"
quarrel with a country like France. You may be sure that it would be
more politic for France to cultivate amicable relations with Japan than
irritate her by such accusations. Even if those accusations honestly
"represent the true sentiment of the French, the Japanese would only take"
"them for malicious manœuvres directed to aid Russia, and they could"
not produce any good impression on the minds of the Japanese.
Is there any reason to believe that the so-called Kodama report was
forged in Russia rather than in France?
I have demonstrated elsewhere that the document which was recently made
"stood ready to cast off--was that he once followed the sea, but in more"
recent years lived by fishing up sponges and at times supplying shark
meat to the poorer quarter of Key West. The carcass of a water fowl tied
"to his boat, while he occupied himself with sponges, would sometimes"
"attract a shark; then he would strip, take a knife in his teeth, and"
dive.
"I glanced at Gates, but saw no incredulity in his face."
"In another hour, at nearly dusk, Key West had grown small and finally"
"sank below the horizon, leaving only its three skeleton-like towers"
"standing against the sky--standing erect with all nerves strained,"
"watch-dogs of the darkening sea; ears cocked, to catch a distressed cry"
from some waif out in the mysterious night.
Looking back along our wake I imagined the big black man standing as we
"had left him on the dock, gazing after us with patient regret; and I was"
"glad to have given him the handful of coins at parting, little dreaming"
how many times that loaf upon the water would come floating in to me.
Monsieur Dragot revealed himself more and more to our astonished eyes as
we sat that night on deck. He had been a professor in the University of
"Bucharest, and hinted at an intimate entente with the reigning house of"
"Azuria. Besides being versed in many sciences, including medicine, he"
spoke seven languages and read several others. But these things were
"drawn from him by Tommy's artful questions, rather than being said in"
"boastfulness. Indeed, Monsieur was charmingly, almost touchily, modest."
"Of his business in Havana he gave no hint, yet this happened to be the"
one piece of information that Tommy seemed most possessed to find out.
"""You'll be in Cuba long, Monsieur?"" he asked."
"sold or ordered, are blessed and enriched with the indulgences of the"
Rosary Confraternity and the papal blessing. When blessed they may be
"distributed; _but if resold they lose all the indulgences_."" (Italics"
ours.)
Still another relic of great interest in this convent of St. Sabina
"is the crucifix of Michele Ghislieri (afterwards Pope Pius V.). ""One"
"day, as Ghislieri was about to kiss his crucifix, in the eagerness"
"of prayer, the image of Christ, says the legend, retired of its own"
"accord from his touch, for it had been poisoned by an enemy, and a kiss"
"would have been death."""
"[Sidenote: Sundry Miracles by Other Saints, and Images.]"
"In the Church of St. Gregory, on the C[oe]lian Hill, the thing that"
"interested us most was the picture by Badalocchi, ""commemorating a"
"miracle on this spot, when, at the moment of elevation, the Host"
"is said to have bled in the hands of St. Gregory, to convince an"
"unbeliever of the truth of transubstantiation."" This is the same"
Gregory who presented certain foreign ambassadors with a handful of
"earth from the arena of the Coliseum as a relic for their sovereigns,"
"so many martyrs having suffered death there, and ""upon their receiving"
"the gift with disrespect, he pressed it, when blood flowed from the"
"soil."""
Not far from the Church of St. Gregory we were shown the hermitage
"where St. Giovanni de Matha lived. ""Before he came to reside here he"
had been miraculously brought from Tunis (whither he had gone on a
"mission) to Ostia, in a boat without helm or sail, in which he knelt"
"without ceasing before the crucifix throughout the whole of his voyage!"""
Time would fail me to tell of the miraculous surgical operation
"would often be waylaid and forced to release them. An old woman, say,"
"anxious to do some deed of merit, would come to him as he returned"
"triumphantly home with his fowls and tender him money, and beg him to"
release the fowls. She would give the full price or double the price of
"the fowls; she had no desire to gain merit at another person's expense,"
and the unwilling cook would be obliged to give up the fowls. Public
"opinion was so strong he dare not refuse. The money was paid, the fowls"
"set free, and I dined on tinned beef."
And yet the villages are full of fowls. Why they are kept I do not know.
Certainly not for food. I do not mean to say that an accidental meeting
"between a rock and a fowl may not occasionally furnish forth a dinner,"
but this is not the object with which they are kept--of this I am sure.
You would not suppose that fowls were capable of exciting much
"affection, yet I suppose they are. Certainly in one case ducks were."
There is a Burman lady I know who is married to an Englishman. He kept
"ducks. He bought a number of ducklings, and had them fed up so that they"
might be fat and succulent when the time came for them to be served at
"table. They became very fine ducks, and my friend had promised me one. I"
"took an interest in them, and always noticed their increasing fatness"
"when I rode that way. Imagine, then, my disappointment when one day I"
saw that all the ducks had disappeared.
"I stopped to inquire. Yes, truly they were all gone, my friend told me."
"In his absence his wife had gone up the river to visit some friends, and"
"had taken the ducks with her. She could not bear, she said, that they"
"should be killed, so she took them away and distributed them among her"
"friends, one here and one there, where she was sure they would be well"
treated and not killed. When she returned she was quite pleased at her
"success, and laughed at her husband and me."
"I do not think it difficult to see how the sick man's face will lighten,"
how his eyes will brighten at the thoughts that come to him at the old
man's words. And he goes on:
'Remember when the squall came up the river and the boat upset when you
were crossing here; how it seemed as if no man could live alone in such
"waves, and yet how you clung to and saved the boy who was with you,"
swimming through the water that splashed over your head and very nearly
"drowned you. The boy's father and mother have never forgotten that, and"
they are even now mourning without in the veranda. It is all due to you
that their lives have not been full of misery and despair. Remember
their faces when you brought their little son to them saved from death
in the great river. Surely that is a pleasant thing. Remember your wife
"who is now with you; how you have loved her and cherished her, and kept"
faithful to her before all the world. You have been a good husband to
"her, and you have honoured her. She loves you, and you have loved her"
all your long life together. Surely that is a pleasant thing.'
"Yes, surely these are pleasant things to have with one at the last."
Surely a man will die easier with such memories as these before his
"eyes, with love in those about him, and the calm of good deeds in his"
dying heart. If it be a different way of soothing a man's end from those
"which other nations use, is it the worse for that?"
Think of your good deeds. It seems a new idea to me that in doing well
"in our life we are making for ourselves a pleasant death, because of the"
memory of those things. And if we have none? or if evil so outnumbered
"the good deeds as to hide and overwhelm them, what then? A man's death"
will be terrible indeed if he cannot in all his days remember one good
deed that he has done.
"'All a man's life comes before him at the hour of death,' said my"
"Miss Lindon's heart sank. She had lived in suburbs all her life, and"
found Croydon--the Lord knows why--the most delectable of them all. She
had sat under Mr. Moneyfeather of Saint Michael's for many years--such
"a dear, good man who preached such eloquent sermons! You could always"
"understand him, too, which was a great comfort. And the church was just"
"round the corner. In London folks had to go to church by omnibus, a most"
"unpleasant and possibly irreverent prelude to divine worship. Besides,"
"when you did get to the sacred edifice, you found yourself in a"
"confusing land where all the clergy, even to the humblest deacon,"
"were austere and remote strangers, who looked at members of their"
congregation with glassy and unsympathetic eyes when they passed them
"in the street. Here, in Croydon, on the contrary, when she met Mr."
"Moneyfeather in public places, he held her hand and patted it and"
inquired affectionately after Dandy's health. With a London vicar she
could not conceive the possibility of such privileged terms of intimacy.
"London, where you did not know your next-door neighbor, and where you"
took no interest in the births of babies over the way; where no one
"ran in for a gossip in the mornings; where every street was a clashing,"
dashing High Street.
"But though her face pictured her dismay, she was too generous to"
translate it into words. John never guessed her sacrifice.
"“We 'll go somewhere quiet,” said he, after a while."
"“We 'll go wherever you like, dear,” replied Miss Lindon, meekly, and"
she rang the bell for tea.
"The main point decided, they proceeded to discuss the details of the"
"scheme, the minds of each suffused in a misty wonder. If John had told"
the simple lady that she could serve him by taking command of a cavalry
"regiment, she would have agreed in her unselfish fashion, but she would"

"Erasmus never felt happy, was never content. This may perhaps surprise"
"us for a moment, when we think of his cheerful, never-failing energy, of"
his gay jests and his humour. But upon reflection this unhappy feeling
tallies very well with his character. It also proceeds from his general
attitude of warding off. Even when in high spirits he considers himself
"in all respects an unhappy man. 'The most miserable of all men, the"
"thrice-wretched Erasmus,' he calls himself in fine Greek terms. His life"
"'is an Iliad of calamities, a chain of misfortunes. How can anyone envy"
_me_?' To no one has Fortune been so constantly hostile as to him. She
"has sworn his destruction, thus he sang in his youth in a poetical"
complaint addressed to Gaguin: from earliest infancy the same sad and
hard fate has been constantly pursuing him. Pandora's whole box seems to
have been poured out over him.
This unhappy feeling takes the special form of his having been charged
"by unlucky stars with Herculean labour, without profit or pleasure to"
himself:[16] troubles and vexations without end. His life might have
been so much easier if he had taken his chances. He should never have
left Italy; or he ought to have stayed in England. 'But an immoderate
love of liberty caused me to wrestle long with faithless friends and
inveterate poverty.' Elsewhere he says more resignedly: 'But we are
driven by fate'.
That immoderate love of liberty had indeed been as fate to him. He had
always been the great seeker of quiet and liberty who found liberty late
"and quiet never. By no means ever to bind himself, to incur no"
obligations which might become fetters--again that fear of the
entanglements of life. Thus he remained the great restless one. He was
"never truly satisfied with anything, least of all with what he produced"
"himself. 'Why, then, do you overwhelm us with so many books', someone at"
"for company, and a few guineas in our pockets, need not fear the future;"
and I trow it will be well for you to be quit for ever of my Lord
Sandford’s company.  I liked him not greatly for your friend; I hate him
with a goodly hatred since he shows himself your foe.  Shall we turn our
"backs upon him and upon London town, and seek our fortunes with the army"
"over the water, where his Grace of Marlborough will give you welcome?"""
"""I scarce know what the future will bring for me, Dicon,"" was the reply,"
"spoken gravely, yet with a certain listless indifference not lost upon"
"the servant; ""I have made no plans as yet.  Let us see what this day"
"brings forth first."""
"""I wager it will fill our pockets anew with gold!"""
"""I will not touch their gold!"" spoke Grey with eyes that suddenly"
"flashed fire.  ""I have cancelled all my wagers.  I will take nothing at"
their hands. I will ride Don Carlos and ride my best for mine own honour
and that of the good steed I shall bestride; but their money will I not
"touch.  I have done with all that.  Nay, stare not in such amaze, good"
"Dicon.  I have not taken leave of my senses; rather, I trow, I have come"
"to my better mind.  Now get me somewhat to eat here, and then we will to"
"the stables to see my beauty. This match once over, we turn a new page"
"in our life’s story.  Who knows what the next will be?"""
It was not much that Grey could eat.  The three days which had passed
"since he and Lord Sandford had come to an understanding, which was"
"well-nigh a rupture, had left a mark upon him.  Moreover there was a"
"weary ache at his heart which he did not fully understand, and which was"
harder to bear than aught beside.  Dimly he knew that it had some
connection with the Lady Geraldine Adair; but he feared to search too
deeply into that matter.  She was as far removed from him as the moon in
"the heavens, and he believed her plighted to another, and that one a man"
"five minutes after leaving the house, reached the bank of the little"
creek I have mentioned.
"Here we paused and waited, a group of huddled figures, while Steve"
"groped about for a plank he had hidden. Before us lay the stream,"
behind us the camp. At any moment the alarm might be raised. I
"pictured the outcry, the sudden flickering of lights, the galloping"
"this way and that, the discovery. And then, thank Heaven! Steve found"
"his plank, and in the work of passing the women over I forgot my"
"fears. The darkness, the peril--for the water on the nearer side was"
"deep--the nervous haste of some, and the terror of others, made the"
task no easy one. I was hot as fire and wet to the waist before it was
"over, and we all stood ankle-deep in the ooze which formed the farther"
bank.
Alas! our troubles were only beginning. Through this ooze we had to
"wade for a mile or more, sometimes in doubt, always in darkness; now"
"plashing into pools, now stumbling over a submerged log, often up to"
"our knees in mud and water. The frogs croaked round us, the bog moaned"
and gurgled; in the depth of the marsh the bitterns boomed mournfully.
If we stood a moment we sank. It was a horrible time; and the more
"horrible, as through it all we had only to turn to see the camp lights"
"behind us, a poor half-mile or so away."
None but desperate men could have exposed women to such a labour; nor
could any but women without hope and at their wit's end have
"accomplished it. As it was, Fraulein Max, who never ceased to whimper,"
"twice sank down and would go no farther, and we had to pluck her up"
"roughly and force her on. My lady's women, who wept in their misery,"
"were little better. Wet to the waist, draggled, and worn out by the"
"clinging slime and the reek of the marsh, they were kept moving only"
"with difficulty; so that, but for Steve's giant strength and my lady's"
He felt the tension of the muscles beneath him. Don Carlos was gathering
"himself together for the leap.  He would not fail, falter, or refuse."
The great mass seemed rushing up against him.  He felt the slackening
"with which Don Carlos faced his task, the motion of his flanks as he"
"took off and rose. Then what was it happened?  The sound of a click,"
"sharp and clear—a sickening sensation of falling, sinking, struggling,"
plunging.  Grey felt for a moment as though the end had come.  He and
his horse seemed falling into the very bowels of the earth. A black
shadow almost overhead showed him that the stallion had cleared the
"barrier, and the air was full of shouts, screams, cheers, and cries."
Next moment he felt strong hands lifting and dragging him upwards.
"Dick’s white face looked into his own, and the first words he heard were"
hissed in his ear by his faithful henchman.
"""Foul play, foul play, my master.  That ditch was dug and concealed—ay,"
"and more than concealed; it has been an old well at some time, and it"
will open with a spring.  You have been grossly tricked and cozened.  It
has been a trap cleverly laid and baited. But let me only get at them—my
"Lord Sandford—"""
"Dick almost choked in his fury; but Grey was now on his feet, and his"
"one thought was for the good horse, who had dropped downwards into this"
"unseen, unsuspected pit, and was gasping in affright, but might possibly"
"have escaped serious injury.  He himself felt little ill effects, having"
"had a marvellous escape.  But his soul was stirred within him, and in"
"getting out the horse he saw plainly that Dick had been right, and that"
some sort of old trap-door concealed an opening into the ground which
"might have been at one time a well, but was now silted up with sand.  By"
"luring the foremost rider to this particular spot to take the leap, any"
astute enemy aware of the nature of the ground could almost certainly
"The Captain's eyes were alight with happiness, and his face red with"
"excitement.  He worked upon Vaviloff's greed, and urging upon him the"
"importance of immediate action in the matter, went away in a very"
joyful and happy frame of mind.
*      *      *      *      *
"In the evening everyone was told of the Captain's discovery, and they"
"all began to discuss Petunikoff's future predicament, painting in vivid"
colours his excitement and astonishment on the day the court messenger
handed him the copy of the summons.  The Captain felt himself quite a
hero.  He was happy and all his friends highly pleased. The heap of
dark and tattered figures that lay in the courtyard made noisy
"demonstrations of pleasure. They all knew the merchant, Petunikoff, who"
"passed them very often, contemptuously turning up his eyes and giving"
them no more attention than he bestowed on the other heaps of rubbish
"lying on the ground.  He was well fed, and that exasperated them still"
more; and now how splendid it was that one of themselves had struck a
hard blow at the selfish merchant's purse!  It gave them all the
greatest pleasure.  The Captain's discovery was a powerful instrument
in their hands.  Every one of them felt keen animosity towards all
"those who were well fed and well dressed, but in some of them this"
feeling was only beginning to develop. Burning interest was felt by
"those ""creatures that once were men"" in the prospective fight between"
"Kuvalda and Petunikoff, which they already saw in imagination."
For a fortnight the inhabitants of the dosshouse awaited the further
"development of events, but Petunikoff never once visited the building."
It was known that he was not in town and that the copy of the petition
had not yet been handed to him.  Kuvalda raged at the delays of the
civil court.  It is improbable that anyone had ever awaited the
merchant with such impatience as did this bare-footed brigade.
bleeding spot.
_Empyema._--I may here add the little that I have to say on this
subject. During the whole campaign the single case of primary empyema
"that I saw was the one recorded below, which deserves special mention as"
illustrating the disadvantage of extracting bullets on the field. Under
the conditions which necessarily accompanied this operation the
"ensurance of asepsis was impossible, and the additional wound no doubt"
proved the source of infection.
"(152) _Entry_, at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid"
"muscle, 2 inches above the clavicle; the bullet came to the"
"surface beneath the skin over the fifth rib, in the nipple line"
"of the right side. There was never any hæmoptysis, but the"
patient suffered with some dyspnoea throughout. After a three
"days' stay in the Field hospital, where the subcutaneous bullet"
"was removed, the patient was transported by wagon and train to"
"the Base, a journey of about 600 miles."
"On the fifth day pus escaped from the extraction wound, and"
"when the case was examined at the Base, the temperature was"
"101°, the pulse over 100, the respirations 30, and the whole"
"side of the chest was dull, with the exception of a patch of"
boxy resonance over the apex anteriorly. On the following day
"the chest was drained, and a considerable amount of pus"
"evacuated, which was mixed with breaking-down blood-clot. A"
fortnight later a second operation had to be performed to
"improve the drainage, and the patient made a tedious recovery."
The following case well illustrates the symptoms in a severe case of
"hæmothorax, and empyema following aspiration:--"
picked from among them to act as her nurse.
And if it did not occur to her to question either his power or his
"perfect right to dispose of her future also as he might see fit, had not"
"all her experience gone to prove that might is right everywhere, that"
law and justice are merely additional pretexts devised by the strong for
oppressing the weak? She had had to choose between remaining on board
"the _Olive Branch_, or paying Jasper Slyne his price for the chance of"
escape he had offered her in pursuance of his own aims.
She disliked and distrusted Slyne scarcely less than before. But she did
"not see how she could have chosen otherwise. And, in any case,--it was"
too late now to revoke the promise she had made him.
She was still afraid to place any faith in the promises he had made
her. She had no idea how he had come at his alleged discovery of her
real identity. But Mr. Jobling's obvious belief in that recurred to her
"mind, and she fell to wondering timidly what life would be like as Lady"
Josceline Justice.
"Her impressions on that point were very hazy, however, and she had still"
to puzzle out the problem added by Justin Carthew. But she finally gave
"up the attempt to solve that at the moment, contenting herself with the"
"tremulous hope that she might soon be on her way toward that dear,"
"unknown, dream-home for which her hungry heart had so often ached."
Of the exorbitant price so soon to be paid for the brief glimpse of
"happiness Slyne had agreed to allow her, she took no further thought at"
all. She had already made up her mind to meet that without complaint.
"An hour or more later, when Slyne looked in to tell her that it was time"
"to start, she was still seated at the window, gazing out over the"
"On seeing him, they would come forward from all corners of the"
"court-yard, drunk, or suffering from drunken headache, dishevelled,"
"tattered, miserable, and pitiable.  Then would come the barrel-like,"
"stout Aleksei Maksimovitch Simtsoff, formerly Inspector of Woods and"
"Forests, under the Department of Appendages, but now trading in"
"matches, ink, blacking, and lemons. He was an old man of sixty, in a"
"canvas overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat, the greasy borders of which hid"
"his stout fat red face.  He had a thick white beard, out of which a"
"small red nose turned gaily heavenwards.  He had thick, crimson lips"
"and watery, cynical eyes.  They called him ""Kubar,"" a name which well"
"described his round figure and buzzing speech.  After him, Kanets"
"appeared from some corner--a dark, sad-looking, silent drunkard: then"
"the former governor of the prison, Luka Antonovitch Martyanoff, a man"
"who existed on ""remeshok,"" ""trilistika,"" and ""bankovka,""* and many such"
"cunning games, not much appreciated by the police.  He would throw his"
"hard and oft-scourged body on the grass beside the teacher, and,"
"turning his eyes round and scratching his head, would ask in a hoarse,"
"bass voice, ""May I?"""
"*Note by translator.--Well-known games of chance, played by the lower"
"classes.  The police specially endeavour to stop them, but"
unsuccessfully.
"Then appeared Pavel Solntseff, a man of thirty years of age, suffering"
from consumption.  The ribs of his left side had been broken in a
"quarrel, and the sharp, yellow face, like that of a fox, always wore a"
"malicious smile.  The thin lips, when opened, exposed two rows of"
"decayed black teeth, and the rags on his shoulders swayed backwards and"
forwards as if they were hung on a clothes pole.  They called him
"""Abyedok.""  He hawked brushes and bath brooms of his own manufacture,"
good strong brushes made from a peculiar kind of grass.
"There was a woman once who loved a young man, not of her village, very"
"dearly. And he loved her, too, as dearly as she loved him, and he"
demanded her in marriage from her parents; but they refused. Why they
"refused I do not know, but probably because they did not consider the"
young man a proper person for their daughter to marry. Then he tried to
"run away with her, and nearly succeeded, but they were caught before"
they got clear of the village.
The young man had to leave the neighbourhood. The attempted abduction of
"a girl is an offence severely punishable by law, so he fled; and in"
"time, under pressure from her people, the girl married another man; but"
she never forgot. She lived with her husband quite happily; he was good
"to her, as most Burmese husbands are, and they got along well enough"
together. But there were no children.
"After some years, four or five, I believe, the former lover returned to"
his village. He thought that after this lapse of time he would be safe
"from prosecution, and he was, moreover, very ill."
"He was so ill that very soon he died, without ever seeing again the girl"
he was so fond of; and when she heard of his death she was greatly
"distressed, so that the desire of life passed away from her. It so"
happened that at this very time she found herself enceinte with her
"first child, and not long before the due time came for the child to be"
born she had a dream.
"She dreamt that her soul left her body, and went out into space and met"
there the soul of her lover who had died. She was rejoiced to meet him
"again, full of delight, so that the return of her soul to her body, her"
"awakening to a world in which he was not, filled her with despair. So"
"she prayed her lover, if it was now time for him again to be incarnated,"
interest.
It is a matter of intense regret that so very few people have
sufficiently clear remembrance of their own childhood to help them to
understand the taste and point of view of the _normal_ child. There
is a passage in the “Brownies” (by Mrs. Ewing) which illustrates the
confusion created in the child mind by a facetious allusion in a
dramatic moment which needed a more direct treatment.
"When the nursery toys have all gone astray, one little child exclaims"
joyfully:
"“Why, the old Rocking-Horse's nose has turned up in the oven!”"
"“It couldn't” remarks a tiresome, facetious doctor, far more anxious"
to be funny than to sympathise with the joy of the child; “it was the
"purest Grecian, modelled from the Elgin marbles.”"
"Now, for grown-up people this is an excellent joke, but for a child"
"who has not yet become acquainted with these Grecian masterpieces, the"
whole remark is pointless and hampering.[20]
VI.--_Stories which appeal to fear or priggishness._ This is a class of
story to be avoided which scarcely counts to-day and against which the
teacher does not need a warning; but I wish to make a passing allusion
"to it, partly to round off my subject and partly to show that we have"
made some improvement in choice of subject.
When I study the evolution of the story from the crude recitals
"offered to our children within the last hundred years, I feel that,"
"though our progress in intelligent mental catering may be slow, it"
is real and sure. One has only to take some examples from the Chap
"formations classified as the Cretaceous system, and which occur"
neither above these formations nor below them. On the basis of
these few fossils we may be confident that the strata in which
they were found in the antarctic region were laid in the same
period of geologic time as were the Cretaceous rocks of the United
States and Canada.
THE RECORD AS A TIME SCALE. By means of the law of included
organisms and the law of superposition the formations of different
countries and continents are correlated and arranged in their
natural order. When the geological record is thus obtained it may
be used as a universal time scale for geological history.
Geological time is separated into divisions corresponding to the
times during which the successive formations were laid. The
"largest assemblages of formations are known as groups, while the"
corresponding divisions of time are known as eras. Groups are
"subdivided into systems, and systems into series. Series are"
"divided into stages and substages,--subdivisions which do not"
concern us in this brief treatise. The corresponding divisions of
time are given in the following table.
STRATA     TIME
Group      Era
System     Period
Series     Epoch
The geologist is now prepared to read the physical history--the
geographical development--of any country or of any continent by
"means of its formations, when he has given each formation its true"
place in the geological record as a time scale.
"The following chart exhibits the main divisions of the record, the"

better until they put a real computer on every ship and tell the

"""You're getting rotten computation, that's a sure thing, and I don't"

"hold them weightless for half an hour, waiting for those two moons to get"
"out of the way, and I know just what the manager will do if we check in"
"minus thirty-one minutes. Wow! He'll swell up and bust, sure. But don't"
"worry, Breck--if we don't check in all right, anybody can have my head"
"that wants it, and I'm taking full responsibility, you know."""
"""You're welcome to it."" Breckenridge shrugged and turned the"

"it's funny how many weight-fiends there are in the world, isn't"
it? You'd think the passengers would enjoy a little weightlessness

"rocks more than a mile in total thickness, which accumulated"
during the long ages of those periods in a gradually subsiding
trough between the Adirondacks and a pre-Cambrian range lying west
of the Connecticut River. But since their deposition these ancient
"sediments have been crumpled and crushed, broken with great"
"faults, and extensively metamorphosed. The limestones have"
"recrystallized into marbles, among them the famous marbles of"
"Vermont; the Cambrian sandstones have become quartzites, and the"
Hudson shale has been changed to a schist exposed on Manhattan
Island and northward.
"In part these changes occurred at the close of the Ordovician, for"
in several places beds of Silurian age rest unconformably on the
upturned Ordovician strata; but recent investigations have made it
"probable that the crustal movements recurred at later times, and"
it was perhaps in the Devonian and at the close of the
Carboniferous that the greater part of the deformation and
"metamorphism was accomplished. As a result of these movements,--"
"perhaps several times repeated,--a great mountain range was"
"upridged, which has been long since leveled by erosion, but whose"
roots are now visible in the Taconic Mountains of western New
England.
"THE CINCINNATI ANTICLINE. Over an oval area in Ohio, Indiana, and"
"Kentucky, whose longer axis extends from north to south through"
"Cincinnati, the Ordovician strata rise in a very low, broad swell,"
called the Cincinnati anticline. The Silurian and Devonian strata
thin out as they approach this area and seem never to have
"deposited upon it. We may regard it, therefore, as an island"
upwarped from the sea at the close of the Ordovician or shortly
after.

"Suppose any country wanted to subjugate Japan, and should want to send"
"an army to fight on the soil of Japan, what number of men do they think"
"would suffice? No general in the whole world would, I am sure, be bold"
enough to undertake the task with under one million men. I have reason
"to believe even that number would not suffice, but for a moment let it"
be that number. What country in the world can send that number over the
"broad ocean? Germany, France, England, or America? Russia seems to have"
"the greatest chance, being nearer to Japan. But her experience is"
already known.
"Suppose the idea of a land campaign be abandoned, and only a fleet be"
"sent to intimidate Japan by sea battles, or by harassing her commerce."
There would certainly be a better chance for any of the Occidental
"fleets than for the armies, in coping with the forces of Japan. Above"
"all, I frankly admit that England would be the most formidable foe in"
"that respect. But excepting England, is there any other country that can"
say with certainty that it can easily crush the Japanese navy? Is it
Germany? is it France? or is it--America?
"But supposing our navy were crushed; what next? It would, of course, be"
"a very ugly thing for us, but it would not mean the subjection of Japan."
"Our sea-coast towns may be bombarded, our commerce may be harassed, but"
"Japan will still subsist within her soil, for she can live without"
"depending on any other country for food. And, besides, disturbance of"
commerce would not be a loss only to her.
"Moreover, any country which should embark on such an enterprise would"
"have need to think it over twice (or, indeed, three or four times)"
"little relieved, but drowsiness came on again. I fought against it with"
"all my strength, but with an agony no words can describe I realized that"

"The theatre orderly burst into the waiting-room and shouted: ""Are you"
"all deaf? I've been yelling out 'Next man' the last five minutes, but"
you won't take no bloody notice. Send us two or three. The Colonel's in

"We were scared and sent three men across. When they had gone, we asked"

"""Well, I was absolutely desperate. I kept on looking at my watch, but"
"the minutes crawled along. I believe I must have started crying once,"
"but I don't know for certain, I was so sleepy that I don't remember half"
"of what I did and what I dreamt--I know I did dream, it's funny how you"
can start dreaming even when you're standing up or moving about. I
couldn't keep my eyes open and I kept on dropping off and pulling myself
"together. Suddenly, there was a terrific crash and a shell burst, it"
"must have been forty or fifty yards off. I thought, bitterly, that"
"there'd be no Blighty for me--no such luck. Then, high up in the air, I"
"saw a big shell-fragment sailing along in a wide curve, spinning and"
"turning. I looked at it--it was coming my way--Jesus Christ, perhaps I'd"
have some luck after all--and in any case a few more seconds would have
"passed by. It descended like a flash, I started back in spite of myself"
and held one hand out in front of my face. I felt a kind of numb pain in
"my right foot--nothing very bad. I looked down and, oh joy, I saw a big,"
"jagged bit of shell imbedded in my foot. I tried to move it, but the"
"pain was too great. Joy seemed to catch me by the throat, I began to"
"dance, but such a pang shot through my leg that I had to stop. I dropped"
"prince of cooks. Yet who, by the wildest stretch of fancy, could have"
contemplated tight places or dangers as the trim yacht rode peacefully
at anchor an eighth of a mile off our dock at smiling Miami? To every
man aboard such things as death and the shedding of blood had ceased
"with the armistice, and Gates would have taken his oath, were it asked"
"of him, that our course pointed only toward laughing waters, blue skies,"
and emerald shore-lines.
Early next morning we were under way when Tommy pounded on my stateroom
"door, challenging me to a dip overboard. There was a glorious joy in his"
"voice, as far reaching as reveille, that found response in the cockles"
"of my heart. Gates, never happier than when standing beneath stretched"
"canvas, hove-to as he saw us dash stark naked up the companionway stairs"
"and clear the rail head-first, but he laid by only while we had our"
splash and continued the course southward the moment our hands grasped
the gangway.
"""We're cruising, not swimming,"" he said bluntly, as we reached the deck."
"""But I'll say this,"" he called after us, ""you're both in about as fine"
"condition as men get to be. I'll give _that_ to the Army!"" Which was"
"true, except for the fact that I might have been pronounced overtrained."
"Tommy and I were as hard as nails, our skin glowed like satin--but,"
"better than this, his spirit was quick with the love of living, charged"
with a contagion that had already begun to touch my own.
Half an hour later he mumbled through a crumbling biscuit:
"""If Pete ever cooked better grub than this it was in a previous"
"incarnation!"""
"""Man achieves his greatest triumph but once in life,"" I admitted. ""It's"
"self-evident."""
You always have it your way.
Okay thank you.
I will send it in.
You still have time to see me?
I've been standing here for a while now.
I feel like I'm making life hard for you.
"Seriously, why are you here?"
"I'm trying very hard, doc."
This is trying?
Yes.
"It's spread to your ear now, you know that?"
Rash: 50 spots
"If on the outside it's like this, the inside is probably worse."
I understand doc but...
I've been dying to do this job.
And it finally arrived.
You want me to turn it down?
Opportunities like this come once in a life time.
"But you only have one life, right?"
That's right.
"We got one life, so we should do what we want to do."
And do the best we can.
You look like you aren't afraid of dying.
"You just said that we only have one life, right?"
"So we should find what makes us happy, right?"
And what I do makes me happy.
I don't feel tired doing it.
So I work hard and I'm wrong?
"And everyone has to die anyways, right?"
You're a doctor.
You should know that.
You obviously know little about dying.
"If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations."
I merely suggest that a regard for sentient life...
There's no time for that.
It's a matter of policy.
"Out here, we're the only policeman around, and a crime has been committed."
Do I make myself clear?
"- Very clear, captain."
"- I'm delighted, Mr. Spock."
"Report, Mr. Sulu."
"Alien ship maintaining interval, captain."
Now at warp 7.
Warp factor 8.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Captain to phaser banks.
All components at battle-ready.
All banks primed.
Aft phaser to bridge.
"Work status, all weapons at operational ready."
- Captain?
"- Yes, Mr. Sulu."
"Closing on target, sir."
Good.
Mr. DePaul?
"- Yes, sir?"
- Our position?
"Two-two-seven-nine PL, sir."
Uncharted solar system at 2466 PM.
This is on the alien's course?
"No, sir."
He's headed away from it.
"Captain, sensors report we're being scanned."
By the alien ship?
What have you done with Nicholas?
What have I done with Nicholas?
"He can't hear you now, pal."
"Oh, come on."
You know he's dead.
Yeah.
"You ought to do something with that faulty memory of yours, pal."
Might make your life a little bit easier.
"By the way, I just love them little notes you leave for yourself."
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.
"Where is your hospitality, partner?"
"If someone walks in, he might get the wrong idea."
Who are you?
"Well, looks like you got some explaining to do, partner."
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
"You going somewhere, Mr. Reznik?"
"Yeah, Mrs. shrike, I'm moving."
I didn't receive notice.
Your lease requires you to give 30 days notice in writing.
"It wasn't planned, something came up."
You can keep my security deposit.
I won't be needing it anyway.
"Really, Mr. Reznik?"
You used to be such a good tenant.
I just don't understand it.
"Oh, isn't that pretty?"
Would you care to sell it?
"No, it was my mother's."
I've made arrangements to donate all my things.
"I slept pretty well, just the same."
Me too.
I missed you too.
"No, I'd love to go to lunch."
I'll meet you there just before noon.
Don't worry.
I'm OK.
I love you too.
"Damn it, Richard."
Will you sit down?
If you think on your butt like ordinary folks...
"Otis, it just doesn't make any sense."
"I mean, why would a girl like that kill her own brother?"
"Well, you're a college boy."
You tell me.
Didn't they teach you any psychology up
In that fancy school?
Sure.
I'll tell you one thing.
"In my opinion, the driver's telling the truth."
Record's spotless.
Stopped right away and he called the ambulance.
"Well, I'll go along with that."
"But, uh, might be a little more to it."
"Well, how do you figure that?"
"Well, look."
The girl's got to feel a lot of guilt
"Over the death of her old lady, right?"
Sure.
"She probably suffered severe psychological stress,"
Which may or may not have anything to do with it.
OTIS:
Corbusier was mean.
"But Lou, now, there was a man."
"All my buildings don't add up to what his three or four buildings, because he, when he did get a client... however he ever got any clients is a mystery, because artists don't get jobs."
"Every time I've tried to do art,"
I've ended up with a...
I've made much less.
"Nothing to be ashamed of, naturally."
I do it the other way.
I do it by numbers and...
and public fame and all that.
But Lou did it by being an artist.
"He'd sit and work on art, see?"
And I always wished...
"I think he did too... wished he knew me better, and I always wished I knew him better."
- Why?
"- Well, you know, there's some things that don't go into words."
"It's animal attraction... his mind, really, because his person... to look at him wasn't much a pleasure."
- It wasn't?
- It couldn't be.
"See, he was so scarred."
"Funny, he never talked to me as directly as he should have."
- Who?
- Lou.
"He never came here, though."
- Didn't he ever come here?
- To the glass house?
"That's strange, 'cause I built it in '49."
Possible.
Possible.
Do you think Lou would have liked this house?
- No.
- Why?
"Well, he sounds like one."
He can spell haemoglobin.
He has a little trouble with words like dog and cat.
(Laughing)
"Where do you practise, doctor?"
"Indianapolis, Indiana."
Good Samaritan Hospital out there.
What brings you to Marrakech?
"We were attending a medical convention in Paris and I thought, inasmuch as we were in Europe, I'd come and see Morocco again."
Daddy liberated Africa.
I was stationed up in Casablanca at an army field hospital during the war.
"- Do you live in Morocco, Mr Bernard?"
- No.
I suppose you came directly from Paris.
"No, we looked in on Lisbon and Rome."
- (Hank) And Casablanca.
- And Casablanca.
I hope you will have time to truly enjoy Marrakech.
Let's see.
"We'll have, at the most, three days."
"You will, naturally, be stopping at the Hotel Mamounia or Le Menara?"
Why do you ask?
Because they are hotels for tourists of good taste.
0h.
"Do you live in France, Mr Bernard?"
- Sometimes.
- Do you eat snails?
(Laughing) When I'm lucky enough.
"If you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails."
Thank you for the invitation.
That's alright.
We tried everything to get rid of them.
- Doc.
- Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean,Lex Luthor.Case in point."
"Hey,psycho."
"Hey,psycho.What's up?"
BOMB SQUAD
You switch to decaf yet?
Not a chance.I got nine lives.Haven't burned through half of 'em yet.
"Oh,right.Well,uh..."
This is some ugly-looking shrapnel.
Ugly and old.
Like FDR old or bush 41 old?
I'm thinking somewhere in between.But this puppy's been modified.
- Who are you?
- Soto.Civilian authority.
Pulled that from a tree branch.
So he's putting something in them.
"Yeah,most of these whack jobs add ball bearings,nails,whatever's handy, put 'em in the mines to maximize carnage."
"This doesn't look like some random piece of metal.You mind if I,uh..."
- knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
You want one of me too?
Recording bombing victim number six.
severe lower body trauma.Powder burns extending to mid-torso.
- Becca.
- Hey.
"- Hey,how's it going?"
- l hear you went to the dark side.
Federal task force.Yeah.I'm working the pine street bombings.
"- l'm her partner,Dr.Diego Soto."
- Hey.
I am not a gutless coward.
"If I leave like this, I will be sinful for the rest of my life."
I won't live peacefully.
And I will be a criminal forever.
I won't leave.
I come to express my support.
You can't lose in this case.
Because your master's name is so important.
"But now, I know that, you are a real brave and quixotic hero."
I believe that you are innocent.
I'll wait for you.
Good speech!
Will you wait for me?
You'll be released at 5 pm tomorrow.
How about the final address?
They can do nothing to me.
"They can't imagine that, you studied law in UK too."
"Tomorrow, you'll take my place."
Hubby...
You'll handle Foon's life.
You sent me to study law in UK... isn't it because you felt boring?
Of course not!
The world is so big!
"I think, it's a good deed... to let you see the world, is that right?"
"Hubby, I didn't study law in UK."
They rejected me.
"So, what did you study in UK?"
Fashion design.
What did you say?
Time's up.
I studied fashion design.
Fashion design.
This is really weird for me.
"I'm used to having sex with whoever I want whenever I want, not settling down with one guy."
"But sometimes your instincts change, and you just have to go with it."
"Oh, my God."
Gabriel?
!
New York has a way of changing you...
Sometimes in ways you don't expect.
♪ Darken the city
♪ night is a wire
♪ steam in the subway
♪ earth is afire
"♪ do do do, do do do it's just a loan, you know?"
- I'll pay you back.
"- Sure, dad."
"♪ Woman, you want me"
♪ give me a sign
But it doesn't just harden you or bring out the animal in you.
It can also bring out the humanity.
"♪ Do do do do do do, do do do, do do do, do do ♪"
"Oh, Gabriel."
Wait here.
Let me get my wallet.
No.
That's okay.
Oh.
"And as our instincts change, so do our actions."
And sometimes the city simply brings out what's already inside of you...
"A killer instinct... which may be scary, or may just be about survival."
But sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
It's a bigger desk.
"No one's using it, and you would have your own computer."
His skin.
Was your hair always like this?
Do you know Gary Coleman?
But I found out they were just scared of me.
She didn't come out of that classroom for a whole week.
Can you tell me what's going on?
There's rumor about the fight.
"I had a fight with Caruso, the school bully."
"He beat me so bad,"
I had to take the Underground Railroad home.
Fight!
Fight!
But somehow that story turned into this story.
"Chris hit him in the jaw so hard, my tooth fell out."
"Chris knocked Caruso's eye out, put it back, and then knocked it out again."
Chris beat the snot out of him.
You can check his nose-- no snot!
"Chris chased him home, knocked out his family, then took their house."
"Now, when a rumor like this gets started, you never know where it's going to end up."
Are you sure about this?
"Yes, sir."
"After Chris kicked his teeth out, he said,"
"""And I better not see you trying to smile, cracker."""
Cracker...
"Yes, sir."
Cracker.
"Dr. Raymond was the school principal, and the last thing I needed was for him to think I was making trouble."
Thanks kid.
"That kid snitched so much, he made more money than the teachers."
Raise it up.
Higher.
Higher!
The keys!
"Beautiful evening, Constable."
Beautiful evening.
Mr X was then pushed into the pond.
"I don't know why you did it, but if that isn't worth double what I asked, I'm a Dutchman."
It was a dummy.
We...
I was working out a plot.
"Pinching a plot, don't you mean?"
What would your chum say?
Therefore I suggest a contract making over 50 per cent of all your future royalties forever.
- Impossible.
"- Then I'll send an anonymous letter, telling police to drag the pond and name you as the culprit."
- Mumsie!
Mumsie!
- Go away!
"But, Mumsie, the keys!"
You've got the keys!
In my raincoat pocket.
Hurry.
Don't say there's someone else for the high jump.
What about the money you mentioned?
I couldn't get it.
It may be a few days.
"Well, the new deal will be £5,000 down in advance of the 50 per cent."
When may I hope to see the cash and contract?
"Why, you...!"
My agent is away.
Come the day after tomorrow evening at nine o'clock.
"Well, don't let me down this time."
- No.
- Good.
- if you're desperate.
"- Someone needs your help, Michael."
Bottom line:
Until you figure out who burned you... you're not going anywhere.
"- What do you think of these shoes, Michael?"
Fantastic!
I have just the right dress.
- Are they real?
"- Well, they look real."
Isn't that what counts?
"You're getting a fake identity, Michael.I can't get fake shoes?"
Place is up here somewhere.
"You know, you go ahead."
I'm gonna-
"Oh, that's pretty."
A fake identity is known in the spy trade as a false flag.
Used to be you could make your own documents with a printer and a laminator.
"These days, though, I.D.'s have magnetic strips,holograms and infrared watermarks."
- Hey.
- You need a pro.
-Yes.
What can I do for you?
-I lost my passport and driver's license.
"I heard, uh, I could get some new ones here."
All you gotta do is report 'em stolen.
They'll send you replacements.
Right.
But the thing is...
"I'm going on a trip soon, and I heard you could do it here more quickly... and more quietly."
That might be possible- for a fee.
A fee is not an issue.
Come on back.
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.
I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow.
You are strapped to the table.
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.
Power has come into our hands which is centuries before its time.
We must use it wisely.
"Well, what can you have him do?"
Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle.
The possibilities are unlimited.
"Oh, come on."
"It's just some gimmick, that's all."
Tony...
"Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved, doesn't seem to believe in you."
"Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony."
"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.
Get back!
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"
I will demonstrate an industrial application.
"Come with me, Tony."
"Now, Tony, those wine casks... stack them... neatly."
"Two glasses of burgundy, please."
To molecular mobilization.
To molecular capitalization.
"Hey, got any more clues?"
No.
Nothing at all.
Wow!
"I couldn't help wondering why, with all the money that Ward Fowler makes, he could owe Claire Daley that much."
And then it hit me.
"What hit you, sir?"
Coffee?
Thank you.
Did you happen to see a show last August that had to do with a man who was being blackmailed by a woman?
"Oh, yes, sir, I did see that show."
Yes.
He shot her.
Exactly.
Why would Claire Daley blackmail Ward Fowler?
And then how?
"That's where I'm gonna need your help, Lieutenant."
"Have you, by any chance, checked with the Toronto police by now?"
"Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, I have."
I thought maybe you had.
And they told you...
They told me that Charles Kipling was an alias.
And that's when you decided to have
Ward Fowler's fingerprints checked with the FBI?
"That is absolutely right, sir."
You're amazing.
"Yes, it turns out that Ward Fowler's real name is not Charles Kipling."
It's John Snelling and you're a...
He's not a Canadian.
He's an American.
And he went to Canada after he deserted during the Korean War.
There you are.
There's your motive.
How would it look if America's favorite detective were known to be a Korean War deserter?
Or hadrt that occurred to you?
"- I'm going to get a farm, maybe something simple,"
"I'm going to start a practice, a fertility clinic"
"Dr. Conner, helping bring light into the world."
The only thing I need is Natasha.
Ah!
"I remember where it is, it's this way!"
Let's get a drink.
I'm so totally weirded out right now.
- It was so weird!
"- Oh, come on, it happens."
- Peter was defending him!
- Who?
- The jackass.
"- Oh, the jackass."
"He said it was an ""accident""."
"Well, that's a way of looking at it, or it's criminal negligence causing death."
Exactly.
Why didn't I say that?
"Well, my guess is that there's plenty of weirdness to come."
What?
You're moving to Dallas with a man you barely know.
"It's going to be a voyage of discovery, that's for sure."
I gotta get downstairs.
I'm going to try to get your brother's job back for him.
Anybody hear from him?
"Sandy hasn't heard from him, neither has Zoe."
"OK, it's just been a couple of days, give him some time to cool off,"
- then if I can just...
"- He's not cooling off, Dad."
He's in a crack den somewhere.
You don't know that.
None of us know that.
"All right, tie it off!"
Now look alive.
Mr. Petty...
You arrive to us with much fanfare.
I can assure you most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party.
"But then you are a special case, aren't you?"
A smile.
"On a child's face, it reminds us of all that's good and pure in this world."
"But on yours, it's all the company of Hades."
"If you've left any more of your mines on the mainland, son, it will be our singular aim to find out just where they are before anyone else is blown to kingdom come."
Take him.
Felicitations to the good men and women of the San Francisco police department.
Does the lady need a ride back to the mainland?
"No, the lady does not."
But nice thought.
Thank you.
Peppermint.
For your nausea.
Officer...
Hauser.
Emerson Hauser.
"She has good taste in music, Mr. Hauser."
Any improvement?
I'm sorry.
And if she stays here?
Did she ever talk to you about a DNR?
Are you saying she's dying?
"Guy, ready?"
"Oh, okay."
"Hey, buddy."
How you doing?
Where'd you come from?
And I believe I know what key you will sing in.
F-major...
You have no right to parade your ignorant assumptions...
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.
- Everyone else was.
"- Mrs. Jennings is not ""everyone""."
I like her.
She talks about things.
We never talk about things.
"If you can say nothing appropriate, limit your remarks to the weather."
Surely they have enough reeds for a Moses basket.
You know what they're saying?
"Word is, you've developed a taste for certain company."
And why not?
A man like you in his prime...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.
Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than of you.
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.
Besotted...
An excellent match.
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?
"As long as I've been here, and I came 15 years back."
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.
He loved a ward to the family.
"- Yeah, I am, too."
She was very pretty.
You were very pretty.
Remember that.
Thank you all very much for this warm welcome.
It's truly an honor for me to be here in your country.
"Hello, Rose, I would love to speak with you."
I never seem to catch you at home.
I really think we should diss...
"discuss this, Rose, and believe me,"
"I have no judgment over what happened, well, I just think we should talk."
I'm leaving for Venice tomorrow and I wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
"I do have a... a present for you, it's a... it's a week at a baseball camp."
Rose...
"Hello, Rose?"
"Rose, are you there?"
"- Henry, have you heard from her?"
- She apparently cancelled her summer classes.
How do you know that?
I called her mother.
She said Rose took a couple of months off.
"- Rose, here, try this one, it's a size eight."
"- Oh, I like the black one and I need a size six."
"Hello, Rose, it's very important, I have to say, I'm very surprised, I can't believe how childishly you're behaving, it's so unlike you."
- How did she finally persuade YOU to come?
- It's a long story.
"I'm changing my plans, I'm coming home right after London,"
I'm supposed to be in New York next Monday.
My number here is:
01-71-25773-55.
"All prime numbers, by the way."
Hello?
"It's, like, Ludlow and Stanton."
I didn't realize that my ass was gonna be...
"- Ari, your ass."
- There it is.
It's so beautiful.
"- Goddamn you, Kat."
"- Does she say, ""My ass is in the air?"""
I remember you saying that.
"You really, really look like you..."
- Jesus.
"- You guys, I'm fine."
"That was like a big stunt, right?"
The timing of that was tough.
"With them pulling the door, and didn't it..."
It was tough and Ari ate that door a couple of times.
Yeah.
You're dedicated to your art.
Was that a take where she actually hit her head?
- I don't think so.
- Looks pretty convincing.
I think it's just the sound effect that makes it so powerful.
"- There they are, off into the night."
- I'm actually driving.
"- Yeah, and..."
- It died a bunch of times.
"Do you have any assemblies of those takes in the blooper reel at all, Pete?"
- Of Mike stalling the Yugo?
- Yeah.
"- No, I don't have them."
- The Yugo just slowing to a stop.
- No.
"- Are you doing, like, a blooper reel?"
"I have no problem with that, Mr. President, as long as we realize we are working against a clock."
I want all departments present to work up an open versus covert containment strategy and report back to me in 30 minutes.
"In the meantime, I want Health Services to issue guidelines, but only to be distributed internally."
That is all.
I'll be in my office.
David.
"Give us a second, please, Aaron."
"Of course, sir."
Secret Service just received a phone call from the west Los Angeles police department.
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
He was found 15 minutes ago in his home.
All signs point to a heart attack.
It isn't possible.
"Well, apparently, it is."
You told me Sherry was on her way over there about an hour ago.
She changed her mind.
Made some phone calls from her car.
Came straight back here.
"David, is that what she told you?"
Yeah.
And where is she now?
Resting.
"Aaron, take me to Sherry."
"Yes, sir."
She's right this way.
Hasn't your shift ended?
I stayed on.
"I sense it's a difficult day, and I wanted to be here for you."
- I appreciate that.
"- Right in there, sir."
Sherry.
You are dead for all of us
You are dead!

His life is in danger.
You must save him.
It's my destiny to stoop so low
And pardon in front of a goon.
I'll tell you one thing.
"Whatever he did, you sure ain't copping to it."
Would you?
"Never trust a con, cowboy!"
They ain't get through life being honest.
Where they hiding you these days?
Around.
"Hey, you wanna see something?"
Look at that.
Lost them on a lady.
"Yeah, they took the big toe from the left foot and a pinky from my right."
That is why I walk with a gimp.
"Yeah, I can't shuffle cards like I used to but the ladies sure like it."
"Oh, no."
You look like you have seen a ghost.
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.
- That is why I can't get a raise.
"- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll."
You believe that?
- Why would they lie?
- They're just having a little bit of fun with you.
I'm not laughing.
"Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm."
He could have died.
That ain't my problem.
"You caused the accident, not me."
Where're you going?
"Take a leak, you wanna watch?"
"I'll be right back, don't just bail me now."
Son of a bitch.
- Hello?
My bread!
My bread!
How was it?
"They just think about eating, and don't even see a car coming."
How do parents teach them?
"The reason I asked to see you is that, next month there will be personnel changes."
Were you aware?
Please help me.
I believe you are the only member that can help me.
Am I?
"I thought you had backups, aside from me, since you have control over the 3 billion Won welfare assets."
You seem different.
It's... a little difficult.
"Since civilians are complaining that the children are starving, we'll just have to work harder."
There must be a way.
"Just a bunch of numbers, nothing difficult."
Not like it's never been done before right?
I'll just believe you.
Go on.
"Thank you, Yun Seong."
"Oh, is your injury hurting?"
Wh-what are you doing?
"Really, I'm fine."
Put me down.
"Really, there's nothing wrong."
Put me down.
You can put me down now.
How come it's so high?
"What is this, graffiti?"
My height measurements.
"From when I moved here at 7 years old, until I was 17."
My father measured my height there.
-You could have it.
-You took it first.
Excuse me.
"There are two copies, you both could have the same."
The bill counter is at the left corner.
You could pay the bill there
Your's sir.
- Thank you.
- Yours madam.
Do they assume to be Vijay and Shalini?
I am Haridas.
The best house broker in South India.
Please contact me to buy and sell house and house plots.
If you want Idli with Chutney approach me.
"You can't even spell fast-food, and you claim to be an owner."
You dare to advertise your Idli and chutney.
Better run away...
-What a stink!
-I didn't do anything
He has opened the idli cooker
I will become a spirit if I consume this vapour
-Why isn't the Poori fresh?
-How many day would it stay fresh?
-Not made today?
Nothing is made today Didn't you see the board outside?
PAST food.
- Give me pongal?
- What you guys want for pongal?
"For pongal give us trousers and shirt, some pocket money."
I asked what you need as side dish?
As if you have eight-variety dishes?
Give me that same damn chutney.
- Sookie and Jackson?
- That would be fun.
- And Grandma and Grandpa?
"- Oh, no."
Come on.
It's your graduation.
They should be there.
- Forget it.
They won't want to be there.
- Of course they will.
"Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school, go to Vassar... marry a Yale man, get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny."
"Instead, I got pregnant."
I didn't finish high school...
"I didn't marry your father, and I ended up in a career... that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her."
I humiliated them.
"The two proudest people in the world, and I humiliated them."
I spoiled their plans.
"I took their fine upbringing... in a world of comfort and opportunity, and I threw it in their faces."
"I broke their hearts, and they'll never forgive me."
I guess I can't expect them to.
Maybe you're wrong about how they feel.
It was a long time ago.
"Rory, I don't want them to go."
"It'll just hurt them, and me."
- Okay?
- Okay.
- You should get back to your studying.
- Fine.
- Great.
- What?
I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.
"- No, you haven't."
- Istanbul wasn't that long ago.
"You like rooftops overwindows... you like angles with the target on your right-hand side, 'causeyou're left-handed."
That's right.
I knew I liked you.
Put it on.
"[ Scoffs ] Michael... is this whatyou reallywant, huh?"
Helping out civilians with their little problems... trying to get your governmentjob back?
It's pathetic.
- You're better than that.
- [ Clicks ]
Let's go.
We have a big day ahead of us.
I gotta turn you in.
There'll be questions.
It'll be past lunch before we're done.
[ Chuckles ] Turn me in?
"A lot of secrets, a lot of enemies."
"Think it'd be a short stay, don'tyou?"
"Now, don'tyou think we could come to some arrangement?"
- I don't think so.
- Now be honest with me.
If circumstances were different... do you think that we could--
Not in this lifetime.
Perhaps the next one.
- [ Crash ] - [ Woman Screams ]
[ People Screaming]
- Indictments came down yesterday.
- That was quick.
They found the leak in the U.S. Attorney's office... and Evelyn-- wow.
They're gonna be workin' up her file foryears.
"She was a very, very bad girl."
I managed to keep you out of it so far.
Murder victim.
His unknown killer is still at large.
Witnesses saw stein enter the hotel
"With a very young, very attractive woman."
"The l.A.P.D. Is now looking for this woman,"
The woman witnesses saw with stein
Just before he was murdered.
Police are asking if you have any information
"About her or her whereabouts,"
Please contact l.A.P.D. Immediately.
"Oh,my god."
I killed him.
I can't believe it.
I killed him.
"Ann,listen to me."
Listen to me.
You did the right thing by talking to a lawyer.
"Now from what you're saying,"
It sounds like you have a good case for self-Defense.
"If he was attacking you,the law says you can protect yourself."
"But in order for me to help you,"
"I need to understand exactly what happened,okay?"
"So one more time, but slower."
Lenny invited me to his hotel room.
We're friends.
And i don't know if it was his temper
"Or his drinking or what,"
"But he got mad, and he hit me,"
And he wouldn't let me leave.
He... tried to kill me.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
"No, get out."
Kuzou.
Why the hell am I being followed?
Why are you having me followed?
"I understand your anger, but while mr."
Tendo visiting we cannot take any chances.
"Hey look, you hired me."
If you don't trust me cut me lose.
I don't need some freak with a sword following me every time I take a shit.
Are you always this crude?
Only when I'm pissed off.
Only when I'm pissed off.
Then I'm sorry I pissed you off.
Oh yeah.
I think that's yours.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Christ.
Campanela's?
The yakuza's don't mess around.
How did you get these?
They sent them to you?
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
Mafia is warning us about yakuza's?
That's rich.
Maybe you're right.
I just hope our guys can bust them before they start an all out war.
"Right, what amazes me is how he got so deep, so fast."
How good is his cover story?
Convict died in solitary so we gave brand his identity.
There is no way for yakuza to found out otherwise.
Hello again.
"Hamit Milonkovic, you are charged with deprivation of his daughter."
Shit genuine.
Why are you locked?
Now you're crazy.
I have not seen Zana since she disappeared.
You said nothing about it to have arrived.
It was because he wanted her to die there?
That's why you cut the fire rope?
'You had the courage to blow up the bomb?
-No Hear what I said?
Shit genuine !
-You Have evidence for this?
"Zana has been there many times, willingly, but for a long time."
The girl's apartment was treated for minor cuts before disappearing.
The blood test confirms that it is Zana.
Do not answer.
I want to talk to my client.
Okay.
She arrived a few days ago.
Something happened to her.
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
"I would give a time to talk again, but failed."
Zana disappeared and I snapped.
Then you cut the fire rope to protect her?
Do you understand me?
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
She was not afraid of anything.
She could get hurt.
Where were you from 9 at 9:30 am when the bomb went off?
-With Him.
-Discutíamos The visitation agreement.
I think they should reduce the working hours.
"Eight hours a day, instead of the current ten."
They only pay us 7000 FM a month.
"The people that work eight hours a day are paid better... than us, that's the real problem."
So what do you want us to do?
I think people are spoiled here.
Did you hear?
"After the first month, everyone's in debt."
You have to claim your rights.
"Besides, there's tattletales among us."
"They keep quiet now, and talk later."
"Instead of insulting each other, let's reach an agreement."
"In any case, we need to earn more."
- Speak up!
"- Traoré, a call for you."
- I'm at a meeting.
- It's very urgent.
- What do you want?
- It's not my problem.
"Instead of talking, let's act."
How?
- Let's go and see the boss!
- We've already seen him.
Let's go once more.
"And if he doesn't see us, we stop working."
"Traoré, the boss is calling."
"Doumbia, carry on with the meeting, I'll be right back."
You know what we have to do.
Traoré will be back.
Wait for him.
Let me go!
Where were you when my fur order arrived?
"""...that killed the rat."""
And then I have to go all the way to Denmark to shake somebody's hand.
He'll take a photo of me and show all his rich friends he's done good.
This is not up for discussion.
- I have to think about it.
"- No, you won't think about it."
"You will go, wear a suit, get a haircut, behave nice and smile."
"Please, Jacob."
You know as well as I do that this is our last chance.
Otherwise we'll have to close down.
Then these children will have nowhere to go.
They'll be on the streets.
Please.
You owe the children that much.
This is our last chance.
Are there only rich people where you are going?
- Yes.
- No one is poor?
- No.
Some have more than others.
"- If I was rich, I'd be happy."
"- I know, but people there are idiots."
"- You hate all the rich, Mr. Jacob."
Is it because the houses are far apart that people are far apart?
"I'll tell you all about it when I get back, right?"
What's wrong?
Pramod?
You're not coming back.
I know it.
I promise that I'll be back for your birthday.
I told you so.
"Pramod, come on."
I feel so glamorous.
Damn it.
Jill's already with the Earl.
"Look at her over there, shamelessly flirting with him."
Maybe I should just go home.
"No, you can't."
That's quitter talk.
"If you don't go down fighting, what does that do for us?"
Who look up to you.
What's the use?
"Look, he's already interested in..."
Hello.
"You move like an angel, as if you were floating across the room."
"Thank you for remarking on my grace, your grace."
Ah.
"Beluga, my favorite."
- I simply adore beluga.
- I adore it more.
Mm-hmm.
Delicious.
"Poor child, have you never had caviar?"
You must be so sheltered and naive.
"Well, I'm certainly not as worldly and experienced as some."
Perhaps the Earl would like to hear a story of a woman who's been ridden by more men than the London underground.
Or perhaps the Earl would like to see a recent photo of a woman with a mustache.
"I'm not sure that I would, actually."
"Who do you want the Earl to end up with,"
Joy mouse or Jill mouse?
Of course I'm rooting for Joy.
"Well, obviously I'm rooting for Joy too."
- But it's gonna be Jill.
- Totally.
- Trouble?
- You don't have to worry.
I'm actually just a normal person.
"I work hard, I take showers, I turn the radio down after 10:00."
I won't tell jokes to the neighbors.
The building is equipped for change.
"For instance, if you're in a westerly room and you're exposed to the setting sun, our computers increase the flow of air-conditioned air."
So your temperature is always perfect.
There's no comparable building anywhere.
How about that one?
"Oh, you know, that building doesn't look as tall."
Probably doesn't even have one computer.
"Honestly, I love it."
It'll be like living in the top drawer of a glass box.
I'll take it.
"Hello, little Cyclops."
Welcome to your new home.
"Don't forget, you're supposed to take the curse off the lonely nights."
Lonely nights and lonely days coming your way.
"Cut it out, Michaels."
"Hello, L.A."
This could be the start of a meaningful relationship.
Mr. Frimkin?
"Hello, I'm Leigh Michaels."
"Fine, thank you."
And you?
Yes.
"I worked at WXN, New York, for five years."
Uh-huh.
"I was born in Carthage, New York."
I'm 29 and I'm single.
"I hope that's not going to be a problem, Mr. Frimkin."
Great.
But what I'm getting at is what were the autopsy results?
Why do you people keep making me relive this nightmare?
Because you're the coroner!
Good point.
What was the cause of death?
Cause?
"Well, um..."
"Sir, there are so many causes of death nowadays."
"Um, murder, disease, loneliness - that's the real killer."
That's what finally got the roadrunner.
"Your honour, the witness is really pissing me off!"
"Mr. Diamond, answer the question."
"Well, I would if he would stop misleading me."
Come on!
What was the cause of death?
What?
What got him?
What?
"Come on, what was the cause of death?"
What was the cause of death?
"Well, I don't know the cause of death."
Because I never finished the autopsy.
There!
Satisfied?
"Fine, we'll just have to do it again."
This is good.
I'm ordering that the body of Mayor Bowman be exhumed first thing in the morning.
Very good.
"Oh, it's gonna be gross."
It's gonna be disgusting.
Is that the ring for the tipster hotline or the suicide hotline?
"- I need more to work with, much more."
- There is no more.
Lucas was drunk and brutal.
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in self-defense is understandable.
"But you hid the body, like a criminal."
- I know.
- She was fighting for her life.
The state is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
He's thoroughly competent and relentless as law itself.
Tell her to come in.
There must be something you haven't told me.
"- He tried to kill me, I killed him first."
- But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison.
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"- Hi, Ted."
"- Hi, Allison."
I can testify about Lucas.
I saw him beat her.
"It'll help, believe me."
- We appreciate you coming back.
"- You'll get her off, won't you?"
We're gonna do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing: evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
"We have a murder, and a defense that's too simple to be good."
It's open to attack from many sides.
Yeah.
Two this morning.
I swear those things show up every time the oil business goes bad.

- They gonna bring the kids in?

Don't these families have enough to worry about?
Hmm.

"Don't report that, Esther."
I never do.
"""Sum"" means that we're adding."
We have at least two items.
"Don't make this hard, but what are we adding here -- protons and..."
Neutrons?
Neutrons.
Neutrons.
"So, David..."
"These protons and these neutrons, they're inside of...what?"
The nucleus?
"Well, don't say it like a question, son."
"If you think you know it, just say it like you know it."
The nucleus.
That's right -- the nucleus.
"So, congratulations."
Go home tonight and tell your parents that you figured out the mass number of an atom.

-Yes.

It doesn't play.
It's only hissing.
Of course it doesn't play.
There aren't any parts there.
"And now we welcome in the studio professor Janatka, to introduce the popular series ""Mystical outer space""."
"Dear audience, recently there have been many groundless reports about the existence of extra-terrestrial civilizations on our planet."

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"-That was a great explosion, Doctor."
-You gave us a real treat.

"In our movies, the shooting schedule, it means very little,"
Because things happen.
"Shit happens, you know."

"Hopefully, things will be better as we go on with this thing."
"But there are gonna be unexpected things, and--"

Because otherwise it looked like-- people
Was saying it's Tromaville.
But now I don't know where he is.
We're late again.
"Every day, it's late."
"It's fucking-- we're shooting exteriors, right?"
-Quit!
Well?
want to indicate you to me where is the vesicle?
Ah... here.
"Either, or."
What cuts you would do?
From here up to here.
Thus?
And how I am going to be able to rummage about with the hand?
"What happens, idiot?"
You have something to say?
Want to operate you?
"No, no, Professor, was enjoying... with its words."
It is not hour to enjoy.
You do sexual activity that I want to begin to operate.
"Hurry up, to put to sleep"
If they do not extinguish the light there is no form to sleep to me.
It pardons?
Dr. Ciotti are you?
-Why?
It is not evident?
"-Yes, it is, only that I am afraid that I have been mistaken of operating room."
What means?
"In fact, I have come by the hemorroides."
Hemorroides?
Hemorroides.
"Cicchirini, between the vesicle and the hemorroides, there is much route."
We suspend during half an hour.
"Prepare, therefore I will do a new back tuna to him."
A tuna new ass?
"Why, the old man is broken?"
"They are misfortunes that happen, why to your sister."
There's a toilet.
The pillow actually looks pretty comfortable.
OK.
"You don't speak to me, ever."
- Ever.
- OK.
- No!
Shut up!
- OK.
So what are you guys in here for?
For giving the United States a taste of their own medicine.
- You guys are real terrorists?
- Some call us terrorists.
Others call us heroes.
Screw that.
You think you guys are heroes for killing innocent people?
It's 'cause of assholes like you that we're even in this fucking place... you fucking cowards!
"Well, maybe if the people in your country stopped eating donuts... and started realizing what your government is doing to the world... assholes like us wouldn't exist."
- Fuck you!
Donuts are awesome!
- They're delicious.
You like donuts?
"Well, wait till you see what they make you eat in here."
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?
l--
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?
What's a cockmeat sandwich?
You're about to find out.
Right about now.
Suckers.
"All right, cockmeat sandwich time."
So you're saying that you can't tell the difference between the highlight reel...
I can tell the difference.
"...and physically, really cheating on somebody?"
Don't say it to me like I can't tell the difference.
"Well, that's what you're saying!"
"You're saying that they,re related, then they're somehow in the same family."
"No, no."
"I'm saying you own a Jack Russell, I own a Bull Terrier."
They're both dogs.
They're both terriers.
Mine's just a little more aggressive than yours.
"I own a zebra, you own a goat."
What the hell's that have to do with cheating on your wife?
"Right, they're both animals."
Are you out of your mind?
How would you feel if your wife cheated?
Guys?
Listen to me.
Trudy's gone.
What?
What do you mean?
What?
I went to the room and all her stuff was gone.
Where do...
Where do you think she went?
Like she...
I don't know.
We had a argument at therapy.
She said she was sick of my senior citizen bullshit.
"I've been trying to keep up with her, but I'm a old ass!"
"Shane, honey, it's not your fault."
"No, it's bullshit."
"I mean, why do you think--"
Why do I think he had a heart attack at 40?
"Sweetie, I don't know."
But he does work too hard.
"Actually, his new boss is always telling him, go easier on yourself."
The lumber business is very unpredictable.
I kept telling him he should take some time off.
But do you know the truth of it is?
He loves it.
He loves his work.
- lt's his life.
- lt must be great to feel that way.
M rs.
Cherski.
Good news.
The angioplasty was a complete success.
"Oh, God."
There was a small blockage that we were able to clear.
That's what caused the arrhythmia.
"I've prescribed a few medications... he'll need to take, but he's going to be just fine."
I think it finally hit me.
Thank you.
- Andy is going to be okay.
- Thank God.
I landed the account.
I don't understand.
"When they told me, I don't know, it was like a... this moment because I had to admit that I didn't want to land it."
Because landing it means that I'm really doing this.
"This is my job, this is my life, this is it!"
This is what I really...
"But, look I'm sorry that I couldn't..."
"- you know, handle it or whatever."
- Yes we can.
She declared war on gossip girl.You brought this on us.
"That's,that's not fair."
Serena was just trying to help everybody.
What do you know about anything
Besides your label was the only one that was true.
"You mean what she said about the ""insider""?"
Are you crazy?
You're friend with Nate Archibald
You played on the soccer team.You got into Yale
You got the lead role in the school play
"You got published in ""the New Yorker """
You had sex with a teacher.
Plus you dated the most popular girl in school
And ignored the rest of us.
No.
I meant them.
You pretend not to be like us but you are... to the bone.
And you should have known better.
Thank you.
Kudos S. Way to go out with a bang.
Now what did you want to tell me before?
Oh.
It doesn't matter now.
- It just happened.
- Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do--finding excuses.
Well...
I won't do it anymore.
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety of the passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died of a heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
Continuing with the treatment would be meaningless.
"Moreover, your current medical fees are costly enough."
I will definitely come up with the money in one month.
"Therefore... please, you must definitely save him."
I absolutely can't let go of my dad like this.
He has been in a coma for 10 years.
Maybe it's time to give up.
"Because of me, my dad is like that."
"I can't give up, I can't."
Doctor!
Please save him.
I'm begging you!
Please save him.
Please save my father.
Please save him.
"Hello everybody, I'm from life beverage company."
I sell hangover drinks.
We are currently having a free trial for our product.
"To participate, you just need to go to our website."
"These don't really work, right?"
"It's a lie, right?"
There's no such thing.
People who have tried this drink say that their stomachs feel a lot better the very next day.
"No, thanks."
We don't need it.
Don't be like this.
Sounds good.
Let's give it a try.
Thank you.
"One bottle, two bottles."
"Hello, It's Kim Na Na."
Right now?
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
He's the only one I can leave my my bankruptcy to.
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."
We cannot afford to lose him.
I am the only one we cannot afford to lose.
Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind?
"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
What... what's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to... empty."
Empty?
It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.
"Boy, oh, boy."
You guys are costing me a lot of dough.
I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.
"No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver."
I'll go.
I think it came from back that way.
Be careful.
And remember what Uncle Bene said.
That is enough.
Bring him down!
"Sickle, turn to your right."
Balance yourself and walk along the ledge.
"- All right, listen up."
- [chuckles]
"I've decided to make some positive life changes, and I am giving up drugs, selling and using."
Fucking have at it.
- [Ron] Holy shit!
"- [Cassie] Oh, my God."
"- Oh, my God, Edgar."
- Take whatever you want.
"Edgar, there are children here."
What do you have in a nice house hallucinogen?
"I'm glad you asked--I have some acid, mescaline, and oh, my favorite organic hallucinogen of choice, mushrooms."
"Oh, hell yes."
- See you later.
- Yup.
[sighs] [knocks]
Yeah?
"Hey, uh, I need to know something."
What--what is your plan for me here?
We're working the plan.
"You're in the Cellar, honing your craft."
"No, my craft's already honed."
I'm killing it every night in the Cellar.
All right?
I need the Main Stage.
Jesus.
You kids and the Main Stage are like lemmings heading off a cliff.
"Well, how about a straight answer?"
"No chickens, no lemmings, no no struggle, just a straight fucking answer."
You hear Barton coming out of your mouth?
"You think 'cause some guy offers you the moon and the stars, he can actually deliver?"
Barton's offering cash...
- [scoffs] - ...and stage time
"There's bigger things happening in the world... than your stupid actor clients, and the Nielsen ratings on the TV."
You're now officially embarrassing everybody here.
Ok?
"Don't you... dare ""F""ing tell me that I'm embarrassing you, ok?"
Because...
my friends think you're a douchebag.
A... nasty ass... sleazebag agent.
"Drew, we don't think you're a douchebag."
"Jill, come on."
That's ok.
Thanks.
"Oh, where you gonna go?"
Are you gonna go home and masturbate?
To one of your anime porns?
Cartoons.
He made me watch animated porn.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go home and masturbate!
Disgusting.
Because it's better than anything you're giving me at home.
"No, 'cause you love to masturbate."
"'Cause for you, it's like having sex with something that you love!"
Yourself!
Did she just make that up?
Annie Hall. '77.
I'm going home!
Are you gonna go screw one of your actresses?
"One of your stupid, slutty..."
sleep your way to the top actresses.
I think I need to go to the bathroom.
Somebody can take her home.
'Cause now she's drunk and you're pissed off.
"Yes, I did say it."
And what will you do if I stop protecting you?
"You won't go to the refugee aid, and quite rightly so.."
In the camp they're very selective... they only let the politically persecuted through.
"Maybe you are a political, Pauline?"
"Could you give me some money, if I leave my child with you?"
What?
Then I could go to the West...
"You see, Pauline, you really are reasonable!"
Pay attention..
"I've saved up some money, a couple of hundred Mark... for the birth..."
I'll give it to you.
"Well, and you'll also need identification papers."
I'll get them for you!
"As for an ID card and such, Bruno will take care of it."
Then you can go to your fiancée in the West.
"Well, what is it, Pauline?"
Haven't I offered you enough?
500 Mark!
"I'd like to think it over, Mrs John."
"Well, yes..."
I only meant it well..
Just wanted to help you.
You sleep on it...
"That's all of it, Mr Hassenreuter!"
"Yes, my child."
That's all I have left after 20 years of cultural work.
"""The rest is silence..."""
Hamlet!
"Yes, my child, you should have seen me as Hamlet... people still talk about it."
"I'd have loved to, Mr Hassenreuter."
"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark."
"That is true, Victor."
He has acrophobia Among other things.
Find a different test for him.
Acrophobia is not a problem with my device.
Start climbing.
"I will do anything else you say,"
"But I am not going up that building, understand?"
- I...
- Sickle I command you to climb up that fire escape.
"You will go to the very top,"
"You will turn around, and you will look down."
And you will not be frightened of heights.
Off you go.
It's working.
It's working!
It seems to be.
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
"He's the only one I can leave my Uh, my bankruptcy to."
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.
I am the only one we cannot afford to lose.
Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind?
"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
- [car rattling] - what...
What's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to..."
- Do they make pink slate?
- That's enough.
"If it doesn't match your pants, I don't want it."
Slate is a word that falls apart if you say it more than three times.
"So 21 ,000 tons of slate by June."
"- Slate, slate, slate."
- Slate is a stone around my neck.
- Because you took it for granite.
- Right.
Cut it out.
We're slated to install these interiors... I'm going to do the rest of this job by myself.
- Yeah?
Rick.
- Huh?
It's for you.
Yeah.
Uh...
Now?
Okay.
Miles is here.
- l thought I smelled sulfur.
- You... shut up.
"Sammler and associates, I greet you."
"Sorry for the intrusion, but I needed a word with you, Rick, sooner rather than later."
"Well, sure, Miles."
"How was your vacation, by the way?"
Vacations can only be judged by the degree of discomfiture upon one's return.
"In this case, the vacation was a grand success."
"Do you believe in portents, Rick?"
What do you mean?
- How's your filing system here?
- Excuse me?
Is that all right?
"Ok, good bye."
- Is the Director in?
- Go see his secretary.
Take this to the boss's car.
Is the director in?
Don't you know how to say hello?
"Yes, sorry."
Is he in?
- He's not seeing anyone right now.
- He called me.
- Who are you?
"- Balla Traoré, from the factory."
"Right, Balla from the factory, he's expecting you."
It's the office on the right.
"You're late, I was leaving..."
Have a seat.
- Any news?
- Everything's all right.
I got the quarterly report.
"Truth is, this factory is going from bad to worse in red ink, according to a report made before you arrived."
"But right now, we need to keep up appearances at all costs."
"A rich man nowadays, is like the crap that... bees feed on."
"They get pleasure, but at the same time it makes them cry."
"200 workers will be laid off, among this mass of lazy bums."
"200, that's too many!"
"The factory will produce, I'll take care of it."
You have my trust.
- Here's the sack.
- Leave it there.
That's everything.
You owe me 215 FM.
The general's funeral.
Right after the D.O.D. closed up shop and sent us home with a $600 check and our dicks in our hands.
You've come a long way.
- Ah.
- [chuckles]
You remember the last thing you told me?
When my uncle said he'd hook us up?
That I was done hurting people.
And you wanted a cozy corporate job.
How's that working out for you?
I'm not here to reminisce.
"Then why are you here, exactly?"
I need some information about a hit on a suit.
A hit?
Outside the wall.
The man from Spiga's here to see me about a murder.
I'm here to see if you'll help out a fellow soldier.
"Well, now you're just trying to take advantage of my soft heart."
You really want my help?
Then take my offer.
It's still on the table.
I'm happy with my job.
I fund a clinic.
I'm a man of the people.
What do you do after you punch in?
"Brother, I just need information."
"Of course, Cap."
I'll ask around.
If I hear anything you'll know.
Was that so hard?
"Now, why don't you tell me why you're really here."

"Stenz worked for the CIA, right?"
Right.
If we can track the way that Walker contacted..
"these guys, we can figure out how to stop them."
How do you propose we do that?
Keep an eye on Caulfield.
"Wait, what?"
Hi.
I'm Carol.
I'm not supposed to talk to you right now.
Run a database search on the guys in that building.
"CIA, NSA, everything you've got."
"Okay, listen, Walker's not doing this for the money, trust me."
There is something else going on.
"I can't do that, ma'am."
On the worst day that our country has ever had..
you could be the key to figuring all of this out.
Couldotherwisenotaccomplishthat  is take back the White House.
I'm gonna have to get that out.
When did you become a doctor all of a sudden?
"Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it."
Talk to me about your daughter.
Emily?
She's completely in love with you.
She even tried to get me to vote for you.
You didn't vote for me?
Your daughter's smart.
You should listen to her.
She was like 3 when I enlisted.
And to be honest with you..
I was probably just running from my marriage.
"Right after I deployed, Emily was watching TV.."
He's still sleeping.
What?
He's still here?
"All right,look,I did something really stupid."
"If you did something bad to Augie,don't tell me."
"I love you,but he's been my best friend for 15 years."
"No,it's not that, but thank you,by the way."
There's a hierarchy.
I'm sorry.
"Alright,look,this is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life."
Really?
'Cause...
Oh!
What is that?
"Bella,I swear to God,if you laugh..."
"Ser... seriously,what the hell is that?"
- It's a merkin.
- Is it alive?
How do you not know what a merkin is?
It's like a toupee for down there.
How would I know that?
"Is it the next link in the chain of crazy, wax-it-all-off-and-stick- something-else on?"
"It's from,like,a zillion years ago when prostitutes would have to shave everything off so they wouldn't get lice."
"That one's a reproduction,right?"
Are you gonna help me or not?
"What do you want me to do,braid it?"
I can't get it off.
"Oh,sweetie..."
"I accidentally put it on sideways, and,and now I can't get it off, and I have a Ted Koppel."
"Oh,sweetie,come here."
Don't worry.
We'll take care of you.
"Trap Door, have you got any milk in there?"
Thank you.
- Perhaps you'd like to mix your own.
-Thank you.
Delicious milk.
"Well, now, my dear, this may come as a surprise to you but I have a little problem."
"You, Black Widow?"
I thought business was good.
Business is boring.
I've completely run out of banks to rob.
I've run through them all.
"Now, that's where you may come in handy."
Me?
How?
"Well, everyone's heard about your Batcave and everyone's heard about your Batcomputer in your Batcave."
Oh.
You want me to get the Batcomputer to give you a bank to rob.
Precisely.
Do you think that you could send for it?
We don't have to send for it.
I have right here in my Utility Belt a remote control Batcomputer oscillator.
"Oh, heh."
- How convenient.
How does it work?
-Simple.
I just press this button and it activates the radio frequency Bat-generator.
- And I just talk to it?
"-No, I talk into it."
It wouldn't recognize your voice.
"Now, question:"
ls there any bank in Gotham City which Black Widow has not robbed?
"My word, wherever he is Batman must be operating his remote control Batcomputer oscillator."
- Do not think of it.
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.
I'll show you out.
"Margaret, get the gentleman's hat."
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?
John Willoughby of Allenham at your service.
John Willoughby of Allenham...
What an impressive gentleman!
He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf.
- Tell me if I hurt you.
"- She feels no pain, Mamma."
"Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress."
Please don't say anything important.
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy.
Ten words at most.
"- Change, or you'll catch a cold."
- What care I for colds?
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right.
Help me.
He's worth catching.
Marianne must not have all the men to herself.
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.
But what are his tastes.
I'll gladly confess to the fact that I'm an addict.
"I'm on Valium, LSD, coke, heroin, methadone, opium, Rohypnol   crystal meth, morphine, mescaline, amphetamine, vitamin C and D   hashish, pot, hash-oil, skunk."
I'm a word addict.
"Psychology, the Bible, Shakespeare   the Qoran, Donald Duck, Hemingway, Céline, micro-biology -"

"- Niels Bohr, Einstein, Camus, Crime and Punishment..."
"If you could shoot up books, I'd do that!"
And music...
"I just got tired, I think."
You know?
Tired of this.
And this.
And this.
And this.
I didn't get tired of Tilde.
"I love Tilde, and she loves me."
It's always been like that.
"Sometimes it's too much for Tilde, and she's admitted to the nut house."
"She only wears yellow, which should promote a successful reincarnation."
"Hi, Thomas."
We became sweethearts when we were 11.
"I showed her mine, and she showed me hers, and that's how it started."
- Good to see you.
How are you?
"- Okay, and how are you?"
Okay.
So everything is okay.
"That's the ritual, Tilde."
Are you okay?
- I feel much better.
- Give us a kiss then.
Tilde and me are having cake.
Can I take a message?
Oh...
OK.
Bye.
Some foreign bloke says he makes tasty crackling and you shouldn't be afraid.
- What's that all about?
- It's... just... a mate.
He's a chef.
Wants me to try a new recipe.
See?
I don't know any fancy foreign chefs.
Don't tell me it's not exciting living in London.
It's not exciting living in London.
"- Oh, come on."
It must be.
- It's not.
It's like some huge ant hill where nothing works properly.
Millions of people just getting in each other's way.
"No space, no air."
"So, why don't you leave?"
"I'm trying, but it's hard."
"With money it's bearable, but if you're skint, you're trapped."
Try living here.
"Everybody knows you, knows everything about you."
"Nothing changes, nothing ever happens."
"Their idea of a good time is getting shit-faced as quickly as possible and then shag anyone who'll let them, and then do it all again tomorrow."
"Now, that's being trapped."
To escaping.
To escaping.
"And a big, fat win on the lottery."
- What?
- I was just thinking about Wicklow.
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us, and I knew even then that you were different."
Your father has raised you well.
He has taught you right from wrong.
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
I don't like what he shows me.
"I know, but you have to try."
"Now, we need to find him."
You don't understand.
"I have tried myself, but I can get nothing."
Please.
All right.
Good.
"Now, concentrate."
Try again.
I saw a river.
Zaddik?
Is there a river nearby?
"Yes, just to the east."
"All right, let's go."
"McKay, stay here and help Beckett."
"Uh, medical research is not really my thing."
And hunting wraith?
"But, I mean, I can stay..."
and help Beckett.
Never could get into biology.
There's just too much information about the human body.
"One time, I took it as an undergrad,"
I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions before I had to drop the class.

Quit this pen-pushing job and get back to work with self-respecting range-bred fellas ought to be doing.
"[Jim] What've you been up to, Taterbug?"
[Taterbug] Seen in the Abilene Cattleman's Journal calling for cow hands over in the Dusty Bend country.

"That Stoneset Trail Company is no place for a kid to get his schooling', is it?"
"Besides, I'm tickled to death right where I am."
"[Taterbug] Yes, you are."

"Eventually no, but in the beginning I loved him."
- Until you didn't.
"- Until I didn't because he was weak, because he drank, because he never really stood for anything."
That's what you do.
"People fall, and you just let them keep falling."
"Oh, come on."
Are you going to help Lucy?
I know that you care about her.
She just might be the one thing to make you happy.
She made me happy.
But she was weak.
Ahem.
Lawyers are reminded-- opening statements are not arguments.
They're road maps to let the juries know what evidence they can expect to hear.

Cool.

"From the time he comes down there until he leaves, you will not have a financial need."
"Now, when you make this decision... you got to live and die with it."
'Cause it's your decision to make.
"Now, I'm here to support you if you - if you done searched this whole thing."
And it's what you really want.
"Not,you know, 'cause Mama said this or your dad-"
"Or because you're saving Mama money, because if we have to... we will still pay- if you have to try to pay- if we can put some- I'm just sayin;"
You
- Understand what you're saying.
"You want to save somebody money, but still -"
But you have to still do what is best from here.
"But still we want the best for you - even if you have to - or we have to go in the hole, you know."
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm just saying.
"But still, the decision is up to you."
"So, what do you think?"
Ah.

"When I was 23, how old was he?"
And I whupped him then.
Aw!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain.!
- You want to see it rain?
It isn't loaded.
- What?
- I took the precaution of removing the pellets.
Which I thought was clever.
I'm more than a little offended...

- You fool!
"I say, handle her with care."
She's most precious.
"- Sit down, Wooster."
- Thank you.
I am dripping with fatigue.
- Won't you sit down?
"- You may as well, Miss Lowman."
You may be here for quite a while yet.
You park on the plush and I'll come and look after you.
- There you are.
- Idiot!
Don't say things like that.
I only did what I did for your own good.
"- If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Miss Lowman."
- Not at all.
Lovers quarrel.
"- Keep quiet, Wooster, and sit down!"
"- Oh, thank you very much."
"Get me a chair, will you?"
I'll get one myself.
Mustn't strain the arm of the law.
"Now, Miss Lowman, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble... if you'll hand over the other half of those plans."
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know that isn't true.
Why don't you give him whatever he wants for my sake?

"The bad news is, there's only one trainer position available."
How do you feel about working in another department?
Huh?
Nice shorts.
Nice hairnet.

Since when have you ever complained about being around food?
"Okay, this is not food."

He shut me down.
Boom!
Gone.
See ya.
It was cold.
Yet you found it hot.
"No,I mean,he was hot while he happened to be shutting me down, but it's not like the shutting down itself was hot."
I really think he's changed.
"Yeah,he's changed into a guy that doesn't like you anymore."
And it happened the same exact time he became more appealing.
Weird.
"Dude,he totally still likes me."
I don't know what you're getting so indignant about.
You won't even kiss me when I get my sideburns trimmed like a quarter of an inch too short.
"When they're too short,your chin looks huge."
I warn you about that before every haircut.

Whatever.
That's ridiculous.

I'm supposed to just roll with that?
"Like normal things,Augie."
"Like,what if I suddenly grew a disgusting mole out of my back,like Bella."
Ew.
You grew something.

I've heard of Spring-Heeled jack.
Victorian bogeyman.

Are you cribbing your ideas from penny-dreadfuls?
"They called him the Terror of London, and do you know what made him terrifying?"
"He could do whatever he liked to whomever he chose, wherever he chose, whenever he chose, and he was never caught."
"He just disappeared, passed into folklore."
"Oh, yeah?"
"- Is that what you want to do, eh?"
- I've already done it.
You just don't know it yet.
Are you sure about that?
Because the last time we spoke you were pretty scared that I was gonna ruin it.
"- Nice one, mate."
"- Yeah, I was, but not any more."
Why should I be scared?
I can take anyone I choose.
You can watch.

"Watch what, Cameron?"
"Hey, Cameron, what do you mean?"

Hi.
Too late for chow?
"What's the matter, boys?"
My slip showing?
I'll say it is.
You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht?

-Oh.
Somebody was peeking.
"Yeah, had a dreamy time."
"Those dames, they really know how to throw a party."
"I've known some women in my time, but between you and me there's nothing like the hot breath of the Cossacks."
There are a couple of blond snipers over there.
Real man-killers.
They--
What's this?
"What happened, Cookie?"
Do they go out frequently?
Juan says he wants to live with Clara.
She's crazy.
He also says you're still in love with mom.
And that you'll always be.
I don't understand why all men are after her.
It was always like that.
Are you in love with mom?
Me?
No.
Love vanishes.
And it never comes back.
"When we decided to split up, my wife assumed that I was leaving and she was keeping the house."
That's what happens usually.
I think it's not fair.
But surprisingly I accepted that as something natural.
Someone had to leave.
"We could've flipped a coin, for example."
And where did you go?
To a hotel.
Even now I still ask myself what I was doing in that room all alone..
Awake and looking at the ceiling.
But wasn't there another woman?
"-Yes, Rosa."
It took some days until I told her I've left Clara.
Why?
I don't know why I didn't go to my parents house in the very beginning either.
And you had a woman..
And a house waiting for you?
And you went to a hotel?
I was there for a few days without unpacking the bags.
Then I reacted and I called Jacoba to tell her I was coming over.
I took my petition to Cowell and you know what he did?
"He didn't listen, because he don't care about people, he don't care about the town."

This looks fucking weird!
"Save it for the county jail, sister."

"Wheel me out of here, Dermot."
"Get out of here, come on!"

This is Jessie J's place.
Wow!
"Yeah, she was my sensei growing up, she taught me everything I know."
Back in the day?
"Way back in the day, O'Leary."
You must remember one thing...
Mm-hmm?
"A relationship with a sensei is based on truth, honour and power."
I need to see you perform a power stance.
"- I'm going to stand up for our rights, at least, in the matter of the fence."
Wouldn't it be easier just to mend it?
"I mean-- no, I'm making a stand on principle, James."
"You will back me up, won't you?"
- Leave me out of it.
"For one thing, I'm not up to it."
For another-- all right.
Be like that.
Wallow in defeatism.
What is that disgusting smell?
Helen swears it's a sovereign remedy for flu.
It smells like old socks.
"- Don't insult old socks, this stuff's in a class of its own."
"- What is, darling?"
I was just praising the remarkable qualities of your flu remedy.
"Oh, were you?"
"Come along, drink it up while it's hot."
Got to get you fit again.
"'Night, tris."
"Next, please!"
"Come on, digger."
"- Andrew, come on in."
"James, you don't sound too good."
"No, I'm fine."
"Spot of flu, but Helen's specific knocked it on the head."
"Let's have a look at him, shall we?"
Come on.
"Come, digger."
Mr. herriot just wants to look.

"All the department heads signed off on it, except Psych-- crazy bastards."
Blaire Collins has been here forever.
I called the nursing home twice.
They were supposed to be sending a ride for her.
"Well, if they're not here in ten, I'm putting her in a cab."
- She's comatose.
"- I was kidding, Dr. Kovac."
Frank ?
Call Blaire Collins' nursing home again and tell those idiots she's been ready to go home for the last four hours.
Tell them yourself.
I'm busy.
Dr. Kovac?
I think I'm one of those idiots.
I feel like I ruined everything.
You didn't ruin anything.
Not a damn thing.
I want you to be happy.
"You didn'tsee it, did you?"
Yes.
Yeah?
She knew.
What?
She was drawing angels.
Two years later.
It was the meanness of the campaigns... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty... that turned the voters off..
I think that these parties are demonizing each other.
They're projecting our own personal fears and anxieties... onto the national stage.
People don't like it.
"People are very, very unsatisfied at the moment."
It makes them complacent because they don't see any possibility of change.
2004...
Is there a dark horse candidate out there for the Democrats?
"Well, I'm hearing a lot about Russ McCallum."
- Governor of Virginia.
"- Yeah, he might do what Carter..."
"Hey, I told her to watch."
Who?
Peter's friend Gwen.
She'll be there tonight.
"Oh, God."
"Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make that one tonight."
"Come on, you can't keep blowing this thing off."
I'm not.
I've got an interview with the governor.
I gotta be in Richmond at 8:00 in the morning.
Then you calmed down.
You're stubborn!
Why are you telling me these Jewish fairytales?
I can be stubborn too.
You shouldn't have brought that snake here.
"Bonbons, he brings me."
"He was my friend, he should've been on my side."
Maybe he's trying to fix something.
"I did things that were wrong, Goni."
I know that.
"I wanted to get what was coming to me, no matter how."
But what I did is disproportional to the punishment and to your suffering.
All of ours.
All of our little family.
I carry it with me all the time.
"You know, a few days ago I bumped into someone I knew in 2nd grade."
She used to say I was from a family of thieves.
And that you stole our fridge from the theater.
She can drop dead.
"She can drop dead, I don't care about her."
And I don't care what people said or what happened.
"Your mother and I always thought that you, little one, deserved a better life."
You didn't deserve all this.
I miss Mommy so much.
Mommy is dead.
You're here and I'm here.
Then they started fighting over it.
And?
Then they pulled it from each other and it tore.
And?
Then I told them to stop.
So you became a judge?
Idiot!
"Hey Halwa, what are you still doing here?"
You are no ordinary man.
You made that lunatic a doctor.
How long is your game?
I can't with stand it.
This is nothing.
This is just an interval.
Climax is still pending.
Shall I tell you something shocking?
What?
I'm the thief whom your brother-in-law is looking for.
Why did he come to Malaysia?
He used to rob regularly in India.
Why is he quiet now?
Has he quit robbing?
What does December 16 mean?
There is lot of time left for that day.
"If he had quit robbing, why would he fix the target?"
Why is he robbing?
Who will he rob in Malaysia?
He must either rob the nrls.
Or rob those who have link with India.
Where could he be?
"If he had called from this phone booth, he must be living in these surroundings."
But where?
What do you think of yourself?
Is duty everything for you?
"Even after coming to Malaysia, you are still thinking about that thief."
Why did we come here?
For your engagement or to catch that thief?
What if something happens to you?
Jesus Christ!
- Why didn't you guys answer the phone?
- I was online.
"Well, no more Internet when I'm not here."
I have to be able to call you.
Maybe you should buy us cell phones.
No.
Just stay off the fucking computer when I'm not here!
You can't make us stay off the computer if you're not here.
- You won't be here to keep us off it!
- It's for safety!
- How did you get home?
- I walked.
What is your dad watching?
It looks like Nickelodeon.
- Don't look at my dad.
- Sorry.
"Ifhe puts up another sign, I think we should go up there."
"I mean, what else can happen?"
Just more signs?
Signs forever?
I always thought I'd lose it with someone who was my boyfriend or something.
But this is better... 'cause it won't matter if we mess up.
And we'll be together.
But I'm trying to change!
All right.

Alicia's periods stopped two months ago.
"At first, I thought it was only one month but I was mistaken."
That isn't mentioned in last month's report.
"In fact, it says you put the towel on her as always."
That week I was off again with the flu.
"You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno?"
It's your writing.
"Yes, it was me."
Why did you falsify the notes?
I didn't want to cause any alarm.
It isn't the first time a patient's periods have stopped.
That's true.
Why did no one notice?
Where's the nurse who did nights?
Matilde?
"She called, she can't come in today."
Didn't she notice anything odd?
Matilds having family problems.
Many nights she can't come in.
And who stands in for her?
Benigno.
Am Ito tell her father his daughter is in this retard's hands day and night?
Please!
Let's calm down here.
I don't know if you realize you are the main suspect.
Why did you hide her first missed period?
I'm sure you've got an explanation.
You're incapable of harming Alicia.
You can be sure of that.
Then...
"Last night, I was in the parking lot and heard a conversation between Benigno and Marco."
Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia.
That's what I keep telling myself.
Of course I'd do it again if I had to.
"I mean, it's my job."
- Hold that thought.
I gotta change tapes.
"- This is great stuff, guys."
"I mean, really, really, really good stuff."

Thanks a lot.

"And of all things, some Ping-Pong balls."
There must have been a slip-up someplace because suddenly we wound up with 2000 Ping-Pong balls.

"Oh, mother, did they come in handy!"
"Hey, Schulz."

Don`t move
Don`t trust him !
"He wanted to screw me so he brushed his wife off, and he even beated his wife up in front of me"
"He isn`t a man at all ln order to trap you , my family performed a show in front of you"
Dear audience
The best actress
"In this play, she acted ..."
"... verywellthat, no matter..."
Help!
Fredo!
"-I can't control her, Mikey."
"-You're my brother, don't apologize."
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers three territories after he died.
You took over and didn't give it to them.
I welched.
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.
-He hated them more than I do.
"-Frankie, they feel cheated."
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains and you're drinking...
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.
"Champagne cocktails, and passing judgment on how I run my family."
Your family's still called Corleone.
And you'll run it like a Corleone.
"My family doesn't eat here, doesn't eat in Las Vegas and doesn't eat in Miami with Hyman Roth!"
You're a good old man and I like you.
You were loyal to my father for years.
The Rosato brothers are taking hostages.
"They spit right in my face, all because they're backed up by that Jew in Miami."
I know.
That's why I don't want them touched.
-Not touched?
"-No, I want you to be fair with them."
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?
"Tom, listen."
"They recruit spics, they recruit niggers."
They do violence in their grandmothers' neighborhoods!
And everything with them is whores!
"- Come on, man!"
Let's go!
"Jack.Jack. Okay, the night porter didn't clean the grill, the big blender's broken... and someone crammed my locker full of Spanish pornography again."
- I'll look into it.
- Thank you.
"-Jack,Jack,Jack!"
- Yeah.
"Jack, three waiters called in sick."
Some kind of explosive intestinal-
They think I don't know Shakira's in town?
Tell 'em I want 'em here yesterday.
Major crisis.
See Page Six.
"""Bourdain Snubs Stunning Starlet."" Translate that for me."
The fabulous Lindsay Lohan was here last night... and you refused to leave the kitchen to say hello.
"Or so says the Post, which I trust implicitly."
I can't be everywhere at once.
I didn't even know she was here last night.
- Lindsay Lohan wants to say-
"- If it's not about the food, get out!"
- [ Screams ]
- I was cooking for 1 80 people.
I can't be everywhere at once.
"I'm not the master of time, space and dimension."
"If I may, your fans are your power base."
- You have to stroke your base.
- I'm not gonna embrace that metaphor.
You will get a second chance to kiss Miss Lohan's ass... when she returns...
for her dog.
- [ Barking ]
"- I'm here to cook, not kiss ass."
"Jack, Pino's on line one."
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
"Now, turn off the lights and go."
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
Guys?
"Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be!
"Okay, what is going on with you guys?"
It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction and a beat-up van
I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
"Whoa, what-what happened to your wrist?"
Oh.
It's an allergic reaction.
So take it off.
"Robin, once you have a child, anything that gets you even remotely close to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters."
Better the sores weep than I.
"Hey, hold on."
That slut just got here.
How'd she get beer already?
Do you see a ring on that finger?
Whoa.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
And his address just came up.
Big Bad lives at 5923 Mills.
Clear here.
Clear.
Like a cave.
This guy hides out all year long.
"Well, with burns like that, he's probably sensitive to light."
And his own skin.
"I mean, look around."
There's not a mirror in sight.
This guy doesn't want any reminder of what he looks like.
There is nothing personal in here.
"Well, we said he didn't have nothing to live for."
"For a planner like Kaman, tonight's abduction was irrational."
He went on private property and took Chris Edwards with a witness present.
"Maybe he's finally starting to feel the pressure, and he's reactive."
"More than that, he's meticulous."
He'd have a plan if he got cornered.
He'd have an endgame.
"Well, he already killed the man he blames for his accident."
The other victims were slights compared to that.
And now he needs to hurt the person that hurt him the most.
The one who drives all of this.
The one who broke his heart.
"Yeah, but who the hell is that?"
I swear I won't tell anybody about this.
"Oh, God!"
Son of a bitch!
"Oh, God!"
[Sobbing]
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm so sorry.
"They're not sympathetic, they're not press-Friendly,"
And they're not helping her.
Your mother's been crying ever since she got the call.
"I warned you about comin' out here,"
And now look what you've done!
"This isn't about you,dad!"
You've humiliated yourself and your whole family.
It is about us!
"I am the one who's in trouble here,okay?"
Not you!
Everything's not about you!
What you do reflects on us.
"Gosh,would you just shut up and just let me talk!"
?
Don't hit her.
Don't tell me how to treat my daughter.
She's not your daughter.
"She is our client,"
"And nobody touches our client,ever."
Tom.
Tom.
Tom!
Ron used some of the money
He's collected for your defense fund
"To post your bail, and he sent your parents home."
We both think it will be better for you and the trial.
You okay with that?
"Listen,i'm sorry about getting into it with your dad."
I'm sure he means well.
"No,he doesn't."
"Whatever my brothers did was fine,you know?"
"But he never trusted me, ever."
What if the next missile that he launches is aimed at Chicago or New York?
We're talking about millions of lives.
Your first act as president..
is going to be bombing the White House?
"Believe me, I know, I know."
But our country is stronger than one house.
This is Mission Control.
"Raptor Alpha 1, clear to initiate Operation Free Castle."
"Copy that, Raptor Alpha 1 beginning approach."
We've lost two commanders in chief in one day.
"Look, Mark, if I'm a foreign head of state, and the United States of America.."
has become a rogue nuclear power..
at what point do I take action and step in..
perhaps even with a preemptive nuclear strike?
Brought you a present.
It's the tourist's daughter.
"Well, hello, hello."
"Good morning, Mr. Cale."
I'm sitting here with someone who would like to say hello to you.
"Say hello, sweetie."
"Say hello, sweetie."
"All right, then, would you like to tell your father.."
what Mr. Stenz here is holding in his hand?
Agun.
"Now, Mr. Cale.."
I'm gonna start counting here..
and if you don't give the president to my men by the time I've reached three..
Mr. Stenz here is gonna shoot your little girl in the stomach.

"SO, SAM, YOUR MOTHER --"
"UM, YOU'VE CITED HER AS BEING A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION --"

IN PROTESTS DURING THE '70s.

We are going home.

The slaves ?
What are they to our happiness ?
"Everything, Arkon."

Balls.
"Hashtag, balls."
"Hashtag, balls."
"I don't know if it's time for self promotion, but, uh... the EP is out right now on SoundCloud, did you--"
"That's why, look, I like lyricists."
"That's why, in my spare time, I watch battle rap."
"-Good evening, Mrs. Bourne."
"Horace, you're looking very handsome tonight."
And so are you.
"-My, that's a beautiful gown."
-Brandon chose it.
"They're always much gayer when Brandon chooses them, Jessie."
"Nora Kernan, Horace and I don't come here every Thursday night just to talk women talk."
Suppose we discuss dinner for awhile?
"Oh, Brandon, before I forget, Frank Belney called a few minutes ago."
He wants you to meet him at your club at 10:00.
"-Oh, no."
"-I'm sorry, Jess."
Frank's meeting his stockholders tomorrow.
He must be getting nervous.
Could you answer one simple question just to cheer me up?
Yes.
We are having corned beef and cabbage.
-Dinner is served.
-On the dot.
Check.
"Dear, I don't know if it's possible, but I feel that you're cheating."
"When you can prove it, I'll be glad to discuss it with you."
Jessie looks wonderful tonight.
"She has you to thank for her looks, darling."
And you.
"When a woman gets more beautiful after she's married, it means her man is either making her very happy, or very unhappy."
-Oscar Wilde?
"-No, Belasco."
"Horace, you're really very good with that one step of yours."
You do so much with it.
"Well, I've been polishing it for 40 years."
"Nora, remember when you taught me to dance, backstage at the New Amsterdam?"
"That interests me, he's my son."
Please come in!
"This is the gate, you know."
"If I made an ordinary gate, everyone could get in."
But here the gate is at the back.
"Please, you can get in this way."
Through here?
"If it was an ordinary gate, anyone could open it."
I'm Marcel's father.
We are the Hladkys.
If it is inconvenient... I'm the mother.
The name reminds me of someone.
He was my supervisor.
From Bratislava.
"Ladies and gentlemen, dear students!"
"We are meeting for the last time, in order to say goodbye to you."
On behalf of the school I wish to thank you for your hard work your teacher and Pioneer leader for everything they have done.
This moment is not suitable for long speeches...
Quite so.
And you don't need them.
So I wish you a pleasant party and much success in the future.
"- Katka, aren't you dancing?"
- l don't know anyone here.
Didn't you dance at your party either?
"I did, I know the people there."
Come and dance at least with me.
"- Marcel, dance!"
- l don't know how to.
Then I'm going to dance.
Why don't you dance?
"I would, if I knew how to."
You must know something.
"Yes, this afternoon there was a documentary on TV about it."
Really?
Good afternoon.
Isn't he creepy?
What does he get up to?
"Whatever he gets up to, it can't be anything good."
He's always hanging around here at this time of the day.
Do you think he's the one who steals the underwear?
It's very possible.
Look at his face.
He looks very dubious.
- Can you keep an eye on him?
- OK.
I'm close by at the moment.
A driving license?
I don't have one.
I understand.
A man nods busily and wipes off his sweat.
When he first came here.
He'd never worked before and still had a smile just like a shining apple.
He no longer has that smile and he's worn out because he can't sleep.
"By the end of this month, from the time he came here."
An ear of rice could have grown to his chest.
Above the top button of his shirt...
Aren't you the model in this magazine?
Please sign your autograph.
"Ah, I can't."
Excuse me.
Please excuse us.
RED PORNO
Are you really sure about it?
Don't you know you could make one or two million yen easily with this job.
"Let's go, Marshall.!"
Let's go.!
Marshall showed us last night they have the ability to come back.
Let's see what they can do here.
This is Nathan.
Nice pass.
Knock it down.
"Biggest lead of the game now, and the Rams fans can smell it."
Been a great run for Luther Bedford's team.
The string of upsets stops here.
- And a foul on Agee.
- he fouls out.
But hejust never quit.
hejust kept going for the basketball.
I wouldn't be surprised ifhe made the all-tournament team tonight.
- Number one!
- We're number one.!
We're still number one.
All right.
All right.
"Though they lose to Peoria Manual... they finish third in the state, the highest a Marshall team has finished since 1960."
This was a great season you had.
There is nothing sweeter than going downstate as a young person.
"I mean, the record's gonna stay there, you know."
"1991, there was a team from Marshall played."
"- You know, and you're part of that."
- Yeah.
- That's part of history.
- Ah!
"But for you seniors,you know-"
"Best wishes to all you seniors, and whatever you try to do, uh..."
"Mr. Williams and I will be around school... as we always are - to help you if you want to be helped, okay?"
Step by step.
There's still lots of work.
I don't understand why our artistic director is walking like a peacock after everything they wrote in the paper.
What did they write?
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
She can stand in for me anytime.
What article?
It's been a month since I read the paper.
3 pages in in the newspaper about our nice little theater.
What did it say?
They're doing an investigative report about financial irregularities.
We have to get rid of our artistic director.
It's not that simple.
"Submit your candidacy, they'll back you."
You submit your candidacy.
"Do me a favor, get serious."
"- Do me a favor, let me direct."
I don't need that.
"The more the merrier, my friend, it's quite elementary"
Sergio Leone died yesterday.
Is that so?
What a shame.
He was young.
"Who is it, Liyova?"
A friend of yours?
"No, Mama, he's a great director."
"An incredible director, eh, Yitzhak?"
A Fistful of Rings.
- A Fistful of Dollars.
"Dollars, yes."
1966.
"Well done, Papa."
"This is just like ""hairspray""!"
"Then the cops showed up, and it turned into a riot."
Whoa!
A riot?
Yeah.
Sweet!
Did anyone use nunchakus?
"You know, I don't think so,"
"But that riot was something else, and it reminded me..."
"So aunt Edie told them all about the riot,"
"The moon landing, and the time she saw elvis"
"Buying double ""a"" batteries at Wheeler's market."
Maybe Axl and Sue didn't find
"The time capsule they were looking for,"
But they ended up finding a better one.
"And it turns out,"
I had a little time capsule of my own.
"A file, mike?"
Someone seriously has a file on me?
How do I go from being a person teachers always loved
To a person with a file?
"Well, you know, maybe they didn't love you"
As much as you thought they did.
So what are we gonna do about this crossing guard thing?
"I take tuesdays, you take thursdays,"
And then we switch off?
"What do you mean ""we""?"
Hey.
I'm telling.
"'course you are, 'cause you're a narc."
"(This film is based on the true event of ""Wushe Incident"")"
"Let's use the word ""alleged."""
They got photos!
They got witnesses!
"They got the ""alleged"" slut..."
Hey!
Let me tell you something.
I'm her husband first.
I don't tolerate talk like that.
"- Will, calm down."
"- You better get used to it, Will."
Especially when not even your wife will defend herself.
"Give me something, Laine."
Anything.
"Hell, just deny it."
Why don't you just deny it?
It is simply beneath my dignity.
Dignity!
Right.
We'll just have to make this all not worthwhile for Mr. Runyon.
What have you got on the distinguished gentleman from Illinois?
Some pretty good stuff.
"- S.E.C. Investigation, 1985."
- You got stocks?
I want something embarrassing!
Something sexual!
"Little boys, midgets, that sort of thing."
- Cows!
I don't give a goddamn!
"- Come on, Kermit."
"If we do that, we're no better than he is."
We are no better than he is.
There's nothing there.
I told you Schnickelfritz.
You made me bet on Equipoise.
I clocked him this morning.
He was running like a doll.
You clocked him!
Why don't I clock you?
Another one of his enterprises was the distillery.
He ran a bar right in our barracks selling schnapps at two cigarettes a shot.
The boys called it the ﬂamethrower but it wasn't really that bad.
"We brewed the stuff out of old potato peels and once in a while, a couple of strings off the red cross parcels just to give it a little ﬂavor."
"It ain't fair, Harry."
"I'm telling you, it ain't fair."
My Betty.
Ain't she beautiful?
She married an orchestra leader.
So what?
There's other women.
Not for me.
Betty.
- Betty.
"-Forget Betty, Animal."
I'll get you a date with some of those Russian women.
You'll get me a date?
Sure.
I'll get you into the Russian compound.
How?
Pinky Miller from Barracks 8 tried getting over there and they shot him in the leg.
"It takes a gimmick, Animal."
I figured us a little gimmick.
- You did?
-Sharp.
Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
I ran away from home to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.
I thought you looked familiar.
Got plans for mother's day?
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.
It's supposed to be my day and he gets all the fun.
"That's okay, when he's older,"
I'll let him make it up to me.
A little guilt goes a long way.
How about you?
Cemetery.
"- Oh, I'm sorry."
- Thanks.
I lost mine too.
Still hurts.
I am not so good at losing family.
Who is?
What's weird is that it didn't hit until I picked out her burial dress.
I pictured her while buying it...
Not knowing it would...
"You know, be the one."
"Seems unfair, doesn't it?"
Not knowing things like that.
"Hey, how about spending the day with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?"
Sounds dreamy.
"Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?"
Armed robbery.
"Oh yeah, that's right, because me and Jackson had you pegged as a paedophile."
"Ain't that right, Jackson?"
"Shit, probably guilty of that too."
"Hey, I don't see what's so fucking funny."
Y'all clowning this motherfucker like it's some big joke.
Well it ain't!
No!
- I Arthur?
"- Evil Clone, we do not touch the ""Don't"" button."
That would send Uncle Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
And let me say that hike back is no picnic.
I'd rather be strained through a chain-link fence.
[Shudders]
"Clone, go next door and fetch me a tissue sample from the Tick."
Got it?
A tissue sample.
I Arthur.
"You'll never get away with this, you over-confident blob."
The Tick will be on to that flimsy fabrication in a second.
He hasn't got a chance against the always-wary eye of the ever-alert Tick.
[Snores]
[Door opens]
[Snores]
"[Tick mutters] Oh, hello..."
"[Tick] Oh, no..."
[Tick jabbers]
"Arthur, I just had the strangest dream."
"I was taking some math test I hadn't studied for, and then you tried to saw off my head."
"Weird, huh?"
I Arthur.
[Chuckles] Of course you are.
And I Tick.
[Chuckles]
"Whoa, oh... [crashing]"
"Oh, sorry, Arthur."
"Blast this uncommon cold, anyway."
"Well, only one thing to do now."
Wear this supercold down with many hours of daytime television.
He's also a man and that...
... eventhoughI'mnot married to your mom...
... Istillenjoythe companyofwomen ...
... whichmeansthatIwill  occasionally go out with one.
But the important thing for you to understand...
... isthatIamnottryingto replace your mother.
"In fact, no one can replace your mother."
I bet you could kill a guy with a piece of bacon.
"All right, then."
I'm glad we had this talk.
I'm gonna go post my plan on the Internet.
"You know, there's moments around here..."
... thatmakeme wish I had a son of my own.
That wasn't one of them.
"Yeah, well."
"Anyway, I really appreciate you watching him tonight."
No problem.
-How you getting to the restaurant?
-Sherri's picking me up.
-Very convenient.
-Why?
Because she's been here before?
Been here with you?
Because you've had sex with her in every room in the house?
"No, because you can't drive."
But it's interesting to see how your mind works.
"Alan, let me give you some advice."
Alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions.
We don't want you to lose that ability.
We want her to.
Of course.
Very good.
Sister Marie.
Please show this young lady out.
You're sure about this?
We've got a U-boat Commander at Bowmanville.
"Now, any intel Klaus can get from him"
- will help with the big Push.
- Eyes and ears inside.
You think he'll turn just because your family took a holiday years ago?
"Well, I'm counting on your legendary powers of persuasion, Tom."
Does he even remember you?
He was a kid.
"If anything, he'll remember my boys."
What else can you tell me?
He's a good soldier.
He's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder due to the fact that his father's got him some privileges.
So he's got integrity?
"Well, that doesn't help us."
He's a pilot.
That could help.
Guys who work alone are more likely to turn.
Start there while you're still on my payroll.
You heard.
The Yanks had to go through me.
I said it was your call.
Good luck with Klaus.
Why are you following me?
"Open your mouth,"
- or I'll open it for you.
- I don't speak unless I need to.
Why are you following me?
I wanted to make sure you are who you say you are.
I can help your men.
- What happened?
"- Optical divagation, I think."
- What?
Kind of like a retinal flare after a photo flash.
"My best guess is the blast from the disco ball, kind of frizzed this mirror's primary reflective capacity and then it probably clipped part of Myka's psyche and fused it in there."
I don't...
"You know, it's kind of like shadows on a wall after Hiroshima."
- It's a pretty lively shadow.
"- Yes, but is it?"
- Is it what?
- Alive.
Help me!
- You wanna?
- Sure.
What's that about?
I'm gonna pull her back if she falls in.
"- Oh, hell."
- Get your mind out of the...
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- So?
- Nothing.
- So what is it?
Just a shadow play?
"- Well, the glass is like a barrier."
"If that's alive, I can't tell."
- Let's just ask her.
"- ""It."""
"""It"" might have something to tell us."
"I mean, why can't we just talk to her?"
"Because we do not converse with reflective entities, okay?"
- Because?
Yes.
My name is Laine Hanson.
My address is...
"Youcanjustdothat , pull phone records?"
Iwork for a pretty powerful guy.
"Yeah,we'reclose, we were close for a while."
"That's till recently, of course."
Our career paths sort of went in different directions.
At least you have your life.
There's nothing sinister going on here.
"At this point, we just need... to look at every aspect of her life and find everyone that knew her."
You never know what you're gonna find.
- Did you find anything?
"- No, no, not really."
Not really?
You mean...
"A little bit, actually."
"I did speak to other classmates, and they told me she was pretty wild."
Wild?
"Yeah, she was wild."
Wild enough you can be sure the tabloids are gonna have a field day.
Have you spoken to them?
"Um, me?"
No.
But somebody somewhere's gonna talk.
- But not you.
"- Uh-uh, no."
- It's okay if you have.
We're not gonna lock you up.
"- No, I haven't."
"So no one like, maybe, the National Enquirer... or one of those silly television programs..."
"- that show, um..."
how much you charge?
-Fifty thousands.
Fifty and fifty do one hundred...
"Good, we go the three."
"Boys, it seems the Day of the Deceaseds, comes, animaos."
-Always with your jokes!
-It is possible that you never change?
"We go, Ciotti is going to begin the visits."
Let's hurry!
.
"-No, no, this way."
-In agreement.
"Boys, the women are as they are, we do not have to create problems to us, we must amuse to us."
"I excuses, Professor, you have seen the young lady Italia?"
Why?
Because I must put the injection to me.
You have that to put the injection?
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"Ah, the gentleman must put the injection?"
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"I have understood if you well, the gentleman must put the injection."
"Yes, that."
"You come with us, we will put."
"One does not worry, you will not feel any pain."
"We already are, happens."
"-That is, does not worry."
-Bend down.
"Now you stand here, Lean here... a little more side... that is."
Comfortable position.
We open the buttock.
-The ass.
-The muscle Relaxes.
You tell him to kill me.
"Sir, you can't do this, Sir, try and under..."
Which kind of sound is this?
"Even Papa, don't know."
"See, how much comfortable?"
"To Sit, To Lay."
You don't have adjust every time.
"It's right, it must be comfortable in the matter of get up and down."
Yes!
"Otherwise, customers complains a lot."
"You have to adjust while sitting, walking,"
Right!
"Gents could do that, but ladies have a problem with that."
"Show me, I showed you."
You told me about the side effective.
"Show me the stuff, What you want to see more?"
This one.
"This, this."
I am showing you this since long.
"Look, Madam since you're showing me that's good but I am... the perfect business man."
"Till I didn't show the real stuff, I don't make deals, this one."
Show me the red west and brief.
Full piece.
Here's your Boss stuff.
"Bhai's diamonds, I'm sorry it's late to delivery you Boss must be angry with me."
Yes!
"He's solid angry, Please say him sorry from me."
I will be grateful to you for my entire life.
Please!
I am very upset and
I am sorry!
Please!
"Now, I need you to get up slowly, and you'll go to that chair, with your hands behind your back, and sit down."
Can you do that for me?
You don't have to say anything.
Just nod if you're cool.
I just need you... on that chair.
"You brought this... on yourselves, guys."
But it can all be over very soon.
I just need one of you to own up to sending the postcard...
- and then we're all done here.
- We don't know who sent the postcard.
"- Please, we don't know."
- He doesn't care if we know or not.
He just wants to screw with us.
- Don't you?
- You got a few moments to talk it over.
I'll be outside.
But I'll be watching.
Luke... with me.
"Did you send the postcard, Luke?"
"No way, man."
I hardly knew your brother.
No offence.
"I'm just a ""party guy"", I bring the drugs and mix the drinks."
"Shallow as fluck, seriously."
"They should be thanking you, Luke."
"If you hadn't have helped out, things might have got a bit more... messy."
You're a good man.
This business with the postcard.
"I don't know, maybe you should just..."
- let it go.
"- I can't do that, mate."
I need answers.
"- Cool, thanks."
"- Uh, why does he get tickets?"
- Because he works here.
"- Well, if I work here, could I get tickets?"
- You don't work here.
- What's that right there?
"- Oh, you... you wouldn't want that job."
"- No, sure I would."
Sign me up.
- Seth...
"- You don't want to know the pay, the hours, job description?"
"- No, I'm good."
"- Minimum wage, long, uh, taking tickets, cleaning toilets, and the light preparation of fried foods."
- I'll be sure and wash my hands between the last two.
"I have to ask Nat, the owner."
"But he's never here, so..."
- Perfect.
"- Okay, I'm Alex."
You can start right now.
"If I don't fire you by the end of tonight, then come back tomorrow."
"- I have a mop, Ryan."
"- You've got a mop, bro."
"- So, you're doing all this for Summer?"
"- Yeah, for her friendship."
"- Wow, you really are changing."
"- Yeah, I am."
"Changing urinal cakes, that's how committed Seth Cohen is, to the new Seth Cohen."
"Okay, now you're talking about yourself in, like, the fourth person."
"Well, it's a whole new dimension of selflessness, Ryan."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to the urinals."
I don't know where they are.
"Check out the new Ryan Atwood, studying at the breakfast table."
They'll send someone more skilful here and we won't go anywhere else anymore.
Don't be crazy.
Why didn't you keep the finished answers?
-Our methods are good for nothing.
-So we must use their methods.
"It seems that if someone gives you one blow,"
-you have to strike back.
-You think?
-What are you doing?
-Strike back.
-At once?
-You mustn't hesitate!
If you think...
-How was it?
-Fine!
"Well, that's it!"
"Hurray, we have it!"
-They haven't worked this out badly.
"Pick it up, the galaxy is waiting for our report."
"One moment, we'll just settle something here."
"So you see, an agreement is always possible."
Hush!
The planet is called Earth.
It's inhabited by living creatures.
"Multi-legged, four-legged... and two-legged."
The two-legged creature is called a human.
He considers himself to be the highest form of life.
He has gained control of energy... and invented a line of useful things.
"The lighter,"
"The telephone,"
The toaster.
"-Soft-boiled eggs, the food dispenser."
- That was you!
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"To-To hook up with a girl, I have to connect with her at least a little."
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings... or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me... with the subject line ""Food for Thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
Now turn off the lights and go.
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
- Guys?
"- Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be.
- What is going on with you guys?
- It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction... and a beat-up van I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
You're welcome.
Sorry.
- Are you well?
"- Fine, thanks."
Sorry to disturb you.
"You're welcome, it's my route."
I'll take you.
I often see you on this road.
- You're not a local?
- No.
You seem to have problems.
One problem!
"In any case, every affair has its own problems."
Anything over a hundred years old is considered an antique.
What are you talking about?
You don't work underground?
"Because of this bone, you think we're looking for treasure or antiques?"
I don't think that.
I'm almost sure of it.
You haven't come for the ceremony?
The cat's out of the bag!
Our crew was joking with the kid.
They said that we've come for treasure.
We didn't want people to know why we're really here.
His family lives in the village.
It's a small village too.
That's why he believed it.
"Later, we told him the secret."
"When I was little, I felt the same."
"Whenever someone told me a secret, I always wanted to tell others."
"And in the end, I would."
I think I enjoyed telling it more than I enjoyed keeping it.
Just go to the concert alone.
- Zach.
- See Seth.
"No bickering, no bantering, just talk."
"As much as I like you, Summer, you need to figure this out with him."
I need you to figure this out.
Holy mack.
"You are, like, such an adult."
"I mean, you're not insecure, you're not jealous."
Are you a robot?
Huh?
"We had a great time over break, right?"
"But if that's all it was supposed to be, and we've taken this as far as possible, just let me know."
Okay?
Okay.
Do you think champagne is really necessary?
Ooh.
Absolutely.
"We need to toast to quitting, slash, getting fired."
To independence.
- You mean unemployment.
"- Oh, Dad, just think how much time Sandy will have to spend on your case."
- Padding around the house in his black socks and his robe.
I can't wait.
"- Cal, don't you have a toast to make, too?"
- No.
"Uh, it's all right."
"Um, too much champagne, I get giggly."
- When have you ever been giggly?
"- Dad, what is it?"
"Julie and I have been talking, and, uh, I've come to a decision."
"Tomorrow morning, I'm calling a press conference to announce that I'll be stepping down from The Newport Group and appointing"
"That day, we went around the town of Nagasaki...  because we wanted to know a lot more about the atomic bomb."
"Even though the atomic bomb was dropped, this survived?"
"No, it was rebuilt."
But there are some things left just as they were at that time.
The angels all look as if they are crying.
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.
Portugal.
These are monuments... sent from different countries of the world.
Czechoslovakia.
Italy.
Poland.
Bulgaria.
The Soviet Union.
China.
Brazil.
Cuba.
Holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water. "" All died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
People are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
"Oh, yeah?"
Since when?
"Well, since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia."
All those things they taught me at Harvard.
"Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I joined the Jesuits I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism."
Not one.
"Yeah, well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed."
And needs an exorcist.
"Father Karras, it's my little girl."
Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why?
I don't understand.
"-To begin with, it could make things worse."
"-Oh, how?"
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
"-Yeah, but--"
"-Meanwhile, your daughter--"
-You could do it yourself.
-No.
I'd need Church approval...
-...and that's rarely given.
-But-- Uh....
-Could you see her?
"-Yes, I could."
"I could see her as a psychiatrist, but I--"
"Oh, not a psychiatrist."
She needs a priest.
"She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world, and they sent me to you."
Now are you gonna send me back to them?
"-Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?"
-You don't understand--
"Now, Stu's over at the Bullfrog."
What's he doin'?
"Well, you know what he's doing."
Is he looking for gold?
"Well, wouldn't be too far off."
No gold over there.
"Okay, tell people that."
"That's a good story, you keep telling people that."
Hasn't been any gold over there for 60 years.
"I watched your dad work that worthless hole for 50 years, and all he come out of there with was a sore back."
There's no gold over there.
"Okay, that's-- that's a good story, Perry."
Tell 'em forget about the gold and go for clip and save.
Do you use clip and save?
No.
"You don't use this stuff because you're on the county payroll, right?"
You don't need to.
But some of us are finding it a little hard to get by these days.
This is a good one.
You can get 75 cents off on a six-pack.
You spend much time around Greenwater Gulley?
No.
Not since I was a kid.
"You know, Earl and I pulled an RV out of there this afternoon."
mm-hmm?
"Three people in it, cut up."
Just like them others we found over the years.
[sighs]
I don't understand.
Some lunatic running around here.
It makes me sick.
"Look at these prices-- 35, 20, 35."
"Klinger, Colonel Potter tells me you're going down to Seoul for him."
Son of a gun.
Now that you mention it--
- You were planning on going to Seoul the whole time!
- It's only an inch from Inchon.
You sneak!
You stole three days from us.
"""Stole"" is such an ugly word."
"Shall we say, ""creatively acquired""?"
"Klinger, this is a list of pieces of music."
The military library in Seoul should have at least some of them.
"Please get them for me, will you?"
Thank you.
Gentlemen.
- That's the most fun he's been in two days.
- Get back as fast as you can.
We want a few minutes before the party to beat the daylights out of you.
Hey!
"Hey, Captain Cook, what about the big dinner party?"
"- You better be quick, or your goose is cooked."
"- Yeah, you bums, you!"
You guys are all talk and no food!
The natives are hungry tonight.
Listen to the pounding of those gums.
"If Klinger doesn't get here soon, we're gonna be the featured danglers at a lynching."
"What do you say we go see Colonel Potter, find out if he's heard from him?"
"- Yeah, let's keep low."
Maybe they won't notice us.
- Yeah.

Banana split.
I'll be right back.

Another murder made to look like accident.
"That's, uh, that's five in two years."
"Just go in the bedroom, that's all."
(angry grunt)
That animal is getting out of here immediately!
"- Wait, wait, wait, don't."
-Don't tell me to wait!
Alice knows she can't have a dog!
And she knows why she can't have a dog!
"Who's gonna take him out, huh?"
Me.
"Me, that's who!"
And when do dogs have to get taken out?
Five minutes before I have to go to bed!
That is around midnight!
"And if you think that I'm gonna walk up and down the street in the snow and the sleet and the rain, walking some mutt back and forth, you're nuts!"
Alice is taking that dog back!
- Right back to the pound!
"-Wait a minute, wait a minute."
She ain't taking it back.
Didn't cost you anything or anything.
She's in love with that puppy.
"If you make her take it back to the pound, it'll-it'll break her heart, and it'll cause a big fight, too."
You're absolutely right.
It will cause a fight.
So therefore I'm not gonna have her take it back.
I'll take it back!
- Back you go.
"-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Just-just wait a minute.
Wait.
- Wait...
-Don't wait...
Get out of my way!
I want them.
- They just left for the hills.
"Would you shut your mouth, bitch."
Who asked you?
Help me.
"Beware, the sailors were here."
They were completely drunk.
Save yourselves.
There is nothing I can do.
I have no more power left.
"Yes, I can save them by myself if you wait here until daybreak."
You will keep them alive until then!
My powers will leave you and return to me.
I will save them.
"Yes, I know what will happen."
You will be left powerless against your enemies.
You will be quite defenseless.
But they will live thanks to you.
That's good.
It's nearly dawn.
Leave as soon as it's light.
Try to save yourselves.
They will live!
Your revenge escapes you.
In this crazy world.
the only thing that might possibly be left for you is generosity.
- Do they have to die?
- In a short while.
I would like to save them.
They gave us their lives.
Can't you help them?
Nothing can save them now.
Just a minute.
What's your name?
"McKendrick, Sir."
The British Army appreciates your generosity in donating gratuitous lessons in hand-to-hand combat.
"As it happens, the army's already prepared a manual based on some actual experience in real fighting."
In future you will cooperate with your instructors and refrain from exhibitions of circus gymnastics.
Is that clear?
"Perfectly, sir."
Who's that new geezer over there?
"Don't ask me, I've never seen him before."
He don't seem to like our Canada.
Fall out.
"Carry on, Sergeant."
"Very good, Sir."
If you can.
Next man.
"How long is it now, Flash?"
I was born up here.
That sergeant must be Dracula's big brother.
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
You ain't even queasy.
"How come, Canada?"
I'm a rollercoaster man.
"They've completed, Sir."
"Thank you, that was most instructive."
"Thank you, Sir."
If a little bothered.
"Excuse me, Sir?"
Yeah.
As you've only just arrived and I've er...
You're saying?
"Well, somebody who'd been here some time might be useful to you, Sir."
They're gonna fly him out at 1400 hours.
"If we abort the transport, Salt's husband dies."
"Letting it continue, it's a big risk."
There's not a lot of upside.
You said it yourself.
She's a decorated Agent.
She's dedicated her life to the Bureau.
"Mejia's capture cost hundreds of lives, and thousands of man hours."
"We put him out there, we risk losing it all."
"Okay, no one's personal situation can justify that."
We know what their plan is.
So we let Salt keep going with it.
We make the cartel believe everything's going their way.
Escort Mejia right up to the hand-over if we have to.
"And in the meantime, we look for George."
"The minute we grab him, we pull out Mejia."
"John, you want to chime in here?"
I agree with Bryan.
That's why I'm standing here.
You're on Mejia with Dave and Rem.
Do not let him out of your sight.
"Bryan and Scott, the two of you go find George Salt."
- When does the cartel plane touch down?
- Six hours.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

So where's Chris?
Good question.
"Hey, Christopher."
So you just send me a text and then leave?
I don't want to bother you any more than I already have.
Bother me?
(chuckles)
Is that what you call what you did?
"Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry."
I-I shouldn't have done it.
"Look, I don't understand."
"I took you in,"
"I tried to do the right thing, believed Tucker was mine."
Why did you lie about it?
I guess I was just desperate.
"You know, to get away from Darrell, to try and find a good daddy for Tucker, I..."
Get away from Darrell?
"What, did... did he try to hurt you or something?"
(sighs) Let's just... no.
"Melody, you gotta talk to me."
What's going on?
"Darrell has a temper, and I was afraid."
Not just... not just for me but for Tucker.
"I tried to get a restraining order against him, but they said I had to wait until something bad happened."
"And I was afraid, and I just-- I didn't know what to do."
I never meant to hurt you.
Okay.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Don't worry about Darrell.
He's not gonna hurt either one of you.

Of course.
How are you?

Her recovery contradicts all I'm about to say.
So that means there is hope.
"No, I repeat, scientifically, no."
"But if you choose to believe, go ahead."
She can open her eyes.
Or am I imagining that?
"No, she can open her eyes."
But that doesn't mean she can see you or is aware of anything.
Lydia's cerebral cortex has been completely destroyed.
But the brain stem is intact.
I came to tell you that Allison has been named valedictorian.
Wonderful.
"She'll be terribly pleased, and so am I."
"She's a fine girl, bright and sensitive."
You should be very proud of her.
"Yes, I am."
"Well, that's what I came about."
"Good night, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"You are lonely here, aren't you?"
It's not the worst thing that can happen to you.
- Isn't it?
- You can learn to live by yourself.
You can get used to it.
Maybe.
But that doesn't make it the best way to live.
The best way?
What would that be?
"People meeting, talking."
"Well, in Peyton Place, two people talking is a conspiracy."
"A meeting is an assignation, and getting to know one another is a scandal."
I think you're hard on the town and hard on yourself.
"No, I'm quite all right the way I am."
What were you gonna do tonight?
Wash your hair?
Read a book?
Go to the movies alone?

- Time shouldn't just pass.
It should be used.
I wouldn't know where to begin.

We need another chaperon for the dance.
Everyone let's line up
So we can make our way down please.

Girls on on side boys on the other
Right.
Well good luck up there.
How could I have forgotten?
We reserved our seats together.
Oh Lily and Rufus!
Oh We haven't seen you
- Since we broke matzo together.
- Hi.
- You look wonderful.
-Thank you.
Love--It's put color in all of our cheeks.
We were talking on the way over here
About what a wonderful couple you two make.
So we decided you should take the plunge like us.
Dating at our age is not enough.
Marry before it's too late.
Well It's not exactly
Uh We're just enjoying the journey.
Well Apparently at one point
We had a destination
But that no longer seems to be the case.
Subtle.
Mm I was going for honest.
Dear friends colleagues
As we stand here today
We bear witness to a bright new beginning.
Just standing in front of him
I-I couldn't do it.
Sensei!
Brother!
He said that ballerinas should dance until they die.
He said that they should dance as long as they have legs.
I'm going to dance.
I'm not going to let myself be defeated like my mother.
"After hearing Kayama-sensei, I know what I need to do."
It's been a long time.
I lived alone with Yagi.
I danced alone.
I pursued you all by myself.
"Now, I just want to be alone in the dark."
I want to do things on my own.
"You know, I was thinking that I wanted to see you not as an old friend, but as someone new."
I don't like that.
"If you were to pass me by now, you wouldn't even notice me."
Do you think so?
I'm going to go to Kansai soon.
Will you come with me?
We can decide our fates on that trip.
Shinako has a performance.
I want to see that.
After that.
That's fine.
"I'll go see it, too."
"Father, I brought you some iced tea."
Thank you.
What's Takao doing?
He isn't home yet.
"Yesterday I said some things I shouldn't have to your mother, didn't I."
It wasn't nice of me to say such terrible things.
"As your mother says, it might be true that your mother's unhappiness is a result of my behaviour."
Just say it.
Unless you tear that notebook up.
If it's really so important to you...
Are we going to meet tomorrow?
I don't mind...
If I ever catch you...
"Is that you, Bernau?"
Just wait!
We know it was you who made a hole in Karel's boat!
You bastard!
Me?
"It wasn't me, I swear!"
Stop that!
How dare you lie about that as well?
"It's not enough that he scares the fish away, but..."
Just leave him.
"Look there, sheep!"
"That's right, this kind is from the hillsides."
There were some especially good areas for keeping sheep in Australia and Wallachia during the second half of the 20th century.
Those aren't sheep.
I think they're cows.
Weren't the sheep kind of woolly?
- What's a sheep?
- Perhaps we should get back to our mission.
We aren't here on a school trip.
"We must adjust the program, I think."
"Watch out, a bus!"
People who live like nomads.
Mostly they came from the poor parts of the countryside.
Working under the Sun.
"So I told him, ""You'll know if she starts talking!"""
- But she needed no introduction.
They're a bit embarassed about their deficiency.
So we give them a safe place to practice.
That was the best party ever.

"I'm ashamed of you, all of you."
"And you, most of all."
I'm sorry.
We snap.
We don't clap.
"And Casey Cartwright, you have earned yourself a grand round of snaps, right, girls?"
This was truly a magical evening.
You see how much fun you can have when you play by the rules and help other.
Come here.
I can't remember the last time I stayed up past 11.
- Good night!
- Good night.
I had an amazing evening.
"Thanks, big sis."
"OK, was Rebecca just being nice to you?"
I'm too tired to worry about that now
"OK, that was the most stressful, exhausting evening of my entire life."
We pulled it off.
And it's been almost a full 48h since I last thought about Evan.
"And tomorrow you'll think about him even less,"
And the next day even less.
"And eventually, it'll just be ""What's his name""."
I hope so.
I wish you were a boy and we could be together forever.
That's weird.
Why do I have to be the boy?
'Cause you're taller!
We want you to come back.
How is she?
My God...
Cumbersome.
Madam?
I'm a jewel broker.
"Since the announcement of my next wedding,"
"I keep getting visits from jewelers, decorators..."
"While browsing, I found in a jewel store,"
"I will not tell you his name by the way, these beads."
"These beads are beautiful, Madam, but again: it's not."
I m sure the Princess Danidoff would be very happy to have them.
Where are they from?
"Show them to her first, then you'll decide."
I will give you a great price.
And I have other jewelry.
A moment.
"Oh, look, I'm in a hurry!"
"If you decide to buy, meet me tomorrow at the Orsay railway station."
-Alright.
"Jean, please get Madam to the door."
"- Well, sir."
- Good evening.
"This is extraordinary, but..."
"I swear, my dear Norbert, these are the jewels that were stolen from me."
I have every reason to believe you.
It is this woman?
A receiver of stolen goods who sells the goods that thiefs put in her hands.
I'll buy them.
I have an appointment tomorrow.
Pay yourself.
Good morning.
I think you heard the news.
Thank you.
you killed him?
You killed dad?
"Not that I want to speak ill of the dead, but lionel luthor left a lot of damage in his wake, clark."
Remember he locked you in a kryptonite box?
"Lionel did a lot of things, chloe, but he'd never commit suicide."
"I don't know about that, clark."
He was beyond disturbed
- when he came to the daily planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
"He was pretty rattled the last time I saw him, too."
He was desperate to give me something... a locket.
What does a locket have to do with lionel luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your father.
When I was a boy...
- Or a CD.
You didn't know what to do.
"No, in homeschool club, you get tapes only."
- So you never had a locker?
- No.
Or I got...
I felt embarrassed.
That's kind of the best part of high school.
- Having a locker?
- Yeah.
- I never used my locker.
- You see it on Saved by the Bell.
"I don't know if they can clear that, can they?"
- Can I say Saved by the...?
- Saved by the:
"Yeah, you could say that."
"I provide the supplies, you provide the service."
"If we're gonna be partners, we need to share the risk."
Same deal I had with Des.
So you need to know how to do this.
I know how to do it.
Properly.
Like a doctor.
How about if I inject you?
Whole purpose is for me to show you.
You can talk me through it.
"First, you have to find a good vein."
Press up and down gently.
Mm-hmm.
This will expand the vein and make it easier to see.
Just like people.
You apply enough pressure and they show what they really are.
Now take the syringe.
Insert the needle.
Pull back slightly to show a bit of blood.
That's good.
You want a slow and steady release.
"Too fast, you'll send the body into shock."
"You always remember your first time, right?"
We should celebrate... our partnership.
Want a drink?
Can I use your bathroom?
"Yeah, just down the hall."
Let me get this straight.
Your dealer is behind this whole thing.
That's right.
Grady Burgess.
Because you owe him money.
They kept her away from drugs and from me.
You still loved her?
Yes.
I'd cry when I saw something that moved me because I couldn't share it with her.
There's nothing worse than leaving someone you still love.
What a sad story.
"Love is the saddest thing when it goes away, as a song by Jobim goes."
We have to talk after the fight.
We've been talking for an hour.
You.
Not me.
You're right.
The doctor said it would take two months for my leg to heal.
But you knowwhat?
I'm glad the bull gored me.
"Now Ican staywith you until you awake, my love"
No one will take me away from you.
We'd gotten back together a month before.
"Lydia was to tell you at the wedding, but when I saw you in the ICU"
I knew she hadn't.
It was you she was crying for.
She rang to tell me she'd cried thinking of me.
It was the last time we spoke.
"As I'm injured, I won't be fighting for a while."
I'd like to stay with her these nights.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
"Hello, Alicia."
I'm alone again.
"Admit it, you were looking at her breasts."
"It's hard not to, they're getting bigger."
I'm thinking of going away.
Can you see beyond looks?
I see a bad future for my daughter.
How are you returning?
Jai's picking her up in a helicopter.
- We'll drop you
I'm ashamed!
He claims he's building the fastest car in the world!
Here?
What's lacking here?
- We needn't suffer like this
"Problem is, you've lived comfortably."
You got no idea how difficult life is
Why should I care?
My parents can give us a life of comfort
"For your comforts, not mine."
- You don't care for me
If my determination is selfishness do whatever you wish
Are you giving me an ultimatum?
- I'm trying to make you see reason
I don't want to see reason I'm not living in this junkyard
This is home!
Not junkyard!
- Even that line is your brother's
Hello Shekhar
I'm Jai.
From America
"Yes Jai, yo on."
Is Om in?
Not right now
I'll pay you back whatever Om borrowed for my studies
"For you, free."
I Take Nothing for free
"Well, yeah, but she looked so beautiful in it."
She wore it in front of you?
"Of course, but you're missing the point."
"Grandma was so happy, and I was happy because she was happy."
I don't understand why you didn't keep shopping until you found dresses in both your sizes.
"No, no, no, no, no."
I was happy because she--
But isn't that the point of mother-daughter dresses--
To get the same dress?
"Yeah, but--"
Gosh.
Who knew grandma was so selfish?
I am so glad you're my mom and not her.
"Okay, I'm done."
There's no way I'm telling her.
So I stayed in the play and just... (Clinking)
Fudged the truth a little bit.
(Frankie) Wow.
Busy night.
"I've gotta go to the bank and the cleaners, and I should probably go to the drug store, 'cause I've had this headache for, like, five days."
"It's not a throbbing, like, ""wah-wah"" headache, you know."
"It's more of a dull, constant ""eh,"""
"so I'll probably be gone 2 hours, 45 minutes."
Hey!
It's Brick's Uncle.
"I'm here for, uh, grandparents and special friends day."
You've gotta be kidding me.
"Uh, th-that was last week."
Th-they're taking a test.
Now is really not the best time.
"Oh, no, it's not the best time for me at all, but I'm here, so how does this work?"
"What, do they, uh, sing me a song, give me a cupcake or somethin'?"
"""Entrepreneur rises from the ashes."""
"Now, I'm just going to be in The Times, looking like a stupid ash."
"Shoot, girl, just push on through."
"I'm pushing, girl."
I am pushing.
(both) Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
"Just go, girl."
I don't want anybody else to get those two yellow dresses.
"Max, did you hear that?"
Someone has worst taste than Sophie.
Now we just have to hang back here and let them get to those dresses first.
Yay!
My life is good again.
"Max, Caroline, up here."
"What was that, like, a second?"
I saved you a space upfront.
Come on.
"Well, it's over."
"As soon as they cut that ribbon,"
Sophie's going to Marshawn Lynch everyone who gets in the way of us and those dresses.
There's only one way out of this.
And you called it earlier.
You have to let them trample you.
I'm serious.
I'm not about to be trampled on purpose.
See if you still feel that way after I say these next few words:
"""Pictured from left, Caroline Channing."""
Try to fend off any heels you see heading for my eyes.
"Attention, ladies."
"As you see, I have the big scissors, which can only mean it's time... to trim some nose hairs!"
"""Immediately, bring him back!"
"We'll chat and lay food on the table"""
"We'll bring him home, we'll settle it, And throw a fiest in his honor"""
--I came home --Very good
--Did you get wet?
--None of us are infallible
"Pasha, they left."
They flagged down a car and left.
36-63-13
--Yes?
--Please call Lyudmila to the phone --Could you call even later at night?
--Do excuse me --Just a moment
--Hello --Gera?
--Yes
"--I was calling Lucy --She's asleep, dad"
Please call her
Let them stay overnight there.
Don't drag the child back and forth.
She's traumatized as it is.
"Good evening, comrade Vasin."
To what do we owe the honor?
"Lucy, you guys come back home in the morning..."
--Yeah?
"--Well, that is..."
--...if you can review your moral code?
--Really?
"Dear Comrade Vasin, we won't come until YOU review your moral code"
--our moral code is doing just fine.
--just fine?
!
Did you take my casette player with you by accident?
--Or did you simply steal it?
- Maybe.
Hello?
"Yeah, Kevin."
Hi.
Is he all right?
"Oh, thank God."
"- All right, yeah, come pick us up."
We're still at his place.
- Where is he?
"All right, bye."
"He's-a, he's in jail."
"Ah, in Oceanside."
He was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.
"Dad left some serious problems with the company, beyond serious."
You think you might have to shut it down?
Maybe.
Probably.
I can't go into details.
I can't even tell Joe.
You know what they say at business school... almost all family businesses fail in successive generations.
I mean...
- if Ojai is already having problems...
"- Then we should kick it to the curb, according to our M.BA."
That's the smart play.
It's not that easy.
Losing Ojai'd devastate my family.
"Come on, you have no idea what families can survive."
"Besides, you are not responsible for everything, Sarah."
You always took on everybody else's problems.
You could come back to North Light today.
You are on the fast track.
"No, that place was eating up my life."
I mean literally I could just kill her.
Okay.
You know how I'd do it?
Rip out her tongue and I'd wrap her own tongue around her freaking neck until she was dead.
Do you know what?
That would be funny.
That would be funny.
You know why?
Because then she couldn't shoot her flipping mouth off and she'd be dead.
And I would win because she's dead!
I added echo for effect.
I like sound.
Now look at the timecode.
"It's the time of the murder, damn!"
This is the first time that someone saying they want to kill someone was their alibi.
Grrr!
Shaye.
"You know,"
"I do what I do, check one two."
Check one two.
"Well, this is the big day."
I'll be witness for the prosecution.
Somebody's ears are going to be burning
"Because I'll be talking about you, testifying about you."
Some say I'll even be lying about you.
"What's that, Larry?"
You want me to tell the truth no matter what?
Then everyone'll know our personal business.
They'll never understand.
What?
I...
I suppose I could do it just for us.
Run!
The warehouse is gone.
They can't get out now
Let's retreat!
Run!
Hot?
Hot!
I don't need you to save me
You don't deserve it
Don't pretend you care
Do you think by killing me this world will be a better place?
You're too naive!
Lei
You think it's that easy to be a hero?
There'll always be another villain on the lurk
You will soon be like me
Because that's your destiny
Father
I'd like to borrow your umbrella
"Previously on ""Black Box""..."
Okay.
Not that I'm obsessed with him.
"Oh, my God!"
"It's a closed-circuit infrared 400,000-CCD-pixel resolution."
I have known Reynaud since I interned under him.
He had an undiagnosed brain tumor.
I want your advice.
"Yes, you have the surgery."
- You remove as much of the...
- What if I don't want to live?
"No, buy as much time as you can, and then you spend it with your son."
"You are wrong,I only know your name, and I am not interested in knowing you."
Alex.
"Where where you, I was looking for you."
Adriana
Its just that I came out for a stroll on this wonderful night.
"to take in the fresh air, and to gaze upon the moon."
A moon in a blue bikini?
"No...you are wrong, Adriana."
"Excuse me, Madame, I forgot my bracelet."
Valet?
"Please give this to Mr. Dinamo, at the casino."
No more bets.
three red
I will teach you how to win at this game.
You don't say. it seems I always loose when you are along.
seventeen.
"Listen to me, I am an expert."
No more bets.
seven red
"Oh my, that is the only time I did not play seven red and now it comes up."
"and its all your fault for interrupting me, just when I was going to play seven red."
"Do not worry, we will win now, on seventeen."
"No more bets, ten black."
"Ah, so you are quite the expert, eh?"
Now you will believe.
Tokens please.
"Unfortunate in games of chance, fortunate in games of love."
Lets put that theory to the test.
"Mr. Dinamo, a message thanks seventeen black"
We won!
"We won, Alex!"
what?
The heavens must be saying that everything will be fine.
Nuna!
Nuna!
(Nuna - older sister)
Who is it?
"My sister is acting very strangely, she can't breathe."
How can that be?
"Put her on oxygen, and inject her with epinephrine."
Yes.
Does she have asthma?
"I'm not sure, but she is allergic to flour."
She ate food containing flour today.
It's possible that her allergy caused anaphylactic shock.
"Her blood pressure is 70/40, and her pulse is only 41."
Her oxygen saturation is only at 70%.
"Nuna, Nuna, Mi Jin Noona..."
(Nuna - older sister)
"Then we'll leave it to you, Doctor."
"Let's not be too worried, let's go out and wait."
"Oh, why is there such a thing!"
"Kim Na Na, can't I go first?"
What did I do?
I don't know them.
Do you think I'd ask you to bring me here if my leg didn't hurt?
Ah... seriously.
Mi Jin!
What if your father comes back late?
You should clean the house.
Make some food to eat with your brother.
"You clearly knew that flour would cause problems, so why did you still eat bread?"
"Eonni, you don't know what happened."
Our water and gas were cut off.
"If we don't get a signal soon, get some back-up..."
We're driving towards Clare in a hearse.
(GRUNTING)
Fuck...
"I'm not going to hurt you, I need some drugs."
(GRUNTING) Adrenaline...
Something to keep me going.
"If you come with me, I can get you your drugs, and examine your wound also."
"There are soldiers here, they're looking for me."
SEELA:
Why?
I was trying to rescue a woman.
She's a doctor.
She got kidnapped by the Janjaweed.
Her name's Clare Somersby.
- The aid worker?
- Yeah.
She's going to die...
"Along with a lot of other people, if you don't help me."
(GRUNTING) Okay...
"So, please?"
(SOLDIERS YELL IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
There's no sign yet of Stonebridge on any of the satellite feeds...
Widen your grid reference.
What about Matak?
"(CHUCKLES) According to his office, he's away on an official engagement."
"- No, He's stalling..."
He's just hoping nothing will stick to him.
"See if she was arrested, as well, and get me on a flight to Khartoum."
I'm gonna have to deal with this personally.
(IN ARABIC)
(IN ARABIC)
What a lovely name.
The dawn.
"(PLAYS ""FANTASIE-IMPROMPTU IN C MINOR"")"
(SIGHS)
- I'm not happy with it.
- Why?
Because a perfect impromptu should seem spontaneous and free.
No-one should be able to guess at the desperate calculation behind it.
I've been struggling with this for so long.
It's like being tangled in a net.
I feel...
I have terrible dreams at night.
"I think if I ever finish it, then it will have finished me."
You must suffer tortures to find the perfect word that will make it all seem effortless.
Me?
Suffer for art?
You must be joking.
I suffer quite enough for life.
I have no hope to be perfect.
I simply pump out pages for money.
"No, your books are admirable."
I've been reading them.
Have you?
GEORGE:
Ah.
Is this your family?
"No, that's my fiancee."
"Well, we are no longer engaged."
Her family didn't feel that I was a very good risk for a husband.
No-one expects me to live very long.
- Balls!
- I beg your pardon?
Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of mothballs.
When were they issued?
This morning?
What do you do for heat in this barrack?
No stove.
"The men here used it as a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily."
How long is temporarily?
I trust not until July.
Here you see a meal the prisoners are getting.
"Schulz, what are we having today?"
Bean soup mit ham hocks.
Would you like to taste it?
"- Thank you, no."
-Where's the ham hock?
There should be a ham hock!
"When you find it, we'll send it to Geneva."
Are there any complaints?
Please speak up.
Don't be afraid to talk.
"That's what the Geneva convention is for to protect the rights of prisoners of war, whether they are Americans or Germans."
- What have you got to say?
-I like it here.
What about you?
"It's all right, considering."
What happened to you?
Were you beaten?
Why don't you answer?
- What did you do to this man?
-They didn't do nothing.
- Who beat you?
- Nobody beat me.
So we headed downtown.
On a bus.
Almost fresh.
I got 'em on the plane yesterday.
"Thank goodness I saved 'em, huh?"
Barbara.
Mm-hmm?
I understand about Roger being a great pool player...
Fantastic player!
His life's dream is to play competition on TV.
But what I don't understand is the part about the gold teeth.
Ah.
"Well, um, his gardening truck."
Did I mention that Roger is terrific with tropical flowers?
And therefore I know he's gonna be doin' real well over here.
"Anyway, his gardening truck was rear-ended, and his mouth..."
Steering wheel.
"So, he had this friend whose cousin was a dentist..."
"Some friend, right?"
And he gave him a deal on these new front teeth.
The problem with tailing a bus is that it can be pretty humiliating.
"See, a bus creeps along while the rest of the traffic moves around it."
"Well, all the, uh, enamel fell off, leaving just the gold casings."
Yeah.
So that's why you don't have a photo of Roger.
He's embarrassed to get his picture taken.
Come on.
The next pool hall is right up the street.
Okay.
"Barbara, does anyone know that you've come here looking for Roger?"
Ha.!
Only half of Bayonne.
"Yeah, nobody knows that better than I do."
Trust me.
But I also know that she knows stuff about people.
She's got a real gift for that.
"So, I'm gonna ask you."
Once.
What was she talking about?
"[inhales, exhales]"
Remember that little ditty I told you about looking for something new in Mexico?
"- Yeah, I remember not buying it."
- I was running.
His name's Clayton.
Met him on the rodeo circuit in Waco.
We were gonna swipe the main till at the stock show.
"Night before the show, he got good and drunk, he beat the shit out of me."
"Jitters, I guess."
"And the next day, we pulled the job."
"And when it came time to run, I left him holding' the bag in a tunnel with a six-pack of good ol' boys."
- So that's who you did the deal with.
- Yeah.
- But how that bitch knew about it...
- Forget it.
- She's like the plague.
- [laughs]
"The longer she's around, the more damage she does, which is why we're skipping this job."
"What are you, crazy?"
"Come on, it's... because of her!"
"Trust me, all right?"
She's bad for business.
- I don't want it.
- That's bullshit.
"- Okay, there's more to it."
There's more?
"Oh, if anyone finds a Xanax, it's mine."
It was knocked out of my hand by two women duking it out over a chintz mermaid dress.
"Oh, now it looks good."
There's Xanax on the loose and I'm just standing here?
"At least if I was high, I'd have an excuse to be wearing this."
"Here pilly, pilly."
"Here pilly, pilly, pilly."
"Girl, for real, you look like straight up crap in that dress."
For real.
You white girls can't pull that color off.
That's a waste of poppin' lemon yellow.
I know.
I am way too white for this.
"She's also too white to say ""turnt up"" all the time, but that hasn't stopped her."
This dress was not my choice.
I hate everything about it.
This is a disaster.
"This is ""Dressageddon."""
"Yeah, but in a good way."
You two don't want to wear the dresses.
You don't have to.
But I thought you wanted us to match the balloons and the ducks.
"Max, she said we don't have to wear the dress."
Don't question her!
That's like questioning a prison guard when he says you're free to go.
"Sophie, are you sure you don't care?"
"Oh, yeah."
Sure.
"Yeah, they're all yours, Destiny's Child."
This is ten pounds of ugly junk.
"Reminds me of this bartender, Pete, I used to date."
Don't fret.
I just lick the alphabet.
"A, B, C..."
"Nothing wrong with that, is there?"
"No, but..."
I thought you were thinking about me.
"I thought about a letter, then you, and then a new letter."
Don't discuss such matters with him.
I didn't say I was going to lick you.
Just licking in general.
"Of course I was going to lick you, but your name wasn't mentioned."
- All right.
- Let's go home.
Well done.
"- Hi, Mads."
"- Peter, isn't it?"
- Good game?
- Fine.
"Frank, I looked into that matter."
"Judging by what you told me,   the woman sold you that picture with intent to defraud."
The law clearly states that any transaction is invalid   if the seller had fraudulent intentions.
She knew you thought the picture was mouth and not hand-painted.
"When you reveal the fraud, the sale is invalid."
- You can demand your money back.
- I'm going to the car.
Bye.
Anyway...
"If you want to, you can sue her."
- Just say the word.
I'm off.
"- Okay, Mads."
- See you.
We can't leave anything to chance.
We can't let the girl cancel the broadcasts.
She's the only one who can undo what's been done.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Go fuck yourself.
"Look, your bosses won't let her live."
She knows too much.
Either you or me or the Agency pulls the trigger.
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
DAVID:
"Fuck. lf anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air... (david panting) I couldn't take the shot."
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
katherine:
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"-No, he couldn't."
"-What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
I'm just wondering about something.
Okay.
Why does your father hate psychiatrists?
He doesn't hate psychiatrists.
"Okay, so why does he hate me?"
He doesn't hate you.
He thinks you're great.
Why are you concerned about what he thinks suddenly?
"You know, he's a puritan."
He quotes Proust and wears tweed.
He doesn't know anything about us.
Do you think that we should've gotten married before?
Before when?
Before coming out here?
"He runs around, spends my money on drugs and ends up in a mental hospital!"
"Oh, I'm so close to letting go on him."
I'm at the end of my rope here.
I think that what's going on with Wyatt is complicated and I don't think your anger is helping him with his problems.
My anger?
I'm not angry.
I'm furious!
"Because this is all about me, you see."
"I will not tolerate disgusting, degenerate behaviour and disrespect for me and my values--"
"Mrs. Jones, listen."
Give your values a rest for a second.
Your kid's in trouble.
Yeah.
"Oh, Jesus, Claudia."
Give me a fucking break.
My relationship with lan has nothing to do with this.
"- Mom, I'm not going to be alone"
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me
I'm not going to object.
But you will need his permission
Ask him when he's home
"God, please keep Babuji in a nice mood"
It's just beer.
It's over there.
- I told you.
The store is shut
Get out
Got the beer?
- Didn't find any
Can't even do such a simple job?
- That was an angry man
I'll get it.
- You won't
Can I have an Aspirin?
- The store is shut
My head is about to crack up!
It's sinusitis
"If I can't find an Aspirin, I'll faint."
All the other stores are shut
Please let me have one Aspirin.
One Hindustani ought to help another
Glory to The Goddess.
- Here you are
I'm feeling bad about forcing you to open your store for a small medicine
I'd like to buy some other things from you
I'll pick up some beer.
Not for myself.
"Hey, you know that guy we met at the exhibition?"
Joe Sandilands?
The Attorney General.
He didn't like the painting either.
(Both laugh)
"Yeah, well he wants me to run."
State parliament.
Oh.
Dutch Patterson's old seat.
It's safe Labor.
"If I get preselection, I'm a certainty."
And is that something you want?
Yeah.
I never thought I had a chance.
I joined Young Labor when I was 16.
Went to God knows how many meetings.
And here all you needed to do was get shot.
You think that's the only reason they've asked me?
I didn't say that.
"No, but you're implying it."
"Well, they did only notice you after the tabloids called you 'hero'."
"OK, fine."
I'll stay at the bar.
If you're going to be negative about it.
What's it got to do with me?
Why is my opinion so significant?
"Well, I care what you do."
You can do what you want.
"All I'm saying is from my experience, politicians tend to be..."
"Let me guess - arrogant, self-indulgent, trough-sniffing arseholes."
"I was going to say sad, mostly."
And how many politicians do you know?
I'd cry when I saw something that moved me because I couldn't share it with her.
There's nothing worse than leaving someone you still love.
What a sad story.
"Love is the saddest thing when it goes away, as a song by Jobim goes."
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
You're right.
The doctor said it would take two months for my leg to heal.
But you know what?
I'm glad the bull gored me.
"Now I can stay with you until you awake, my love."
No one will take me away from you.
We'd gotten back together a month before.
"Lydia was to tell you at the wedding, but when I saw you in the ICU I knew she hadn't."
It was you she was crying for.
She rang to tell me she'd cried thinking of me.
It was the last time we spoke.
"As I'm injured, I won't be fighting for a while."
I'd like to stay with her these nights.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
"Hello, Alicia."
I'm alone again.
"Admit it, you were looking at her breasts."
"It's hard not to, they're getting bigger."
I'm thinking of going away.
- How come?
- I have to work.
What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
Sure.
Can I borrow your forehead?
"Good afternoon, gentlemen."
How may I help you?
Afternoon.
Agents thompson and sousa with the ssr.
If you're looking for mr.
"Stark,"
I'm afraid he's indefinitely unavailable.
"We're well-aware of that, mr."
Jarvis.
"That is your name, isn't it?"
Mr. Edwin jarvis?
You misplace anything recently?
"Yes, I did lose a fountain pen on fifth avenue."
How about the bumper off a fleetmaster?
Just the bumper?
Wish you'd found the entire car.
I reported it stolen several days ago.
Detective davis at the 19th precinct was very helpful.
If there's nothing further...
That bumper was found at a major crime scene.
There's plenty further.
"Mr. Stark doesn't like visitors,"
Whether he's here to receive them or not.
"Look, mr."
"Jarvis, I can call a judge"
And wait here to get a warrant.
"But honestly, it's almost lunchtime,"
How would you like to take a ride downtown?
"Well, lead the way."
"Well, this will be novel."
-She's just a kid.

DOCTOR:
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
How do you feel about the girl?
She asked a very good question.
-Which was?
-Why?
"Well, that's a question that needs to be asked."
We are not sociopaths.
We're vulnerable to qualms of conscience like anyone else.
"We face these decisions every day, and we vote up or down."
"Like everything else, it has all been distilled down to zeros and ones."
They have asked for me to describe your emotional state
(helicopter hovering) in as detailed a manner as possible.
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field.
... she'sdead.
The little dog is there.
"I used to go over there on Sundays, you know..."
... bringthepaper...
... coffee.
I used to bring a bag of bear claws.
That little dog used to beg in front of me for them bear claws.
I loved that little dog.
I loved that little dog.
[MARTlNEZ SPEAKS in spanish] I'm okay speaking as we are.
MEDAVOY:
"Mr. Fuentes, when we came to see you yesterday..."
... youseemednervous about Mrs. Garcia making her bail.
You told us that you and your wife don't know her very well.
"So, what are you concerned about?"
You know her a little better than you said?
"I'll tell you everything, but you can't use it to incriminate me."
I gotta ask you something.
-Do you want to have a lawyer here?
-No lawyer. I didn't do nothing wrong.
Why don't you tell us what's on your mind?
-l had relations with Mrs. Garcia.
-What kind of relations?
"You know, intimate, virile."
I couldn't help it.
She fell in love with me.
Her husband worked all day.
"He'd come home at night, drink, beat her."
"Coño, you know, she has needs."
"You're home during the day, work at night."
My wife's a good woman. I love her.
But Luisa Garcia estaba bien caliente.
"Fair and square, is it not?"
"Look Johnny, my room shouldn't go vacant even for a day."
Your house is like my own!
I wouldn't be able to bear it.
If you were to incur any loss on my account!
May I take one?
Get lost!
Are you a moron?
Rushing to pay the advance when the house isn't even vacant yet!
You haven't understood this city at all.
"Johnny bhai, thank you."
Oye!
What do you think you are doing?
Hey!
I am talking to you!
That is my drawer.
It was my drawer till you stuffed your things in.
Your mother has given me the key.
If my mother gave you the house keys someday..
..would the house be yours too?
I pay my share of the rent every month.
You eat worth much more in a single day!
I will leave your house...
and your drawer as well!
Quit talking about it.
Why don't you actually do it for a change.
I told you not to come here!
What was so important?
You should not trust me so much!
Where else can I keep it?
All the banks are asking for an income proof.
I will come and take it in a couple of weeks.
"No, Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now."

Lemonade mixed in mayo.
It's an old prison trick for dyeing hair.
Seriously?
Looks like our man's a blonde now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.
15 minutes ago.
"Factor in the time for a dye job, he couldn't have made it very far."
He could still be around here.
You see that?
"Excuse me, sir."
Every time I come across...
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.
The Frabjous Day is almost upon us.
You must prepare to meet the Jabberwocky.
"From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole,"
I've been told what I must do and who I must be.
"I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and stuffed into a teapot."
"I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice, but this is my dream."
I'll decide where it goes from here.
If you diverge from the path...
I make the path.
"Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard, and don't forget the hat."
There's only one way across.
"Lost my muchness, have I?"
Bayard!
The hat!
Your Majesty.
He was found two weeks ago.
Patrolman saw him wandering on Bahnhofstrasse.
"Dazed, confused."
"Ran his prints and uh, found that he worked for your group, NATO Intelligence."
Thought you could help us.
He was stationed in Zurich.
Shuffling papers.
Hm.
What'd the doctor's say?
No.
He's catatonic.
"Appears to be awake but he's uh, not responsive."
There's been no change in the two weeks.
I think he's hopeless.
So whatever he once knew will die with him.
Nothing?
"No sir, we had a tracer put on Keene's passport."
The woman as well.
But they vanished.
And Jared Clayton.
"They are moving him into a nursing home, outside of Staad."
On NIA pension of course.
Of course.
"All right, we tie up the usual loose ends."
Release statements about terrorist cells to cover up.
"And tomorrow morning, we'll be back to business as usual."
"Good night, agent Henry."
"Sir, there's just one more thing."
It's very late.
It's about the Kozlenko affair.
What about it?
"I did some research, and as you know the NIA keeps excellent records."

What'd you do that for?
"Here we go, London!"
"O2 Arena, welcome to the Take Me Home tour!"
"London, are you ready?"
One Direction!
One Direction!
One Direction!
British boy band One Direction has arrived  to the frenzied screams of fans.
Security was needed to control hundreds of fans.
One Direction is taking over  the music world one country at a time.
-One Direction.
-One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
hey're number one here in Australia.
Number one in the U.S.
One Direction are number one  in more than 35 countries.
Even the beatles never achieved such transatlantic success so early  in their careers.
t's happened so so quickly.
t's not just unusual it's unprecedented.
1 D definitely set  the pace for 201 2 selling out their entire 201 3 arena tour in mere hours.
he group was forced to add even more dates after selling out an impressive six days at London's renowned O 2 Arena.
"Look, he ate a coin."
- A coin?
Yup.
An incident with the kebab.
Border!
Hurry.
Finga being a woman.
"As the border guard approached, I was all in sweat."
"I imagined someone imprisoning me, he would take off my clothes"
And confiscate the camera.
"It's already done, you know."
"Fortunately, our clandestine escape coincided with another story."
"Sorry, Nicolas, but we're in a crisis of identity."
Crisis?
- We do not agree with anything.
Anything.
Anything.
"The old generation wants tradition, we merge."
"In Istanbul, we had to appear on television"
For the first time after so many years.
Stupid storm.
But Mr. Lloyd will make a music video.
"Yes, I hope so."
The first shot was just to have fun.
Maybe they just had to clear their minds.
The real canton for the video is a cosmic classic.
"Then, Mr. Lloyd, his flight plan ends so?"
Miss?
- Ana.
"Ana, yes."
Can you give us some information on transport?
Yes.
"Sees a woman obviously in a distraught position at the House obviously a prisoner of sorts, and He turns and rides off."
I just picked out a lot of wardrobe and brought it all with me.
We end up changing the poncho.
"We found one in Spain that Sergio liked, that green one."
Same boots I wore on Rawbide.
"Cigars, bought them in a store down in Beverly Hills."
Tbey were about tbat long.
So I bougbt a mess of tbem and I just cbopped tbem up in tbree pieces.
I'd always Have a pocketful.
I'd Have them in different sizes and lengths.
"In one scene I bad left off, I'd bave it in one Iengtb."
"If you jump to a sequence, I'd remember wbere it was."
We didn't Have bathrooms.
We were out there in this town and there was nothing.
Just this facade town.
Out in tHe desert.
It was 6:45 in tbe morning.
"I said: ""I bave to go to tbe batbroom."""
"He said: ""Abb, abb."""
"I tbougbt: ""I bave a wboIe desert out tbere and be wants me to go to tbe batbroom..."
"""...rigbt out in tbe middle witb a camera and a reflector and all tbat."""
"I said: ""No, no."
"I'II wait."" ""Go, go,"" be said. ""We won't look."""
Clint's acting style reminds me of Gary Cooper.
WHat I liked was His calmness.
"I must bave been like a little jittery, fidgety actor."
Agua.
Water.
I was a member of THe Actors Studio.
I was loaded with the method.
And He wasn't.
Leone's approach to acting was a little overboard.
I trust that she offered some challenges.
"Yes, she did."
Good.
Now we can give Roland's mother a proper burial.
"Thank you, gentlemen."
So what did you glean?
Surely there was something.
"There was indeed, Dr. Ogden."
Mrs. Braxton was not a full woman.
Meaning?
She had no ovaries.
She was born without a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't bear children?
"Whoever she is, she isn't your baby's mother."
Who is this girl that you keep locked up?
And don't give me that story about Borneo.
I... came across her in the Appalachian Mountains some ten years ago.
"Well, she came across me, more like."
How so?
I was asleep in the caravan when I heard something rummaging around my campfire.
"In the darkness, I thought it was a bear"
- and almost shot it.
- Where did she come from?
No idea.
"You ask me, she was raised by wolves."
Highly unlikely.
"Sir, she's as wild as the day is long, mister."
"So, you keep her caged like a beast."
"Look, she's clothed and fed and in a better state than when I found her."
"And before you start, she's legally mine."
I have the paper to prove it.
There you go.
"Great leading, Joey."
Me?
"Yeah, you."
I thought monsieur Marcel felt that technology was a distraction.
"For the guests, yeah."
You seem pretty good at that game.
He's the best on the whole island.
It's a pretty small island.
Doesn't look like it's all that hard.
Looks like all you gotta do is push these big buttons and play along with the song here.
Am I right?
Something like that.
"You know what'd be a gas, Sctanley?"
For me and you to play.
"And when I win, you could point me towards the singles' side and forget you ever saw us."
When you beat me?
"When I win, what will you give me?"
Maybe just this.
"$1,000"
"- A cool G, as we call it back home."
"Are you at liberty to play for that, Sctanley?"
Or would you prefer to play for smiles?
"Monsieur Marcel, I'm sorry to have woken you."
"I thought there was an emergency, but I was mistaken."
I do apologize.
I play at expert level.
You take this kind of serious.
That's a big screen.
You've played this before.
"Maybe just a couple times, Sctanley."
"All right, Sctanley, let's have some fun."
"Come on, Sctanley, get him!"
- It makes a handy weapon in a pinch.
You kidnapped me with a candy bar?
"Well, you have to admit it was rather inventive."
"Oh, God."
Don't be upset.
"If I'd had a real gun, I would have used it."
It sure felt like a gun.
I thought for sure everybody would hear the wrapper crinkle.
"Oh, God."
I can just see the headline now.
- Hey.
"Hey, candy thief."
"- ""Kidnapper Exposed When Candy Gun Melts In Hand. """
Hey!
Hey!
Come on.
Thanks.
Thank you.
If my father only knew you kidnapped me with a candy bar.
Think of the embarrassment.
"Oh, God, what a jerk."
"You know, he's probably thinking right now about how he can use all this publicity... 'cause he wants to run for governor of California."
"Now listen, once this whole fiasco is over..."
I want you to get me and Natalie on A.M. San Diego... and all the national morning shows.
Call Ted Turner.
Tell him I'll give him an exclusive first once this insane thing is wrapped up... in exchange for some good publicity.
He owes me one.
"Uh, you get to work."
I'll call you back.
- Mr. Voss?
- What is it?
- Our chopper's back.
Let me get on the floor and beg
"That makes me look bad, so no"
"Anyways, the report please"
Yes.
Someone seems to be home since last night
Ok.
Please lead us there
Yes ma'am.
Please follow me
He's been on a stakeout since last night?
Of course
"If he stayed, this old beast may have attacked me"
I was so scared!
I'm so sorry
Don't look this way evil one!
Yes
The final battle with this party...
They're on the fourth floor
I'm calling the police if they aren't there
They're there
Their lights were on until really late last night
I was watching his door from across the street
Didn't stop you from going shopping
I'm sorry...
Lin...
Let's go in!
Let's persuade her and bring her back home
I've never been so nervous
Are you ready?
Mr. Sexual Demon?
Ready baby!
"Stop using that gross language, Anti-sex-ed-man"
I would do it until a morning the with pleasure.
Tell dear Tót.
Where is he?
Excuse me.
It fell down.
Is there a some kind of paint in the house?
- Paint?
- Yes.
This environment is monotone.
Do you not see it?
This grew tired.
You know what I had it made with the sentry boxes in the barracks?
"With a red, yellow, blue paint painted they."
Into the boards I had angles beaten in order for it not to be possible to lean against him.
What is your opinion?
Interesting.
Should we paint the walls?
Everything.
Oh it doesn't matter.
Let us continue.
Let the hand move.
He was cut it off his new sock.
He was crying very much.
"How I remembered him, that strike one 8 monthly children."
"I don't know, I already said that Gyula followed away when I took the road from the front line to the station?"
- Really?
- That's right.
I took a liking to that child very much.
"We took a bath, we were drinking beer next in the canteen."
Oh my sweet god.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
I hear.
- This was awkward.
"Like, ""Wait a minute, no way."
Seth Meyers?
"- That wasn't him."""
- Their mouths were making noises.
"- I'm like, ""Why are you telling me?"""
"- They totally made out, like, for real."
"This was an interesting biological experiment, to have them making out in the back of that Yugo for a whole night."
- I think that's fake.
"- Yeah, they committed."
- Something came over them.
- Did they get pregnant that night?
Their characters did.
The characters got pregnant.
"Their characters did, they did."
Sick.
Was it awk...?
Did they...?
"Like, when you guys would cut in between would, then, they sit on opposite sides?"
"- No, we were all talking."
- They were chilling.
- Or were they still making out?
- They were friends before this.
"So it was more comfortable than it would've been, I think."
I don't think they were friends in italics.
They weren't friends afterwards.
No.
Bet she was pointy.
"It was fun, though."
I remember laughing a lot this night.
And we went really late this night.
"I think we went till, like, 6 or 7."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"So we throw some in a college fund, but the rest is fair game, right?"
"After taxes, after we pay Doug and after my management fee."
"Okay, fine, manager."
- Can you loan me a few grand?
- What for?
Clothes.
I had my cancer purge.
"But now I am in the public eye, and I have nothing to wear."
You want to take Isabelle's hard-earned dollars and blow them on glad rags for your star turn on Agrestic Access TV?
You bought a motorcycle and a ridiculous leather jacket.
All right.
Let me think about it.
No.
- Are you okay?
You look a little frazzled.
- I'm fine.
- Who kicks ass?
- I'm guessing you.
I totally kick ass!
"- What does ""kicking ass"" entail?"
"- A girlfriend, but that's not all."
Did a free cheese grater come with the girlfriend?
"Oh, stop it."
I'm gonna be the class speaker for graduation.
"- Sweetie, that's fantastic."
"- Way to go, little man!"
The whole lower school voted.
I'm gonna go start working on my speech.
"- Congratulations, honey."
- Thanks.
"- Oh, are we worried?"
Who owns the cuff link...
"And where did it go, eric?"
"We figure that out, we clear jesse, right?"
Or we sink him.
Okay.
Our forensic nurse found evidence
Of forcible sexual intercourse.
But there was no evidence of male contribution.
What does that mean?
It means that your attacker wore a condom.
None of this makes sense.
I know.
"This may be a little strange question to ask,"
"But, um..."
Do you think that tony could've had anything to do with it?
How can you even ask me that?
"Look, tony gets accused of things,"
But...
People don't know him like I do.
I'm just asking because
I was married to someone like him once.
"And, um, I know what that can do to your self-image."
It's not like that with tony and me.
"And I used to defend him, as well."
And I paid a pretty heavy price.
"If, um..."
"I mean, if you ever feel like you want to talk to someone,"
Here's my card.
"Okay, guys."
We're now in a cisco webex meeting.
Are we ready?
"Dave, is this line secure?"
That was my first job interview ever.
"I mean, I haven't gone anywhere with my life, and this is my second one."
All I have is a fake résumé filled with things that I've never even done.
"I mean, I've never even lived alone."
- How long did you live alone?
- Long enough.
Don't you think that's odd?
My entire life.
My aunts swept in the moment my dad died and you the moment I died.
You're thinking about living here.
Aren't you?
Yeah.
"Well, you hate corduroy and sleighbell slippers."
I'll stop walking in on you doing things you don't want me to know about.
Would never have happened if you wore your slippers.
- It'll be romantic.
- I'm confused.
More.
- More?
- More explanation.
How is it romantic?
You've got a job and now you're moving out?
But I didn't get a job.
I'm undercover Kitty.
"And I'm not moving out, I'm just moving next door."
It's French.
It's very first-class Parisian living.
His-and-her suites and coy midnight knocks on the door to share a lover's boudoir.
- You'll be knocking?
You can knock too.
This was not romantic for the Pie-Maker.
Yay.
I had to finish high school first.
Before I go into modelling.
Why not just do it anyway?
"Yes, but unless mum signs the contract Unique can't hire me."
She's been in such a mood since dad went off with her best friend.
Unique will want you anyway.
You're so beautiful.
You are so sweet.
You are the most beautiful girl I have ever met.
I've been in love with you since the first time I saw you.
"I love you, too."
- I'II go with you.
- Do you mean it?
You make me feel I've come home.
With you I'd be able to get my life sorted.
- You think?
- I know I do.
In New York we'd have our own place   and make our own dough.
And start a family when we were ready.
"No fucked-up parents, no fucked-up friends."
No dope.
- Just us.
- But if mum says no we can't go.
No.
But you are a clever girl.
You'll get her to change her mind.
So your mum says you can't be a model till after high school?
What a bummer!
We were going to come and see you in New York!
"I've just bought a new suitcase, too."
- You look a bit better now.
- Philip's arrived.
"When I saw you there, I just lost control."
Who are you?
!
I saw the magazine.
I'm really not that kind of person!
Just five minutes.
Let me talk to you?
"I can understand why you are worried because perverts might call you or write you letters,"
but I'm not like that.
So warm.
Just leave me alone.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not a porn model and never have been.
I'm not like that.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not!
Excuse me?
I have to lock the toilets shortly.
What do you think you are doing in my room?
I'm a manager of this apartment.
I can come in.
Can you please leave now?
There's been a lot of female underwear stolen from around here lately.
And?
"And what's more, the daughter of Mr Yamashita who lives across the road, says you often peek into her room."
Have you got any evidence?
I have a proper girlfriend.
Why would I be interested in that school girl?
Look at that.
You've made a stain on the wall.
Are you cleaning the room properly?
That was there when I moved in.
I'll reimburse you at first opportunity
"--Check it, it works --Lucy"
"Yeah, I'm a fool and a simple nurse and no match for your son."
But we'll manage to live without your charity
"Lucy, wait!"
"I'm just saying, if you are standing on principle, then you should return everything"
The bag?
We bought it with our own money.
The bag is ours!

"--Vasin speaking --Comrade Vasin, this is Kuziatin."
There's a person threatening me with a rifle here
--Where?
"--Here, building # 7"

These are my mother's earrings.
My most precious possession.
"She lost the second one on purpose, so as to hit where it hurts most"
"Don't worry, Pavel Ivanovich, everything will get resolved"
--You're gathering evidence on me?
--What evidence?
Don't.
"Don't, Galkina."
I can see right through all of you
"--Raya --Yes, Pavel Ivanovich"
--May I get Kostya for 15 minutes?
"--No, his carburator is not working --Got it"
"Zinaida, why are you wasting time in here?"
"Go, start digging!"
"--Dig where, Pavel Ivanovich?"
--Dig dirt on me.
Maybe you'll find some.
"Listen, Dalton, what do ya have on this?"
"I just got here, Judy."
I don't know...
Give me a break.
"Come on, Dalton..."
You're here.
"It's gotta mean one thing, the exterminator."
"The first one was johnathon minor, age 37, male Caucasian."
"Forty-two arrests for promoting prostitution, assault, rape, white slavery, corrupting the morals of minors."
Lately he specialized in young boys.
He was convicted twice and served a total of 18 months.
"Jesus, it looks like he got hit by napalm."
Most of that's from the burning mattress.
The fireman says it's like that every time someone falls asleep smoking.
Step this way...
I'll show you our next attraction.
Jesus.
Who was he?
He was a state senator from new Jersey.
"Hey, Dalton?"
"Yes, Steve?"
I have the autopsy on the third ghetto ghoul and the print out that you ordered.
I also have a telephone message from the CIA.
- The c.I.A?
- Yeah.
An agent shore called.
"He wants a briefing on the ""the exterminator"" case."
He says he cleared it with the commissioner.
"Here, he left his number."
"- Thanks, Steve."
- All right.

Thank you!
Give the bully an extra point.

I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy.
In this phallocentric society of ours--
"I don't know what ""phallocentric"" means, but no girls!"
So much for Plan B.
"That's it, boy."
You're our last hope.
Ohh.
"I just don't want to be here, Dad."
"Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."
"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea... but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns."
You'd just get all of his money someday.
This could provide for your entire future.
- [ Applause ]
- Congratulations.
"You've just graduated from the most expensive and, therefore, best school there is."
And your discovery of the cure for the common cold--
"Hello, Marge."
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Damn it!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
"He was... ""And what do I do about going to the bathroom""?"
(MR. WHlTTEMORE continues yelling)
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
"Hmm, Scott or Stiles?"
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
"My, these look comfortable."
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the Argents."
They haven't found us.
Yet!
So how about we forget the Kanima?
We can't!
But there was something about the way Gerard looked at it.
He wasn't afraid...
At all.
I don't know what he knows or what he's planning.
But I'm sure about one thing.
We have to find it first.
allison:
It's everything Lydia can translate.
"And trust me, she was very confused."
Let's talk later
Why don't you use this car?
"I will, of course I will"
When?
All in good time
"Namaste, sir. (Greeting) How are you Ramprasad?"
To that usual everyday question I usually lie everyday
You lie?
About being fine
You aren't fine
How could I?
I want to become a singer
I took up the liftman's job here in hope that you'd notice me someday
I sing extremely well.
Would you like to hear...?
Not now.
Only in-between floors
"That was folk, but I can change it to rap"
Let's talk later
I told you.
Try to understand.
I'll try to put in a word
"Mr Om, why did you lodge a police complaint?"
He's a poor guy
Because you are a traitor who pirates my music
So what's wrong?
It's only business.
If I make a few cents pirating...
I can spare a bit for you too.
"Fast-forward your life, Mr Om"
Don't you ever step into this office.
"Peace Mr Om, peace"
What's the problem?
- It's your sister.
- I just got off the phone with her.
Not Kitty.
- What do you mean you knew?
- I ran into her at Holly's house.
You didn't think it was worth mentioning?
- I didn't think you wanted to hear it.
- You were right.
"- Well, what was she like?"
- I don't know.
She...
She seemed fine.
How long is she staying?
"If this is just a visit, drop it."
It's not just a visit.
She dropped out of college and was living with a friend.
"When that didn't work out, she moved back home."
Indefinitely.
Sounds like Holly raised a real winner.
"Despite your opinion of Holly or Rebecca, the question remains, what are we going to do?"
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Not with everything that's been going on here.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- What I mean, Tommy, is do you think this business with Holly can go on if Mom finds out about Rebecca?"
This is exactly why I didn't want to say anything.
Holly is working here.
What if Nora runs into Rebecca?
What if your mother asks questions?
I say we tell her.
"I can't believe I'm hearing this from you, Saul."
"Oh, my God, this can't be happening."
[Crying] Next week was our anniversary.
I'm so sorry.
Are you married?
"No, I'm not, and I can't imagine what you're going through."
But everything you tell us can help us find the person who did this to Tony.
"I know this is hard, but I want you to try to remember that when you're talking to Agent Rossi."
Ahem.
"Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and relax."
I want to walk you through an exercise that's going to help you recall everything that happened last night.
"- What, like hypnosis?"
"- No, no, no."
Not at all.
"Now, just close your eyes and do the best that you can, okay?"
All right.
Think about last night.
"You and Tony, you went to the Halloween festival in Greektown."
What time was it?
"[Kiersten] Uh, around 9:30."
[Rossi] Crowded?
- [Muted chattering] - [Muted music]
Yeah.
Uh... there were drums and loud music.
"Uh, some people wore costumes."
Tony and I went to the festival every year.
We actually met there when we were in high school.
But this year we decided not to dress up.
- Boo!
- [Gasps]
What is it?
"A kid dressed in a mask jumped out, scared me."
Made Tony laugh.
"You killed leslie stoltz,"
And we can tie you to both.
You guys are pretty funny.
"I mean, you just crack me up."
You really think you're gonna pin a murder rap on me...
Based on a lambskin condom?
I don't think anybody here
"Mentioned a lambskin condom, genius."
That's knowledge only the killer would have.
Ah.
"You know, mr."
Enright told me
That she'd be a willing participant.
He told me that he was sick of the bitch.
"He gave her to me, as a bonus,"
Because we had a good year.
"You know, if she would've just relaxed and just..."
"Stayed with the program,"
Everything would've been just fine.
So that's when leslie tried to stop you.
She came barging in.
"And everything kind of went, uh..."
Everything kind of went haywire.
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
So you roofied anna
Because she wouldn't cooperate.
"I didn't roofie anybody, pint-size."
That was tony.
Do you want her?
You can have her.
Watch for him.
We will.
Thank you.
"I'd wish you luck, but what you'll need is a miracle."
He's more than three hours late.
We have to consider the possibility that he's been arrested.
You mustn't believe what he told you about me.
I don't believe it.
You're not a coward.
I had to keep my little girl safe.
It was just too dangerous to get involved.
Can you understand?
Your mother wouldn't listen.
She wanted to fight.
She was always...so passionate about what she believed in.
She didn't care about the risk.
You were proud of her.
I didn't want to lose her.
I didn't want you to grow up without a mother.
I tried so hard to change her mind and finally she changed mine.
She convinced me to go with her.
I said I would meet her...
by the river.
She was leading a raid against a Mokra supply center.
I said I would meet her... but I didn't...
I couldn't.
I was too afraid.
She was still waiting for me when they arrested her.
I could never tell you about this.
I knew you would hate me.
I couldn't bear that.
"Please, Ralkana, if you can ever forgive me..."
She pays his salary.
"She may let him strut around like boss man, but make no mistake... without his wife, David Harris is a big, fat zero."
Sorry.

I made dinner reservations for tonight.
Just the two of us.

"Earlier on I was told to go and break the world caravan speed record, which stands at 128mph."
And I failed.
So I had another go.
"With the window repaired to Aerospace standards, caravan glory is within Lee's grasp."
This time the cross winds have built up.
The caravan starts to fishtail.
Lee keeps his nerve and keeps his foot to the floor.
He hits 125.2mph. That looks great for a new record.
Just 5mph more.
There's plenty of runway left.
"But then, oil and smoke everywhere."
This doesn't look good.
"I'm not an engineer, but I'd say it was mullered."
"I think the piston's gone, or low on fuel,"
I'm not sure.
We can't have another go then?
Not with this car.
There you go.
"BBC Top Gear, the world's anti-caravan organisation defeated by a 20-year-old Abbey GT214."
It's pathetic.
I wonder if James May realises.
We don't tolerate failure on Top Gear.
It's not an option.
Maybe he doesn't know about the tank of piranhas.
He'll be in it if he doesn't get it right.
Right.
For a second I thought it might have been-- lt was like going out the jump door.
I was falling through space.
"Count, sucker, and pull the ring."
One thousand.
Two thousand.
"Then, lights."
The ground batteries had picked me up.
"I tried to side-slip the chute, but I couldn't."
"The lights got brighter, blinding me."
He's coming to.
"Go ahead and make with the music, f riend."
We love it.
"What's the letter say, f riend?"
"- Tell us about it, f riend."
"- Quiet, Krause."
I haven't yet solved the code.
Repeat the message in the letter.
I hadn't read it yet.
I just started to when you sapped me.
You place me in an extremely distastef ul position.
"By nature, I'm a gentleman."
Truly gentle.
Brutality has always revolted me as a weapon of the witless.
Like your f riend Baretto.
"Yes, and Krause here."
Although Krause's inclinations are more psychopathic than intelligent.
"He suffered an injury to his brain once, and ever since then.... lf you make me leave you to his quiet whims, I will never f orgive you."
Go take a flying jump f or yourself.
I'd f ormed a higher opinion of your ability to make decisions.
"The rest is to dance time, f riend."
"You like music, f riend?"
I like music.

Don't worry about the dead men in the bathtub.
It's not what it looks like.
And a long story to tell right now.
"Sometimes, for no particular reason,"
I think of you and smile.
"Seriously about that day, that... we drove out to the mall, for your birthday."
"Your mom had the flu, and she said to go on without her."
I remember you wandered off.
Got lost.
"And two hours later, we finally found each other."
We hugged...
You didn't wanna let go.
"Then we went for ice cream, and we talked..."
all the way home.
I think that was the happiest day I've had.
"I know I probably wasn't the best father in the world,"
but I tried the best I could.
Anyway...
I loved you all that I possibly can.
"Love, Dad."""
"""PS:"
"This isn't in my handwriting, because friend of mine wrote it out for me."""
"If you just leave that in the... apartment when you go, make sure to get to her."
Glad you girls came by.
I wouldn't have written that otherwise.
Daze...
"We gotta go now, Daze."
"We never even said his name, Vi."
Come on.
The bike is gone.
I am...
"I am a crystal clear well, please dri..."
I am a crystal clear well...
"-That's beauty, isn't it?"
"-Yes, but we would..."
Mother Nature will outlive us all.
-It's beautiful.
-But we are looking for...
"Yes, yes, a rest."
We have wonderful things here.
"Yes, but we are looking for..."
"It's something, isn't it?"
"Wow, it's like at our home."
"According to the dynamic plan of the landscape development, there should be a hundred years of untouched nature here later."
-Let's continue.
"-Yes, but..."
-Who are you actually looking for?
-A colleague.
"He got lost, We're worried about him."
In our forest nobody can get lost.
"Oh, yeah, in the past horrible things happened here."
"Rabbits ate grass, foxes ate rabbits and bears ate whatever crossed their mind."
But now thank God there is order here.
Look.
"I know a crystal clear well, where the forest is the deepest."
"Dark bracken grows there and in the surroundings, red heather."
"Thank you for your visit, sirs."
We are closing.
"Please, wait."
We've lost our friend here.
"But no one can get lost here, sirs."
-It belongs to the ministry of culture.
I'm the sheriff.
It's my business to know such things.
"Besides, this road only goes to one place."
"Now, you folks have a good time down there, you hear?"
- Thank you.
- This'll be cleared up in no time.
Great.
"Thanks, sheriff."
[Mike] Thanks a lot.
"Come on, Bills."
"He's back at it again, Perry."
That girl's cut the same way as those two last year.
"Earl, why don't you just haul this stuff to town and stop playing coroner?"
You know it's the same.
You ain't no closer to catching him now than you was then.
I know.
But your blabbing about it ain't going to do nothing except maybe scare folks around town half to death.
"Now, will you get that stuff out of there?"
I got something I got to do.
"You're too old for this job, Sheriff."
"[chattering, laughing]"
"Hey, Billy, how about it, huh?"
"Sure, Mom."
Hold it.
"Draw, sidewinder, or I'll kill you where you stand."
You got your iron there.
"You better pull it, or I'm going to blow you apart."
[cap pistol fires]
[laughs]
Got to watch out for these varmints.
"Thanks, Sheriff."
"Hey, that's great."
"I'm not sure that is how conversation happens, Marcus."
"No, I think that is how conversation happens."
That's right.
"My God, we've got 60 years of conversational experience between us I'm sure we can come up with something."
"Okay, then."
"- So, Fiona."
- You first.
"Will, why did your wife chuck you?"
Marcus!
"No, it's okay."
It's fine.
Good question.
"I'm quite comfortable talking about it, actually."
She chucked me because she was basically going through this whole:
"""I want to find out who I am"", malarkey and thing."
"Which is selfish, considering she had a kid and all that."
And did she find out who she was?
She was a figment of my twisted imagination.
That's who she was.
"Not really, no."
"I'm not sure anyone really does, do they?"
"We know who we are, don't we?"
That's right.
You're a depressive hippie and her weirdo son.
- What are we?
- We're us.
- And what are we not?
- Sheep!
And what does a sheep go?
This was going really well.
I wondered if we'd move into Will's place or someplace new.
What type of car is yours?
"Some celebration, or what?"
"It's my lucky day today, dear witch."
Let's hope it's not the last.
Now nothing can prevent her from making the right choice
Me!
Me!
Me...!
"That's fine, but your star is waning!"
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
I can talk and talk and nobody listens to me.
- Nobody believes me.
- Nor me.
But he brought the kerchief that I gave Henry.
How else would he have got it?
"I don't know yet, but we'll find out."
"It's not working, or something."
D'you know why?
Because you're a muddle-pate!
Let go or I'll hit you.
So how did she do it?
I don't know!
"So tell your girl-friend to show you and fast, or Elisa'll die of woe."
We want Elise to see Henry alive and stop dripping tears into the dough.
"Here you are, and make it quick."
"I went to her three times, you know what she said?"
Patience brings roses.
What would I do with roses?
Johann.
Looks nice.
"Is it noon already, Johann?"
"Not yet, but I can't wait."
"""And I'm also going to take a picture."""
And so I took this picture.
"And it was really hot, I tried to show this with..."
With this clumsy coloration.
Clumsy...
A picture can be personally pornographic while being also...
Publically decent.
Wouldn't you say so?
This is my father.
Where is this?
"Between Washington and New York, on the road."
This was one and a half years ago.
I took it because I realized it was...
The way I saw my father...
"Almost all of my childhood, as we travelled..."
"While driving, I always saw him from the back."
I saw his eyes only through the mirror.
I mostly saw his big hands on the wheel.
I trusted him.
Therefore it's a picture...
I mean...
"It's a family picture, a sentimental picture."
A childhood memory.
But it's a childhood memory that isn't in childhood pictures...
That's why I reproduced it.
I mean re-photographing a memory I had.
This isn't a family picture.
It's in Corsica.
It's a pseudo-sunset.
The sunset isn't real.
"The sun wasn't setting, it's here."
The light beams.
- You've always despised the Wu-tang.
And you're afraid that someday we'll overtake you.
You...
So you used your medicine to poison my master.
Nonsense!
You're scared that our power will surpass yours.
"Nonsense, don't flatter yourself."
Our Wu-tang...
Someone is trying to pin the blame on us.
Then where did His Highness get your medicine?
Where is your proof that the medicine is ours?
His Highness said so.
His Highness?
Then why did he lock you up with the crazy women?
Because I'm guilty of killing my master.
Your master threw himself onto your sword.
And now His Highness wants to learn your secrets.
I won't tell him!
Master told me before he died not to let the Tartars have the secrets of Wu-tang.
The Shaolin would never reveal our secrets either.
"You want to see the Wu-tang destroyed, hence your trickery."
Brother!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Mr. Chao!
Mr. Hong!
"Fung-wu, even if we were to learn your 8-divine sword, she already knows Chin Kang Fist."
Chin Kang Fist?
"Jun-kit, you taught her the Chin Kang Fist to help me, but you still haven't taught me."
You haven't learned it?
Did you teach him?
- I!
"Snap your fingers, you're dead."
We see that every day.
And those people never have time to untangle the knots.
They never have time to prepare themselves.
And so?
And so... the role of the Messengers is to give those people too a chance to be reconciled.
"- ""The Messengers?"""
- Yes.
I don't understand.
There are people out there who know in advance that someone is going to die.
Let's say they...
"""got the message."""
"And in those cases, their job is to help that person depart in peace... reconcile."
"- And you're one of these ""Messengers?"""
"- Yes, I am."
- You know who's going to die?
- Yes.
- You see it?
"- Yes, I see it."
And you help them depart in peace.
"Nathan, I realize it may be hard to believe..."
But Dennis didn't depart in peace.
- No.
- Why?
We don't always succeed.
Sometimes we get there too late.
No one has power over the hour of death.
No one.
I don't believe you.
"Have it your way, Nathan."
But these things can still exist whether you believe in them or not.
I know when someone's going to die...
"And then audition day 4:00 in the morning, I don't wanna get out of bed and go audition."
So my mum physically pulled me  out of bed.
Imagine if I'd stayed in bed that day.

"Cairo, city of the Lilies, a paradise on earth."
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
"Ah, oh no..."
"Cute, Ha!"
What an adorable creature.
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Well no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me!"
I knew the Germans had hired you Sallah.
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They have hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous!
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It is as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one....
"He's very clever, he's a French archaeologist."
What's he's name?
"They call him ""Bellosh""."
"Belloq, Belloq!"
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the well of souls.
"Well, they are not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy...
There is something that troubles me.
I don't know why he's missing but he's alive for sure.
The Commander told me to report his death... so I could save my family Prince Daeso was holding hostage.
My family is safe now.
I'll go to Jolbon sometime soon and serve the Commander.
I'll think of a way to get you out.
Please look after yourself.
Hope you had a nice trip.
Have a seat.
I received your letter but I still can't believe it.
Is Jumong really dead?
He is.
What a pity.
I wanted to kill him myself.
Once I take overJolbon...
I'll offer his head to the Emperor and win back his trust.
Do whatever you want.
Thanks.
"The ministers wanted to attack Jolbon without your help... but instead, I shared a secret."
"Since we're in it together, you must do something for me."
What is it?
Feed my soldiers during the entire war.
You can't expect us to feed them all.
"Prince Daeso killed Jumong, which weakened Jolbon."
It's your turn to do something.
The war will be short and you won't lose any men.
You have nothing to lose.
Very well.
We'll provide your provisions.
Governor.
What is it?
Mr. Hwang is here.
Who's Mr. Hwang?
...
What you need to take is not the people's judgement.
You should receive my judgement.
If you don't want to see any additional innocent sacrifices... don't block my way.
The meeting is in two hours.
"Oh, Chief Park..."
"Before that, an important guest is going to come looking for me."
"Without a bodysearch, just send him through to me."
"Yes, Mr. President."
"Also, I want to be alone for a while."
"But, we can't do that."
"Please, Chief Park."
Since I have some things to think over by myself.
I came here to see the President.
"Yes, he told me."
He's waitng inside.
Please enter.
So you came.
There's nothing for you to do any more.
This isn't a place you should be at.
I told you already
I'll block you with my own hands.
My revenge of 28 years...
you can't block it.
The type of revenge where I have to shoot my real dad.
Do you think I could live well afterwards?
Having the woman I love point a gun at me...
Did you think it wouldn't matter to me at all?
The dad who lost a leg for me.
Having to shoot him... how would that make me feel?
If you ever thought about me even once...
I wanted you to stop.
"- Sergeant, relax, okay?"
Your friends were in trouble;
you did what you had to do.
And now I got to do what I got to do.
"- Oh, no, a memorandum of admonishment?"
- Much worse--you're never gonna see the sun again.
Your families--they're gonna forget your faces.
You'll eat lunch at dinnertime and dinner at breakfast.
And you'll...
"Ah, what was I talking about?"
I totally lost my train.
- You were punishing us.
"- Yes, thank you."
Ah!
I'm transferring the whole squad to the night shift.
- Noooo!
- Yes.
-Notadoctor.
-Shh.

"The men, identified as Gregory Stickney and Larry Sherbert were arrested after a routine traffic stop revealed a cache of automatic weapons."
¶ Me and Fred gonna stick together ¶
'Cause I ain't a punk.
I'm a survivor.
"Hell, yeah."
That's why I can't smoke weed.
Weed is dangerous for somebody like me.
I already got too many voices in my head.
"Last time I smoked weed,"
I got so high
I was driving around looking for my car keys.
Just stopping people in my neighborhood.
"""Hey, yo, you seen my car keys, man?"""
"""No, for real."
"You seen my car keys?"""
"The dude that I asked, he was high too."
"He was like, ""Maybe you should keep driving around"""
"till you find them."""
"But I was so messed up, I was like,"
"""That's a good idea."
"I'm gonna keep driving."""
I can't do it.
"I'm messed up, man."
I'm messed up.
I went to the West Coast.
I did a show out in Oakland.
That's already a bad situation.
And I had something called a weed cookie.
"Yes, ""Ooh,"" is right."
I was high for two days straight.
"It was so bad, I was in my hotel room in the bathroom mirror having an in-depth conversation with myself about why I should keep my voice down."
"Because the walls were thin, and the next-door neighbors was gonna think I was crazy."
So I'm in my hotel room looking and sounding like Sméagol from Lord of the Rings.
America's premiere covert intelligence agency.
"But now that the war is over,"
My mission parameters these days are...
"Agent carter, cover the phones."
...Different.
That all changed when an old friend
Asked me to become a double agent.
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.
"A couple of weeks later, my inventions..."
They start turning up on the black market.
"As of this moment, howard stark is a fugitive from justice."
You're the only one that can clear my name.
Edwin jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.
I found the man who stole howard's inventions.
He was part of a bigger conspiracy.
Leviathan is coming.
Who is leviathan?
He didn't have time to tell me.
All he left behind was a symbol.
I must determine what this means
Before the ssr catches up to me Or my friends.
"Clearly, you don't know the rules of the house."
Is this not apartment 3-f?
Who are you?
Jimmy.
"My girlfriend, molly..."
she lives here.
I swear.
"5'5"", blonde, works at bonwit teller?"
Next one over.
I want her!
I want her in my life.
She is amazing.
She's not that amazing.
"Hey, help me analyze this."
"We've been out a couple times, but when I call her, she just texts me back."
"And short ones, like, ""Hey, Everett."""
"I mean, you know her really well."
Does that mean she's brushing me off?
"Hmm, what to say, what to say."
"If you ever get the opportunity to talk me up, you know, if the subject of Nobel Prizes comes up, maybe you could drop something about my nomination."
"Listen, I hear you, okay?"
But I don't think I should get involved in this.
"I really admire you, and it doesn't feel right..."
Have you ever separated twins in the womb?
No.
- Would you like to?
- Would I like to?
"I mean, it would be the opportunity of a lifetime."
Are you bribing me?
"12-hour surgery, right by my side."
"Afterwards, an interview with CNN's Sanjay Gupta."
Fine.
I'll do it.
But just so you know...
This is very wrong.
Great!
"Listen, I need you to help me compose a funny tweet to Riley."
"I want it to be clever, but not like I'm trying too hard."
Okay.
You're a horrible person.
You're a horrible person.
A man with your talents...
"My talent is gambling, Pop."
"Hoofing is all right, but there's no future in it."
I want to spread out.
"I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky."
"I know I'm going to miss you, Pop."
"Is he staying with us, Pop?"
"No, he's made up his mind to get married."
How do you like that?
Letting his marriage interfere with our career?
We shouldn't have played his hometown.
It was a bad move.
Bad for us and bad for him.
Local boy makes bad.
"- Father, has he come yet?"
"- No, and it's all very much as I expected."
"Hi, fellows."
- How do I look?
"- Marvelous, colossal, splendid."
Wait a minute.
You're not going like that.
Of course.
"Big church wedding, girl's family very social... whole town there."
"I guess it doesn't really matter, just a hick town."
What doesn't matter?
- Last year's trousers.
- Last year's trousers?
No cuffs.
- No cuffs?
- No cuffs.
Whoever heard of cuffs on these?
Are you serious?
"Thank you, Miss ""I'm in love with Dylan the spy."""
Wait.
"I'm confused, because the papers are right here."
They've been switched.
How do you know that?
They're in Russian.
Because I speak Russian.
"Sure, Jerry."
Ask me to say something.
"Okay, um..."
"Say, ""I've been lying to my sister about speaking Russian."""
[speaking Russian]
And you wonder why I don't trust you.
[dramatic music]
"I swear to God, sometimes I feel like I know you better than anyone else on the planet, and then there's other times that I--I feel like I don't even know you at all!"
I'm sorry--
Why would you keep something like that from me?
Because I wanted to protect you.
I've done some things I'm not especially proud of over the last five years.
Like what?
There was a time I was running from arms dealers in Tunisia.
"I didn't have a weapon, and they were chasing me, so I-- You know what?"
Stop.
"You're right, I don't want to hear this right now."
I'm sorry about the papers.
It's all right.
I'm just glad that you're okay.
[sighing] Great.
Angela.
Yes.
There are things you don't know about me.
"But seriously, there is no question you are the closest person to me on the planet."
What Solomon?
May be I'm a schizophrenic indeed but I can still tell a dream from reality.
If you weren't such a cynic you'd tell what is real and what is not.
If you had just a bit of faith you'd find the key to your problems.
What advice can I give you?
Turn to a doctor or to a prosecutor.
I feel unwell.
A medic!
I have nightmares.
"You're too busy, King."
You should take more rest and enjoy yourself more.
Change your wives more often.
You have the same advice for every cause.
I need a real cure.
There is one effective cure from your illness.
It is a sacrifice to Moloch.
Moloch is waiting for fresh blood.
I am not a pagan.
Moloch is the only one who can help you.
Try it!
"Yes, everything has been performed and signed."
Goodbye.
Whom did you call?
Nobody.
Why aren't you sleeping?
I see Solomon and police in my dreams.
What police?
What Solomon?
You need to have a good sleep.
I'm very tired.
I'll be upstairs.

Bull always wanted to be a detective.
And?
And now...
"I've finally become a detective, and my career is on track."
All I can think about now is work.
You sure?
I can't think straight anymore.
That was amazing.
I remember.
That cleaning lady...
Which case was it?
Here it is.
"""In 1998, a restaurant chef, Shigehiko Kashiwagi,"""
"""was struck by his employee, Yasuo Ikezawa, with a frying pan,"""
"""and had his proceeds stolen."""
"""Ikezawa fled the scene and remains missing."""
"""Kashiwagi's wife Kiriko is also a suspect and has disappeared as well."""
"""The two are wanted on robbery charges."""
Did the victim die?
"No, but his right side was paralyzed and he's confined to a wheelchair."
"Robbery, and aiding and abetting."
"If that's Kiriko Kashiwagi, Ikezawa must be with her."
"Wow, this is a huge breakthrough!"
I'm glad I remembered!
I was just going through expiring cases.
Expiring cases?
The statute of limitations expires...
I need my brother back.
I promise.
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
- Are you ready?
- One condition.
Just this then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Check this out!
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
- Where'd you get it?
- Kosovan Kate.
- Who's Kosovan Kate?
- She works with the Albanians.
"Here, you need to wear these - give the Old Bill a head start."
She's setting up her own people?
"Mate, I don't know how much you know about that part of the world but they treat women in a very degrading way."
Dealing with you must make a nice change.
"She noshed me off for free,"
- that's got to tell you something.
"- Yeah, it certainly does."
Lenny wants it done at the airfield.
Isn't there a lot of CCTV down there?
"Entrances, lobbies, exit to runways, manager's office."
"There's a blind spot in the toilets, though."
It's what everyone does before they get on a plane.
- But the front entrance is covered?
- I can get you in a different way.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked."
I've seen your picture in the paper from time to time.
They don't do you enough justice.
But I'm sure you've heard that more than once.
"Thank you, doctor."
And thank you for coming to the house.
"Oh, it's a pleasure, ma'am."
"I'd like you to meet my niece, Samantha Reece."
How do you do?
Pleasure.
Likewise.
Doctor?
"Oh, forgive me."
I was just studying that oil.
It's magnificent.
I think everything about this house is going to be magnificent.
Bad news?
What kind of bad news?
About my record company.
"Someone is buying up large blocks of stock in my company, and I don't like it."
When did all this begin?
Immediately after your party.
When you announced the pipeline deal.
The brokerage house that is handling the deal is located-
Don't tell me.
It's located in California.
"Los Angeles, to be exact."
Were you able to trace down who it was that was buying up that stock?
No.
No.
I haven't been able to find out anything.
It's Jason Colby.
- What do we have here?
- A broken statue.
- probably with that rock.
- By the young guy.
The lady saw him and went out with the gun.
He took it and...
Let's see what they say.
Why did he break the statue?
It can't be easy... seeing a statue of...
What?
"I don't know, just imagine..."
"You're in Africa, and you see a statue of a... a white guy in a Canadians sweater, fishing with a hockey stick, an Expos cap, a red belt, and a six-pack, while you're at it."
Why do you laugh?
That's exactly it.
"Take a hot head, he sees this and goes for it."
- You're right.
- obviously.
"obviously, the old lady was scared enough to get her gun."
What is it?
"I know you, you got an idea."
"If it had been a white guy, maybe she would've run out screaming, with a broom..."
"but here, she saw a black guy."
- She took a gun.
- She was scared of him.
"She saw him, got a gun, went out."
Jacques... did you ever wonder where it comes from... being uneasy around black people?
We're even scared of them.
Think about it.
"We copy Americans, and they don't like them much."
"I don't know, there must be a reason."
"It comes from, listen to this, from prehistoric times."
- It's true.
He put you right in front of me.
It's true that Chief Jung tricked me.
Because he told me that this was all to protect you.
"Then, it's all over now."
Since we know... that we all tricked each other.
Then does that mean it's really over?
Nothing comes after that?
- Hello.
- Hello!
Min Ki!
Sit down for a second.
"Hey, we're sorry..."
about beating you up that time.
Your grandma must have been very shocked...
"Hey, we're good guys."
"The shadow told us not to look for you, so we never did."
- Why are you here?
- Min Ki.
"You're a good source of information in this neighborhood, right?"
- You're close with the police too.
- Who said that?
Earlier today...
Was someone stabbed with a knife?
Why... do you ask?
There is this crazy kid...
who is going around bragging about it.
"He said he really used his skills, or something like that..."
- At Chung Gye Plan?
- Yes?
A man was killed.
They said it looked like a spiteful relationship...
Because he was stabbed so many times.
How's your gin?
- How was he?
He has a quality that can only be described as... chrome.
- And?
- He seems to wanna help me.
How can he help you?
He didn't say.
He's got great stories.
I'd love to hang out with him again.
Do we have plans?
- Do we have plans when?
- Whenever.
"Yes, Philip, I'd say sometime in the indeterminate future, we may have plans."
Good shoot today?
Can you just leave me alone?
I have to do this.
You're fucking with other people's money here.
"Money, money, money."
What about my integrity?
"You know, I can think of a few other important writers who also took a firm no-press position."
I just wanna know that you've thought it through thoroughly.
I haven't.
"It's a very impulsive decision, and I'm very pleased with myself for that."
"Philip, this is Josh Fawn."
"Josh, this is Philip, who's being a baby and an asshole."
Ciao.
"Yes, we've met before."
We've done some panels together.
Er...
I remember one of them.
"Phil, Josh is going on a promotional tour for his new book."
That's what responsible authors do.
You always were the one to show me how.
"Back then, I couldn't do the things that i can do now."
This thing is slowly take me apart.
"Grey would be the color, if i had a heart."
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
I can never have...
I can...
"Whoever threw that, fuck you Allright ?"
In this place it seems like such a same.
"Though it all looks different now,"
I know it's still the same.
Everywhere i look you're all i see.
Just a fading fucking reminder of... who i used to be.
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
I just want something...
I can never have...
I can never have...
I can never have...
"The trouble is, officially the problem doesn't exist."
-
- What does one do?
-
- One acquires a frat detector.
Something that burns on a low light.
A little yellow flame which turns green the moment the frats appear.
That's one.
"There, madam."
I'll open the door for you.
Thank you!
"Do call again for frat oil, won't you?"
"""Quaint""?"
"What does she mean, ""quaint""?"
I'll give her qu--quaint!
"This may be old--fashioned, but it's functional."
-
- This here is an annexe to my wallet.
-
- How did you sell them lamps?
"Don't worry about that, Granville."
That's too advanced for you.
-
"- Oh, my God, what's that?"
-
"- Oh, me horse collapsed."
I'm not surprised!
"Oh, dear."
Hardly the thing for a quiet evening out with the one you love.
-
- What?
It's not so loud.
What I saw was the night-show;
He's into the matinees now!
Let's apply some ointment...
Why did you go there anyway?
I went for a soft-drink and she didn't let me open the fridge.
The thief?
She must have had it herself.
She's stolen so much already.
Is that the truth?
Of course.
All right.
Papa will set it right!
"Aunt will set it right, you mean!"
Well...
Aunt will!
"Back to the table, Bharti."
"I've got an order for 50000 pairs of shoes from Italy, sir."
The manager has left his file.
Good.
But he said we can't execute the order.
Why not?
Slaying animals is tough... thanks to the animal protection groups.
They're protesting atrocities against animals in the Capital.
"You'll get a shock, Bharti."
Kaushalya... you switch it on.
"""Listen to the secret news from Bharti"""
"""There are many thefts taking place at No. 10, Juhu Scheme"""
"""Our reporter, Aunty, is investigating the robberies"""
"""We present a special report"""
You even steal!
That's not me!
"They're playing such dirty tricks on film stars, too!"
- I'll drive you home.
"- No, I'll get there myself."
"Okay, Mike."
- Tell me I'm a genius.
- You're a genius.
Come on.
You can do better than that.
Remember the mail we were sorting' through at Doug's place?
"Outdoor Life, Field  Stream."
Got me thinkin'.
Outdoor types always go back to the woods.
"I got ahold of a buddy at the Coast Guard who knows a guy in Park Service... and I said, ""Hey, there's a couple of good bottles of Patrón in it for you if""-"
"- Just tell me, Sam."
- State Parks has a record... of Doug's license plate at Mangrove Campground.
- Keys.
- Yeah.
"Now, look."
"I'd go there with you, but..."
Veronica sort of set up a mini vacation in Boca.
"- You know, one of those swimming' with the dolphins-"
- I'll take care of it.
I can't believe that you found them so quickly.
That's amazing.
My friend Sam may have bruised a couple federal statutes along the way... but nothin' a gift-wrapped bottle of tequila can't smooth over.
"- Well, you won't get in trouble?"
- We found him.
That's what's important.
I knew I could count on you.
- Is that loaded?
- Yeah.
"Well, you're not gonna bring that with you when you go getJasper, right?"
It'll be fine.
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Yeah.
That was great.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Nick, I really hope that you and Jeremy can get to know each other."
"I mean, after his dad left, he's never really had any kind of male influence in his life."
"Uh, but, you know, my father's probably a better choice for that kind of thing."
"No, I can tell."
Jeremy could really use a guy like you.
[Telephone rings]
Excuse me.
[Ring]
Liz is sick.
Cancer.
James mooney?
Yeah?
Jonathan goldsmith from the U. S. attorney's office.
I understand Joe nassurn paid you a visit.
That's right.
The police checked the address.
He's disappeared.
Ok.
"Joe nassurn has a lot of nieces and nephews, from Thailand, Cambodia, South America."
"They come through here loaded to the gills with dope, show up at his apartment long enough to crap it out or puke it up, and then he gives them a small amount of money and sends them back home on the next plane."
What do you want?
I want to know the name of the person who put your client on that plane in Thailand.
What will you give her for that?
I'll make sure they don't prosecute her back home.
Prosecute?
Thai juvenile justice is a lot different than ours.
Well you broadcast this alone.
Did you go crazy for her or what?
No.
I only wanted...
Sorry.
-Well not this at all.
-And why not?
"On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other, and they call it love."
Why don't you want to broadcast it?
Because they wouldn't understand it.
Love...
And why do you care?
We must deliver all available information.
"This information is available, but incommunicable."
-What do you suggest?
-I wouldn't like it if we caused panic on our planet.
I'll alter it a bit.
-What about this?
-Let me see.
"""On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other."" This is already better."
So broadcast it.
"But... ""attract each other""."
I'll omit this too.
-This is useless titillation.
-All right.
Broadcast it.
-And what about the gender?
-What about it?
"Wait, I have it!"
And this way it will be without consequences.
"""There are people on Earth."""
Right?
"Mrs. Quick, no!"
"Mrs. Quick, we've got to get you out of here."
"Now don't get too upset, okay?"
There's got to be a simple explanation.
"It's a bee sting, isn't it?"
Okay.
"I thought I heard buzzing earlier, but I attributed it to my tinnitus."
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
"The next dance is for our King and Queen nominees, and then it's time for everyone to vote."
"Mrs. Quick, don't panic, okay?"
We're going to rush you to the hospital.
The doctors are going to take care of you.
Everything will be fine.
I just need one minute.
Got him.
I knew he couldn't resist that thumbnail- sized Toblerone.
Thank goodness.
Zap him back so we can go home.
Right.
But first a little good-natured torture.
Hilda.
Where am I?
Um... we found you wandering out in the street.
I-I think you may have hit your head.
Do you feel all right?
Do you perhaps feel like you now understand what it's like to be the little guy in constant fear of unfeeling giants?
No.
I feel strong.
"In fact,"
I feel like I could withstand a nuclear holocaust.
I suppose this means you're going to go ahead and build your Everything Emporium now.
What?
That's...
"I'm flattered, I think."
"But I, uh..."
I can't do that.
"- No, no."
I understand.
- Nothing personal.
"No, I understand."
Just asking purely from a scientific approach.
What about after?
After what?
"The surgery, to see if anything still works."
"I'm gonna have to take a pass on that, too."
"Abby, you want this?"
GSW to the upper chest!
I gotta....
I better get back.
You want to hop on?
"I mean... are you coming to the, uh, for the..."
"Place a chest tube, call me if the initial output's over 500cc's."
How's Grace?
We moved her to one of our exam rooms so we're going to take you to her.
"Mrs. Anderson, I brought some mug books for you to look through."
"It all happened so fast,"
I'm not really sure what I remember seeing.
"Well, take a look."
Maybe a face will jog your memory.
I can't.
- Why don't you give us a few minutes?
- Sure.
I don't want to look at those books.
You might be able to identify the two men who drove you off the road.
What?
Oh!
it's to remind you of who you are.
I love it.
I am gonna put it up on my wall at brown
As soon as I get back from europe. oh!
Come with me.
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me
And going to a glorified state school.
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.
so I need to just stop moving
And contemplate the failure of my life.
Well When you're ready to start moving again
- You know I'll be here.
- Yes of course I do.
Humphrey Where's your mind?
I know it sounds crazy
But I actually-
- I kind of miss high school.
I miss blair waldorf and her daily ego demolitions
Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch
Even Chuck Bass who would get so close to talk.
Wow. you miss Chuck Bass.
Well not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass.
But yeah I uh I think it's safe to say
That the nostalgia's officially begun.
Apparently the upper east side feels the same way about you.
What's up Dan Vanessa?
Shouldn't you be getting the deputy mayorher coffee or something?
Well I think she'd rather I gave her something else.
- Yeah she made a pass at me. - god. is she hot?
Actually yeah she is.
"people come about 1 o'cIock, they're busy before that."
And before 4 pm nobody moves.
Robberies?
Everyone knows everyone here.
"With all these stairs, how could they everrob us?"
"It would take Tom Cruise from ""Mission:"
"impossible""."
You deny this area has a high crime rate?
You have no perception of reality!
We'II get a specialist to evaluate.
He was sent here orhe came by hisself?
"And anotherthing: when you speak, I don't understand you."
Speak to me in italian.
Were you sent here or did you come by yourself?
They sent me here to make you work.
Let's try to optimize the work.
I'm constipated.
You're pushing it.
Maria!
You could have come a little later!
"I can drive like a pro, too, taking curves with an ear on the ground."
finally Mr. VoIpe is here too.
Had to wash Mommy's dishes?
AII those courses...
Aren't you feeling well?
Why are you laughing?
Know what this man did?
"I invited him to my house, he locked himself in and hid his wallet, scared I'd steal it."
Don't force me to report you for discipline.
I'm shakin'.
You asked forit.
Didn't they teach you manners?
~ Have you finished?
The pies have come.
~ Not yet.
"Our mate Michael, the best-dressed Bolshevik in Newcastle."
We're all grateful to him for standing up for our right not to have our rubbish collected.
"It used to be I was talking rubbish, or he was talking rubbish, now the whole of Newcastle's talking rubbish"
~ because we can't get it collected.
"~ Hear, hear!"
~ Scott.
"~ Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"All right, seriously."
I love Peter Magath.
Just like I love Michael.
Lifelong friends.
I love that Peter's an original.
"I love that he had a vision of what he could be and he pursued it, even when we laughed."
I love that he has faith in others.
Maybe even in me.
God knows the world needs people like that.

I'll manage.
Don't worry about me.
"What about you, Alain?"
Leslie's in New York.
I won't go.
It's not for me.
I'm not ready.
"Later, maybe."
For now it's painting.
I still have a lot to learn.
It means going back to Kabul.
I know it'll be tough.
The Situationist International arrived at a point in History as the thought of a world collapsing.
It is now occurring before our eyes.
The new era is deeply revolutionary.
and it knows it.
"In all of society, no one can or will continue as before."
We will not submit to what is going on.
The demand of life has become a revolutionary program.
"It's Wolfblood, not werewolf."
We're not monsters.
Could someone live and act as a human but actually be a completely different species?
"On the full moon, do you change in the house?"
In here?
"No, we've got a secure room in the cellar."
The cellar?
"We call it the den, it has everything a wolf desires."
- What you doing?
- Checking Maddy's blood out.
- Do you have to lock me in?
[laughs]
"She skipped lunch, so."
Why don't we get you two a drink?
- Great.
- Yeah.
"Tawny, come, please."
"Good night, girls."
[kisses] Bye.
"I'll see you later, okay?"
"[Arnie] You know, I'm thinking of trying out for the Washington Generals."
"You know, the basketball team that's always losing to the Harlem Globetrotters?"
"Hey, why can't white people win once in a while, right?"
"I know what you're thinking, ""Arnie, you're too small."
"Arnie, you're pathetic at basketball."
"Arnie, you're too white."""
"No, those are the requirements to play for the Washington Generals."

"Now, you know that should be you up there, right?"
"[sighs] Goldie says all the greats take the stairs, not the fucking elevator."

Ten bucks a set.

That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.
Why don't they just come right out and tell us what's on their minds?
You're more advanced than a cockroach.
Have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?
How many people have seen it?
Ten.
"Twenty, maybe."
Listen to me.
Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.
Don't go back.
Stay away.
I can't talk about this anymore.
Mr. Leek.
There is a reason... that I ended up in Point Pleasant.
Something brought me there.
Whatever brought you there... brought you there to die.
You're just in time.
They're just about to light this Christmas tree.
They have been for the last two hours.
Isn't that Denise?
Is she okay?
She left Gordon.
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.
Where is he?
Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
I put you a cold plate on ice.
I'm gonna try to keep blanche out until the party breaks up...
-...because I don't know how she'II take it.
-Isn't that just dandy?
So you'd better give me some money.
"Hey, where is she now?"
She's soaking in a hot tub to quiet her nerves.
She's terribly upset.
Over what?
She's been through such an ordeal.
We lost belle Reve.
"What, the place in the country?"
"-well, how?"
-It had to be sacrificed or something.
"Honey, look."
"When she comes in, be sure and say something nice about her appearance."
"And, oh, don't mention the baby."
I haven't said anything yet.
I'm waiting until she gets in a quieter condition.
-Try to understand her and be nice to her.
-AII right.
She wasn't expecting to find us in such a place.
-AII right.
-I tried to gloss things over a little in my letters.
Admire her dress.
tell her she's looking wonderful.
It's important to blanche.
Her little weakness.
"Okay, honey, I get the idea, but...."
"Now, Iet's just skip back a little, the way you said the place was disposed of."
"Oh, yeah."
"well, how about a few more details on that subject?"
We should move on as quickly as we can.
"Tom, some of those cows in there are mine."
"What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?"
"We're just gonna water our horses, and we'll be moving on."
You like to buy some of them cows?
"I don't want no trouble, and like I say, we'll be moving on."
How about a little dance?
"Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble."
Dance.
I said dance.
"All right, Mr. Coble, why don't you just ride on out?"
Get that shooter and put it in this water trough.
Move!
You son of a bitch!
"I'll get you, you son of a bitch!"
"Tom, that little deal back there at Brown's Hole... ought to give you an idea of what we've been putting up with out here."
I ain't never seen roping like that.
Damn!
He sure don't rope like no Christian.
I wanna tell you.
Any means that you have to take... to eliminate this rustling problem... we're all behind you 100%.
- Whole organization?
- All of us.
"I'll just have to take your word on that, John."
You got it.
"Hey, Tom."
How you feeling?
We're plugging along.
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.
See the diff?
"Do you mean ""hyphen""?"
You are gay... because you are attracted to men.
That's it.
"You sleep with men... man, me."
- You sleep with me.
- Yeah.
"And that... is pretty gay, dude."
Exactly.
And people don't want to think about our sex life.
"Uh, I could show you a few fanfic forums..."
On the Internet.
But...
I play baseball on TV.
Okay?
"TV gays, they... they sing about acceptance."
"Or host daytime talk shows for housewives, or... acquire babies from exotic locations like China or wombs."
That is so not me.
"You've met me, right?"
Look...
You are such a great actor.
"I mean, you've played everything from an elf to a..."
Christmas elf.
"I mean, you could be a little less..."
"So the Alderaan of my uniqueness is to be blasted out of existence by the Death Star of ""less gay?"""
Is that right?
"I'm not sure, but... nerdy stuff like that, I mean, that is a good place to start."
"Maybe, maybe if you wore glasses then people would look at the smart, not the gay."
You want me to be Anderson Cooper.
"I mean, you know, if he were gay."
- All I'm asking is...
"- I know what you're asking, Brady."
She's a Wraith.
Maybe so.
"But she's different, I swear to you."
Let me guess.
A Wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
Please... lower your weapons and I'll explain it to you.
It's alright.
- Father.
- I won't let them hurt you.
I raised her as my own.
You live here?
Together?
"This was part of a mine, before the last culling."
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
Gee!
I wonder why.
The villagers told us there was a Wraith in the forest.
"It came here in a crashed ship, ten years ago."
Ten years ago?
Ellia was just a child.
Do you really think that she could be responsible for the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?
"So you know about that, then?"
I was there.
I helped kill the survivors.
"But... when I found a young female lying unconscious, some distance from the crash,"
I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.
I brought her here to this cave to hide her from the others.
"To this day, the people of the village don't know and you must promise not to tell them."
"Yeah, Molly's mom gave it to me."
"I know, it's a sweet deal."
"Sure, come on over."
"Ladder's around back, and I'll try and save you some pie."
Would you girls knock it off?
It's your squabbling that kept me a single mother all those years.
"Oh, don't play that card."
You've had more boyfriends than she's had.
Are you calling me a slut?
Are you calling me a slut?
"Just stay away from my fiancé, and yes, I am!"
I think all the idiots in the world should send us chocolates and liquor baskets.
I just want to touch things.
Why?
We immortalize their stupidity.
You guys stink worse than my diapers!

I created the Wall of Sound.
"A mean, old record producer who made one last hit."
"♪ Help, I've fallen, and I can't get up ♪"
They're singing our song.
[Crying and screaming]
You...think you'll be okay by yourself?
You were in a big accident today...
And your situation isn't normal either.
I'm sure you've been really shocked...
You really think you'll be okay to stay by yourself?
You seem to want to stay here by pretending to care for me...
But forget it.
Leave.
I'll make sure to get lots of sleep for you.
All he has is frozen food and carbonated drinks.
I wonder if he only eats food like this?
His build is really large.
Too big!
I don't have to go to school.
Yes...!
Oops.
I see she brought everything over for her precious body.
'Please treat it preciously'.
I won't eat it!
"You're in there, right?"
Right?
Are you really cold?
Your hand is very warm!
It must be because I was holding the coffee with that hand.
They say the temperature of the hand is the same as the temperature of the heart.
I think your hand is this warm because your heart is so warm!
I bet you're the only one who has hands this warm.
So warm.
The person who has hands this warm in this world...
There was just one person.
And here they are.
Da Ran just came home.
"If he gets out of line again, I will be back."
Keep it!
Ahem.
"Excuse me, Mr. Reed."
Mrs. Laws is waiting for you.
You wanted to see me?
"Well, you've done it this time, Mr. Reed."
What did I do?
Look.
"Louis, what happened to you?"
You.
You're the one filling his head up with all this junk.
"We have taught this boy to stand up for himself... to fight the bullies, but he doesn't listen to us."
"He said, ""Mr. Reed teaches us differently."
"""Mr. Reed said that we should run from the bullies..."""
"and that Mr. Reed encourages the smaller kids... to practice running, hiding, and eating their lunch quickly!"
"I didn't say ""quickly."" I said ""rapidly."""
- I was trying to help.
"- Well, thanks to your help... every bully at this school is beating him up."
A younger girl did this to him!
"Mr. Reed, have you ever stood up to anybody?"
"Or better yet, have you ever had your butt..."
"Mrs. Williams, I'll handle it from here."
"Mr. Reed, may I remind you... that you are just a substitute teacher?"
No more of this.
I was simply talking about how life is.
I don't care.
Teach only from the books and not your philosophy on life.
That's all for now.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
No.
"I'm sorry, he didn't."
May I ask... do you not speak?
He asked me not to.
"Well, that's something you should work on, along with what was going on in my, uh, waiting room."
I can refer you to somebody.
Can she access the applications?
No.
I want agents put on the people with access to the applications and reach out to anyone who remotely meets the killer's criteria.
[Cellphone beeps]
What?
I've never seen you work the field before.
It looks good on you.
We won't be able to get the admission files now.
So maybe we stop.
Maybe it's over.
That's what's wrong with you.
You don't push hard enough.
You're lucky I am in your life.
Why you?
Why bring you back?
And not someone worthwhile?
I asked that question myself.
Something about my DNA makes the process just...
Go.
And you just signed up for it.
"No, I didn't."
They just did it.
"So, it's been nearly two years."
Why are we here?
Your son Kevin was the first... only after we found the others...
We knew it was homicide.
The size of an asteroid?
The power requirements would be staggering.
My people used it
To transportandromeda to a safe place.
You transported the wholeandromeda?
To a safe place?
What safe place?
Why?
I don't know.
I was sent to make contact with you.
"Oh, well, you certainly did that."
"In fact,"
"You made a lot more contact than i'm happy with,"
But there's no reason to go into it.
I think we all know
Where we stand on that.
"All right, you got me."
I'd like to see your... tesseract generator.
We'll take my loving bucket of bolts.
But i'm not driving.
What is it
"With crazy people and asteroids, anyway?"
The plan was
To draw the andromedainto range
And send her through a tesseract.
That's all i know.
"Yeah, well, theandromeda"
"Is not responding to my halls,"
"So either your plan worked,"
Or you're lying to us.
"In which case,"
There's only one way to find out.

You're under age!
No!

"Yeah, I'm a teacher so I can't watch students drink with my eyes open!"

I can go by myself.

"Well-connected-- journalism, treasurer for the friends of national Spain."
No criminal convictions?
No.
None that I could find.
What do you make of him?
I'm not sure.
"I'd say a man has to be quite brave to hold the opinions he does, especially at a time like this."
You admire him?
I don't think he's a fool.
"I mean, you read the medical report of..."
"Isaac wolf, the man who got beaten up?"
"I don't think you can blame Spencer for that, sir."
He knew nothing about it.
How do you know?
He told me...
And I believe him.
Margaret Ellis' will-- he had the most to gain from it.
"I still think that Spencer was the likely target, sir."
All right.

You scared the shit out of me.
You should look into that.
I brought you something to eat.
Way to go Zeke!
Now get out of the way and let me show you how it's really done.
I want to see Acho finally get it right.
"No, that's cool."
Don't be chicken-shit.
"Look at Pyro, he did it and he's a little kid."
You know what they say...

"What they say, if you eat dirt after falling of 6 meters..."

You can do it.
"We are all about trust, right Bro?"
"That a boy, show these Barneys how to catch some air."
Shit!
What are you doing?
Center the tire and the ramp does the work for you...
I told you to be one with the bike.
I know how to do it.
"Damm, where are you head theses days boy?"
What you got on your mind?
"Lead, follow or get out of the way."
You alright?
He's out.
- Yeah.
Don't you think?
"I mean, honestly, are you ever angry at him?"
No.
Really?
You're not angry at him?
"Well, I did get angry sometimes, but not... but just..."
I just felt...
I don't know.
"Kind of a tragedy that he didn't work it out, isn't it?"
"You know, it seems almost too much he was on the way home to maybe come live with us."
- Yes.
- Who knows?
- You still believe that?
- I do believe it.
Do you think he crossed off his passport on his way home to...
to show something?
"Yes, to indicate... yes."
Why else would he have done it?
Why else would he have done that?
Can you give me an explanation?
It's a good myth to have.
I don't think it's a myth.
I don't think it's a myth at all.
"I mean, I have very strong conviction about that, because I know what... what Lou said to me, you know, when we... when we parted."
What did he say?
He said he would do it.
"I mean, he said..."
I said that I can't...
"I can't bear it any longer, and you have to... you have to do something, and you have to live with us."
And he said he would.
- Really?
I see you've drawn a tree.
Do you think you're a tree?
"Heh, heh."
- At least I didn't draw a knife.
- What knife?
This knife.
"Oh, you're gonna get your meds upped for that."
You should not be drawing knives in art therapy.
- All right.
"- Ha, ha."
Don't.
Oh!
It's almost like an outside force is guiding me.
Stop it.
Nice work.
- You ruined mine.
- Sorry.
"When my little sister was 8, her appendix burst and she was in the hospital for like a week."
And she was scared of everything.
"The doctors, the needles, the, um, weird plastic kidney-shaped thing that she had to pee in."
Um...
So I made my mom take me to the hospital every day.
And I sat by her bed and I painted her nails and we made fun of the nurses together and...
"I didn't really think I was doing anything that spectacular, you know, because I thought of course I would do that."
She would do the same thing for me.
"But the thing is, um, she hasn't come here to visit me."
Not even once.
I'm glad they don't come.
I don't want anyone to see me in here.
"It just makes me sad, that's all."
"Before we end, I just wanted to mention that this is Bruce's last session."
He'll be leaving tomorrow.
But we had permission
Nobody could permit to have a drinking binge in an unfinished building.
"You are all adults here, you should..."
I knew this would happen.
Shouldn't have lied to people!
"Attention, I am taking it now!"

Only hurry up.

Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Pavel, I know all your principles, but could you get him into a co-op garage?"
"He's a worthy person, and it's nothing so bad really..."
--With pleasure --Really?
Yes.

"Thank you, Nicky."
"Dragan, how would you describe your life?"
Well...
"Everything happens differently, you know."
Nothing was what I wanted it to be.
You are perhaps the only one who knows that is true.
But now I just try...
To feel felt pain.
And it would be enough for me now.
Describe the pain.
"Do not ask me this, please."
Remember picker?
Of course I remember it.
I and you have lived the whole war.
Do you remember when you called me and you told me not to get out?
Why do you ask me if I remember it?
- Why did not you want it to go out?
What do you think I did not do?
"It would launch my career, but I heard you."
And I did not quit it.
You...
You just...
Did something that no one else would have done.
And  I...
I can not believe you did it.
"All right, I admit it."
"I tried to convince Dragan to get him out, but I did not succeed."
My chosen movie shooter will never see the light.
But the king had listened carefully to every word.
You do not like it?
- Yes I like it.
"That's just the beginning, try again."
"I drive by your place, I call and hang up."
I'm turning into...
Me.
Yeah.
"A wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl he will make it happen, no matter what."
That's true.
But when I was hurling my body onto yours you did not seem to want to make it happen.
"Yeah, all right."
Here's the thing about that:
You were right.
I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from all these women and having the power that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually fell for one of them.
I didn't know.
"Look, I just went out with your friend Bill and..."
Yeah.
He might be just exactly what I need.
No drama.
"He calls, he does what he says."
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.
And that same wise person told me that I am the rule.
That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change.
That I have to stop thinking that...
I'm the exception.
You are my exception.

"Hi, it's Mary at the Blade."
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.
Really?
You don't think the muscle T is too much?
I think the shirt you're wearing now is probably more you.
"What, you here?"
Ok.
"Maybe there was some truth in there, but..."
You know what?
"You're seeing who I am, who I really am, after all these years, and that's a good thing."
It's really important for me not to know anything about you.
I don't wanna know that you're an alcoholic or that you killed a guy and had sex with my mother.
You're my therapist.
I need to think of you as superman.
"I can't think of you as drinking and crying and screwing and killing and then ask you to help me with my fear of spiders, you know?"
Yes.
I'm erasing the events of last night from my mind.
You should too.
"- Oh, they're barely there."
- Good.
So last night never happened.
"Hey, boys!"
Now you know my day job.
What can I get yous?
No booze for you.
You have a problem.
I'm not gonna be your enabler.

Oh!
"Hey, hi!"
I got here as fast as I could.
"I drove like a teenager on coke, but I'm here for you, just like you are for me."
- Great.
How did you know?
- How did I know?
That we were stranded and where we are.
- Dr. storper.
"- Well, you called me, or some woman named Shasta called me and handed you the phone."
- Me!
Oh.
"Okay, I'm heading out there."
"If you need anything, if there's a crisis, if you have a question-"
"Jack, you're 1 1 feet away."
Don't worry.
I can handle these animals.

I just always had this real need to please people with food.
"I just think it's, like, uh, a gift that I have, as God made me."
"Hey, uh, if your father calls... tell him that I'm working the floor like he asked, okay?"
"-Yeah, you're really taking one for the team."
"-Actually, I'm shooting for two."
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
"No, I'm not."
This table needs a complimentary everything.
I'm well--known round here for it.
I'm famous in the chest.
"Don't half turn the chicks on, right?"
The only snag is if the waistband on your jeans is too tight.
That's what jeans are all about.
"If your jeans aren't tight enough, you might as well be dead, right?"
Can you repeat all that?
I couldn't hear you for the sounds.
"I was just saying, like, you know, I dig all your gear."
-
- You got any blancmange?
-
"- Yeah, I got two of their LPs."
Life's full of excitement when you're engaged!
Where are you going with that?
"The magnificent metal digit is going on the pavement, p--pointing at the shop."
It's the opening salvo in me new advertising c--campaign.
"You spare no expense, do you?"
It's your old ice cream sign!
That's just for openers.
The hard sell comes later.
-
- It's all peeling and rusty.
-
"- Oh, yes."
How is your mother this morning?
-
- She's wandering.
-
"- Oh, is she?"
Perhaps we can get her to wander off completely!
-
How long have you been working on these?
About a year.
Can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
I can... but I'm not going to.
But you just said they were good.
"So is ""The Hulk,"" but I don't have to like it."
"Your drawings are technically fine, but it just shows that you can copy well, and they've got no soul."
"I've known you for two years, we've had a hundred conversations-- about comics."
"You are a passionate dude with deep ideas, so I'm looking at this and thinking, ""ls this all you've got to say?"""
Aliens from Jupiter want to enslave the women of the Earth?
Yep!
You dumb motheftucker.
"Cans go in the blue, green is for paper."
- What's going on?
- I ain't touching those hands.
How did it go this morning?
"David totally dug my shit, man."
He might send something over to Gotham Comics.
That's excellent.
Check it out.
It's the Brunswick Monster.
- How much did you pay for that?
- What does it matter?
I predict this ball is gonna add 15 points to my game.
Friend:
Now all I got to do is get to Vegas.
Vegas?
"The Amateur World Classic is next month, it costs 3,000 to enter, but get this... the purse is a hundred grand."
"I don't know, Mick..."
three grand?
Aw...
"Gracias, mi amor."
I'm having a baby with a woman that I'm very much in love with.
"You told me that you were confused, that you wanted to leave her."
I know.
"I was confused, Kim."
I was so confused.
And it was wrong of me to get you tangled up in that.
How could you not tell me that you were having a baby?
Because I'm an asshole.
I did a bad thing.
I have no excuse.
"There nothing I can say to you other than that I'm so sorry, and it's really not about you at all."
Why do people always say that?
"How can it not be about me if you can sleep with me one minute, and then walk out on me the next?"
"I'm sorry, Kim."
I gotta go.
- All right.
- All right.
"No, you'll be fine."
You are the suckiest driver.
No way.
I'm not.
"Well, how many miles do you think you guys will be making fun of me for?"
I'd say pretty much the whole entire way.
I'm not going to make fun of you.
I think there's a bus stop...
- Is there a bus down there?
"Oh, good."
- It's four miles.
"Because my friends aren't giving me a ride home, so..."
I think it's going to rain.
"Sorry I'm not coming, guys."
"- No, don't apologize."
"Oh, Becky is scaring me."
"For the love of god, go for it!"
You idiot!
Watch where you're putting your oversized scalextric.
Should be looking where you're going.
And you should be in ***

"Hi, I'm Jenny pope."
I'm here to interview for the practice manager's post.
"If you'd just like to take a seat, Mary will see you at 9:05."
"Hello, I'm Mary."
I'll be looking after you this morning.
If you'd just like to follow me I'll take you to meet the doctor.
Are there many other candidates?
"Oh, just one."
"Doctor, this is Jenny Pope, is it?"
"Jenny, meet Dr. Blair."
Hello.
"We've already met, actually."
"Oh, yeah, the *** lady"
"Yeah, that was very much my sense of humor on display."
***
It's just silly.
As you come to learn I'm pretty quick on the draw when it comes to banter.
"I'm a social beast- who knows where to draw the line, hard working, but very pleasant."
Right.
Take a seat.
"This is Karen from the PCT, she is going to be doing... *** testing and role plays."
"Yeah, thanks, Mary."
"And there will be an interview, and then at the end of the day"
I'll decide who's going to be taking over from the late great Valery.
"Well, if you're ready, doctor, I think we should begin."
.. will go bore as your bolts will become loose.
To know your father's counter schemes after Vasundhara Devi caught him red handed..
.. we replaced Ram G with our Master.
They are planning to kill you.
"- Master, do as I say."
"Master, this is body bullet's remote."
You should handle this.
Okay
Our Master gave you the gun which had dummy bullets.
We showed you a dummy death via cinema technique.
I am a fighter.
There will be no interval until I finish the mission I take up.
Just climax.
"If it missed there, it won't miss here."
Karthi..
Come on!
Jump!
Come on!
Keep going!
Karthi..
Karthi.. Tell me Mr. Ratnam!
"Sorry sir, the entire family has died in the accident."
What?
They collected the bodies on the highway and sent it by cargo sir.
They will handover if you come and sign sir.
I am coming immediately Mr. Ratnam.
"Hey Macha, you had seen a business man in me till now."
Now you will see the actor in me.
Very agonizing thing has happened sir.
Sir..
Vasu..
Business man in you has got the Padmasri.
And how was your breakfast this morning?
It went really well.
I can tell that's 100% not true.
"Okay, are you two, like, legit fighting?"
"No, it's fine."
It's just...
"Audrey has some unflattering opinions about my dad, that's all."
"No, they're memories, not opinions."
"And, sometimes, maybe people are going through big things that have absolutely nothing to do with you, Emma."
Big shocker!
"At the most, it's identity theft."
"And, even then, what's the real harm?"
"I'm sorry, Mag."
I-I didn't mean to sound dismissive.
It's just... you've seen the reports of all the hijinks since your unfortunate run-in with Ms. Shaw.
That's a pretty damning understatement.
"- Look, we all grew up here."
- And you left.
You both left.
My family left because of that whole Brandon James mess.
"Miguel, with our particular history,"
I think you should investigate.
(SIGHS)
You know what?
You're right.
Just to be safe.
I know a guy in the bureau back in Phoenix.
He can try to trace the activity.
Take a while.
"But, for now, do not tell Emma."
Okay?
We don't need the whole student body talking.
I'm unholdable.
It was just too scary.
"Like you're a Bruce Willis movie, Unholdable."
This is...
I think it's terrific.
Try and get as close to my hands as you can without touching them.
- It's so good.
- But this is my favorite.
- This is one of my favorite moments.
- We did a lot of versions of this.
- What's that?
What?
- This.
Look at us go.
I don't remember any of this.
It's one of the few times in the movie where you were improvising.
- And I...
"- Yeah, I guess so."
I don't think you know where it's going.
"Usually, when you improvise, you have a sense of where you're gonna land."
Yeah.
"But in this case you didn't, and I think that the way you were feeling that really makes that special."
"It makes it what it is, because it's so in the moment."
And it's really cute.
I'm not gonna lie.
Baruchel.
Slow down the sexy bus.
It was really fun.
It was good having Jay around.
I would like to...
I would like to also tell people that Jay didn't smoke cigarettes this day and put candy in his mouth because I'm not a smoker.
And it was very sweet of him.
It's...
It...
Okay.
If I rigged the lottery... lf...
If...
"If I'm so smart, why would I let this hammerhead win half the money?"
"Well, you didn't want to."
You didn't plan on it.
But you got fired.
"Well, because of her."
"Hey, there were cables on the floor."
Somebody could have gotten killed.
They were duct taped down.
Nobody was tripping on it.
Okay.
Okay.
I told you about her.
Can we focus here?
Your plan was already in motion.
"You'd put the gizmo in the microphone, but getting fired ruined everything."
They escorted you out of the studio.
They took your security pass and you couldn't get back in.
"You had a problem, Billy."
A real dilemma.
Is that right?
Yeah.
You knew the six numbers that were going to hit.
But then what?
You were locked out of the building.
You couldn't just turn the magnet off.
You knew the same numbers were going to keep coming up night after night.
"After four or five times, somebody would have noticed."
"Stop joking about this, please."
"For most people, Fantômas is nothing but make-believe."
Nobody was able to put a name on the man behind the mask.
I have the feeling you forget the death of
Juve in his last battle against Fantômas.
It is true that our famous Police officer was horribly killed.
Buried beneath Lady Beltham's hotel.
Yes.
A dirty death...
but it will perhaps have been useful.
Useful?
How?
Because it proves the existence Fantômas.
Because it forced him to disappear.
"Curiously, it is in dying that Juve has kept Fantômas from doing harm."
So what do we do with Baroness de Vibray?
"Could we not suggest that Dollon was heir to his will, or something like that?"
"Hello, yes?"
Yes.
"It's for you, Fandor."
Thank you.
Yes?
Jacques Dollon just hung himself in his cell.
Thank you for calling So the murderer hanged himself?
"My little Fandor, the murderer is innocent."
"What are you talking about, Arsène?"
We just brought a letter with the name of the Baroness de Vibray on the back.
I read it discretly before bringing it to the procurator.
I copied it.
"""Mr Procurator."
The Barbey and Nanteuil bankers made it clear that I'm completely ruined.
I have no family.
Your dad is a police officer...
You shouldn't say that.
Then why are you running away?
- Come here.
- Let go of me.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry that I'm a day late.
This... is that watch that high school students like these days.
Tell me now.
Did you kill someone or not?
I didn't.
Soo Bin...
"Your father is... is trying to catch a really bad guy, and that's why he's hiding right now."
"If you were five years younger, that's how I would have explained it."
Um...
I still don't know how I should explain it.
But you'll still...
"believe in me, won't you?"
I told you... that I want to make this a better world for you.
Then are you saying that I was the one who was wrong?
I'm not saying that.
"I'm telling you to believe in me, Soo Bin."
I'm asking you to believe in me.
We're family.
We know each other better than anybody knows anybody.
You shouldn't have run away if you did nothing wrong!
Okay.
That was... my mistake.
"Well, I have to go now."
There were times when...
I... didn't believe in you.
So I'm reflecting on that.
"No, sorry."
"I was looking for, what are the ovaries?"
"Oh, the o..."
"Yeah, I always mix those two up."
Try not to.
Your future will be brighter.
Can you tell us anything about ovulation or how pregnancy occurs?
"Well, the man's got the sperm, and the woman's got the egg."
"Now, once a month, an egg slides down the Philippine tube towards the uterus."
"The first sperm to reach the egg wins, it gets a medal, it's born, you name him Cory, you push him out the door, and nothing makes sense for the rest of his life."
Congratulations.
You seem to have a thorough understanding of the life cycle.
"- Hey, I live it."
- Any questions?
Yes?
How do you get a girl to say hi?
Michael and Lisa Marie?
- Looks like it.
- Since when?
- Just now.
That was it.
"- What, that?"
- Yeah.
You saw it happen.
- I can't believe it.
"I saw it happen, and I still don't know how it happens."
"Stop obsessing, man."
You're gonna pop a lobe.
You're right.
"I should relax, 'cause this coupling thing, it's just a phase."
"I mean, how long can it last..."
a few weeks?
- Won't you reconsider?
"- You were a hopeless doctor, but you're a brilliant coward."
The rats are deserting the sinking ship.
But no great loss - he was hardly a scientific genius.
"I'll stay with you, even if all hell breaks loose."
You're guaranteed to go to heaven.
- If there were more people like you...
- Stop it.
"I really don't know if I've pleased the Lord that much, but He might have turned a blind eye now and then."
Padre Miguel.
"Look, they're here."
Let's just hope that they won't harm the ones who've stayed.
"Padre Miguel, that's the guerrilleros, isn't it?"
- How could we forget about you?
- Help me.
- They mustn't find out who you are.
- We should take off his uniform.
Up here.
We've got injured people out there.
"We need beds, a nurse, and most of all antibiotics."
"I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't here."
He was scared.
He fled.
- And we've only got two vacant beds.
- I need three beds.
Jaime!
- You can't do this.
- This man is injured.
Show some sympathy.
- He's in the militia.
- How cruel!
- Get him out.
"- um, i know, but..."
i kind of have to.
thi-- this is like the whole check.
- yeah.
"let me take -  no. no, uncle bob."
i... [sighs] i need to take care of us.
- all right.
you endorse it right here and sign it right to the dwp.
"- well, i guess that's why the power didn't get turned off last month."
[chuckles weakly] hey.
"- i'm proud of you, champ."
you're becoming quite the little man.
"uh, i-i mean big man."
"- thanks, uncle bob."
- all right.
let's get out of here.
it's christmas eve.
- so that how the electric bill was paid last month.
"- cindy, where did you come from?"
- i was just here.
i was shopping around.
so why'd you -- uh... why'd you get a job?
[chuckles]
"- i mean, the bills had to get paid somehow."
"- well, you shouldn't have to worry about that."
"- well, what's good having a big-screen tv if you can't watch it?"
- come here. [sighs] all right.
"i'm -- uh, i have to go now, so [sighs]"
- phew.
i thought for a second that maybe you actually cared about somebody other than yourself.
"- where are you going, mama?"
- [scoffs] i made a promise to someone that i-i want to keep.
See you Saturday.
- Did you find out anything?
"- Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
The medical officer and Alicia's father say I'm a psychopath.
"Yeah, a psychopath."
"They say it's good for the trial, but I don't give a shit about that."
I need to see Alicia and find out how it all ended.
"If this goes on, I'm capable of doing anything."
They say I'm a psychopath?
"Well, I'll behave like one."
"Don't say that, please!"
And get me another lawyer.
The one I've got practically throws up on me when he looks at me.
OK.
I'll tell the concierge to give you my keys.
Rent it out and that'll pay the lawyer.
"I'll rent it, because mine has been rented out too."
Great.
I like that you're my tenant.
"I've been thinking a lot about you, especially at night."
Why at night?
Okay.
"Oh, Dad's here."
I gotta go.
"I love you, Mommy."
[Karen] I love you too.
- Hey.
- You set to go?
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.
"You can call the Romans a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of them."
"Okay, well, not really stupid, but, all right, they built roads, and they had a million armies, but all they did was enslave and conquer people."
- What about their system of law?
"- Oh, great."
"They introduced law to barbarians, but how did the barbarians feel about that?"
"All their art was copied from the Greeks, all their philosophies were stolen from the Greeks."
The gods were stolen from the Greeks.
They just gave them different names.
Think of one thing that they did that was original.
They didn't even invent Christianity.
"If I was a Roman, I would be so ashamed of myself, I couldn't show my face in the Coliseum."
[Lily] Pasta's ready!
"Eli, you have to save me from Dad!"
I'll set the table.
Don't worry.
"Thank you, Jessie."
"We're gonna get through this, whatever happens."
"Rick, whatever happens."
Did she actually cook for us?
That's pretty cool.
- [knock on door] - l got it.
Cook County Sheriff's Department.
We have a warrant to search.
I have a family that needs me!
"When's the last time you did something, anything, without thinking about how your family might react?"
- I think Griff is in trouble.
"- I told you, he's using!"
Tell me you think our brother is not on drugs.
- Natasha!
"- I tried calling, silly, for a month."
"It wasn't that whole night with the coke thing, was it?"
- You and me had a good thing.
- I was used!
Now I need you!
"Allen, I fired him."
He's done.
Let's talk.
"Jesus, she's a cop."
What the hell happened?
Fell through the floor at an abandoned factory chasing some jackass.
- How's her airway?
"- Looks clear, but her sats are low, 93 percent."
I'm taking her up to 10 litres of O2...
let's push ***.
She's tachypneic but breaths are shallow.
Where are those chest tubes?
- Laryngoscope?
"- Kelly clamp, now."
Got no radial femoral pulse by palpation.
- It's already at the carotid.
- That's not a good sign.
- How is she?
- Right tube... is placed.
- You need to find her husband.
"- I'll call dispatch, let them know."
I do not take orders from lady straw bosses.
Hey hey.
Was that Miss Krail?
Is she back in her office?
Pining for you.
Pining for you!
- Miss Krail?
- Yes.
"Everything's here all ready for you, Mr. Sandover."
- These are the letters for you to carry.
- Thank you.
- Lita?
- Yes?
"I'm all packed, all ready to go."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Well, I-"
- I just wanted to make sure that you hadn't changed your plans.
About what?
"Oh, well, Sandy, there's so many things that I ought to be doing this weekend."
"But you fly down there quite often, you said."
And you said you might even leave early tomorrow to be in Phoenix around noon.
"And what if I do, Sandy?"
Do you have something to tell me you don't want anybody to know you're telling me?
"Well, yes, as a matter of fact I do."
I-
- I have several more tidbits about people in the office.
- But that's not what I meant.
- It's not?
You promised you'd be there.
"Lita, remember the money I mentioned I was coming into?"
"Well, you're the only one who can advise me."
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.
Why don't they just come right out and tell us what's on their minds?
You're more advanced than a cockroach.
Have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?
How many people have seen it?
Ten.
"Twenty, maybe."
Listen to me.
Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.
Don't go back.
Stay away.
I can't talk about this anymore.
There is a reason... that I ended up in Point Pleasant.
Something brought me there.
Whatever brought you there... brought you there to die.
You're just in time.
They're just about to light this Christmas tree.
They have been for the last two hours.
Isn't that Denise?
Is she okay?
She left Gordon.
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.
Shit.
- Where is he?
- Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
You know what?
Just go.
Seriously.
"Okay,the band rents the rehearsal space."
It's not like we're meeting in somebody's basement.
Are you not attracted to me?
What?
!
"I just can't help thinking if I was some hot,tatted-up 22-year-old, maybe rehearsal wouldn't seem so important right now."
This is insane.
"I mean,I know I've gained a little weight, but it's not like I'm not going to lose it."
"I just have to be careful because of my food issues, and,yes,maybe I have a tra of body dismorphic disorder again, but whatever."
Who doesn't?
I have to go.
You're so grossed out right now!
"I am not grossed out,okay?"
I'm just late.
Don't leave me!
What is with you tonight?
I don't know!
I don't know...
Fine.
Let's go take a freakin' bath and figure it out.
Come on.
Let's go make raising fingers.
"Baby,the MySpace page is just for the band."
You have nothing to worry about.
I can't believe you were stalking me on MySpace.
"Hey,would you mind washing my back?"
Mind?
I'd pay good money to wash that back.
Come here.
"I've taught my cub all that I can, and now it's time for him to go out and maul some tourists on his own."
You know what?
I'll get you a glass of water.
"Ooh, hey, hey."
And a Pop Tart?
"Oh, well, if you want a Pop Tart,"
I do not have to go downstairs.
You have a problem.
"Hey, buddy."
"Oh, thank God it's you, man."
I was so scared to come out of my room.
But I really needed a drink of water.
I almost let Clementine get it for me.
Clementine's in your room?
N-No.
"All right, look, this is crazy."
You got your mom right where you want her right now.
You need to take advantage of it.
- What do you mean?
"- What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but your mom wouldn't let you do?"
Go to Tijuana.
Then you go to Tijuana right now!
How can she possibly say no when she won't even look you in the eye?
You really think she would let me go to Tijuana just to avoid talking to me?
Only one way to find out.
- (chuckles)
- Look.
I also want to clarify one thing
- about that text.
"- No, no, no, please..."
"I would be doing those things to your mother, and not the other way around, because... no, look at me."
You got to look at me.
I knew that I belonged... someplace.
"You know what I mean, Tillie?"
I don't think that...
I don't think there's anything in the world that's more important than that.
- Hey!
What are you doing that for?
- Because I care about you.
Put that down.
You can't make it dragging me.
- You look like a jerk.
- You know me.
I'll do what I say.
"What is this, your mother talking to you or something?"
My mother's dead and we're here.
You'll never make it if you have to take me.
You don't want me anyway.
Is that what you think?
"If you think that, then just do it."
What the hell.
Don't try to rattle me.
"Your father gave me 20 bucks to keep you from running, but if you wanna do that, that's fine."
Blow your guts out all over the mountain.
See if I care.
"Tillie, don't move!"
I won't get any further alone.
"If you hadn't been with me, I wouldn't have got this far."
I would've sat down on that first night by the fire and waited for the snow to cover me over.
Tillie...
I don't wanna go back there without you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Edgar.
He studied in New York when he was young.
"And Yoon Sang Min is a Korean American, from New York."
"Although, I'm sure there are countless Koreans in New York..."
"And the man taking orders from all of them, our killer."
"And, working under Park Seon Woo, the suspects of our current murder case."
The two unknowns.
"If our predictions are right, and Chief Jung is Park Seon Woo's boss..."
It's good to look at this from different angles.
"If we catch these two guys, as well as Park Seon Woo..."
"We could knock them off balance, and get them all at once."
You could have came home to change.
Why did you ask me to bring you clothes?
Your lips are chapped too...
- I might have to work overnight.
- What case is it?
And your clothes...
Whose blood is this?
Hey!
Why are you staring at us like that from over there?
It's making me angry.
- Are you monitoring him right now?
"- No, no, we're not."
They just wanted to say hello.
"- Hey, say hello one more time."
"- Yes, hello."
I'm pretty quick with my wits.
"Something is... not going well, right?"
This is all...
because of that Park Seon Woo.
Park Seon Woo?
"I knew I had to watch out, but I didn't know he would come at me so fiercely."
- What's going on between you two?
CRYING
MUSIC PLAYS:
Shape Of You by Ed Sheeran
MUSIC IS TURNED DOWN
SILENCE
CRYING
MUSIC TURNS BACK UP
APPLAUSE
That's the demographic.
"The only thing I knew about Ed Sheeran before was, he famously had a Nando's black card."
I've always been very envious of that.
You know Nando's black cards?
"I do, yeah, I'm a..."
Have you got one?
Yeah.
"So that, like, gets you free Nando's, plus five friends for life?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, he just needs the five friends and he'll be away."
RICHARD:
Wow.
"Well, you're off the list."
"Do you know my beef with, uh, Sheersy?"
"So I did a gig in Dublin, there was very fancy equipment at the gig, so I'm there to the tech, ""Why is the mic so fancy,"

"And I'm so sorry to admit this, because I'm 41, but if you tell me this is Sheeran's gear, only one thing's going to..."
So I put it down my pants.

"I immediately got 50,000 new Twitter followers who all thought that I was best friends with Sheersy."

It might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.
"So far, I'd say there seem to be three."

Earthling!
Captain!

The Metron?
"This is your opponent, earthling."
I have heard every word you have said.
- All right.
What do you want?
- I weary of the chase.
Wait for me.
I shall be merciful and quick.
- Like you were at Cestus III?
- You were intruding!
You established an outpost in our space.
You butchered helpless human beings.
We destroyed invaders as I shall destroy you.
Can that be true?
Was Cestus III an intrusion on their space?
"It may well be possible, doctor."
We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
Then we could be in the wrong.
Perhaps.
That is something best decided by diplomats.

Yes.

"Your Highness, although kung-fu is for everyone,"

Don't move!

Cheers!

Don't you still want to learn Shaolin Chin Kang Fist and Wu-tang 8-divine Sword?
"If Law Ching of the Wu-tang also refuses to hand over the 8-divine Sword book, what shall we do?"
I've got an idea.
You'll have the book.
I must have it by any means.
"Mr. Law, please!"
Please!
Playing chess is like having a sword fight.
"Strong, fast, and accurate."
"What a good sword, your Highness..."
Do you think your Wu-tang sword is better than mine?
I came here tonight to play chess.
Please don't mention anything about swords.

"Go, Go."
"Well, Doctor, we go away."
"Yes, we have an appointment in tanatorio."

"It was not a real pain, it is an emotional reaction."
It seemed to him that he was bad and he began to complain.
But now it is under my cares.
"A series of analysis will be necessary, so that it is better so that it is better to drain the intestine completely, we are going to begin by a medicinal injection."
-It does damage to me.

But he wasn't dead.
He was buried in the rubble under a stairwell.
"He survived, you see... for three days in the dark until they dug him out."
"And there was a girl in there, too."
But she was dead.
- They were trapped.
- For three days?
We sent him to a psychiatrist... because he was...different afterwards.
Still good at his job...

Where is he now?

There was a fire.
We found his body.

"No face, of course."
"I chose not to pursue it, not to question it."

"Yeah, that's the whole idea."
"Mike goes in, steers him to the house."
"Jabbar comes here, attacks the place."
We call the cops on him.
W-why am I hearing about this part of the plan just now?
T-the part where my last remaining possession gets chopped up by machine-gun fire and then turned into a crime scene?
!
Because we knew you'd get all whiny on us.
Whiny?
!
"Listen -- the good news is, you don't have to part of the fireworks this time, okay?"
Fi's gonna take you up the road to a nice little motel.
You sit tight there.
But never thought I'd walk away.
With so much joy but so much pain.
And it's so hard to say goodbye.
But yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
Another chapter in the book.
Can't go back but you can look.
And there we are on every page.
Memories I'll always save.
Up ahead only open doors.
Who knows what we're heading towards.
"I wish you love, I wish you luck."
For you the world just opens up.
But it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
"Every day that we had all the good, all the bad."
I'll keep 'em here inside.
"All the times that we shared every place, everywhere."
You touched my life.
- Saul shouldn't have said anything.
- No!
You do not get to blame Saul!
"He had enough faith in me, enough respect for me to be honest, which is more than I can say for you or Tommy or Kevin."
Were you never going to tell me?
You've had so much to cope with.
It just didn't seem to be the right time.
I can just see Tommy spearheading this whole brilliant idea.
- He's so like his father.
"- No, it was my idea."
- It was your idea?
- Yeah.
I was the one who thought that we should keep this information from you.
"Your father made you president of our family business, Sarah."
Not our family.
You taught me to put family first.
I was trying to.
"No, it is not."
You were trying to do what was easy for you.
You think it's been easy keeping this a secret?
No one asked you to!
There is no justification for this.
"- Oh, God."
What?
- Hey.
You ready for dinner?
- May I speak to Dan Silk?
- Talking to him.
"If you're going to make a living tarnishing people's reputations, you may want an unlisted number."
Thanks for the tip.
- Do I know you?
"- No, you do not."
But I think you know that deep down inside.
Mighty soldier!
Our mighty States will not tolerate defeat!
"To ensure that, there's something you must get."
"With that, you will have the body of steel."
You want me to get on?
I'll do it.
But...
I don't want you to go on anymore.
Look at the state it's in.
I'll go.
"For you, too."
How could that be?
They blocked us from using Bout Dimension...
So the protection device is still disengaged...
Burning...
NO!
Blow!
Kuya!
Goddamn it!
You let Black Elk go out without orders?
"Over time, its body won't be able to bear the burden..."
Our mighty States will not tolerate defeat...
Right?
Ahhh...!
What...?
They're here.
"Multiple unidentified objects from outer space, are currently descending at a high speed!"
"They look exactly like the specter pattern, ""Exception."""
Is that related to that monster we fought in Narita?
Wh...
What the hell's going on?
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?"
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah.
"Me, neither."
"When we was in the car, my breathing went all funny."
Couldn't get air into my lungs.
That's panic.
Know the best way of controlling that?
Singing.
"If you sing to yourself, it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
Sing what?
Dunno.
"Not sure the lyrics make much difference overall, Calum."
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."
"That's an underrated song, John."
Much darker than you think.
"Like, he freely admits he was high."
And once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that... ..the curtains closed for them.
"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
"That, or La Bamba."
"Remember what you need to dance the Bamba, Calum."
Feet.
Do you want a bacon sandwich?
"Yeah, all right."
"I'll stick the grill on, you nip down the shop and get the bacon."
What?
That's fair.
"And if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them."
There is one thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life.
Contesse d' Borchere.
Still nothing from the Maquets?
They already paid once.
And they shall pay again.
Put another note under their door.
I'm in no mood for tenderness.
You will stand behind the hedge and you will wait for my signal.
"Yes ,Madame."
"When I raise my hand, you will begin."
How much longer?
"Two hours, Madame."
"You do not have two hours, you have one!"
Stupid girl!
Go and find out at what time the King is expected to make his entry.
"Yes, Madame."
I had forgotten.
What?
How exquisite you are.
Don't ever go away again.
Monseur and Madame Maquet.
Did you hear the latest news about the Count De Valletta?
No.
A very sad affair.
"Despite several reminders from his creditors, he refused to pay his debt."
"The King was informed, sentenced him to 10 years in prison."
I thought you should know.
If it isn't France's favorite couple!
"On the right, the Duke d'Orleans, sporting a delicious spring outfit and on the left, looking in fine fettle..."
My wife is pregnant.
The King!
"Look at me, each and every one of you."
You all have a choice to make.
Often get defamed.
But I'm a minister.
If get defamed my party will be finished.
Vishwas fired a shot.
If Shiv's questioned... then me and my son will be in trouble.
The election's around the corner.
The media cannot be trusted.
Why don't you understand this?
Let's take care of Shiv permanently.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
I want to be on the top touch the sky... and you're still busy burying people.
I want to be a hit in politics not be on someone's hit-list.
- Mr. Pradhan...
- Enough.
You won't move a muscle.
I'll take care of things now.
If anyone asks say that Shiv's still being investigated.
The dog will definitely die.
But someone else will kill him.
Get it.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
Someone else.
Boss.
The inspector's here...
To inquire about Bajrang.
Go on.
Go to the dispensary.
Otherwise even the rats at home will fall sick.
Welcome Inspector.
For the first time...
an inspector's surrounded by goons.
- Boss...
- And?
It's Lionel Luthor right before he died.
What?
No way.
Creepy.
I can't believe you got this.
It's gonna get creepier.
There's someone else in the room.
Lionel Luthor might have been pushed.
You think this blurry blob of pixel is the killer?
Trust me.
This has Pulitzer written all over it.
What are you waiting for?
Sharpen the shot.
It's not that easy.
My computer's not powerful enough.
What about that heavy-duty hardware that Lana has stashed at the Isis foundation?
Nice.
"I can upload this bad boy to the foundation's server right now and, if we're on Lana's system, we could use Chloe's mad skills with a CPU."
"That is, if we can pry her away from Clark."
Chloe and I share the same DNA.
"Trust me, Jimmy..."
She is gonna want to be in on this.
I'm so sorry about your father.
"Thank you, Chloe."
He visited you here tonight.
He really wasn't himself.
"I fear, in his deluded state of mind, my father disposed of some valuable family heirlooms."
Did he give you anything?
Other than the feeling that something was definitely off?
No.
He was here for a few minutes.
Can't go watching soap operas all day.
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't.
Listen to the doctor.
"Margie, this is Reznik."
The man who cost me my arm.
"How do you do, Mrs. Miller?"
"I've been better, Mr. Reznik."
Is there some place we can talk?
Check it out.
It's a beauty.
8 cylinders.
MagnoSphere.
Speed sensitive steering.
ABS breaking with road texture and tension.
Defence lock-up helps you maintain control in emergencies.
"Of course, it's an automatic."
Hell I wanted a stick... but I figured my shifting abilities wouldn't be so hot.
"You know I am not at National any more, right?"
"Yeah, I heard about it."
"It sounds like you almost lost one yourself, huh?"
"Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?"
Ironic?
"I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade."
"I'll break it down for you, Miller."
"Moments after you left the shop, someone powered up my machine."
With my arm in it.
I nearly got killed.
Accidents happen.
It wasn't an accident.
Accidents happen out of negligence.
This happened out of spite.
"Yes, I could make a killing on my own land, but they had to have the other property, too."
I'd promised I could deliver.
"Oh, I made a killing, all right."
"When I tried to get Somers' option in writing, he wanted more money to cover all those checks that he was kiting, or else he'd block my sale, block it so I couldn't deliver."
"He wanted more money, then more."
"We got into a fight, and-- that's-- that's how I made my killing."
"Axel, for heaven's sake hurry up!"
"The plane won't wait, Axel."
I forgot I need another shirt.
"Here, I'll do that."
It's so nice of both of you to come and see us off.
"Ja, we send you a postcard from Copenhagen."
"And, Mr. Mason, you won't forget--"
The hospital.
Don't worry.
We'll get that land back.
And raise the money.
Mr. Hadley's already helping.
Ja.
I forget my neckties.
Here.
"Edie, you just get him outside."
We'll bring the suitcases.
"Ja, we go."
There is no fool like an old fool.
Ah.
Such a pity.
Hm?
That a man like that should have to wait all those years to get married.
Don't you agree?
You've been my legal secretary long enough to know that that's a leading question.
Here.
No snowballs reported in hell.
No sightings of flying pigs.
-What am I gonna do?
-You don't know?
"Come on, Alan, you were married for 1 2 years."
What does marriage have to do with sex?
Point taken.
"Okay, you want some tips?"
"No, no, nothing like that."
I need step-by-step instructions.
All right.
Since this is your first bout in this weight class...
... I'dsaystickwiththebasics.
Better to do the simple stuff well than the fancy stuff badly.
Got it.
And the simple stuff would be... .
"Well, you know how women like you to go slow?"
Really?
My ex-wife put a premium on brevity.
"Her motto was, ""Less is more, and none is perfect. """
"Well, Sherri's not like that."
You're gonna wanna take your time.
-l can do that.
-But don't loiter either.
You don't want her to get bored and play solitaire on your head.
No loitering.
Got it.
-Something else?
-Okay.
"When you're with a woman like Sherri, who's so gosh-darn beautiful..."
... thatyougetexcited just thinking about her...
... howdoyoukeepthesprinklersfrom going off while you're still mowing?
It's hard to imagine that a person would ax her so horribly.
Totally sliced up.
Let him in.
He's free.
"Maybe he knows about our style, our real identity."
What shall we do?
He suspects that we killed her.
"By any chance, did you two do it?"
"No, I didn't!"
"If you said no, then it's no."
Keep cool.
Don't be nervous.
You're the one who's nervous.
"No, it's hereditary."
I need to pee.
"Ladies and gentlemen, next you will see our amazing vanishing show!"
This beautiful girl will completely vanish in front of your very eyes.
Then she will appear behind that curtain like magic!
"Soon, this girl will..."
Look over here everyone!
"While that gentleman gets covered with blood, in this box..."
"What bastard bent this wire, damn it?"
Tada!
The vanished beauty will appear over there!
- Where's Miss Hwang?
- I don't know!
Come grab her!
Are you her family?
"Yes, we are."
She doesn't have much left to live.
Please prepare yourselves.
Doctor.
"- See, I don't get that."
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.
"You kill people, but I see something human in you."
"But with her, there was..."
There was nothing.
You can turn it off.
It's like a button you can press.
"I mean, Stefan's different."
He wants the human experience.
He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother so he shuts his feelings out.
"The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel."
Isobel chose the easier road.
"No guilt, no shame."
No regret.
"I mean, come on."
"If you could turn it off, wouldn't you?"
- You haven't.
"- Of course I have, Ric."
That's why I'm so fun to be around.
Why did you wanna meet me?
It can't be to just catch up.
Because I'm curious about you.
But the real reason is I want what your uncle wants:
Johnathan Gilbert's invention.
[CHUCKLES]
How do you know my uncle?
I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger.
John had a crush on me for years.
He was the first one that told me about vampires.
"So, what made you wanna be one?"
"It's a very long list of reasons, Elena all of which I'm sure you've thought about."
♪ I ♪
♪ I don't wanna waste your time ♪
♪ And I don't need you wasting mine ♪
♪ So leave it on the front lawn ♪
- ♪ Drive ♪
- Hey.
- Hey.
- That was pretty cool.
"Oh, thanks."
It's... it's nothing.
"Oh, come on."
It's not just nothing.
Um...
So your mom and I've been talking.
And I know you know that we're not exactly on the same page on this.
"But I don't know what to do, B."
"If we let you have the surgery and it causes more damage, are you gonna blame us when you're older because we let you make this decision when you were only 16?"
"And if we don't, are we getting in the way of your dream?"
- I would never blame you.
- But I would.
"I'm your mom, B, ok?"
I'm supposed to protect you.
"And, uh  that's a lot harder... these days."
I don't know what the right choice is.
"So if you want the surgery, I will talk to your dad, and we will consult with some other specialists so that we get a better picture of what we're looking at."
Ok?
We're not saying yes.
"But, uh, we're not saying no either."
Um...
I think I'm gonna wait.
"Yeah, maybe... maybe the feeling will come back on its own, right?"
That's what you want?
- That's our daughter.
"Hey, Jeff..."
"today, at Ritchie's school, with everybody there, I got a glimpse of what the future would be like, and it is so messed up."
Is that because you and Matthew have a baby?
"Okay, stop-- stop looking at the board, okay?"
I...
Oh!
I like you a lot.
And I like you.
So why can't we just look past the other stuff?
"Look, you've got to understand this from my point of view."
"I mean, what if I said that, in order to date me, we'd have to hang out with your ex-wife and her husband?"
I'd rather have diarrhea.
Exactly.
"I mean, it's great when it's just us, but it's never going to be just us."
It's always going to be weird.
Isn't this a conversation for way down the line?
No.
"Way down the line, I'm going to be in love with you, and then it's going to be too painful to tell you I don't want to do this."
You don't want to do this?
It's just...
It's too incestuous.
You dated your second cousin.
"Actually, he was my first cousin."
And I asked him out.
I think you're making a mistake.
Yeah.
That's what my aunt said.
No.
No.
About us.
What?
It's your first real conversation since you arrived here?
Conversation that take place on or around campus and was substantial?
Yes.
Wow.
You must be really lonely.
Can't see your eyes in that hat.
That's better.
Where are you going?
Are your office hours over?
For the time being.
Also they're for people in classes I teach.
"That's not you, is it?"
"No, but I was hoping..."
"No, it's urgent."
"So today we'll be learning about the Romantic period, and the impact of the French Revolution, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and..."
William Godwin and...
Did anyone read it?
We'll be also talking about the... (CHUCKLES) Romantic themes.
"Sorry, the cult of sensibility, emphasizing..."
"Sorry, what were we talking about?"
"Well, this is the most amount of visitors I've ever seen during a single session."
"And on a Friday, no less."
What a world.
One second.
(THUDDING)
Come right in.
"When I was in school, I never went to these things, so..."
I tend to forget about them.
That's okay.
I was hoping we could discuss my story.
Right.
Which I read.
But what truth?
The naked truth.
You met your brother in secret 48 hours ago!
- This is false!
- Do not deny it.
It is wiser to confess.
Mr Judge will consider it.
Do you have proof of what you just said?
Absolutely.
"This medallion, Mr judge"
You recognize it?
You authorized Dollon to keep it with him in his cell.
Why didn't we find the young man's body while his sister bears the medallion today?
It's you who gave it to me!
Do not deny it!
You lie again only to save your brother.
"You know very well that if he is found and charged with these crimes, he'll get the scaffold."
It shows a little.
Doesn't it?
"I understand that it is a concern, but do not make it an obsession."
"Turn your head, Sonia."
"No one will see it, I assure you."
Your scars are invisible.
When I think about all that happened...
Forget it.
- Let's eat.
- Sir?
- What?
- What is it?
- A lady asked for you.
- Take that.
She's waiting in the park.
Don't turn on the light.
You want something to drink?
"No, no."
I'm not staying.
What are you trying to do here?
"Turn that off, please."
You think having the lights off... is gonna make everything OK?
Just let me pretend for a while.
"Pretend what, that you can't see?"
I can't see.
I can't see things that are right in front of me... and I can see things that couldn't be there.
"For all I know, it was Cuchetto on the stairs."
I saw Valerie after she died.
I saw my mother.
Want to see me cry?
Boo-hoo!
My dog got hit by a Cadillac.
Now get the fuck out of here.
Simmer down.
Is this the cross you saw?
Is it?
How about this one?
That's it.
Why didn't you tell me... about these other hallucinations you had?
Because it wouldn't make me a credible witness.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you're here to tell me... that I'm a nut and you're moving on?
Why do you think I assigned someone to protect you?
I can protect myself.
With what...
darkness?
I survived 20 years... without sight or a cop at my door.
"Hey, you guys aren't gonna fight in here, are you?"
And why not?
I pay half the rent.
We lose our cleaning deposit if any half gets messed up.
"Oh, the cleaning deposit."
What was I thinking?
"Of course, you're right."
- Now what?
- How about the roof?
"Good call, Arthur."
There's a place good always fights evil.
"Well, works for me."
"Frankly, that's why I was so glad to find this great apartment."
You'd be surprised how hard it is to get a place in the city.
"Never mind that most folks are hesitant to rent to a slime-based organism, much less one with intentions of taking over the world."
And human brains too!
Don't forget the brains!
"It is good, this roof."
I am pleased.
- [Squelching]
- Come on.
"Let's get this over with, nose jelly."
"Tick, wait."
"- Hey, no whispering."
"- Tick, keep them busy."
I think I know how to get Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
"When I give you the ""high"" sign, try to throw the Mucus Tick into Thrakkorzog."
"A ""high"" sign?"
Are you a great sidekick or what?
Let's get to it.
Break!
Coward.
Frank Lloyd Wright was too cantankerous to love.
Mies van der Rohe wasn't you couldn't talk to him at all.
Corbusier was mean.
"But Lou, now, there was a man."
"All my buildings don't add up to what his three or four buildings, because he, when he did get a client-- however he ever got any clients is a mystery, because artists don't get jobs."
"Every time I've tried to do art,"
I've ended up with a-- make much less.
"Nothing to be ashamed of, naturally."
I do it the other way.
I do it by numbers and-- and public fame and all that.
But Lou did it by being an artist.
"He'd sit and work on art , see?"
And I always wished-- I think he did too;
"wished he knew me better, and I always wished I knew him better."
(Kahn) Why?
"(Johnson) Well, you know, there's some things that don't go into words."
"It's animal attraction-- his mind, really, because his person-- to look at him wasn't much a pleasure."
(Kahn) It wasn't?
(Johnson) It couldn't be.
"See, he was so scarred."
"Funny, he never talked to me as directly as he should have."
Who?
Lou.
"He never came here, though?"
Didn't he ever come here?
To the glass house?
"That's strange, cause I built it in'49."
Possible.
Possible.
Do you think Lou would have liked this house?
No.
Why?
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.
Backed by fine chain mail.
- The blood?
- It's in the ribbing.
"Rollin, were you able to work out the mask?"
Yes.
I have it right here.
Disintegrates two minutes after being exposed to the air.
And did Mr. Gordon accept the Harpers' invitation to dinner?
His R.S.V.P. was in this morning's mail.
"Well, in that case..."
"Mrs. Harper, I think we'd better get headed for home."
"How are you, Burt?"
"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"
Anything I should know about any of these?
The third name.
"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
- Right in back of us.
- What?
- Yes.
- Here.
They were staring at us in front of the hotel too.
"Jo, will you please stop imagining things."
(Whispering) I'm not.
Good evening.
You must think me awfully rude.
I've been staring at you since I saw you at the hotel.
"- You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?"
"- Yes, I am."
I knew I was right.
"I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband."
- How do you do?
- We're Dr and Mrs McKenna.
My wife tells me Mrs McKenna appeared at the London Palladium.
We hardly ever see a show now.
Edward is such an old stick-in-the-mud so I have to console myself with your records.
I must admit I love em.
I'm not one for this terrible be-bop.
- Thank you very much.
- When are you coming back to London?
"- Possibly never again, professionally."
- 0h.
- Don't say you're giving up the stage.
"- Well, temporarily I am."
"It's just that I'm a doctor, and a doctor's wife never has much time."
"What my husband is trying to say is Broadway musical shows are not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana."
We could live in New York. I hear that doctors aren't starving there either.
It's not that I have any objection to working in New York.
It's just that it'd be hard for my patients to come from Indianapolis for treatment.
It's been open to that same page for the last three days.
"Oh, that's the centre page."
It opens there naturally.
- How long for the pancakes?
- Just a few minutes.
Well I'll finish getting dressed.
Mother?
"Mother, I can't wear this coat."
"Yes, you're right, Samantha."
The colour isn't very becoming to you.
"Oh, that's perfect."
Mother.
"I know, I know."
"I don't understand, but I know."
"I will have a mink coat when Darrin can afford it, and not before."
"Well, by the time Darwin can afford a mink, mink will be extinct."
"Now, be honest with yourself, Samantha."
Wouldn't you adore to have that coat?
Well...
Wear it in good health.
Mother.
You take back this coat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"It's crazy, but I've been looking at that picture of that mink coat for so long, I could've sworn you were just wearing one."
Darrin would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
"I don't know, honey."
L...
I don't seem to be getting anywhere.
I've been doing pretty much the same job for the last three years and what have I accomplished?
"Sweetheart, I think you accomplished a great deal."
Like what?
Get me an interpreter.
I want to make sure she wants to stay.
If she does?
I'll see what I can do.
I'm looking for Joe nassurn.
My name is James mooney.
I work for legal services of Pittsburgh.
Does Joe nassurn live here?
Do you expect him back?
"If you see him, tell him that his niece kalaya is at the allegheny children's shelter, and to call me right away."
Jeremy.
What's up?
Where's your mom?
She's in with your dad.
You're stuck here till they're through?
My mom is into us having some time together.
Wants to take me shopping.
"The kleiner automotive group doubled their sales to $58 million in the 4 years following the highly visible angry penguin ad campaign,"
"Liz hetherington has won the atta-- the manno and every regional and national advertising award in print, television, and radio."
I tried to buy Liz's company a year ago.
What's different now?
Right.
"Well, she's been very impressed with the growth of your company over the past year and sees this as a, uh..."
Strong synergistic opportunity.
Let's get some numbers going.
Great.
"Mr. mooney, right?"
Right.
"I'm Joe nassurn, kalaya's Uncle."
But earlier you--
I didn't know who you were.
I had to check you out.
The earring.
Eric was with a girl alone in this house.
"Oh, boy."
"OK, sweetheart, I will go have a talk with him."
"No, no, no."
I will talk to him.
I don't want to have any of that father-son winking thing going on.
- What father-son winking?
"- No, I-I don't want to see you go,"
"""Son, what you did was wrong,"" and then, ""Attaboy."" I don't want to see that."
- You think I'd do that?
- I think you'd do that.
"Well, I wouldn't do that."
That just goes to show you don't know me at all.
We'll both just go have a talk with my son.
- My son.
- Ugh!
- Hello.
- You want to tell us anything?
Uh... not yet.
Now I got something to tell you.
We found this in our bed.
What was it you wanted to tell us?
"I just wanted to say, ""Happy Birthday, Mom."""
The other one's on layaway.
"Nothing happened between me and Rebecca, if that's what you're thinking."
Why should we believe that nothing happened?
Look at my face.
Do I look happy?
Nothing happened.
"Well, I'd like to know what you were doing bringing a girl into our room."
"And don't give us some lame-o excuse like, ""She wanted a tour of the house."""
"Get it over to Aaron,"
- see what we get.
"- Okay, good."
Ma'am...
When were you going to tell me ?
Excuse me.
Tell you what ?
Last week you were looking at Ray's old case files.
"And now today, a man I thought was locked up for the rest of his life, the man that killed my husband, was murdered."
I'm still working on that.
"You see the way I have this is that if Bob Keaton got out of prison, that tells me he wasn't Ray's killer."
"Horatio, don't lie."
Do you trust me ?
I thought I could.
I need you to trust me until I have something real to tell you.
Okay ?
You promise me ?
Promise ?
Of course.
Hey.
"Alexx, what is that ?"
The shooter left a calling card our competitor missed.
Muzzle stamp.
It was under the mess.
They didn't know to look for it.
"But we did, didn't we ?"
The killer got close for the second shot.
The heat softened Bob's skin.
And then the muzzle smashed into it.
"The muzzle with an imperfection, Alexx."
This demarcation is unique only to the killer's gun.
"So we find that gun, we match it to this imperfection, we have our killer."
It gives us hope that perhaps there may be others
Does she remember what happened in the coach?
No
And have you seen the other children?
Did they talk to you?
Why you?
Now that Camille is here perhaps Audrey's turn will come
"Like Pierre says, Camille's return gives us all hope"
Easy for you to say
There must be a reason why she's the one who came back
Why her?
Camille!
I'll go
Don't treat her like a monster
"Please, she needs our help."
It's not her fault
Go away!
I never should have listened to you
People fear what they don't understand imagine how they feel
What about them?
Did they ever wonder how I feel?
They are just like Léna and Frédéric
They look at me like I'm a monster
You can be so selfish
What?
Have you ever wondered how your sister might feel?
You came back.
Do you realise how lucky you are?
"You're a miracle, Camille"
And what do you do with it?
Nothing
It looks like I'm wasting my time
That's a bit of overkill.
"I tell you, we'll discuss it..."
May I take your arm?
My husband's in a temper tonight because I'm wearing his britches.
"George, Chopin does not deserve to be collected."
"He's so fragile, you know he might..."
What's this?
A secret?
Is he the one you came here to meet?
"Mallefille, if you can't behave, go to your room."
I am quite marooned.
Will you... partner me?
Of course.
- Bon appetit.
- ALL:
Bon appetit.
I understand many of you artists are atheists.
Atheists?
"Oh, no."
"No, we feel that God exists."
He's just not considered worth all the trouble of denying him.
"Oh, really!"
The baron is baiting you.
He maintains there is no scientific evidence of God.
"And I reply ""Because civilisation has poured dust on his traces."""
God has been buried by science.
But alive!
God exists.
"But he is no longer loved, so he hides away to conceal his broken heart."
(SYMPATHETIC MURMURS)
Certainly it is difficult to find God in our age.
And artists are the only hope.
Gives you height.
"Say, what all did you buy, Lottie?"
Nothing really.
[sighs] [exclaims]
"Jane, it's for you."
"On second thought, it's too young for you."
Size 10?
I don't get it.
"Well, you will."
"With this, I'm gonna lose pounds like water."
"Wait, I'll show you."
"All this wouldn't have anything to do with a certain gentleman... whose initials are ""Charles Nash""?"
Where do you get your ideas?
[grunts]
"Now, look, this is what you're supposed to do."
"You're supposed to kind of, like, lasso your feet."
Lasso your feet.
"Like that, see."
And then you pull yourself up.
You're bending your knees.
Shut up.
[snickering]
"Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better, Mrs. Slocum."
How do you do?
May I help you up?
"Well, I'm not feeling better, I'm not well at all."
I just keep trying.
"That's why I'm here, Mrs. Slocum."
I'm gonna ask you to try to remember if there are any details that you overlooked.
"Like what, for instance?"
"Well, supposing we go through the whole thing again."
Right from the start.
- That's right.
Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.
"Hello, Higginbotham."
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?
I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you.
"I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better."
"- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?"
"- Thanks, Cutter."
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.
"I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement."
"Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie?"
"We can look after that, old boy."
Take a plunge into this punch.
Punch?
That stuff's for drummer boys and old ladies.
- Not that stuff.
- That would knock a horse down.
"Swill that down, me boy... and you'll think all the Thugs in India is a bunch of missionaries."
"That's right, Bert."
That's a funny thing.
The punch tastes all right.
It's all right.
"Bert, how about having another drink?"
"To the new comradeship, Mac and you and me and the regiment forever."
"- That's it, Bertie, my boy."
- I'll drink to that.
All right.
Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham... the finest soldier since William the blooming Conqueror.
"Down the hatch, boys!"
"At some point, we have to address it."
J.T.
"You're all right, dad?"
No.
I'll come see you when I'm done.
Have you heard from your sister?
She's just being Marcy.
"Don't worry, okay?"
All right.
Senator!
Listen...
I know how you feel.
This is a mistake.
You have no idea how I feel.
Sara could be anywhere.
I don't even know if she's alive.
"You offer a reward before the abductors issue demands, we're going to lose the advantage."
What advantage?
"She's out there, pregnant."
"You haven't found my ex-wife, and my daughter's MIA."
Your daughter's not missing.
She just didn't want to be here.
"You know, I can't eat, I can't sleep, and I sure as hell can't sit here and do nothing."
"We're going to break into the 11:00 news, we need to go now."
"All I care about is my wife, and the only way you're going to stop me is if you pull out that gun and shoot."
Senator!
"If you're gonna do this, do it right-- look straight into the camera."
"There's a good chance the perp's watching, and if he is, he's enjoying your pain."
Let him.
"We get lucky, maybe we can draw him out."
Thank you.
All right.
"Yeah, felt all of it."
I got my head turned inside out.
JIM:
Jesus.
"Them Indians down Texas way they may rob you, but they ain't gonna take your topknot."
JIM:
When was it?
"Goddamn it, will you quit that noise now, will you?"
Quit it.

If you ready to take the sacrament I can do that for you.
"What you holding to, Glass?"
You know it would be better if you were to take that last breath of yours now... for all of us.
Now you hung tough.
And that's something.
I'm begging you.
Them Ree are so close I can smell 'em.
"You can smell 'em, too."
You got to think of your boy.
All right?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
You'll kill us all.
(MUTTERING)
I can muzzle you if you like.
Take away this suffering quick and easy.
No one ever has to know that you give up.
All you have to do is blink if you want me to do that.
(GRUNTING SOFTLY)
Save your boy and blink.
You just have to blink.
- My lord?
- He did not call;
He's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
A most unhappy one:
"I would do much to atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio."
- Fire and brimstone!
- My lord?
- Are you wise?
"- What, is he angry?"
May be the letter moved him;
"For, as I think... they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government."
"- Trust me, I am glad on't."
- Indeed!
- My lord?
- I am glad to see you mad.
"- Why, sweet Othello."
- Devil!
I have not deserved this.
"This would not be believed in Venice, though I should swear I saw't:"

Make her amends;

Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
- Out of my sight!
- I will not stay to offend you.
"I do beseech you lordship, call her back."
Mistress!
"What would you with her, sir?"
"- Who, I, my lord?"
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most peopleNhave different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
can you manage a smile?

Go.
You do realize it's well past 4:00.
Now everything will haveNto be rushed through.
never mind!
Forgive my wife.
She's been planningNthis affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here...
My condolences.
I think of your husband often.NHe was truly a man of vision.
I hope you don't think I've takenNadvantage of your misfortunes.
Of course not. I'm pleasedNthat you purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing inNhis mad venture when I had the chance.

On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

No.

I'll tell you about her childhood.
Margaret dropped from Connecticut.
She went to church every sunday.
This is when she was sixteen.
What are you doing?
"This is my hair, you could at least consult me about it."
"I think, Jane, the hairdresser..."
Hair stylist.
Hair stylist is right.
We don't need this accessory.
The image should be simple.
Your photographs that Adrian was just showing me indicate a fairly traditional upbringing.
And you slipped to a weird off with some obscure fantasy look.
spirit of paradise everyday in Las Vegas and better.
It's tacky.
You're tacky.
What do you mean by wearing all this weird make up and strange clothes?
Nothing.
You don't admit to dressing strange?
You're strange.
What do you mean by that?
I'm not wearing rags.
You're wearing what they want from you...baby.
America!
What do you mean America?
"I'm American, she's American."
He's American.
Where're you from?
-Detroit.
-Las Vegas.
-I'm coming from Montana.
"Anyway, you're not going to see her anymore."
"Why do I feel like heartbroken, just like my 2nd year in college?"
But this time how can it be a broken-heart?
It can't be.
"A relationship like this where... we meet for a few minutes a month, the doctor is just doing her job."
There's nothing more to it.
So how can I say that I'm heartbroken?
But just now I said heartbroken 3 times.
Shit.
There is no way I'm heartbroken.
You're way brokenhearted bro.
It's not hard to tell.
I've given you my diagnosis.
No way.
Why not?
Sure.
You have all the symptoms.
"You can't eat, or sleep."
I know.
I was a teenager once.
But we didn't even pass go.
"But from what you've told me, you've gone far enough."
Why did you drop all your work to go see her?
You even asked me to play badminton to exercise.
Right?
I was sick.
So I went to see a doctor.
I exercised to get better.
You did it so she would give you props.
You did it for her.
You wanted her to see you doing good things.
"You'll be ok because you want to be ok for her, right?"
It's over.
I got mine.
"Of course, tomorrow you'll have to make up the deliveries you missed today and do your regular route."
Oh.
"Right, sure."
"Well, either way, it'll be nice to have a day with the kids and Frank."
"Well, that's a positive outlook."
Who's Frank?
- He's my...
- Don't care.
Do you have to fucking chew so loud?
Excuse me for having a resonant skull.
Good news!
I don't have to work after all!
We've been handed a gift!
A snow day we can spend together as a family.
"Don't you ""agh"" me."
We are all gonna have fun together at the sled hill!
- Yeah!
- Sledding!
You guys have a good time.
I'm gonna curl up in an afghan and slowly cry myself into a nap.
"No, no."
Uh-uh.
You are going to leave this house and enjoy the day with your family.
I can't.
Pogo might call.
"Frank, I'm your biggest cheerleader, but it's been three weeks and Bob Pogo has not called yet."
- And I doubt he'll call today.
"- Your cheerleading needs work, Sue."
"And, if by some miracle he does call, we have an answering machine."
"Come on, you've been a ghost around here since Christmas."
- Yes.
- I am Tonjura.
I am pleased to meet you.
-It's an honor to meet you.
- We would like to extend our deepest regret.
We cannot help you in this matter.
We are not a violent species.
And not equipped for war.
"I'm sorry, Robert."
- The Arktorians have always been here.
"Silently monitoring human progress, along with several other races."
But now they're all returning home.
-You mean evacuating?
So now we really are alone.
-Yes.
Thousands of years of accumulated human data ends here.
- You could have gone back with them.
Why didn't you?
Or at least given them the Purian.
- They've fulfilled their duties to the council.
This is not one of them.
"And as I stated before, I'm not leaving."
-Is this John?
John Walker?
"- Yes, yes, this is John Walker."
- It's Denise from the motel.
You told me to call if anyone came inquiring.
"Well, there are government agents inside this room as we speak."
"Well, you didn't tell them anything, did you?"
- No.
I didn't.
But these guys have real badges.
Keep them coming.
"See, Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city."
"He was first locked up at 11, and he was doing hits for mob bosses when he was 16."
"See, hits never bothered Jimmy."
It was business.
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.
"I mean, he actually enjoyed it."
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.
Give me your wallet.
"You might know who we are, but we know who you are."
You understand?
"He was one of the city's biggest hijackers of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters."
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.
And almost all of them were gimmies.
"I mean, they just gave it up, no problem."
They called him Jimmy the Gent.
Tommy...help the lady.
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off about the really good loads.
"Of course, everybody got a piece."
"Thanks Jimmy, I'll be back for the rest later."
"Ok, see you later..."
"Henry, come here."
Say hello to Tommy.
"Youse gonna be working together, okay?"
Help him.
Go ahead.
"Hey Jimmy, you got anything good?"
"And when the cops assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?"
He made them partners.

Why would they leave us alive?
Let's discuss.
They think we have
Information they can use.
Like what?
What do they possibly need from a drunken nietzschean
And the captain of a ship
That doesn't function any more?
Maybe they're interested in your huge load of fruit.
Or maybe they have an actual chain of command
And they're waiting for orders.
"You know, if i was a bad guy, i would split us up."
"I mean, why let us conspire unless they want us to?"
Confident in their monopoly of power.
That's just overconfidence.
"If they're smart enough to fix theandromeda,"
They're smarter than that.
Maybe none of it matters.
I can get next to that.
Did i ever show you guys this?
No.
No.
It's a long story.

Now let me hear your voice just for once
'Cause you've mixed all my bits
You've grabbed all my soul
You've taken everything over
Now let me hear your voice just for once
You know you can make me smile
You can make me cry and take me out from these nights of longing

I'm gonna go up on the roof and stand there by myself for five minutes.
Have fun.
And that's exactly what she did.
She just stood there.
"All right, kids, I'm gonna level with you."
That's not what she did.
Here's what she did.
"All right, all right."
I'm going to go have a cigarette.

What?

"I promised her I'd never tell you this, but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin did enjoy the occasional cigarette, and occasionally that occasional cigarette... was more than just occasional."
I just left something like this in my apartment.
"Robin, come on, take it to the roof."
We said no smoking in the apartment after you torched the throw rug doing push-ups.
"All right, all right, all right."
Geez.
"Yeah, Robin, I mean, God, not only is that a filthy habit, but also, can I bum one?"
Sure.
What?

No thanks.
Sorry about Dante.
Gene.
They figure out what killed him?
What does it matter?
"He's dead, right?"
There have been people around here asking questions.
"You haven't said anything, have you?"
Of course not.
Good boy!
No thanks
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
"Yeah, well, it didn't do much for Gene."
You don't think this is what killed him?
He was doing a lot.
Yeah and he was sleeping it off in an alley.
Who knows what could have happened to him.
"Hey, I know how we can make each other feel better."
I have a new piercing.
Where are you?
There's evidence to indicate that Gene Hansen died of anaphylactic shock.
The pathologist found an unknown substance in his bloodstream.
"Yeah, an unknown substance."
I need you to be straight with me.
Are you selling drugs here?
I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.
"Coreen, tell her I'm not selling drugs."
"You have to tell her, whichever way it is."

"- Thank you, Greg."
"CNN is prepared to make the following projection that Virginia, with its 13 electoral votes, is a win for President Meyer."

And we shall overcome.

One more mountain to climb.

Thank you.

- We don't do anything.

"Hey, Dan, when you get this, can you put in a good word for me with Greg?"
I think that I need to keep my TV work going.
"Okay, you're gonna win."
"And if you don't, I'll kill myself."
"Kent, what happens next?"
You've got to know.
"No, I'm afraid not."
"Some of these House races,"
- they're still too close to call.
- What does that mean?
"Well, presently, we cannot predict the result of the vote in Congress on January 20."

- Welcome to my world.
- Can you stop thinking about yourself for one second?

I asked Mr. Lawrence to check it out.
I reviewed the tape from Monday night's show.
"I didn't see anything suspicious, so we examined the machine itself."
We examined the balls.
"We measured them, we weighed them."
We were bouncing them.
And everything seemed perfectly normal.
"So, what's the problem?"
This is the problem.
The same numbers?
The same numbers.
But that's not possible.
That's what we thought.
So we tried again.
And again.
And again.
And the same six numbers kept popping up.
"Not always in the same order, but the very same numbers."
How did that happen?
They're very lucky numbers?
Metallic paint.
"Very good, Mr. Monk."
We took a closer look.
The numbers on these six balls and only these six balls were painted with metal-based paint.
All the others were acrylic based.

You told the other officer you saw the killers face.
I did?
"No, I didn't."
You calling this officer a liar?
I didn't see faces.
I seen the license plate.
"258, right?"
287.
I didn't see the rest of it.
What's the last line on that poster?
"I, I..."
I don't have my glasses.
I was wearing my glasses.
"Y'know, a doctor says to me that I gotta wear my glasses all the time, and, I have to admit, I am sorta vain."
"Well, put your glasses on... and read the bottom line on that poster."
I don't have 'em with me.
"Tell me about the gloves, what were they like?"
"They're white, cotton."
"They got stitching on the back of the hand, along the knuckle."
They're proper ladies gloves.
You can see that kinda detail from your car without your glasses?
I had my glasses.
"When the two guys went away, I got out and took a closer look."
"Frank, your wife's on the phone."
"Stan just radioed in from Pamela's apartment, only the name on the lease is JMJ Wilgis."
"JMJ, a brother, sister?"
"(normal voice) I don't think he knows that movie, honey."
"Mrs. Dunphy, you're trying to seduce me."
"Okay, let's just give him the gift, all right?"
"Okay, but first, gather around, everybody!"
Riddle me this...
"What has two hands, is wound tight, and has a lot of ticks?"
Alex?
- (laughs)
"- Good guess, but no."
"This was made in Switzerland, not in the Disneyland Hotel."
Awesome!
A watch!
We wanted to give it to you early so you could wear it to graduation today.
Yeah.
It's shockproof.
"Oh, good."
You can show it your grades.
- I love it.
- What time is it?
(voice breaking) Time for my little man to go out in the world and make his mark
- like the tiny trouper he used to be.
- (sighs)
Hold on.
I'll be right back.
"I remember when he was so small, we'd give him a bath in the sink."
Here we go.
"Dad, we really got to talk about the crying."
"When we graduated, you were a mess, and it was humiliating."
Showing emotion is part of being a sexy modern man.
Ask anyone who was raised on Alan Alda.
I don't think we have to worry about him going anywhere anytime soon.
He just installed a mini fridge and a hammock in his room.
How can one help abhorring these men and their religion?
A pagan would be ashamed of such villainy!
Oh lord.
Oh blessed lord.
Oh blessed lord.
What a generation of vipers do we live among!
You watch!
He'll have him tied to the back of a cart and whipped through the streets.
"I can't say how it goes in england now, but every man deserves a chance to redeem himself."
Like jacob moore.
Jacob moore sealed his fate whatever we do.
How do you plan on getting that to your captain?
You have already chanced one visit to the camp.
I have a messenger in mind.
"I tell ya, lads."
Have no fear.
"I look into the eyes of evil and I come through unscathed, right?"
All of you!
Stop your mumbling about ghosts and demons.
Get to work!
Ya see?
They don't doubt me!
"I don't doubt you eitherer, jacob."
He's been muttering all night.
Something about a man coming to set us free.
It's the fever.
It's healing.
Thank you.
Excuse me!
You're a woman.
"You have a keen eye, mister..."
- crusoe.
I have nerves like everyone else
"--Pasha, the thought has nevereven crossed my mind..."
"--Excuse me, I must wake up early tomorrow"
Good night
"Pasha, you and I never used to fight"
"Just tell me, what has happened?"
"Have you fallen ill, my little hampster?"
--What's with you?
--What for?
"--What, my little one?"
--What do you paint your lips for in your old age?
Whom are you trying to tempt?
Swamp-Queen!
"Alright, you chased out the kids Now chasing me out too"
Good boy!
Ira
I am at Dina's
"Dina, good morning, this is Vasin"
Lightened up a bit?
"Pavlik, listen to me carefully"
"First, you need to seek treatment."
"Take a vacation, drink some herbs, and so on"
"Second, Irina doesn't see that you're having a nervous breakdown And you must keep that in mind"
--Third...
"--Dina, tell her that I regret last night"
There you go!
Only you will say it to her yourself
I'm listening.
"Go ahead, Pavel"
--Desert --What?
"--Nothing --Pasha, do you recall the first word little Masha said?"
Remember?
- No!
You will be playing right into her hand.
I'm a good person!
You knew what you were getting into when you married me.
"Okay, but no crawling up her butt."
"No, like, ""Oh, we're just so happy you're here!"""
- I don't sound like that.
"- Dad, did you say something?"
All right.
So.
How was your trip?
"Not easy, as you can imagine."
Anna-Kat and I saw a video of this guy going through security who was caught smuggling a monkey in his underpants.
"It was supposed to be sedated, but it was awake."
- And very angry.
- Mm.
"Well, uh, we're happy you're here."
I...
"Check on the, uh, Thanksgiving."
Just leave it.
"Grandma is known for pretending, so even though she looks hurt, remember the important thing is that she's not hurt."
So no one talk about the monkey bars on Grandma's head.
I love watching your mouth move.
Dude.
"Anna-Kat, you don't need to squeeze your stress ball."
Mom is fine.
We are like E.T. and Elliott.
Whatever happens to one happens to the other.
Oh!
You're like me.
So you get a weird feeling in your tummy whenever you see a mommy that's taller than a daddy.
Totally.
Now you do need help.
"Why, you're scared to death thinking that your husband is in some way mixed up with Lita Krail or even--"
I don't know anything about it!
"So please just get out, Perry."
We-- we don't need you.
Please just get out.
"[door opens, closes]"
Any luck yet on the guy with the strawberries?
"No, not so far."
I'm checking out the license number
- and my men are checking the markets.
- What about the necktie?
"Well, there was a cleaning tab on the label and we're running it down as fast as we can."
I gave my men a head start before I reported what I had to the police.
"All right, Paul."
I want one of your men to watch that house.
- Don't leave till he gets here.
- All right.
"Oh, you heard about the Lita Krail thing."
"Shocking, isn't it?"
Very shocking.
Such a pretty creature.
"How did you hear about it, Mr. Banks?"
"Oh, the police just called a few moments ago."
Routine-- check the employer.
That sort of thing.
"I wasn't in town when Jess Devro died last year, Mr. Banks."
I still miss him.
"Best friend, you know?"
Very best.
"It happened here in the office, didn't it?"
"He was alone, working late."
You're going to leave us here?
I could make my life a lot easier and return you to Jacob Moore.
If you would prefer.
"Soon as we clear the rocks, move the main sail!"
Give her everything she can carry!
This ship's mine now.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Get him!
"Take the wheel, boy!"
This one's for me.
You fight like a man with a lot to lose.
"Well, I have nothing to lose."
Which makes me far more dangerous.
"First blood, I think."
"So, the evil island spirit."
"You going to attack me with a stick, are you?"
"I have a very, very unfair advantage."
Oh?
"Well, we'll just see about that."
Die!
"Hold the wheel steady, boy!"
While I finish him off.
You see?
I have been living the outdoor life.
"Fresh air, plenty of exercise and nutritious food."
You...
"You have been cooped up at sea, eating nothing but broth and dry biscuits."
"Aye, but I still have the beating of a savage in me."
Especially one that cost me so much.
I do not think so.
You can't defeat us all.
Last blood to me as well.
What did you see?
Who is that?
Independent Auxiliary Unit 13...
"I heard you were a descendant of ""Koga ninjas,"""
but your talents exceed my expectations.
Looks like I need to examine this further.
What is this?
What have you been doing here?
It's exactly what you see.
Remember it as you embark on your journey to death.
How did you get there?
You did this?
You punk!
Cross Tornado!
It's all over.
"Ambition, love, relationships..."
These are the reasons why we stake our lives for battle.
The battle with the giant deity brings back memories of pain.
"From the day I lost my big brother, my battle had begun."
"Don't miss: ""The Great Soldier"" on Great Dangaioh."
That's not right Kuya...
Why aren't you being more like your usual goofy self?
"C'mon, I know you can do it!"
Um... what do you mean by that?
"So, how are you feeling?"
I feel much better now.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
You've been asleep for a week.
"But as your doctor, let me say something..."
"You're only human, you know."
Remember that.
Right...
He has no jurisdiction.
"Now, why don't we try going to Tascosa."
Fight it there?
"The minute he steps foot in that town, they'll hang him."
vin:
Wanna give me some of them beans?
Might slow you all down if I'm going empty.

Let's go!

MAN:
The hell you doing?
MAUDE:
Need ammonia and water.
"Mother, what are you doing?"
I'm redecorating.
"Yes, but poker tables?"
Selling liquor?
I thought we had an understanding.
"Well, I found those gambling tables in the hotel cellar."
"Now, am I supposed to let those lovely furnishings..."
... languishinadarkanddusty hole?
"Don't start with me, Mother. I won't sit back and watch you take my business."
Your business?
Where in the city charter does it say...
... thatonlyyoucan servedrinks and offer gambling?
You know what this means?
"A little war, dear?"
I'll run you into the ground.
"Well, we'll just see who buries whom."
"Well, then, the gauntlet is thrown."
Good day.
–Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."
Until he tired of his domination and control Dr Mengele experiments... and decided to squeeze the last breath out of her so he could watch.
"See, this is why you and me can't date."
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D now.
I spoke to Shane.
He said you weren't with him for about an hour last night.
Yeah.
That's right.
"I was with a private eye named, uh, Gordie Liman."
–What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
–Nothing.
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
–Are you?
–I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
–This dog was sniffing around it.
–So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
"I see, Avdeev."
Do you have problems with the SMERSH?
- lt is them who have problems with me.
- Please specify.
I was drafted with my elder brother.
He was captured and I had no idea about his whereabouts forthree years.
He managed to escape with a group offellow prisoners.
They got to our lines with a lot of arms seized from the enemy.
Theywere lucky.
Theywere arrested.
The arms were confiscated.
They accused my brother oftreason.
I couldn't stand it.
- Can I ask you a question?
- No need forthat.
We are not kamikazes.
The top commanders have set a very difficult battle task to us.
that's why I'm picking up the most experienced soldiers for my company.
"-That's all, you may go."
"-Yes, sir."
"A good guy, isn't he?"
"Listen, private, you'd rather wash yourface.."
And wash your shirt as your senior comrades did.
You are hanging around like...
-Are we preparing for a parade?
"-Well, be it a parade or not a period..."
- but the hygiene is obligatory.
- Fulfil this order!
"Yes, sir."
Nowthe next one.
The next one.
"- Let's have a smoke, folks."
Come on.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Come on.
- No.
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me!
I'm going.
I'm going.

- My coworker had it.
Sorry about that.
Now... you know I can't be letting a ten-year-old boy go unsupervised like you've been doing.
"And trust me, a 13-year-old kid on probation is not our idea of a good caretaker."
Now...
The judge has allowed you to keep Jacob.
"But you've got to go to the court-appointed counselor once a week, make every single court date..."
And stop drinking.
We'll give it a month and revisit the situation.
You're just lucky that
Judge Bradley's a big baseball fan.
Said he went to all your games.
"Look, I know that you and your family have been through a hard time."
And seems to me that you could use a little help.
"So you look to me and your sister-in-law, because we're just trying to help you out."
You understand?
Hollis?
- This is just temporary.
You know that.
"It's not like last time, okay?"
"If anyone deserves tonight's Grocey, it's you."
"Oh, thank you, honey, but it's really no big deal."
You don't mean that.
Do you?
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews."
Is Cory home yet?
Nope.
"But soon, though."
I know.
"According to tape 56, he should be home tonight."
Late tonight.
So is it okay if we wait?
"Well, actually, we were on our way out."
"That's okay, it's okay."
I'm just going to take a hot bath.
What?
There's seepage at the trailer park.
"Shawn, I'd prefer that my son's friends didn't bathe in my home when I wasn't here."
Or ever.
"Still in a bad mood, huh, Mr. M?"
What bad mood?
"Well, me and my dad noticed it when we were last at the market."
"You know, we were eating our free samples, like we always do..."
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sticking your own toothpicks in our turkey and steak does not make them free samples.
Fine!
We'll just take our business elsewhere.
"Now, Mr. Eric from the city, uh,"
"I'm flattered and everything, but why would a guy who's traveled back and forth across the state line be so keen on chatting up a small-town girl like me?"
Aren't all newspapermen?
That's a myth.
We're the most sentimental slobs in the world.
- The softest touches there are.
- Prove it.
All right.
When do I start?
All I want is a chance to show what I can do.
"Write something up this week, I'll run it Friday."
"Thank you, Mr. Bushwell."
I'll start right away.
- I'll dig up a story you'll never forget.
- I don't doubt it.
"Just remember, there's no such thing as a cheap lawsuit."
Hold on.
We haven't discussed pay.
You don't have to.
I'll do it for experience.
The first thing experience teaches us is to get paid.
Five dollars a column to start.
More later.
That's more... .
I wouldn't want these stories to fall into the wrong hands.
"Thanks, Seth."
"There's no question, the tests confirm that you're pregnant, Selena."
I'd say about three months.

"Now, what kind of rot is that?"
You're not the first girl in the world who had to get married.
"Or in this town, for that matter."
Who's the father?
You are unbelievable.
- That could be taken a couple of ways.
- Get out.
"Well, no ambiguity there."
Don't forget your brother's CD.

It's amazing.

"No, that's not what I'm really enjoying."

Can't we just go home?
If I gotta drag you to the doctor at 8 in the morning...
... youcancoolyourjets  while I get coffee.
I must look like an idiot.
Wish I could tell you different.
You're the reason we went to the eye doctor in the first place.
"You said, ""Throw me a piece of toast. """
I threw you a piece of toast.
"Two cups of regular coffee, please."
-My treat.
"-Oh, that makes up for everything."
"Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket, but I get a free cup of coffee."
Just the coffee.
Keep the change.
I'm gonna need your help until I get this patch off.
I am absolutely there for you.
Yes.
Oooh!
Erie!
"Any part of 1,000 at 72?"
You want me to start buying?
At 72?
I should say not.
I've passed the word that i'm not gonna buy until the price goes down.
In a few days it'll be a flat as a flounder.
The board of directors of the erie railroad wish to announce that they have declared a dividend on all outstanding stock of 50%.
Whoever heard of a 50% dividend?
"Nobody, but it makes erie the best buy on the market."
"Any part of 1,000 at 72?"
50%!
I smell a rat.
A little bald-headed one with chin whiskers.
73!
73!
You don't know how lucky you are.
His brains is gonna pull you through.
I didn't think drew was smart enough to find a new way to start a bull rush.
But i'm gonna fight him.
Go ahead and buy.
But it's a false price!
"False as wooden teeth, but the suckers are falling for it, and the only way to beat drew is to get control."
"No matter what it costs, i can make the railroad worth it when i'm boss."
"But commodore, i don't think- go ahead, buy."
"While we've been gabbing here, it's gone up 3 points."
Vanderbilt's buying.
Vanderbilt's buying.
Erie's up to 83!

Never mind that.

And hurry it up.
Would you please tell Miss Morrow that Axel Norstaad is here?
"Sorry, but she isn't in."
Would you care to leave a message?
"No, I've got to talk to her."
I've got to see her right away.
"Well, she just this moment left."
When she will be back?
All of 'em.

"Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other, to distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets."

[Cheers and applause]
LIZ:
You know what?
"When people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or at the store."
"No, thank you."
You know what?
This is for computer classes.
"You know why I should do this TV show, Lemon?"
I really don't.
To get you rich.
"'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gonna blow up."
How do you know I'm not rich?
Your teeth.
"You got to think like these strippers, Lemon."
They know the window of opportunity is only open for a moment.
"You got to get in while you're young, get the money, and get out."
"Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy."
I don't have sex for a living.
She's a killer.
Yeah.
Garthe?
No.
"No, name's Michael."
Does that surprise you?
"Uh, no, no."
"It's, uh, just that you look so much like somebody I-I know."
"Uh, place your bet."
"Hi, Rita, name's Michael Knight."
Devon Miles from The Foundation sent me.
I said not to send anybody here.
I can't talk here.
"Okay, where?"
"Uh, I get off at midnight."
"Okay, thank you."
"And so I did everything the magazines say a wealthy, attractive divorcee does."
And more.
"Thank you, Roger."
That will be all tonight.
"Although I don't suppose there was anything that would unduly shock a man, who appreciates life as much as you do."
And I gave up being shocked years ago.
I must tell you that I'm having a wonderful time.
"In spite of a nagging suspicion that somewhere, you have an ulterior motive hidden between the entree and dessert."
"No, no, no, no, no."
No ulterior motives.
"No, I gave that up long ago."
"When I want something from a man, he knows it."
"Devon, would you be a dear and open a window?"
"It's a bit stuffy in here, don't you think?"
"Yes, of course."
I was gonna be a singer and Ron played piano.
eh?
There am preparation to you meatballs to have dinner.
Meatballs.
"Thanks, mother."
Thanks.
I will be on time.
You have heard?
My dear mother is preparation meatballs for me to have at dinner.
I also will do them to you when we are married.
It will not be necessary.
She will do.
What?
I have not said it to you?
We wanted give a surprise
She will come to live with us.
It does not seem to you a good idea?
Clearly.
But?
you know?
"I thought that once married, we would be both single."
"Laura, here no."
You already know gossip that she is the doorman.
"We go, hide."
"-Either they come, or they come."
"she will not bother to you minimumly, on the contrary, it will help you, in house does everything."
She is insurmountable.
"Ah, yes?"
What time is it?
Four and the average one.
You want that it takes to house or to the consultation?
"But, how?"
"I have postponed all the visits, we did not have that to happen together afternoon?"
You can stay as long as you like.
Based on true stories
"The police are searching for Robert Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie who disappeared earlier this evening from her home."
What are you doing to find her?
- Sarah Lund
- Who is this?
- The girl's all fight.
I'm collecting on a debt.
I have a suggestion - a life for a life.
"I'll get Zeuthen, you'll get the girl."
Emilie!
No!
The perpetrator listened to you.
You made him think twice.
- I saw him shoot her.
- Did you?
"Sarah Lund, Juncker and Borch have gone to Jutland."
The perpetrator may have spared Emilie.
He won't finish until he knows what happened back then.
- We don't know what happened.
- He shot her and threw her in the water.
- I can't feel it.
- And the investigation in Jutland?
We haven't found anything to show that your daughter is alive.
You could say that mourning is love without a home.
Don't!
"Let me out, damn it!"
I've decided to resign as Prime Minister.
The assistant public prosecutor had another meeting that day.
- I won't argue over Emilie's grave.
- They say she may still be alive.
He fell off a building.
Don't you read the papers?
"Listen, Sheriff, I'm really sorry... to have awoken you from your slumber, but it's over."
Hands are tied now.
You shut me down.
Listen to me.
You're IA.
That's why I came to you.
You can do whatever you want.
"Remember you came to me, said, ""You wanna be a cop?"" I'm bein' a cop."
- I offered you a chance.
- I'm asking you for some help.
I need to do something.
I need to do this for myself.
"Listen, you deaf fuck."
I offered you a chance.
"When we could have done something, I offered you a chance to be a cop... and you blew it!"
You blew it.
You people are all the same.
"That cupcake makes a mess, we got a case again."
The mob runs millions in drugs through their precinct... and everybody gets a nice house.
Figgs is right.
The mob owns this town.
"They closed the case, Freddy."
- If they don't have the stomach for it—
- They had to.
It's circumstantial.
You don't have anything either.
All that stuff is illegal.
You stole it.
I know this guy.
He's a corrections officer.
"- If he keeps giving us hundred dollars bills,"
- he can have all the vanilla milkshake he want!
- Ow!
I just don't understand why we have to do any of this.
"Well, if you want him to sign off, these are his terms."
"Yes, but it makes no sense."
It's not like she's asking him for anything.
"Sit down, love."
"So, Callie, we heard back from Robert Quinn's lawyer."
- Ok.
"- And he won't sign anything until there's a DNA test, to prove that you're his daughter."
So...
I seriously can't handle sharing the gym with the wrestlers anymore.
- The gym smells like feet.
"- Well, that's appetizing."
And all the boys ever do is stare at us.
Pervs.
"Well, it's not awesome for me either, hearing guys talk about how hot my sister is."
- Which guys?
"- Besides, I see the dance team checking us out too."
"That Hayley girl, can't take her eyes off me."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Hayley, the one with the college boyfriend Hayley?"
She dates boys in college?
None of the girls on the dance team date boys in high school.
- Oh.
We'll see about that.
- Better not let Emma hear you.
"Please, I can handle Emma."
What?
I pretty sure no one handles Emma but Emma.
"Hey, Brandon!"
"There is a place called Congo Square and this was the only place in the South where black people could actually have drums, 'cause that was outlawed."
"Sunday at Congo Square, these cats played that music to commune with their ancestral spirits."
That caused Europeans to start coming out on Sundays to check what was going on.
"This famous pianist,"
"I think his last name was Gottschalk, he wrote this thing called the ""Bamboula."""
His music was based on what he heard being played at Congo Square.
That was part of our natural evolution.
"What you doing tomorrow, Dave?"
- What's that?
- What you doing tomorrow?
Singing.
Nothing.
Feel like coming by my aunt's house and jamming?
- Yeah!
Absolutely.
- Cool.
- Could I?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
Okay.
"- Sure, yeah!"
"She'll cook for us, too."
"That's the way we used to do it back in the day, with Jessie Hill, Professor Longhair, Dr. John."
- Go by her house...
"- Oh, my God, I would love to."
That'd be so fun.
The importance of the music to the people is what really blew me away.
How you doing?
"- How you making out, man?"
- All right.
"- This is my aunt, man."
- Hello.
"I mean, you can go back to college if you want."
You can take classes.
"Writing, photography."
You can travel if you want.
"The point is, we have options."
Why can't you be happy?
I would be happier if we had coffee.
OK.
No.
"We swore for the sake of our sisterhood that we would never, ever ask each other to double date again."
"Oh, come on, Sarah."
We were 19 years old.
"That is ancient history and besides,"
I already told Robert that you would come.
"It's ""Robert"" now."
"I have seen the birthmark on his butt, so we're on a first name basis."
Would you just come on?
Lt'll be fun.
One thing Joe and I are not at the moment is fun.
I'd say we're downright gloomy.
"Well, shake it up."
Get out.
"Yeah, right."
Um...
"Intensive couples counseling didn't work, but a good dinner out, that'll fix everything."
I know you and Joe have been having a hard time.
"If I honestly believed staying home was going to help,"
- I'd drop it.
- There's a problem.
"OK, listen."
Fine.
"But if it's a complete disaster, don't say I didn't tell you."
Good to see you.
All right.
"Let's all get back to work, for chrissake, okay?"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
- What's this from A.P.D?
- Been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me?
Yeah.
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
Hey.
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"Now, if you just tell me who your supplier is I think this can end very well for you."
"What are you doing, detective, talking to my client without me present?"
You sneaky Pete.
Which is which?
"What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to baby face?
"Yes, I believe it is customary."
I suppose we go on the deck and into the matter comfortably.
I'll get my wrap.
"There we are, my sweet."
Bermuda.
"We'll ride bicycles and everything, won't we?"
I myself prefer a horse and the open range.
With the vine fanning my cheeks.
And the stars for me guide.
"What was that, Jason?"
- What was what?
- What you just said.
"I don't know, my dear."
I'm afraid I wasn't listening.
[ship horn blowing]
The pilot boat.
"I must get this letter off, my dear."
You'll pardon me.
"You'll hurry back, won't you, Jason?"
I'll be back before you can say abracadabra.
Abracadabra.
Have you tried the cut-rate ticket brokers?
I've tried everyone.
Everywhere.
Nobody wants to put money into a show with a black eye.
"- Oh, if father only had..."
- Your father isn't responsible.
I went into the show because I liked it.
I thought it had good possibilities.
It's no great tragedy.
There'll be other shows.
But what about now?
Whoever doesn't think before talking will surely accept their punishment
I fell asleep.
How long did I sleep?
Plenty of time.
I didn't want to wake you up
What are the noises?
I have no idea
"Look, they are nicely shaped"
That's right
Attention
"İbrahim, these..."
These sculptures are the gift of his Majesty for me
Don't you like them?
"No, not that"
But what will my mother think about them?
"My Sultana, if you allow me I'd like to introduce someone to you"
Who?
Malkochoğlu
It is a great honor to meet you
"I wanted you to meet to Malkoçoğlu Bali Bey, my Sultana"
"He's a very brave, valuable Bey"
He brought the sculptures to here
So that's you
I heard nice things about you
How are you?

We were told by the police commissioner that the car was brought to this garage.

- You have to be patient.
We get four or five hundred cars here a day.
Monsieur Devereaux is an important guest ofthis country.
He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation ofyour government.
Here are his credentials from the French consulate.
"Unless you wish to see this in his film, I suggest you locate the car immediately."
"You're in a no-smoking area, sir."
Would you please extinguish your cigarettes?
"What was the weight ofthe car when you got it, Irv?"
4795 pounds.
You sure?
That's what it was.
4795 pounds when it came into the shop.
Owner's manual says 4675.
That's 120 pounds overweight.
And when it was booked into Marseilles it was 4795.
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.
"Listen, I ripped everything outta there except the rocker panels."
"Come on, Irv."
What the hell is that?
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
All right.
"I got it for you, Randy."
Itjust came in from downtown.
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr Devereaux.
Why?

I didn't mean to.
Zucco.
Talk to me.
[Man] He's dead.
You have a phone call in my office.
"Don't give me that fishy look, Doctor."
You just got a nicer job than we do.
[Bystanders Chattering]
[Walton] Plenty of shotgun shells and wire and a box for an alarm clock.
There's a receipt for it.
Alarm clock?
"Well, that didn't figure in the analysis of the last explosion."
"According to the receipt, he just bought it at the corner drugstore sometime today."
But it's not here now.
"I'm gonna stick my neck out, Kojak."
"I think he made a bomb today, and it's not here."
So you think he's got one ticking out there somewhere now... a time bomb?
[Walton] Yeah.
Yeah.
Send Crocker up here with everything I ought to see.
[Seymour] Then it's true.
Danny's dead.
"Sure, he's dead."
"The big, bad copper didn't like what he said in here, so he plugged him."
"The big, bad cop didn't like what he said in here, and you wanna know why?"
Because he's been going around this city killing people.
"Now, if you have any plans, you better get on the phone right now and give your apologies."
Are you saying that this invisibility thing means I might not be able to get beer?
I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee and bagels and rent.
Rent?

Unacceptable.

Huh.

"That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin was her fiancé."
"Ted, I'm desperate."
"Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff and I got a partial for Marshall."
Did you bang that girl yet?
"Don't get your hopes, or anything else, up."
"I tried to connect with her, but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am."
"Well, j-just go simple-- does she like TV?"
No.
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you as loud and as long as you want.
Sports?
No.
"But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard, just... slathered in Bengay."
"Well, does she like books?"

"Hey, baby."
I thought you came here to quit your job.
I forgot about the hoop.
Yeah.
"I thought if I could just do one thing in that letter,"
"I wouldn't feel like such an old sellout, so I came out here to dunk."
Did it make you feel better?
"I barely grazed the bottom of the net, and now my legs hurt so bad, I can't even fall down."
(LAUGHING) Wow!
How could you?
"Ted, I challenged myself to get laid wearing overalls."
"And if you stand in my way, then you're letting Barney win."
And you don't want that.
That smug son of a bitch will never let us hear the end of it.
"Oh, thank God."
Maggie...
Where do you think you're going?
- To tell that girl I love her.
"- Get in line, bub."
Yeah.
"I'm going to have sex with her, then he's going to tell her he's in love with her, and then you can do whatever you want."
Do we agree on the order?
Mister!
Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
"Now, then, play the whole thing through and play it properly."
"Yes, sir."
Left.!
Left.!
"Left, right, left.!"
"No, no, no!"
That's where we go... down!
"- Oh, it's you again."
"- Yes, I thought it only courteous... to return your visit of last night."
- May I come in?
Thank you very much.
- What do you want?
I just want to talk.
If you'll overlook this informal visit...
I'll forgive you for slighting me in the dining room.
- Spicy little spot you have here.
- I wish you wouldn't follow me.
I'm not following you.
"As much as I'd like to, I'm not following you."
I'm here to do you a good turn— and at the risk of my life too.
Oh!
Very inefficient.
I think you'd better go.
I've had just about enough of this nonsense.
Have you got a license for that machine?
You could be put in jail.
"I was quite aware of that, but don't come any closer."
I can't help it.
You're so irresistible.
- Please don't come near me.
- Would you point that thing away?
There you are.
"I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect..."
- I know.
You said it before.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I'm not worried.
- I'll have it by the end of the week.
"In the meantime, I suppose you'd like some spending money."
"Here, here's 500."
I'll take that.
It'll take me a few days to get settled.
"By that time, you can get that dough together and tell me where I come in."
Where you come in?
What do you mean?
"What business you want me to handle, what parts of town and what my cut is."
- Your cut?
- Yeah.
"That was the idea, wasn't it?"
"I took the rap, three years."
"You took the dough, made connections, built it up."
For you and me.
Wasn't that it?
"Oh, I see."
Yes.
I understand but you've got this thing all wrong.
"See, I work for Keefer."
He's the boss.
I haven't anything to say.
"If you want a spot in his business, why you'll have to take it up with him."
"Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up with anybody but you."
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm taking up with you where I left off.
"That was the agreement, and we're going to stick to it."
Out of my way!
Now you're here to bribe me with wine?

You sure you had that pistol set to stun?
Captain.
I hope you understand if there'd been any other way....
"You were protecting our mission, Trip."
I would have done the same thing.
"Still, I never thought I'd find myself pointing a weapon at you... no matter what the circumstances."
"Let's put this behind us, okay?"
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It's time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the Bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
ARCHER:
I've had plenty.

Okay.

"- Hello, Lucas."
- My hand's too dirty.
I'll start on another room.
Does he always drink?
He's disappointed for me.
Loyalty is always more passionate than reason.
I guess that's why I came to see you first.
There was sentiment for making you principal.
"Please don't feel uncomfortable, Mr. Rossi."
My time came too late.

- Of course we can.

I was nominated for a Daytime Emmy and now they're treating me like some day player.
"OK, we've parked at inspiration point so you can bitch about your job?"

Wait.
Wait.
So you are gay.
"No, man."
But it doesn't mean I don't think you're hot.
Wait.
What about your girlfriend?
She doesn't mind.
I've seen her make out with tons of girls.

"Oh, nothing."
"Bob just went for his physical today... and he's gotta lose weight, so he's gotta watch his calories for a while."
"Oh, that's"
- That's bad.
"No, it isn't, Howard."
A lot of people are on diets.
"Oh, no, no."
This is a bad diet.

"I mean, that's what you should be counting."
"- Well, what do you suggest, Howard?"
- Water.
You should drink water.
"I mean, just drink all your water you can get inside yourself."
"You know, just lots and lots of water."
"That way it'll fill up your stomach, and you won't get hungry."

"Sideburns, no cans."

"So why can't she come in, Ted?"
She can come in.
In six and a half months.
Wait.
Are you saying she's...
Twenty.
And a half.
Almost.

Ah-ah!
"Hold up, guys."
She had to bounce.
"Um, a flash mob broke out in front of a line of Korean-Mexican food trucks in Williamsburg."
The only thing that would make her more of a 20-year-old is an ironic form
- of transportation.
- Yeah.
She's roller skating there.
I don't know which is more pathetic-- that you're going out with a 20-year-old or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.
I didn't buy this to get a date.
"I just happened to be out catching up on some Saturday afternoon leather cuff shopping, Oh."
and she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.
"God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos."
"Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life just seems sad and empty."
"I don't want this to sound too harsh, Ted, but you disgust me."
"Until a month ago, your headboard had a lube dispenser."
"Uh, yeah."
"We got rid of that, okay?"
Yeah.
-What's ridiculous about it?
"Come on, don't jerk me off."
This is me you're talking to.

"What's the matter, Adriana?"
You and Christopher arguing?
"It's a stressful time, right before a wedding."
A lot of guys get cold feet.

"There, you happy?"
We put you guys on the mailing list for Hazelden.

-Harry!
Hi.
I'm telling the truth.
I'm not sad.
I'm not.
You...
Face reality.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
You're lying!
Shoot!
I let her influence me and spoke lines not in the script.
I'm lying?
Why do you say I'm lying?
Because...
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
What do I do?
I can't counter her...
"Oh, right."
Because Dad carries my photo with him every day.
"This line... ""Because Dad carries my photo with him every day... """
That's supposed to be Lola's line.
Angel was pressured by Gong Xi into speaking Lola's line.
"Next, Angel's line should be..."
Dad carries around pictures of our brother and me every day too.
He doesn't just keep your picture.
They really did swap lines.
"Gong Xi made Angel say Lola's lines, and then changed Angel's lines into Lola's."
She actually has the ability to make Angel automatically collaborate with her performance.
Angel fell into her trap.
"No matter how busy Dad is, he always shows up for my piano recitals."
"That's because if he doesn't show up, people will criticize him behind his back."
He...
Um ...
"No, thank you."
Don't you like cookies?
"Yea, but ..."
I feel kinda bad now.
Don't be ridiculous.
Are those oatmeal ?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong ?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in these ?"
Why are you looking at us funnny ?
"No, no...no"
It's just that you girls are not what I expected.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you've any milk ?
I hate to interrupt or anything but... don't you think you girls should better reload ?
"Excuse me, but what is your deal ?"
I rather not discuss it.
Why not?
"That's my business, that's why why not."
What's the big...
I thought for sure they'll send professionals.
They did !
Then why is that matter I don't want to discuss ?
Wouldn't you be curious if you were us?
There's a place around the corner if you need more ammo.
We got ammo!
Then let's get this show on the road!
I'm expecting company.
What kind of company ?
I'd rather not say.
Braiding each other's hair and having heart-to-hearts.
Then why are we still here?
we've already paid the check.
Serena.
- So we'll meet afterwards for the party. - will do.
"- Good luck up there, son. i'm proud of you."
- Thanks.
It's like getting a smile from the president.
And how are you?
I'm good. and you?
"Good, good. i start my internship"
At the mayor's office next week.so that's the big news.
As for today i got my mom and my grandpa
To agree to sit together so that's something.
- And things with you and
- Blair?
"Yeah, it's over. but it's okay."
"It turns out,we just had to go through something to be sure."
Ever since it ended i can't stop thinking
About how horribly i handled everything between us.
So i just wanted to say i'm sorry.
Thanks.
It means a lot. and thanks for what you did last year.
If i hadn't taken the s.a.t.s i'd never be going to n.y.u.
Right after i get back from my
"Backpacking trip through europe, of course."
Look at us--so civilized.
Hey stop by my party tonight.
Party?
what party?
After-grad party.
I figured i'd at least do something
"I'm not wasting your time, am I?"
I lost my job.
I screwed up and word got out to the whole industry.
No one wants to hire me.
So I'm free everyday.
"I should say that's great, right?"
So you can rest.
Okay?
No more black circles around your eyes.
I retouched under my eyes for you.
I will erase the rash for you too doc.
Actually our occupations have a lot in common.
I don't know if you still want to die.
"But you are not allowed to, got it?"
You must get better.
Okay?

Jerd you make Thai people proud.
Wow you've come a long way my friend.
Congratulations bro.
It looks like a funeral in black and white.
My boyfriend wants it more dreamy.
What do you mean dreamy?
You know dreamy.
The fact you took these at the park is lame.
Don't tell me you want pink grass too.
Just do it to make him happy.
He had a licensed revolver for security.
He had just got in a cab and inspector Varma ascended.
He had a pistol in hand.
"Your honour, Inspector Varma was in muRi."
"And you see, one's identification is not inscribed on his face."
My client took him for a crook.
And he tried to escape.
Then Mr Vijay threatened to shoot him.
To defend himself Mr Balwant fired at him.
It's not true.
It is baseless.
Because Mr Balwant vey well knows me as a police officer.
This is not our first encounter.
On the 16th of October I tried to arrest him at Malighat.
But he managed to escape.
- Wrong again.
"On the 16th of October, Mr Balwant was lying in the hospital and not in Malighat."
He was ill and was bed-ridden.
This medical certificate proves it.
"""Me and you in a locked house"""

Hello!
"Inspector, he..."
- What times!
A decent man like me... ..can't even walk on the streets!
"- Inspector, the fact is..."
What is the problem?
I was on my way to the beach for a swim.
He whistled at me and passed remarks at me.
- Lies!
I am seriously stressed up myself!
"You see it, don't you?"
"But that's slow, Freddy, fighting your way through traffic."
The goal is perpetual motion.
You want greens.
But how do you ensure the greens?
You can't.
"As in life, in traffic."
So what you do is you leave yourself an out.
"At every corner, you leave yourself an alternative."
You move diagonal.
You turn the wheel when you hit a red light.
You don't drive down Broadway to get to Broadway.
If you move diagonal... you're gonna get perpetual motion.
That's what you want.
But how does this apply to what you were saying in there?
"It applies, Freddy!"
It's just as easy to tail a man walking in front of him.
"You butt heads with these friends of ours, you're gonna come at them head-on?"
- Okay.
"- They got lives, Freddy."
Families.
No.
You move diagonal.
You jag.
Christ!
Where the fuck are you guys?
We're on our way- in 20.
I'm down.
"But Joey, he's tryin' to hold on... but this big bastard, he cut me up."
I need help!
- He's a fucking monster!
"- I need your location, Tom!"
- I need an assist.
"Gloria, here you have yours."
Thanks.
You help me?
"But, if you obtain to marry you with Alvaro..."
I will live like one lady.
-Yes.
"Good afternoon, Senator,"
You have seen that we have gotten dressed as you like it?
Very pretty!
Precious!
I am hoping to you with the full portfolio so that you make it to me happen well.
Beautiful.
He will see how we will try to him.
"Very well I am wishing, it."
"Today I am in form, girls."
"How much it is going to give to us, today?"
Today I feel more generous than ever.

So that wretch of Cicchirini me has spoiled it everything.
-And you have played it to you.
-Yes.
I have played it to me.
Boys?
we are going to give him to a lesson to that swine of Cicchirini?
-A double lesson.
-We will occur it.
"Iâm the one getting my ass kicked over here, itâs not you."
Horace.
"Yeah, I have children here, you don't know what that's like."

"Yeah, but I'm not gonna do that."
"What are you, crazy?"
Yeah.
"No, I can't do that."
Come here.
"Go downstairs, get mama a pack of cigarettes."
"Yeah, I know, I know, I know."
"I know, Abby."
"Oh, okay."
"- Well, Little Horace, when he was about six, he was in the little league and I coached his team, right?"
"And so he played right field, so right away, you know how good he is, right?"
"I mean, how many kids that age could hit it out to right field?"
"So he'd be out there, you know, picking his nose and staring off, and then one day, he comes running up to me in the middle of the game, up to the bench, he says,"
"(high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete,"
I gotta make a pee pee!
"I said, get the fuck back out on the field!"
What's the matter with you?
(laughter)
"He said, (high pitched) time out, Uncle Pete, I gotta make a pee pee!"
"I said, I don't care if you gotta make a doo-doo."
You don't stop in the middle of the game.
What are you doing?
"What is this, girls' softball?"
"And then he's crying like, wahh..."
"All right, all right, I had to call a time-out."
"So I say to the ump, time out."
"And then I go over to Horace, I said, okay, all right, come here."
"Here, come here."
Listen!
Dr. Kazamaki...!
Why are you so calm?

What do you mean?
"It's fine to affirm one's position... but left to your own devices, you're the type to brood, you know."
It's true that she may have been the one who changed your destiny...
"But if she hadn't come, it might have been the end for you of everything."
"You can't help worrying, suffering."
But you have many people depending on you now.
Don't forget that.
Yes...
I guess so.
"I'll kill him, I'll kill him, I'll definitely kill him!"
"I kill him, I'll kill him..."
What are they doing in there?

--What!
You numbskull!
What happened in there?
I won't tell!
"But, what if something terrible is happening...?"
"What God has joined together, let no man pull asunder."
What are you doing here?
We were to meet at the hotel.
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.
Weren't you to see your sister before the fight?
"I called her, she'll be at the hotel."
I had to promise we'd have supper at her bar tonight.
Whatever you say.
"A lovely ceremony, isn't it?"
Beautiful.
Ididn't think she was so young.
I guess you came because you didn't trust me.
I came because we can't go another day without talking.
You needn't worry.
It's over with Angela.
I've got proof.
During the ceremony I didn't cry.
But you did.
That's true.
And you needn't.
Don't you believe me?
It isn't that.
"It took me ten years to get over it, but I swear it's over."
Marco...
"Believe me, it's over."
Angela and I traveled a lot.
"The excuse was to write a travel guide on some exotic place, but really it was to keep her away from drugs, to escape from Madrid."
Life in Madrid was hell.
Our relationship only worked when we got away.
"After trying for five years and seven travel guides,"
"I brought her here to Lucena, to her parents."
"If you're thinking of turning this into some kind of witch-hunt,"
"I wouldn't recommend it, Phil."
"I wouldn't recommend it, Phil."

What I can't figure out is why is this guy gunning for me?
"Oh, no."
You called him.
Yes.
"Yes, I did."
I thought I could convince him to leave you alone.
You think you're the first lawyer to try and scare this asswipe?
He makes his living from screwing with people's lives.
You just egged him on!
You promised you wouldn't do anything.

He likes to play with me.
Silence heard by the heart.
Doctor told me that I can play now.
He must be very happy.
"Do you have any dreams, uncle?"
It's alright.
What's the fun if each one fulfills his own dream?
The fun lies in fulfilling others' dreams.
Are you the meaning of life?
It's said that God lives in children.
It seems to be true on seeing them.
Each one of them has a disease.
They forget all the sorrows and feel very happy since one of them has defied death.
Some of them will not survive inspite of good medication.
But some will survive.
But there is no money.
Look at him.
He will not survive for more than 4 days.
He too knows that.
But he forgot that  is happy that she has survived  he can play with her.
Who has disease?
We or they?
So many of them?
"If there are so many of them in our orphanage alone, think about the entire city, state  the country."
How many are there?
I need a list of all those children.
We went pillar to post to save one child.
I use it for exercises
Clementine...
I've come to a decision
I'm leaving with you.
It's all decided
If you agree
"I'll write my mother when we're there, explaining my decision"
When we arrive... where?
Wherever you're going
I packed a suitcase.
I'll be ready.
You'll see
I'll manage all the details
I'm sure you will
"Please, don't joke."
I can't stand it
I'll never cause you any problem
I'm the one who would cause you problems
I'm sick... finished
"Yes, I mean it."
I'm flat broke
Poverty doesn't scare me
You know what it is?

"Where he went, women used to adore him"
But he died penniless
"Good luck, sweetheart."
"We were just messengered the photos from the shooting... including the Polaroids of you and Paul, they are adorable!"
I'm just dissapointed that Paul missed my cue.
I gotta get the guy out of my head.
- I need some mental floss.
"- Sweetie, take a thought shower."
The important is that Editor Chief knows your triumph...
- and put you on staff.
- I guess...
You're going with me to pick up stationery from the colleaguer.
I've got to get this down to the messenger center by 6.
I'm totally going.
I'll just do a quick e-mail and we're off.

Pink!
The beauty is that he got a bony campaign with Calvin Klein...
- She was swallowing everything...
"- I'm sorry, have you seen Jocelyn?"
- The intern?
Absolutely not!
- Thank you.
"Jocelyn, I hear you got to do the Las Vegas shoot... com Roxanne."
Am I green or what?
"Oh, yeah!"
I'm so excited.
I see Resin found herself a new boyfriend.
Get a room!
- What about Paul?
- He's over Sabrina's heels.
what's it really about?
I want to become the person my mother can be proud of...
The person I can be proud of.
"Well, for the record, you made a believer out of me."
"You know, this would make one hell of a story."
"No, no."
I am a private detective.
"No, thanks."
Thank you.

- Hey.
Just came to make sure you were okay.
I get it now.
"By rescuing Amanda, you were saving a part of yourself."
"I guess if you want to have a future, you have to make amends with your past, right?"
And you're off to a flying start.
You want to get something to eat?
"Uh, thanks, but I have to take my mother to dinner."
I told her I needed to clear the air.
I predict a complete success.
You don't know my mother.
But I know you...
And I am always in your corner.
"Am I moving your stuff to my place all alone, or are you gonna help me?"
I'm helping.
I'm packing memories.
You know I actually five pounds lighter than I was in high school?
Do you know that none of your glasses actually match?
I don't even know how a person does that.
"Hey, same haircut, you ask?"
"Same barber, I say."
Thank you.
Did I fail?
No.
I...
I'm sorry.
Um...
Did I fail?

Most patients come to rosewood in order to relax and recuperate away from the harsh
day-to-day life outside of these gates.
"Some patients, however, they're faced with more advanced challenges."
"But not to worry, patients like that are kept in a separate wing from ladies such as yourself, miss Porter."
Shall we?
Of course.

Okay.
Okay?
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?

This is just what I need.
I feel better already.
I'll come visit you soon.
Take care.

Amy.
Amy.
Let's wrap things up out there.
"Um, good night, Stuart."
Good night.
SHELDON:
"Take the hint, Stuart."
"The lady said ""Good night."""
How did you get into my apartment?
Wow.
Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girlfriend?
Good thing I drew this up.
What's that?
I present to you the relationship agreement.
"A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as ""the boyfriend,"""
"and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as ""the girlfriend"""""
It's so romantic.
Mutual indemnification always is.

"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was.
Once.
- I got donuts.
They got jelly.
- (CHUCKLES)
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix at this high-end jewelry place.
"The manager was a drunk, and he would forget to lock the case with the expensive watches."
Neal...
I resisted.
Twice.
"Third time, this guy's just asking to get took."
"So, I grabbed a couple of cases of watches, and I hopped on a train to Portland."
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed them in a locker at the train station."
"They're still there, so that's hardly stealing."
"Well, so you got away clean?"
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras were stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
- You don't have to do this.
- Please.
- Please.
It will be safer if you stay quiet.
BROYLES:
Her name's Christine Hollis.
"Twenty-seven years old, in the master's program for fine arts at BU."
"Far as we can tell, she's no one special."
"Parents deceased, no siblings, no arrests."
Twenty-seven hundred dollars in her bank account.
- Nothing unusual at all.
- Do we have a home address?
We're working on it now.
Assuming she's still alive.
We have no reason yet to think otherwise.
"Well, that's just it, isn't it?"
We don't know what to think.
I'm lost.
"Twenty-four years ago, one of them saved Walter and Peter."
Walter doesn't know why.
Can't remember.
"But beyond that, everything we know about these guys the little that there is, suggests that they just watch."
They don't get involved.
But now...
Figure out why he took this girl.
What makes her the exception?
"Do that, and I think you'll find him."
PETER:
"Hey, I think we may have a lead on the Observer."
"Walter, look at this."
In his book.
I think that might be blood.
You must really suffer from the terrifying clarity of your vision.
Thank you.
I do suffer.
Thank you.
Take a look at this screenplay.
I kind of dashed it off.
It's about the New York poet Frank O'Hara.
He had a beautiful nose like a boxer.
"Yeah, I know."
I love his nose.
He got run over by a dune buggy on Fire Island.
"Anyway, I'd like you to think about doing a rewrite on this."
- George has my number.
- Thank you for this opportunity.
I love your work and I can't wait to read this.
Thanks.
Did you have this script made for me?
My name's on the cover.
Now when you give someone a script to read it's kind of standard practice to laser print their name on every page.
I see.
"This is not a big deal, but my name is misspelled."
"There's no ""O"" at the end."
"It's ""Jonathan"", not ""Jonathon""."
"Yeah, man, I don't know."
It's not really important.
But call me tomorrow and it's really great to meet you.
Great to meet you.
"Thank you, Jim Jarmusch."
Do you know Jim Jarmusch?
He's my favorite director of all time.
His films are like poems that come to life.
It's really interesting.
"- Unless Mary helps him, of course."
- Of course.
"Rotten for you, Christine."
I got the fright of my life.
Did you see him come after me?
"Writers can do fine things but when they crack up, they're a menace."
"Here, dry your tears."
An emergency.
"Sit down here, I'll phone you a cab."
I'll come back and tell you what Gerard said about you.
- Feeling sad?
- Yes.
Where do you live?
"Let me take you home, I'm going that way."
"- No, they're getting me a cab."
- That'll take ages.
Come on.
- You wind surf?
Any good at it?
"- Yes, out at sea and in the harbor."
- Among the big tankers.
- lsn't that dangerous?
It's child's play.
Want me to teach you?
"No, it's not my sort of thing, but I'll come and film you some time."
"Oh, any time."
"1938, when Sino-Japanese War was like a raging fire."
"And the countries were fighting each other,"
"Atomic fission was first tested by German Scientists, which would lead to the world's destruction."
"If this was exploited by Hitler,"
The entire human race will be annihilated.
Why are you standing?
How does one start this engine?
I have cursed you.
You won't forget your fears until you disappear.
I cursed you.
Solomon?
What are you doing?
Whom are you sacrificing our children for?
You betrayed God.
"Pestilence, diseases and troubles are happening because of you."
Your betrayal will bring blood and sufferings to our people.
"You betrayed, you betrayed..."
"I don't know what to do, Garik."
I thought that I had one person who could help me.
But it turned out that he is dead.
"I'm alive, thank God."
Stop that!
I know that I'm ill.
You and many other people don't exist.
You're looking for reality in an unreal world.
It's like looking for God for He is the only reality.
Do you get it?
The rest is the illusion of the Creator.
"Garik, shut up!"
You're dead.
May be you died?
Maybe you were devoured by your mega-centre.
I look at your paying for your wealth.
I think I made a right decision.
"I built my own real world, my family and my life."
But I'm grateful to you.
I won't be happy without you.
I may want to live differently now-- quite differently.
I'm even stopping off on the way to the train to buy a new sport jacket.
[chuckles]
"Mr. Sandover, your wife is here."
My wife?
What in heaven's name?
She said she stopped by because you didn't pack your sweater.
"All right, all right."
Thank you.
I told her she could put the sweater in one of your bags.
I showed her where the luggage was in the office.
I said all right.
Thank--
"Beth, here, give me that."
Of all the things I don't need on the desert.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
But I suppose I didn't kiss you goodbye this morning.
All right.
There.
"Now run along, dear, for heaven's sakes."
"Sandy, I ran into Frank Sellers in the hall downstairs."
He said he was surprised to hear I hadn't wanted to go to Phoenix with you.
He said the company would gladly have paid--
"Beth, how you could have worked here all of these years and still be so stupid and gullible--"
"Sandy, you're upset about something."
You know you are.
"You didn't eat your breakfast this morning and last night you talked in your sleep again about waterskiing, of all things."
Please leave me alone.
Go home.
"Sandy, of course I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow."
I've already made my reservations.
[whistle blowing]
"With that planning to kill wife, throwing bombs on police, and escaping to Malaysia on fake passports."
Go and tell her.
What's this man?
Game.
Is it good?
"He's not a patient, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"Being a doctor, I say this."
"No, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"No, he doesn't have memory loss."
Trust me.
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that."
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that...?"
"Actually, he told me that I am a doctor."
Aren't you a doctor?
It's okay you knew it.
But don't tell him.
He will beat me to pulp.
Hey you patient...
Where were you?
Did you find anything about him?
I found everything about him.
What?
Does he remember his past?
I saw my future.
Don't play with him.
He will cover your face and beat you up.
Stop talking nonsense.
Are you playing games with me?
Everyone thinks they have started the game.
"But actually, we are all players in his game."
Excuse me for barging in on you so soon after a long trip.
That's no problem.
I touched this up on the train back from Kyoto.
"You may not find it suitable for a textbook, but here you go."
When can I get paid?
Soon.
"Scholars don't live on air, you know."
We'll get it to you as soon as we can.
"Come to think of it, would you send it to my school?"
Huh?
"Oh, I understand."
You have to put more expression into it.
"Ah, they're dancing."
"Yes, I'll go tell her you're home."
"Like this, see."
Mother!
Father's here!
Oh?
"Shinako, go say hello to your father."
"Namiko, are you asleep?"
Excuse me.
"That kimono looks really good on you, Mother."
Is that right?
I'll tell you about clothes.
"Before the war, lacquer and colourful prints sold really well."
That's right.
Those are luxury goods.
"If a woman wore a luxurious kimono during the war, a woman exposed her asarakasa."
It would have been the picture of vulgarity.
"Father, you have a morning lecture, don't you?"
"Yes, but go on ahead."
I see.
"Well, with a diagnosis like mine, the goal is to keep the patient alive long enough for some new miracle drug to appear."
Daddy.
"Yes, my man?"
I want to play with you.
Okay.
"Well, I want to play with you, too."
Let's do it.
Oh.
Dad.
What's happening?
Take me back to the Cube.
The E.R. stopped the bleeding.
He's resting comfortably in his room.
What happened?
"Nose and mouth bleeds are common side effects of chemotherapy, but they can lower his platelet count, so your dad may need a platelet infusion."
That's... all it is?
Mm-hmm.
They'll run some tests to be sure.
"All right, come on."
Show me what you got.
Wait for it.
- There it is.
"- Oh, touchdown!"
- Right on cue.
"- No, no, no, what am I missing?"
"Spike in cerebral blood flow in his precuneus area, also known as ""the God spot."""
It's one of the several areas of the brain linked to spirituality.
"You see, as Jacob listens to music, his right brain is shutting down because he's entering a trance state."
"So, why is this happening to a man who's never been spiritual before?"
"- I don't know, but look at that."
- Mm.
"Oh, wow."
"I have never been one to believe that there's gonna be some knight in shining armor, and he pulls up into my driveway and sweeps me off my feet."
"But, you know, I really..."
I really never thought that it was gonna be this hard either.
"Oh, I..."
I have to go.
"So, thank you for not being a complete jerk about this."
Anytime.
Oh.
"And, uh... wish me luck."
"Then I said, ""You know, I know I'm supposed to be humble, but I'm better than that show."
"I mean, I can do more than play a Mafioso's son."
"At least give me a disease or a multiple personality or something."""
I can see how that'd be frustrating.
"And then finally I just said to him, ""Look, I'm not renewing my contract."""
"So, Kev, you got a boyfriend or something?"
"Uh, no."
"No, I don't."
"And, uh, h... how..."
how did you know I was gay?
I got a lot of gay friends.
"It's so much easier hanging out, you know?"
None of that alpha male weirdness.
- So you're not...?
- Gay?
- Yeah.
- No.
My girlfriend's got a theory we're all a little bit gay.
Right.
"Well, right."
"Well, I'm..."
"I'm pretty much fully gay, so..."
- So you have a girlfriend?
But thank you for the invitation all the same.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
"Henry and I would like to thank you all very much for coming, and Lady Felicia, of course, for all your kindness."
25 years sounds a lot.
"Some of you will know it's not been our easiest year but we've stuck though it, together, like we always have."
"And, well, I think that's the secret of a happy marriage, really."
"So thank you, and enjoy your evening."
What about Edie?
"Red Lion, anyone?"
"Ready to sweep all before you tomorrow, Mrs M?"
Tomorrow?
"Oh, you mean the flower show."
"That's just a bit of fun, isn't it?"
"Now, what can I do for you?"
About George...
You can save your breath.
You clearly put him up to that little stunt.
"Mrs M, you've got it all wrong."
He did come and see me but only because he was feeling nervous.
He'd wanted to ask you out for lunch for a very long time.
"He seems a jolly decent chap, and I think he really likes you."
Was there anything else?
No.
Only that Gerard's Brasserie is quite the place to be at the moment and the Dover sole is really rather good.
"Your Cosmos looks lovely, by the way."
Edie.
Tea's up!
George.
"Mrs McCarthy, good morning."
May I have a word?
"Yes, yes, of course."
Let me just...
We'll find her soon.
I've also looked for her.
"I thought she was in the gap, but she wasn't."
What gap?
The place she goes when she doesn't want to hear anymore.
- What doesn't Emilie want to hear?
- When you argue and stuff.
Let's go downstairs and get a cookie.
Come.
I've packed the basics for him.
We'll wait and see where he wants to sleep.
Any news?
Not yet.
Did Carl or Emilie ever mention a place they call the gap?
No.
Special Branch insist that their concern for the PM and the notebook meant nothing.
We need all the information.
They must have a copy of the numbers.
The head of Special Branch will come in the morning to explain.
- Did Burch say anything to you?
- No.
Any news on the perp?
We don't know how he got your number.
He returned to Zeeland as a stowaway on a train.
We fauna' blood matching his.
- Did no one see anything?
- No.
- But we have the lab results.
"- Hi, don't tum on the heating."
"The preliminary tests of the perp's DNA indicate with 99% certainty, that he's Louise Hjelby's biological father."
I've set things in motion.
"The father's unknown, so dig up more on the mother."
"Because when I go, I go."
JIMMY GUFFAWS
The little mashed potato monster's on his case.
"OK, Paul, I can tell you Anthony Joshua is not on our list."
THEY SIGH
But Joshua won his big fight against Vladimir Klitschko at Wembley.
"But the weird thing was, no-one seemed to know what the fight was about."
"Normally a girl, innit?"
"OK, all right."
"Fingers on buzzers, one more to go."
"OK, what do you think?"
David Beckham.
"David Beckham, what, you think he's very popular?"
"Well, everyone loves him."
He's getting more and more handsome by the day.
It's like a disease he's got.
"You've been cured, I see!"
Yeah...
"You knock 'em up, I'll hit it..."
I mean...
Aw.
You're a very handsome man.
"No-one's denying it, they're just reassuring you."
"Let's have a look at David Beckham talking about his tattoos, in this enlightening clip from 2000."
"What is this, David?"
It's a new tattoo I'm thinking about having.
I wanted a new tattoo for ages but I just couldn't... not think.
"I've known what I've wanted because I wanted something to do with Victoria, Victoria's name."
And I think it'd look...
"We've both agreed it'd look a bit tacky if I had ""Victoria"", just in English, down there."
So I've gone for Arabic.
Why?
It's remarkable.
Tremendous.
"Look, at long last."
The Temple of Ages!
This statue's extraordinary.
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't think it's a statue.
You're right.
I believe we have discovered
Solon himself.
"He must have been caught in a volcanic eruption, and covered in hot ash."
Like the bodies at Pompeii.
He's hanging on to something here.
It's the platinum book.
"Yes, like the page we found inside the Ark."
"Yes, well I think I'd better hold onto that."
Might just help defray some of my traveling expenses.
Look!
The gods march in rank.
"The riddle says when the planets are aligned, we'll find the Treasure of Atlantis."
Where is it?
The red crystal.
The one in the observatory?
We forgot the second line of the riddle.
"""Hecate races in the heavens."""
The planets alone isn't enough to reveal the treasure.
It takes something more.
Hecate has to appear.
Who the devil's Hecate?
A demon of the night who rides a chariot of fire.
There she is.
A meteor shower.
- Right.
"Okay, well, I'm gonna go."
This is long distance.
"Yeah, it is long distance."
"So, see you."
Yeah.
See you.
Mom?
What's wrong?
I'm experiencing frustration.
At the general state of things in the world or something in particular?
What do you wear to a graduation?
- A cap and gown.
- I mean underneath.
Whatever you want.
The gown will cover it.
It's complicated.
I don't want to overdress... so I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium.
"But if I don't have enough on and it's cold, I'll freeze."
"It is complicated, especially if you over think it."
I need a helpful comment.
Take light layers.
Wear your turquoise-and-tan dress you just got.
It's cool and it will look good without your gown on.
Wear your turquoise sweater over it.
It will look great with the dress... and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.
- You are a fashion genius.
- You taught me everything.
- My brain's not working.
- You're excited.
It's a big day.
What time will you get there?
Excuse me.
Is everything okay?
Everything's not okay.
- Hold on.
You give him an hour with the actors?
That's a joke.
Stop and think before you open your mouth and don't tell me it's a joke.
So that's why it is in the makeup room?
"Do it in the stairwell, for all I care."
Stop overreacting.
You're doing it wrong.
Then tell me how to do it.
"He's here after so many years and is so excited, you could at least give him a proper welcome."
"Believe me, I tried."
- I don't believe you.
"After he got out of jail,"
I asked him to direct in the basement hall.
He got up and left.
"I fought with everyone who didn't want to see his face in this building, and there were lots, there still are."
"You deserve a medal, Alex."
"- The next day, he changed his mind."
"Maybe Mother spoke with him, I don't know."
But he called and said he'd accept my offer.
I sent him the play.
"It was small, but it was a gem."
We chose the cast and scheduled a rehearsal.
"He stuttered, lashed out at the actors, came unprepared, the actors said they wouldn't work with him."
That was a long time ago.
What about the big stage?
Why not there?
"Hello, Yitzhak."
Zeltzer.
Debriefing at 10:00am.
"Stop it, no one will be up at 10.00am. Not even youl"
Wanna bet?
No.
"You'd lose, there's no point."
"By the way, I owe you 10 euros."
I thought you were a heavy sleeper -
I've been ringing your bell for 10 minutes.
Get lost.
I should be the one who's angry.
"Since you lost the case, you pretended to be into me while running after Ronaldo on the sly."
I didn't suddenly become your type overnight.
Why are you doing this?
What do you gain by sleeping with me?
And you?
Fifteen years ago I totally messed up with you.
This time I don't want to miss my chance.
Would it be a problem that you've become my type?
Get up.
Judge Morel just called.
She found you a home.
You've got 15 minutes to get ready.
Where is it?
- Pantin.
You will go and see her after and start reimbursing what you stole.
Have you got any money on you?
"If you mean the 200 euros, I spent it all."
- And how are you going to manage?
- It's not a problem.
It's not a problem to find 200 euros?
I've got as much cash as I want.
It just pisses me off to earn it the way I do.
"When I think about my vocation,"
"Say it: ""whores""."
one should...
Life doesn't scare me anymore.
Put them down?
"Here's the only Venom still alive, the untouchable, the only one that never touched me."
The one that lights the match!
I don't want the penguins splattered in ketchup.
Especially not in front of the fuzz.
"Enjoy your meal, gentlemen!"
"""Ministers of Integrity""!"
"Thank you, show's over."
It's not over for me.
You gave me a theater as payment for a quickie.
"I resented you, and went crazy about that innocent."
"He burst out of his Hungarian shithole, out of his mind, then began fucking things up for everyone."
The innocent is a dog.
I bought him back from this harlot
- I was wrong.
Do you still want me?
I want everything.
"Whereever you want, whenever you want."
As long as it's now.
"And I want him to see it, OK?"
Search him.
The wax of the seventh seal drips on the butcher's fingers.
The lamb is ready.
"Here, if you please - same as them."
Am I frightening you?
Lower.
Where it's real.
Where it smells.
"Well, if I'm afraid, I'll call on you, you little slut."
Small since when?
I'm plenty grown up!
"More than is good for you, right?"
Not at all!
But I'm already outgrowing the clothes...
Everyone can tell that.
See for yourself!
Have a look.
"Well, what's already there..."
Don't be so sure.
- If you've set yourself up here...
"- Stop it, ok?"
"Can I come visit then, Bruno?"
This is no children's playground!
Can I have a drag?
Why are you shaking like that?
Give it back!
Just what I'd need - have people say that I seduced a minor into smoking.
Come over here...
What do you want?
Come here already!
It's my sister!
Take care that you're not caught here!
Maybe one could stretch a few clothes lines from pillar to pillar?
Or across here...
"Or at right angles so that the whole thing would get more class, become slightly more stylish."
So that things are not hanging around here like... in a pawnshop.
There are more 100 valuable costumes here.
He wants to unpack his stuff.
All the baskets?
Termination!
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your führer would approve.
"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
-I found him.
-Where?
There.
"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
Monsieur...
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this...
Jewish ritual.
Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
"Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your führer?"
"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
"I'm going to blow up the Ark, Rene."
Your persistence surprises even me.
"Hey, Janice."
-You and your boyfriend got me.
-l don't know what you mean.
"Well, I got a hot flash for you."
You don't got dick.
I'm gonna ace the drug test and take the results...

What did Dee Dee's mother want?
"Look, let's talk in the interview room, all right?"
I hope you're not paying attention to what she says.
According to her...
... DeeDeestillhad her cherry.
A stone junkie.
She still thought her daughter ran around in a convent school uniform.
I wish you didn't leave messages at my house.
Connie's worried.
You were down to work.
We tried reaching you.
What are you gonna do?
"More ""rub Mike's nose in it""?"
"""How could Roberts mess up on procedure?"""
-Procedure?
-l got overinvolved with a snitch.
"It's not a hanging offense, is it, guys?"
"Hey, do I need a PBA rep or a lawyer?"
I thought seven years working together counted for something. lt doesn't.
"In her diary, you threaten her life."
"Said you'd kill her if she calls your wife, which we heard her threaten."
KELLY:
Tell us what happened between you two before she died.
What are you saying?
You think I killed her?
"Are you fooling me, Brother Foon?"
"Master, if she bites me, what'll I do then?"
"If you switch her on by your tongue, she won't bit you, right?"
"Master, you are so nice to me."
"I am so nice to you, right?"
Yes.
Brother Yan.
Master.
Come here...
Ask her to stay in this room and don't leave.
"Later, water will come through this hole and aim at your face."
Stuff this pig's tongue into this hole.
Understand?
Yes.
Repeat once please.
Damn it!
"Later, a water-column will flush in through this hole."
"When you are damn wet, you stuff this damn pig's tongue into... this bloody hole."
You should have said in this way.
What a creep!
Let me have a second thought.
When Foon is kissing the pig's tongue which Yan's holding.
I'll be here to kiss Lotus.
"If she accused us,"
Foon will admit all the blames!
"Lotus will slap Foon severely, again and again and I'll go forward and kick him severely too."
"Lotus will lean on my chest, and I'll comfort her."
"I'll make her drunk, then I will..."
Who else can be the King of Brain-truster in this world except me?

We don't have a record of purchase of this cardiac regulator.
What difference does that make?
"If there's no record, it means that it was stolen from one of our facilities."
It's company policy for us to permanently deactivate all stolen tech.

If you just try not to compare him--
"-Oh, he was an officer?"
"-He was master sergeant in the Engineers Corps, decorated four times."
He had those on when you met him?
I assure you I wasn't just blinded by all the brass.
"-Oh, that's not what I--"
"-Of course, there--"
There were things to adjust myself to later on.
Such as his civilian background.
How did he take it when you said I was coming?
"-Oh, he's on the road a good deal."
"-Oh, he travels?"
Good.
"I don't know, but maybe we should start running."
I always thought your idea of having a combat base was crazy.
"Vila, I won't run."

Why the old colonies are being conquered so easily.
Then perhaps we can do something about it.

"Oh, and Trooper Orac here."
We need to know how they are doing it.
"It's possible that the Federation have some new weapon, something we don't know about."
- All the more reason to start running now.

"He rushes to the hospital, gets there, the doctor comes out, and he says, I'm so sorry."
"Wait, why is he rushing to the hospital?"
"Oh, his wife was in an accident."
Wait.
I thought I just said that.
So where was I?
Um...
"Oh right, she was in an accident, and the doctor says, uh..."
What kind of accident?
"Again, so, worst shape possible."
"She basically lost all of her limbs, so, the doctor says, you know, and she may not be able to recognize you ever, ever again, and the husband says, oh my gosh, this is terrible news."
"And the doctor says, by the way, she's dead."
"She's, she's dead."
"So a man hears that his wife's in a horrible accident, he rushes to the hospital."
"When he gets there, the doctor says, I'm so sorry, but the accident has left your wife blind, deaf, and mute, and she'll never be able to recognize you again."
"The guy's like, oh my God this is terrible news, and that's when the doctor says,"
I'm just kidding.
She's dead.
It's funnier.
30 seconds.
"Man, it's really our last one."
Ssh.
"Wrap up, wrap up, wrap up."
Shit.
"We gotta go, we can't go this way."
Okay.
You ready?
- Yeah.
Look Mom!
Maybe she used to watch me from right here.
But she hated movies.
The only one we saw together was Dumbo.
Takizawa-kun!
I'm fine!
I wanna keep watching you.
Target acquired.
He's in front of the merry-go-round.
Finally found them...
How dare those jerks sneak off on a date...
Is this... thanks to you I remembered that I once lived in New York.
Get in!
Are you the one who called me yesterday?
Yes.
Prime Minister Iinuma's wife requested I meet with you in secret.
The Seleção aren't the only ones who don't like your request to become king. and she loathes you for it.
Then why does she want you to bring him back?
Mrs. Iinuma wants to hear it straight from his mouth.
And I personally want to see what happens with you as king.
What do we do?
I already deleted the new search engine.
Take the Eden of the East System down.
That should at least buy us some time.
How much would that help?
It'd give us exactly 48 hours.
More evidence of how incredible our Eden really was.
Eden of the East 000 NEETs in Toyosu anymore.
It's being used by people all over the country.
We have no choice.
Micchon?
I switched over to the wireless LAN.

Morning.
How do you do?
"Well, all I can advise is don't get complacent."
- I won't.
"Asthma's a condition that can lie low for years, then out of the blue, something triggers an attack and then suddenly you're in trouble."
"Thanks for the all-clear, Doctor."
"Give my regards to your mother, David."
"- Will do, Mrs Campbell."
Thank you.
Have you given any more thought to what I've asked - about enlisting?
I just want to know whether or not they'd take me.
That's all.
"But if they say ""yes"", then that won't be all, will it?"
"Erica, I'm not going to do anything rash."
I just want to know my options.
I suppose I was hoping that the girls and me wanting you to stay with us would be the only option you'd need.
The appointment's at 3:30.
I'll be back in time for evening surgery.
David's turning into a fine young man.
- Hmm.
It's mine.
Soon we will welcome Turkey
In the embrace of the European Union.
"We Belgians, finding us in the heart of Europe,"
We will celebrate this historic occasion
Giving the Turkish people our most beloved Mini-Europa Park.
He has already sent me eleven messages.
I do not know how I can do my job while I'm following this documentary.
The Queen would not cancel her because of her annual cold.
Sire.
"If you allow me,"
Mr. Bulut told me the evening program.
"At 18, show of dancing dervishes."
"No speech, just a few words."
"I remember not to mention Iraq, Syria, Israel, the Kurds, Armenia,"
"Our federal problems, our debt,"
"And, above all, football."
It is a delicate topic.
The gala dinner will start at 8pm.
Nine courses.
No kebabs?
One two Three.
"Mr Moreau, are you sorry?"
Thank you.
And action.
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
"I remember that in Turkey, the handshakes are energetic."
It's even shorter.
Brussels insisted on brevity.
"Clearly, a consequence of my speech in Scotland."
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Hisses ] [ Gasps ]
[ Panting ]
"[ Inhales deeply, panting ]"
[ Breathing heavily ]
Man:
We'll let you know if we need any other information.
Thanks for everything.
Appreciate it.
Hey.
What did you tell the sheriff?
The usual -- psycho killer on the loose.
"They, uh... usually buy it."
I lost my whole family today.
I'm so sorry.
I...
Can I steal you a sec?
"Once this place clears out, we're gonna make this a family affair."
"Wait, Dean."
[ Chuckles ]
We're not gonna kill Maritza.
She's a monster.
"Yeah, who saved our asses."
You said that you wanted to keep things strictly business.
"Well, last I checked, we were in the business of killing monsters."
I wanted to keep things strictly business between us.
But I still have a heart.
What if I had crossed paths with a hunter back when I was possessed by Gadreel?
"I could've ended up dead, too."
Would I have deserved that?
Would I have deserved to die?
I can't do this without him.
"Look, Dr. Roland, I need to reschedule."
I'll move my nail appointment to next Tuesday.
But I'm not ready to have a baby yet.
"Well, you should have thought of that before you got pregnant."
"Okay, did you somehow swallow my mother?"
"You'll stay with me, right?"
"I can count on you, at least, can't I?"
Absolutely.
"All right, Substitute Daddy, scrub up and get ready because I'm gonna need you to hold the baby as it comes out."
"Now, get a good grip, because it's gonna be kind of slimy."
I'm passing out.
What?
Passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
"God, this is going on forever, and I have to get there in time."
What's the longest it's ever taken for a baby to come out?
"Well, I heard about this one woman in the Himalayas who was in labor for a week."
Really?
Yeah.
She died.
"Oh, this is not a helpful story."
"No, it's not."
"God, I can't believe"
I didn't even have it together enough to be there for my own son's birth.
"I mean, my father was a son of a bitch, but he was there when I was born."
"God, Billie must think"
I'm the biggest loser on Earth right now.
You?
What about me?
I'm her sister.
"Unlike Mr. Everett, Mr. Carrington is a professional singer, and sober."
"Mm-hmm, that's what I say."
?
If the thundercloud... ?
?
Passes rain... ?
?
So let it rain... ?
?
Rain down on here. ?
"The morning after, an inquest is held into the previous night's excesses."
"Your charges have been very respectful, I thought."
"the cross-dressing thing, then they sort of..."
"They settled down, yes."
"They settled down for an early night, which I thought was rather demure."
"A night to be remembered, though, sir."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, it was."
"Yeah, another one."
I fell asleep on the billiard table... and then I fell asleep underneath the billiard table.
Despite Mr. Everett's attempts it is the departing Mr. Carrington
I can see Carrington being a really good mate.
"You know, one of those guys..."
I really think he's lovely.
"He's got everybody summed up in here in one day... everybody to a ""T."""
He's a very switched-on guy.
Hmm.
"Very, very switched-on guy."
And I hope he...
I do hope he comes back because I think he brings a really good dynamic to the group.
"Oh, I think he's fantastic."
Shall we run for it?
Keep going!
It's only Fairclough's word.
And he was telling the truth.
"And that's what it's all about, isn't it?"
"Really the truth, that's where our loyalties are, not in clocking up convictions."
"But there again, if the truth doesn't suit you, you can always do what Charlie Fairclough did."
He invented it.
And no-one noticed?
"You have to trust people that you work with, unless you have a very good reason not to."
There's no other way.
So I'm going to find the truth.
That's what's going to get Michael King out of jail and put away a murderer.
And not by what your opinion is of me.
(Everyone applauding for Jack)
"Come on, back to work."
It's not Ladies Night at Masonic Lodge!
Mr. Mullett.
Superintendent.
Goodbye.
"Darling,"
Yep.
It's Inspector Frost.
Thank you.
"You're back, Inspector."
If you think you can just walk in here and talk to James.
"No, no, it's you I wanted to chat to sir."
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Barr."
"Yes, well the thing is,"
I don't think that your brother killed his wife.
You've arrested Sheridan?
"No, no Mr. Sheridan's innocent."
He's got an alibi.
"Your brother would have had an alibi too had he gone to Bristol, on your instructions."
We're going to do a full run of the first act.
I want to check the timing...
"Alex, please..."
"Everyone in place, please."
I know we're tired.
"Believe me, sometimes it's a big plus."
"Okay, no talking backstage."
"Music, please."
Last night at 6 PM the deceased's wife was seen by the fireplace in the cook's arms
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Stop, cut."
"I said, stop."
The timing of your entrance was wrong.
"Your cue is the orchestra, not the lighting."
"The lighting didn't start on time either, Zeltzer."
But that's beside the point.
We'll do the entrance from the beginning of the song.
Music.
"Eli, are you ready?"
Ten to midnight
"A wet, cold night"
Waiting for my friend at the street corner
"My dear Dr. Watson is a partner and friend but, unfortunately, he's always late"
I saw you from onstage.
I had to come get a kiss.
"Do you recognize me with the moustache, Goni?"
"Alex, it looks so funny on your face."
How's it going?
"- Wonderful, knock on wood."
I hope the theater doesn't fold before the general rehearsal.
Where the hell is Alex?
And it's the first time I've ever sung.
"No, mom."
Close but it's not what you think.
What?
"What are you talking about, marcus?"
Relax.
I'm talking about monica.
- Oh.
- She's doing really well.
"Yeah, and she's like a new person next to how"
She was when she went in.
And she's coming home soon.
"Oh, that's wonderful news."
I can't wait to see her.
"Yeah, and the good news is today is her pre-Release evaluation."
"So say a prayer that they feel she's ready to come home,"
Because i miss her.
And monica also had some news
"She wanted to share with all of us,"
But she wouldn't tell me what it was.
"Oh, that's wonderful, marcus."
Yeah.
I wanted to share the news with regina.
"I was hoping that it would make her feel better about monica and things,"
But i guess it's not gonna happen today.
I know this is not the right time for her.
"Well, i wouldn't get my hopes up if i were you."
She does have a lot of feelings
That she has to deal with about monica.
And we won't even talk about this new mess.
I know it's been hard for regina
"When it comes to dealing with monica and this situation,"
But i also know she loves her daughter very much.
Health teacher sick again?
Not a lot of credibility.
I wonder what kind of creepy substitute we'll get today.
Wow.
That is no substitute.
That is the real thing.
"Good afternoon, class."
"I'm Ms. Kelly, and I'll be filling in for Mr. Dubin for the next few days."
"On behalf of the entire class, I'd like to say... stay as long as you like."
"Now, right now, you seem to be covering..."
"CPR, and I'm today's dummy."
"No, actually, we seem to be up to human reproduction, which I hope we can discuss in a mature fashion."
(laughter)
"Oh, stop being so young."
"You know, I'm not as young as they are."
"I've stayed back, like, 50 times."
- Really?
How old are you?
- 24?
Really?
What are you doing in a seventh-grade classroom?
I'm a cop.
Sit down.
"All right, but I'm watching you."
"All right, who can tell us the name of the organ where the eggs are stored?"
Officer?
"Oh, sorry, Ms. Kelly."
I don't have that stuff.
I can name the stuff I have.
Or at least what I call them.
"All right, the name of the place where the eggs are stored."
What are the gonads?
You're always taking them away so you can wear them yourself.
Merle!
"All I want for my birthday is Danny, and I'm going with him."
Now you stop this.
I hate you.
I hate you!
"If you try to stop me, Aunt Olivia, I'll kill you."
"You know, she just might do it."
"Hey, not bad."
What name did you register under?
Lenore Adams.
I hope that meets with your approval.
"Hey, now come on, come on."
This is the big night.
This is what we've been waiting for.
"21 candles, remember?"
I still think it's a dirty trick.
"That poor little nitwit has fallen in love with you, hasn't she?"
Next I suppose you'll say you want to marry her.
"If I married every girl that had eyes for me,"
I'd have them strung out from here to...
Anywhereland.
"Oh, yeah, you're quite a rocket."
"All right, how much do you think you're gonna get for the diamonds?"
"$50,000, easy."
Merle's worth a quarter of a million-- or she will be as soon as Uncle Howard decides she's old enough to handle it.
That's the way her trust is set up.
Did you know that?
"No, I didn't know that."
"And, uh...how do you know that?"
"I keep my ears open, too."
[whistles] A quarter of a million dollars.
"So, what, you thought you-you'd handle it yourself, threaten him?"
"Well, I did what needed to be done."
I've seen you go off-book...
Not about me.
"This isn't you, Christopher."
"Maybe who you used to be, but this is not who you've become."
"Emotional situation, I get it, but you can't just go running off hotheaded to solve problems, not anymore."
I know.
I know.
You got to think about what it is you want.
You hoping to keep...
Tucker in your life some way?
I don't know.
I know I want what's best for him.
But there's one thing I can do and that's protect them from Darrell.
Then figure out how to do that.
"There's a right way to handle this, Christopher."
Find it.
"What about this financial manager, Simon Delaney?"
(phone ringing and buzzing)
(cell phone beeps)
Okay.
Anything?
"Yeah, here it is."
Simon Delaney.
"Apparently, he's also an officer of three other LLCs connected to Garcia."
Which means three more possible drug-laundering companies.
Is Garcia's name on the title?
"I'll have to find out, but if so..."
We might have enough for an indictment.
Mm-hmm.
There's a Special Agent Pride on the phone for you.
Krishna.
"Hey smarty, what if it has your name on it?"
If you write your name of this colony..
..then will this colony belong to you?
"Look mister, you dont.."
- Move on!
"Yobbo, quickly get out of here.."
..or I shall break your bones.
Hey but that trunk belongs to me.
"Look mister, this trunk is mine.."
..please give it back to me.
It contains a very precious thing which belongs to me.
I beg of you.
- Look I have gone crazy..
"But mister, listen to me.."
"Mister, give me my trunk back."
"Look, give me my trunk back."
"Hey ruffian, get the trunk."
"Come on let me see, pick up the trunk."
"I swear on God, dont worry, brother."
You have landed in the right hands.
"Hey boss, what are you doing!"
Do you wish to kill this person by hitting him so hard?
"And brother, even you should leave this place."
This fellow is a very crazy man.
But he took my trunk..
- Let the trunk go to hell.
And you get lost from here.
"Brother, this blood is more expensive than yourtrunk."
Go.
"Look mister, I have requested you a Iot."
I have even begged to you.
You've done a lot of shopping today.
"These days we're playing tag again... with the tax agents, to avoid any delays."
True.
We have to solve the problem... one way or another.
How much do we owe them?
200 million!
Is that the total?
What's our cash flow?
75 million!
I'll ask Djénéba to write a check.
"It's always better... to pay off debts to the state, so we can make projects... in the best conditions."
Put the money away!
Write a check for 125 million.
I don't have so much money in the bank.
It's not about your bank account.
Is it you who feeds him?
No use complaining.
Do as you're told.
You're unbearable.
I can't take it any longer!
Just leave if you can't take it!
"Sissoko, calm down."
What do you want me to do?
My woman treats me like a nobody.
You don't have to spit on me... every time you get into debt.
Leave me alone!
"If you don't do it, I'll beat you up."
Too much anger... for just one man.
"By God and Sinaté, I forgive you."
I've had enough.
"Here, Sinaté."
"Djénéba, give us five minutes."
... she'sdraggingyouoff  to the Moose Lodge...
... forfolkdancingand bingo.
"You know, I'm damn envious of you, Gallant."
"Finding your soul mate, someone to share your hopes and calm your fears."
-Uh-huh.
"-Hold your hand in the dark night, and--"
Good one.
"Keep saying it to yourself, you might believe it."
"Dr. Gallant, I'd like to offer my services in officiating at your nuptials."
-What?
I'm a Universal Life minister.
-l can marry you and Neela.
"-Jer, they're looking for something legal."
It's completely legal.
I've married lots of people.
"So, what are you?"
"Like, Reverend Jerry?"
"Actually, I go by Father Superior."
So the rumors are true?
Yes. I'd like you to be my bridesmaid.
"Maid of honor, whatever they call it."
"Well, normally I'd say no, because of the taffeta dress..."
... andmatchingpeaudesoie shoes...
... butbecauseyou'vehad  a complete brain lapse... .
"Look, we love each other."
-We wanna be together.
-But today?
"We thought it'd be kind of crazy, something good we can tell our... ."
"Anyway, his tour's over."
"What if he gets stationed in, like, Romania?"
He's hoping to finish his training in stateside Army hospital.
I'm not saying he's not a great guy.
"What'II happen?"""
No wallets!
It's so fuckin' tense.
"Like when you're in line with everybody and you're going through the zigzags, yeah, you're having the time of your life."
"The moment you touch a bin, you're in the Octagon."
Nobody's your buddy.
Nobody's your pal.
They're timing you.
"As soon as you touch a bin, go!"
"""That's as fast as you can go?"
How many bins do you need?
Laptop and an iPad?
"Where the fuck are you going?"""
Then you gotta go through that goddamn Stargate machine.
What is that?
Why do we just do it?
What is it?
"If you asked TSA, ""What does this even do?"""
"They're like, ""Well, shows us where your sweaty spots are, and then we tackle 'em."""
"Next time you're at the airport and you step into that Stargate machine, look at the person on the other side and be like,"
"""I guess Los Angeles, 1984, please."""
"""Sir, please come out."""
"""Oh."
"How long was I gone?"""
"Do all that. ""Sir, you can step out."""
"""How long was I gone?"
"Where am I?"""
"""Very funny, sir."
"Please go, get on your flight."
"You, ma'am, with the baby formula, why are you here?"""
"""I think I was sent from the future to kill a boy."""
"""Sir, please, grab your bag."
I feel like they-- They spit.
I pay attention to lyricists.
'Cause y'all might not know this.
I've been rapping 13 years of my life.
No?
She--
"The Black girl, ""Spit something."""
"I said, um..."
"I said, uh--"
That's what rappers always do.
"""I said, uh..."""

Do you think you have any enemies on the city council?
"Well, there is that rich jerk, Roger Frank, who hates me and wants to destroy me."
"Wait, you don't think he turned the council against me?"
"It did seem weird that you were impeached just days after you were fired, so I called your old company, and it turns out they just signed a new, huge client-- Dustybear Financial."
Guess who owns Dustybear Financial.
Roger Frank?
!
He's behind every bad thing that's happened to me!
"Well, except for Bobby leaving."
"Well, it may be a coincidence, but you know that golf club in Georgia that hired Bobby?"
Guess who their wealthiest member is.
[ Groans ]
Aah!
I like what I'm seeing here.
[ Chuckles ]
You.
You remind me of me at your age.
"I'm gonna call you ""the little lady-killer."""

And you seem nice.
And dangerous.
"[ Chuckles ] Play on, playboy."
"And I'm gonna call you ""Prius,"""

"Let's, uh, check out the playlist."
"""Hot Cross Buns,"""
"uh, Snoozeville."

"I thought you guys were gonna drop some funky beats, you know?"
Like C+C Music Factory?
He's working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government.
Here are his credentials from the French consulate.
Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film...
I suggest you locate the car immediately.
"You're in a no-smoking area, sir."
Will you please extinguish your cigarettes?
"What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv?"
"4,795 pounds."
You sure?
"That's what it was... 4,795 pounds... when it came into the shop."
"The owner's manual says 4,675."
It's 120 pounds overweight.
"And when it was booked into Marseille, it was 4,795."
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.
"Listen, I ripped everything out of there except the rocker panels."
"Come on, Irv!"
What the hell is that?
Uh-huh.
"Well, shit!"
Son of a bitch.
All right.
[Chuckles]
[Arguing In French]
It isn't the only car we have here.
"Got it for you, Randy."
It just came in from downtown.
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr. Devereaux.
Why?
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux... but we get a lot of cars here at night, and sometimes it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
I was sort of heard you on the phone.
I'm starting in the fall. uh i just transferred from b.u. scott.
I'm dan. nice to meet you scott.
- Maybe i'll£¬uh i'll see you around. - yeah.
We got this for you.
I'll take that. thank you.
What are you doing here?
What i should have done months ago.
In about five seconds your phones are all going to go off
With the latest gossip girl blast.
She is nothing if not punctual. allow me.
Remember all those secrets jenny amassed
When she was trying to protect you nelly?
Well now the world knows them too.
So looks like we have a winner.
Now if you don't mind...
How can you do this?
Letting some girl from brooklyn carry on our legacy?
Haven't you ever heard of a foreign queen?
Besides her dad is marrying lily bass£¬
So i think that makes her richer than all of you.
Not enough.
Okay so starting next year no more headbands
Except for this one.
- Thanks you can keep the change. - oh big spender.
Hey mom. it's really cool here.
Um i've already met some great people.
Yeah.
All right. all right. you were right about portland.
I think i'm gonna love it.
All right. yeah i--listen i gotta go all right?
- I'll--i'll call you soon. - well i'm done for the day.
We would now have one of our own as a member.
-Who's this?
-This is Vinnie.
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
We had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.
You know what I mean.
"He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it."
What do you mean?
He's gone.
He's gone.
And that's it.
I knew it!
I can't fuckin' believe it.
-They fucking whacked him.
-Fuck.
Are you all right?
"It was revenge for Billy Batts, and a lot of other things."
And that's that.
And there was nothing that we could do about it.
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open-coffin at the funeral.
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's to match some silencers he had gotten.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and pick up some stuff for Lois to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.
Right away I knew he didn't want them and I'd be stuck for the money.
I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them and now he didn't want them.
What the fuck good are these things?
urgent kinda gets her way
I'll take it.
"- Thanks,darling."
- I'll be right back.
"- Mrs.Collins,Your work is an inspiration."
- yes?
"- Oh,thank you."
- Robert rubia.
- If you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.
Doj new deputy attorney general.
Senator.
"What can I do for you,mr.Rubia?"
Supreme court... with confirmation being 3 days away I was hoping perhaps...
I'm sorry.
What were you hoping?
That you publicly declear your intention To vote with the party for the president's pick.
I'll vote as I see fit.
"I understand that you need to feel independent, be your own man on this one."
This is not a political function.
I'm here for my wife.
I won't take up any more of your time.
"It's good to see you,senator."
What in the holy hell is he thinking about?
"Excuse me,but where's sara?"
She's taking a call.
I just checked.
She's not in the lobby and she wasn't in the ladies' room.
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you please take your seats."
The program is about to begin.
Excuse me.
"...And if you don't have it,maybe janet, Call janet for any numbers.... have you seen a woman,brown hair, light colored dress?"
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.
Weren't you to see your sister before the fight?
"I called her, she'll be at the hotel."
I had to promise we'd have supper at her bar tonight.
Whatever you say.
"A lovely ceremony, isn't it?"
Beautiful.
I didn't think she was so young.
I guess you came because you didn't trust me.
I came because we can't go another day without talking.
You needn't worry.
It's over with Angela.
I've got proof.
During the ceremony I didn't cry.
But you did.
- That's true.
- And you needn't.
- Don't you believe me?
- It isn't that.
"It took me ten years to get over it, but I swear it's over."
- Marco...
"- Believe me, it's over."
Angela and I traveled a lot.
"The excuse was to write a travel guide on some exotic place, but really it was to keep her away from drugs, to escape from Madrid."
Life in Madrid was hell.
Our relationship only worked when we got away.
"After trying for five years and seven travel guides,"
"I brought her here to Lucena, to her parents."
They kept her away from drugs and from me.
- You still loved her?
- Yes.
"Squishy, I can help you."
I read the topic...
"""Describe a personal hero who's changed the course of your life."""
"- Mom, stop."
- Let's brainstorm.
What makes a hero?
Hmm?
Someone who's great at...
"crafting, matchmaking, parming chicken or shrimp or eggplant or meatballs."
"Listen, I did write about someone in the family, but it's a ""he."""
Yay!
It's me!
"I am he, and he is me."
"Bevy, she clearly picked someone else, perhaps a decorated war vet who had a date with two different Shirleys last night."
That's right.
Pops?
!
"You picked the random old guy who just hangs around our house all day, eating our smoked fish?"
Choo-choo!
"Next stop, Lametown."
"Hey, I liberated an entire country."
I helped saved lives.
Oh!
"Oh, sorry, I drifted off to sleep there."
"Okay, this turned ugly fast."
"Now, if you'll excuse me,"
I have a full day of doing nothing ahead of me.
I honestly don't see a world where it's anyone but me.
But thank you for your service.
My mom would stop at nothing to be Erica's hero.
"Meanwhile, me and Big Tasty started our snow day with an epic cartoon marathon."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Shopping with Sophie is like when I worked in a Thai massage parlor.
We are going down.
Not if we go before Sophie and hide every ugly bridesmaid's dress that Sophie would like.
"If she can't see them, she can't make us wear them."
How did you come up with that so fast?
It's the same plan I used in 2010 when I was a bridesmaid for Chelsea Clinton.
Bad dress and then her father followed me into the coat room.
"Oh, wow."
Look at this place.
It reminds me of that movie.
- Bridesmaids?
"- No, Nightmare on Elm Street."
"I don't know what you're worried about, Caroline."
I think they're all quite lovely.
"Nash, please."
You're a poor person from Ireland.
I'll ask your opinion when I need to know where to go to get free leg braces.
"You were right, Max."
"She can be a real ""B"" sometimes."
"I'm sorry, but I don't even know why he's here."
Bonin' O'Brien here... is gonna distract the sales lady while we hide the ugly dresses.
"Hello, ladies."
Same plan.
Who's the lucky bride?
"Or should I say, who's the lucky cradle robber?"
Don't mind me.
It's just my crazy sense of humor.
"Oh, the ladies here love it."
"The call me ""Crazy Carl."""
"[raspy voice] ""Did you hear what Crazy Carl said?"""
They just love it.
I'm Caroline.
How did it go?
It went over really well.
Ballet is really something out in the country.
Did you dance well?
"Yes, but I wanted you to see it."
Waiter Are you ready for your meal?
"Yes, we are."
Is Father back yet?
Not yet.
I heard something unpleasant about father.
What was it?
During the war he put out an obscure book called
The Literature of the Yoshino Court.
Who told you that?
NMzu-san.
Your NMzu-san?
Yes.
"But even if he put out a book like that, they treat him as if he was a collaborator."
Let's not talk about your father.
"Ah, you came together!"
When did Shinako get here?
She got back today.
"Oh, she must be tired."
Ballet is popular these days.
They must really like it when they see it for the first time.
"But have you made up your mind, Mrs.?"
"It's going to be the studio that you use, so shall we take out those briars and put up a prefab building?"
That would be too much for us.
Leave it all to me.
I'll make a two story concrete building and put in some big windows.
"If we're going to put something up, we'll build it ourselves."
Be serious!
It all boils down to the old question.
Is there a life after marriage?
She just didn't wanna hurt my pride.
Wants me to think that I'm the breadwinner.
Pretty soon the romance goes.
"And, as the song says women get weary wearing the same shabby dress."
"Well, then, that's the time to go out and buy her another shabby dress."
That's why she's doing it this way.
Instead of just wapping up a million dollars.
"I guess I have been selfish forcing her to give up her witchhood, live on my salary."
- Poor little witch.
"- You see, the thing to do is to try to keep the magic in your marriage."
I guess I'll just have to go along with her.
She's been a great wife.
Be my way of saying thanks.
"Oh, listen, you're welcome."
"Anytime, Darrin, old boy."
Anytime.
"Oh, Darrin!"
"Oh, it's..."
It's beautiful.
"Well, you shouldn't have."
"Oh, but I'm glad you did."
"Well, I can afford it."
Because you got the Waterhouse account?
"You guessed I would, huh?"
"Well, you deserve it."
It's beautiful.
"You like my gift, huh?"
"Well, Darrin, you know what they say."
"It isn't the gift, it's the thought that counts."
"Oh, yes, of course I like it."
"What are these, bitch cuffs?"
"My hand, man!"
No!
- Better get him out of here.
- Have fun.
What the hell are you doing?
I want to talk to you about the e-mail Coach Nelson sent you.
What?
The day he was murdered.
"Hey, Todd, wake up."
I know you got Nelson's e-mail and I know you were on his roof.
It's crazy.
This is our fault.
Was there someone else involved?
It wasn't supposed...
You talking about Vince Nelson's murder?
- Can I go or what?
- Todd!
Your coach was murdered!
Now tell me what do I gotta do to get your attention here!
Get down on the floor now!
I need an ambulance in here!
Get me an ambulance!
Preliminary cause of death is hypoxia which presented in cardiac arrest.
Did he have a history of brain seizures?
Medical records are on the way.
He was a wrestler.
He might've had a previous head injury.
"There were also several bruises on his arm, fractured ribs."
"Well, that could've happened while Flack was performing CPR."
What about this abrasion?
"Based on the lack of subdermal bruising, it occurred moments before death."
You've dieted until you've disappeared.
Now I'm starting to wonder if you can be too rich.
There has to be a potion in here somewhere.
You need an Other Realm camera.
Everyone knows those cameras add a hundred pounds.
(doorbell rings)
That's Harvey!
"Order me a camera, now!"
"Come on, Sabrina."
We're not going to be able to vote for ourselves if we're late.
Self-opening door?
Cool.
"Not very safe, but cool."
(running footfalls)
Has the camera arrived yet?
Yes!
Finally.
Hurry up and take my picture.
Could we take another one?
I think your eyes were closed.
"Sabrina, I'm down here when you're ready!"
And sorry to anyone I woke up.
SABRINA:
I'll be right there.
"Okay, everything's going to be fine."
Uh-oh.
You think that happened because we didn't use name-brand film?
"Oh, look, it says the camera only brings you back for a few minutes."
"So much for ""Take a picture, it'll last longer."""
And you'll start to flicker whenever you're about to disappear.
Like that.
"Quick, take another picture."
She's the one who used to pinch my bum on the side.
"Yes, I did."
Look out!
-I'II pinch your bum a bit more.
-See?
You know you meet a lot of people who kind of see  lik e a media perception of you.
And it's just nice coming here and spending a bit of time with people who know me.
Most important part  of having time off.
Being able to come home and see me mother me father my brother Greg.
"Lord, may Denise and Greg be united in love forever."
never had any problem going up and asking me father anything.
"The birds and the bees, the one-two-threes."
He left here as a 1 6-year-old.
He knows more about life than me really now.
I come from a very rural background.
still live in a rural background.
He's going out and seeing the world.
I can't give him advice.
He knows where he's at.
This is the fifth day he's actually been home since he left two and a half years ago for X Factor.
Yeah.
"-Hi, love."
"-Good to see you, my darling!"
How are you?
Are you all right?
Long time since I saw Louis.
I know.
I see you every day when I walk out the toilet because you're on the wall.
"Goodbye, my love."
So lovely to see you.
I'II get my earplugs then and I'II come to see your shows.
"Yeah, that'd be lovely."
Babar Quereshi just published a mathematical formula for perpetual calendar calculations.
"I know you think he's perfect, but not yet."
You must let me have this one.
He needs to be pushed just a little more.
[Tires squealing]
[Sighs]
[Footsteps approaching]
"What's the feeling, Otto?"
They were all outliers.
Their gifts set them apart from the world.
Like you're set apart?
There was no one to protect them.
What would happen to me if you went away?
Same exact heroin compound found in all five victims.
None had a history of street drug use.
This is a homicide investigation now.
US or local PD?
[Chuckles] Five victims over three states.
"I think we take this one, don't you?"
"Yes ma'am, I think we do."
Kevin Whitfield's parents came to us.
Said his death wasn't an O.D.
If I'd have stopped it then...
"No, the Bureau didn't."
So I'm telling you to stop it now.
Use whatever you need.
No more bodies like this.
"Yes, ma'am."
Agent Pritchard.
How'd you make the connection?
Kept digging.
Then just got lucky.
"Apparently he's only been missing for a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
It looks like Zaddik might have been telling the truth
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
Maybe we could help you.
That won't be necessary.
We're sick of doing nothing.
We're sick of being afraid all the time.
That thing is hunting in daylight now.
We'll never be safe.
Just be patient.
We'll take care of it.
You see?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.
Can you confirm that?
Not yet.
It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
All right.
"Well, in the meantime,"
There's another wraith out there.
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.
How?
May I speak with her?
All right.
May I join you?
"Ellia, we need your help."
You can sense the other wraith.
It is all right.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"In fact, I have the same ability."
"""Care""?"
He looks like a cross between my childhood Saint Bernards and a Cuban eeyore.
He even bailed on teaching Stan's music class this week.
Andy teaches music?
He used to shake maracas in his stand-up act to punctuate any joke that didn't work.
He shook them quite a lot.
"Okay, look, buddy, so, you lost Bobby, and you lost your job, okay, but you're still the mayor of Gulfhaven."
No one can take that away.
[ Cellphone rings ]
[ Beep ]
This is Mayor Torres.
"What do you mean, ""Former Mayor Torres""?"
I see.
[ Thud ]
"Remember how I always thought you were crazy for how you loved Travis so much, you wanted to shrink down and live inside his blood?"
I am so sorry.
I totally get that now!
I'm so glad.
"You know, sometimes I still sneak in Travis' room and watch him sleep."
Travis and I live together.
I've said too much.
Can you believe my boss almost tossed out these old aprons?
"Luckily, I rescued them for us to use."
- For what?
- We could swaddle little baby Bobby with them.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ] Okay.
Trav is so resourceful.
It's basically one step above dumpster diving.
Exactly-- a step above.
That's even better.
"Jules, it reminds me of..."
LAUGHTER
"Ellie, what do you get jealous of?"
"I think I get quite jealous, like, if I hear my husband on the phone to another woman and just hear her being like, ""Press 4 for customer service""."
LAUGHTER
Whore!
LAUGHTER
What do you guys get jealous of?
I get career jealous.
Mm.
Career jealousy.
"Yeah, I get jealous of North Korea."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Is that the nice one?
I think so.
You get jealous of people's careers?
Yeah.
I found that one of the highest-paid actresses in England is the Witch of Wookey Hole.
The kids' show?
"No, she's actually in Wookey Hole, which is a cave, and she just pops out at people and she's just a witch."
LAUGHTER
"And that's a proper job that she's on, like, 40 grand a year for that."
"Sorry, you're jealous of a witch that lives in a cave?"
LAUGHTER
"I mean all right, I think we can probably get you that."
"The bar's pretty low, Jimmy."
"David, do you ever do anything..."
Have you ever made anyone very jealous?
Ugh.
"Well, my friend Mike and I, he lives near a cafe where I drink very strong coffee, and I go to his house and do shits sometimes."
And...
LAUGHTER
"Oh, it's these jokes Ben Littmeyer gave me at lunch."
"Ben Littmeyer, from the sociology department?"
"Yes, oh he has the best sense of humour."
I finally convinced him to host the fundraiser.
"Well, why didn't you ask me to do it?"
I have a wonderful sense of humour.
"Nina, come in here."
"I have a wonderful sense of humour, don't I?"
Ohhh.
See?
- Oh!
"This is an important fundraiser for Pendleton, and Ben can get those fat cats to cough up some cash."
Well I can make a fat cat cough.
I can even make him vomit.
"Thanks Dick, but Ben already said yes."
You don't think I'm funny?
"Oh Dick, you're loving, and intelligent, and sexy.."
and funny?
- Oh!
I have a class!
I am funny!
I am funny!
I am!
What happened to your coat?
"I don't know what happened to it, so Mrs. Dubcek let me borrow this one."
Sweet woman.
So you lost your coat?
Oh tough break.
"I lost more than a coat, Tommy!"
"I lost a friend, a buddy, a companion, who kept me warm when it was cold and warmer when it was really sort of too hot to be wearing a coat."
"Tommy, look, you're the information officer."
What do you know about this thing they call a sense of humour?
"This isn't about you, Gary."
"Jesus, nothing here is ever about you."
"I didn't hear any of this 'cause I have a really bad case of tinnitus, especially when discussing morally dubious things."
So it's kind of like sinnitus.
But I'm implicated.
I'm the linchpin.
- I could go to jail!
- Shut up!
"No, you shut up."
You shut up.
And I will also shut up first.
Sue!
"Sue, I need to see the president."
"She's in with the joint chiefs, Gary."
Is it that important?
"Listen, Sue, I'm involved with some stuff here."
Scary stuff like take it to your grave kind of stuff.
And that's the... that's the way I like it.
"Okay, well, she'll be out in five."
Can it wait?
"Yeah, no problem."
No problem.
What if he checks our cover story?
"Like, what if he informs Congress?"
"Dan, he's a congressman."
Congressmen never do anything they say they're gonna do.
How are you not freaking out about this?
I'm kind of having fun.
I like having a cover story.
Makes me feel like a Charlie's Angel.
"God, it was a rush!"
"Yeah, but you're a control freak and this whole thing is out of control, so why aren't you freaking?"
Mom finding out now will destroy her.
You're in a relationship with Holly.
How long can that last if this whole thing blows up?
"We all have things at stake, Sarah."
If it's out in the open we have a chance to diffuse it.
"Saul, Rebecca's lived in this city most of her life."
It hasn't affected any of us.
Justin and Kitty don't know she exists.
That's another thing.
Justin's out of rehab.
Are we going to throw this at him?
Right.
If your mother found out we were keeping this from her...
- We've been keeping it from her.
- Before Rebecca moved back home.
Our chances of keeping this a secret from her are...
Nobody will find out if we don't tell them.
Holly's lied to Rebecca her whole life.
I don't think she's going to risk telling her now.
Come on.
Haven't we learned anything this year?
"- Tommy, you're with us, right?"
- Yeah.
Good.
Apparently you've all made up your minds.
It's settled then.
He had this one lone hair.
Like this Fu Manchu thing.
And he had this little fuzz on his upper lip.
He was so proud of it.
You're kidding.
And he called it a mustache?
# We'll always be dancin' #
# And singin' it loud #
# Aah # Ahh # # Ahh # # Ahhhh #
Here he comes!
# I like havin' fun #
# In the hot summer sun #
# And grooving to the beat #
# When my homework is all done #
# If you ask me what I know... #
Who the hell is that?
That's Bridon Gueermo.
"He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody!"
He's already seen High School Musical 3 over 100 times!
#... everyone is special in their own way #
# Special in their own way #
# Let it out party people #
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"Yeah, I guess we better check that movie out."
# You got to go with the status quo #
# If you wanna be a regular joe #
# Come on now #
# And your dreams are only a beat away #
# Don't let 'em tell you no #
# You got to go with the status quo #
# Keep singin' about the status quo #
# That's the phrase we know #
# Get down now... #
This... is cool?
# Sing about what we know #
This is cool?
"We are really getting old, you guys."
# Goin' with the status #
"–Well, what do you wanna do about it?"
I went through Tio's place.
I found his business ledger detailing payments made to a landlord.
I wanna check them against Vic's cash deposits in his bank accounts.
I need your authorization.
"Claudette, Vic's one of us."
I got a dead drug dealer.
I got a suspect who's probably skipped town... and the only person who can shed some light on it... is an uncooperative cop with a bad rep.
"You want me to let this case just slip away, son?"
I.A.D on Danny's shooting.
Draw up the authorization form.
I'll take a look at it.
Everything looking good for my officer?
–Getting all the cooperation you need?
–Pardon?
"'Cause if anybody's giving you any interference, I can help."
Ah.
Thanks.
"Claudette, witness brought in a freshly amputated arm."
"I'm thinking sadomasochist, probably keeping her alive."
–I've got a suspect named Jordan Arnold.
–Let me help you with that.
Thanks.
I can use a sounding board.
Know who lives there?
Cocksucker who cost me my job.
–Fleetwood.
–Yeah.
City paid off the lawsuit: 1.2 mil.
He moved back just a couple months ago.
–Son of a bitch.
–Hey.
For a long time now I have blamed myself for your unhappiness and suffering.
And when I think of the music I might have written if not for the guilt which has murdered my vitality all these years!
"But Chopin has seen a happier side of you, it seems."
You can't think that I...
that he and I were lovers?
I'm not sure it was a good idea of yours dedicating the Etudes to her.
Why not?
We are in love.
We can afford to be generous.
They're running away together!
It's a catastrophe!
- It sounds like fun to me.
"- Oh, I see."
Ever the wily peasant you are.
"With Chopin out of Paris, your music no longer suffers the comparison!"
They say Majorca is the most magical island in the world.
The sun will bake that silly cough out of your lungs in no time.
Think of it!
Spain!
Pirates!
Pirates!
Don't you understand?
She'll kill him!
She'll kill him!
CHOPIN:
"May we shut this, please?"
"No, darling, the air is good for you."

"They're sexting, they're krumping, they're twatting each other 'cause their day's so special they have to share it with the world."
It's called tweeting.
I call it twatting!
"Look, Joey, we were single."
We had our fun.
We're not missing out on anything.
"No, you were single, you had fun."
"I got married early, so I never got to experience this."
I have a feeling you had a chance to experience lots of things.
"But, look, if you want to go play ""Guess Your Disease"""
"or ""Let Me Translate Your Tribal Tattoo,"" knock yourself out."
You don't get it.
I'm here trapped on an island with a woman who can't even stand the sight of me.
And whose fault is that?
It's not my fault!
"Dude, relationships are a two-way street, not a highway and a bike path."
"If it matters to you, work at it."
"And if it doesn't, then don't!"
But make a decision.
I want to be married 'cause I want to have people I can share my life with.
I don't wanna be doing this.
I know what I want.
I want it...
Look.
"Hey, Dave, it's not 'cause I don't want it, okay?"
You make the best of your situation!
My situation's to party!
Yeah!
"Yeah, definitely."
San Diego!
Remember me?
Where have you been?
"Well, you see, the thing is..."
I've got to go to prison.
"-No, seriously."
-I'm being serious.
"God, you think I'd make jokes about a thing like this?"
I'm out of my head with worry.
"Look, we're none of us perfect, okay?"
And I won't bore you with all the financial irregularities.
I knew it was wrong what I was doing.
Just thought I'd get away with it.
My mistake.
"They're coming down so hard now, the regulating bodies, on any kind of fraud."
"Fraud, my God!"
Phillipa.
"So, what are you saying?"
You're being taken to court?
I've been to court.
I've been found guilty.
I go back tomorrow morning for sentencing.
My lawyer reckons twelve months.
Nine if I'm lucky.
"I mean, I'll cope."
I've got to cope.
It's Stephen and Julie.
They've both taken it very badly.
I can imagine.
He'll be like a fish out of water without me around.
And she's just at that age where the hormones are all exploding and she's confused about boys.
"I mean, she desperately needs a woman there... with a wise head on her shoulders."
Who can steer her through the quagmire of sexual relations.
I'll bet.
Oh!
how will you find your way?
The End
"Charles, you have finally lost your senses"
This venture is impossible.
For some.
"Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it IS possible."
That kind of thinking could ruin you
I'm willing to take that chance.
Imagine a trading post in Rangoon!
"Bangkok, Jakarta!"
The nightmare again?
I won't be long
I'm falling
Down a dark hole.
Then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?
"There's a dodo bird, a rabbit in a waist coat and a smiling cat"
I did not know cats could smile.
Neither did I.
And there is a blue caterpillar.
A blue caterpillar?
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
I'm afraid so.
"You're mad, bonkers, off your head"
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
"It's only a dream, Alice, nothing can harm you there."
"But if you get too frightened, You can always wake up."
Like this
Must we go?
I doubt he'll notice if we never arrive
I probably wasn't right for you.
Daring?
What are you talking about?
"If a guy showers you with eternal love, suddenly you're suffocating."
"If he doesn't, it's what you want, isn't it?"
"You're so scared of losing, you never invest yourself in anything."
"Well, except your damn work, of course."
I just wanted to...
"Anna, please."
"Just tell him what he means to you,   or you'll spend the rest of your life thinking love hurts."
- But... how do you know?
"- Good night, Anna."
And good luck.
What if Camilla and Johan had already planned their future?
What if she'd love to have babies and he said he'd never leave her?
In my flat!
Frank was right.
I had to conquer my fear of defeat.
I had to risk the pain.
I had to go back into that flat.
"(footsteps on stairs, heavy breathing from bedroom)"
Johan?
"- Johan, I have to talk to you."
- You see any fucking Johan in here?
Anna!
Christ!
What happened?
"Oh, my God, Anna... (air rock music)"
Had I just blown all chances of ever seeing him again?
"Apparently, Johan had left the flat to go to some boat."
Of course!
The boat!
Aren't you just a peach?
There you go.
Where is he?
Tick-tick-tick.
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know, it's what, 2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible, and I'll tell you anything you want to know."
Hey.
"Hey, don't walk away from me."
All right.
Stay here and talk to him.
About what?
About what happened.
I don't know what happened.
"You have, like, 50 theories."
Just pick one.
"""Emerson Hauser."""
This was his case.
I think it's a quantum thing.
Imagine a water bug on the surface of a pond.
And he sees this twig sticking out of the water.
"When it rains, the water level rises."
"He thinks the twig is moving, when, in reality, the one dimension he's capable of perceiving is moving."
Not the twig.
"You don't know what happened, do you?"
I got good news and I got good news.
Which one you want first?
Whatever's faster.
"All right, the sample of sawdust from the roof is identical to the sample we found in Coach Nelson's chest hairs."
And I finally determined the species it came from.
Fagus Sylvatica.
Beech Willow Tree.
"Which is indigenous to Flushing, Queens."
Could be where our killer lives.
Or just where he set up his chop shop.
See if anyone who got that e-mail hails from Flushing.
Got ya.
Kyle Sheridan?
"Three count, buddy."
You lose.
High school wrestling team?
Four oer brothers.
Come on.
"Whoa, Coach Nelson."
What happened to his neck?
It was separated from his body.
And the rest of him was stuffed in garbage cans all over the city.
"Whoa, wait, you think I had something to do with this?"
We found sawdust on his torso.
"Sawdust from a tree indigenous to Flushing, Queens."
So?
"You're the only kid on the wrtling team who is from Flushing, Queens."
We found that same sawdust on Coach Nelson's roof.
"You were up there, weren't you with Todd Fleming?"
No.
"You leeched off his Wi-Fi signal, sent out the incriminating photos of the young boy."
"Right, when the coach found out about it, he came to you, and what'd you do?"
So is there an echo in here?
Why him?
Because he's a hero!
So?
"Well, how do you know he's a hero, if he doesn't do anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
Are you trying to put up a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
Johnnie can't go in the water!
He's injured.
Badly injured.
Manly slash on the biceps for Christ sake!
He's...he's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.
"""Mrs.Rosen Lily story"" and you won't let them do anything."
Then go to Dunkirk.
And Johnnie pirates them home.
They are girls!
Here girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to have by him!
Huh?
Tom?
Cab.
"And back in there if Viper just even gets her nose through the office door while we are out, you are sacked!"
"And don't think I won't know, I can smell her shaving cream on the wind."
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up."
I heard furniture.
"Angels of the sea, across the waves, two to Dunkirk, three to Dunkirk, Dunkirk O'bust, busts Dunkirk."
"Somewhere in the world, there is bullet with that man's name on."
Why hasn't he been called up?
Apart from Parfitt's too old.
"But, Buckley?"
"If there's nothing out there,"
It's gonna be A huge disappointment.
But I'm not gonna give up.
90 miles east of nome...
Shawn pomrenke is trying To strike gold.
At a remote spot of his own.
We made great time.
Like glass out here.
And he's not about To let any previous mishaps.
Hold him back.
I think this hunting for Treasure at the bluff.
Is gonna Finally pay off.
Everybody's always wondering.
Why I get more gold Than everybody else.
It's because I work A hell of a lot harder.
Than they do.
This summer...
I know there's a Pile of gold down there.
Mr. Gold has gambled On the bluff...
Puddles and puddles Of gold.
A coastal trench nearly A 100 miles east of town...
There it is Right there.
Where he's convinced An untapped hot spot.
Could set off The next alaskan gold rush.
"But so far, instead of gold, It's only yielded Frustration..."
Damn it!
I wanted to go.
Here we are.
Another day.
And he's feeling The heat from dad.
"A couple hundred thousand bucks In the bluff,"
And we ain't got no gold Out of it yet.
We would put them in reservations or ship them to...
Madagascar.
"In fact, we encouraged mass emigration."
Eichmann's assignment during the '30s was to find places to move them to.
But... few countries would take more than a handful.
Someone even proposed... a mass sterilization plan.
An ugly necessity.
"In every society, there are pent up hatreds."
"For example, in the United States it's against the blacks;"
"in Russia, the successful."
A politician must mobilize these hatreds.
Reason must be trained to think in historical dimensions.
Get out!
Get out!
You'll get nothing from me!
No mercy!
Tell them Hitler has ice in his veins!
Ice!
I'm the greatest actor in Europe.
I am... the greatest actor in Europe.
Hitler:
"What a thrill to play the Führer-- for 12 years, the supreme Father figure."
On to surpass even Lord Grimm.
"They made me ""Man of the Year."""
They made you what?
"Time Magazine, they made me ""Man of the Year."""
I was on the cover for six issues.
"I conquered Poland, Norway, Denmark, France."
Americans love a winner.
"Of course, it doesn't mean a thing."
They made Roosevelt
"""Man of the Year"" three times!"
"What's wrong, you're not getting in?"
Looks like I have to go in his car.
"Don't eat bread Mi Jin, or you may trigger your allergies!"
Please eat your meals when you are at Sunshine Welfare!
Sunshine Welfare?
Why are you telling her to not eat that?
She is allergic to flour.
"If she eats foods containing flour, she'll have reactions."
This time the infection got into her trachea which is making her show signs of asthma.
It is extremely dangerous.
"Because she's on welfare, she doesn't have to worry about the hospital fees."
Welfare?
They're not on it.
"I don't have a lot of time, so let's hurry."
They're not on welfare.
I think the nurse was misinformed.
Do you know those children?
They live in the basement of my apartment building.
"It's them, please stop the car."
What's wrong?
"Hey, you were told to not eat food having flour."
Why are you still eating that?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Chase after them!
Why do I have to chase them?
Hurry!
Didn't you both hear that she can't eat bread?
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?
Go.
Are you all right?
Right.
"Well, now, the way I got it figured... the girl probably"
Feels a lot of unconscious hostility
Toward that brother of hers.
"I mean, after all, he's the one having a good time."
And she's been shackled with her mom in the funny farm.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
It's not enough to kill her own brother.
"Ah, maybe yes, when you consider"
That now she's the only one that stands to
Inherit the whole Ramsey estate.
"Otis, I think you're the one that's crazy."
Maybe I am for listening to you.
It just doesn't make any sense.
"Well, anyway."
Wait a minute.
What about that Hester woman?
"I mean, hell, she's the one that's got all the money."
And she's still alive.
Yeah she sure is.
Hester is still alive.
And she's got no kinfolk.
Except that Audrey girl.
You know something?
"Maybe we ought to go after her, talk to Hester Ramsey."
Might give us some background information.
My god.
"That college education wasn't a total waste, was it?"
Why don't you give her a ring?
"Hell, I've been dying to see the inside of that house"
Ever since I was a kid and used to steal
Faldo.
"Faldo, Nick Faldo, correct, one point."
Pasteur?
Lavoisier?
"I think it's there, yeah."
Araucarians.
Lavoisier.
It is Lavoisier.
"Well done, Helen."
"Antoine Lavoisier, correct."
Well!
"I don't know about you, that was absolutely nailbiting!"
"Araucarians, you were breathing hot on the heels of you, Lutrophiles."
"Lutrophiles, you have won with 23."
"Araucarians, a valiant effort with 21, very well done."
"That means Lutrophiles, you're the winners, you go through to the semifinal, congratulations."
"Araucarians, bad luck, but valiantly played, my goodness me."
Join us for more brilliance and bewilderment - and excitement!
- in Hive Minds next time.
"But before we go, here's one for you just at home."
"Find a US city that, if you subtract four letters, becomes a type of curry."
Bye-bye.
"Welcome to Hive Minds, the quiz where simply knowing the answers isn't enough."
You've got to find them as well.
Let's meet this week's hive minds.
"Lutrophiles, introduce yourselves, please."
"I'm Ned, a professional gambler on football from Northamptonshire."
"I'm Oliver, I'm a designer from Surrey."
"I'm Marianne, I'm a quantitative analyst from London."
"Pascallywags, over to you."
"Hello, I'm Rob and I'm from Torquay."
- What is it?
Sit down.
"Emily, I've been cheating."
Cheating?
Eating cheating?
"You know today, when you called the office, and Carol said I couldn't talk?"
- Yeah?
"- Well, I couldn't talk... because my mouth was full of chocolate-covered peanut brittle."
"Oh, Bob!"
"Emily, Let me finish."
The peanut brittle was just the dessert.
The appetizer was a liverwurst and Swiss cheese sandwich.
"- Oh, Bob."
How could you?
"- Emily, I'm still not finished."
Then I went down to the snack bar... and I snacked on almost every bar they had.
"Do you mean while I was stuffing radishes, you were stuffing your face?"
"Well, Emily."
I don't know what came over me.
"I just-The minute I walked in there, I wanted to attack anything edible."
I felt like...
Bela Lugosi in a room full of necks.
"Emily, hunger is a terrible thing, and I gave in to it."
And You know what's worse than all of that put together?
- What?
- I'm still hungry.
"Well, Bob, what do you want me to say?"
"I mean, eat whatever you want, stuff yourself like a pig?"
Start your diet next week or tomorrow or never?
"Well, It is my birthday."
Fine.
Why don't you eat your gifts?
Police.
- So we have to find these '63s?
- We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.
"You know,they're not so bad."
"Lucy,get down!"
Welcome to Alcatraz...
Dr.Sengupta.
"Thank you,Warden James."
*********
"I don't know,Hauser.Maybe the pirate life ain't for you."
"All right,tie it off!"
Now look alive.
Mr.Petty...
You arrive to us with much fanfare.
I can assure you most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party.
"But then you are a special case,aren't you?"
A smile.
"On a child's face,it reminds us of all that's good and pure in this world."
"But on yours,it's all the company of hades."
"If you've left any more of your mines on the mainland,son, it will be our singular aim to find out just where they are before anyone else is blown to kingdom come."
Take him.
Felicitations to the good men and women of the San Francisco police department.
Does the lady need a ride back to the mainland?
"No,the lady does not.But nice thought.Thank you."
Peppermint.
For your nausea.
Officer...
Hauser.Emerson Hauser.
"She has good taste in music,Mr.Hauser."
Any improvement?
I'm sorry.
"£ I'll lay my head down low, oh"
£ And I'll lay my head down low
"£ Lay my head down low, oh. £"
Let's go out the rear entrance.
Shirou!
Saber?
I'm surprised to see Saber with you.
You...
Archer!
What's with you finally showing up now?
530)}#09 The Distance Between Them
Isn't it obvious?
I sensed a threat to my Master and rushed to her side.
But it appears I was too late.
it's all over!
I'll fill you in on everything that happened so you just stand there and listen!
Looks like I arrived at the worst possible time.
You can say that again!
and now you decide to show up?
all right.
I'll rush to your side at once.
which Servant was eliminated?
It was the Rider-class Servant that disappeared.
but she was probably taken out by Caster.
The coward.
Then she really was all talk.
Rider died protecting her Master.
You are in no position to call her a coward.
A coward is a coward.
One who calls herself a hero should at least try to take her opponent out with her.
That she was defeated without resistance suggests she was unable to do so.
- Is he willing?
- Let me worry about that.
"Karl, go after him."
Okay.
"Hey, watch where you're going!"
What's the big deal?
I'm looking for someone.
"Pardon me, Your Excellency!"
Have you seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
Has a guy with a brown fur collar been in here?
I haven't seen him.
You seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
A brown fur collar?
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
Who sent you here?
"If you haven't seen the guy, then why should you care?"
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
See?
He's seen 'em!
We need to know who sent you here.
I don't have to tell you my business.
"If you ask him if a guy with a brown fur collar was in here, then he can ask you who sent you here."
I still don't have to tell you who I am.
"No, my friend."
"If you ask him a question, then he can ask you one too."
Otherwise just don't ask him.
I still don't have to tell you my business!
Then he doesn't have to say if the guy was here.
It's just logical.
Aren't you the clever one!
Fine!
Go on being clever!
Do you know why I gave them?
So that he could photocopy them.
"And, do you know why I gave them to Kaan?"
Because I trust him.
If you ever ask me how I know that... because the animal didn't even look at questions once.
Come in!
Give them to me.
Go to your seat.
Did you ever check the questions?
Don't talk nonsense!
Of course I didn't.
Are you crazy?
And he says he didn't check them with no shame at all.
"Don't tell me, ""Don't you feel ashamed?"""
- What happened to you?
"- I am answering, (e) gone crazy"
You drove me crazy.
"It's enough, enough."
Did you get that?
It's enough!
Don't shout.
She's studying.
Did your daughter's success just occur to you now?
I'll get her married to a man and it will be over.
Do you understand that?
"You'll get her married, huh?"
Whose daughter are you forcing to marry?
My daughter will finish her studies.
Then she'll marry the man she loves.
"So, she'll marry the man she loves and live a miserable life like I do?"
I am going to divorce you!
Divorce me!
Look at that cannon!
Would you mind?
"Don't be ornery, Bill."
Let him see it.
Yankee army issue!
Where'd you get it?
"I say, where'd you get it?"
Took it off a dead Yank.
Which battle?
Battle for our hen coop!
"That's all any of them Yankees are, chicken stealers."
You hear that?
Chicken stealers!
"[conductor] Station-stop, Kingston, Kingston."
What do you think you're doing?
He didn't mean any harm.
He just can't help playing jokes on people.
I wasn't speaking to you.
Why'd you go and play a cheap Yankee trick like that?
You're right welcome to the seat.
I was just havin' a little fun.
I'll be dogged if he can't even talk like a Yankee.
"Sit down here, pint-pot, and see if you can teach me."
"[Pittenger] In spite of Campbell and Buff um, we all reached Marietta in safety and spent a restless night in the Railroad Hotel."
"With the dawn, we were ready for the big day."
Two fair days in a row.
You don't know what that sun means to us.
"What are the fine clothes for, Mr. Andrews?"
Today I'm an official of the Western and Atlantic Railroad.
"- A very high official, I hope."
"- You are the president, at least!"
It's 15 minutes till train time.
Don't worry.
They did not notice whatsoever
Well done
You may take your leave
He wrote a diary
Right on the time!
Take this to Yakup Efendi immediately
He knows what to do
This is yours
"Oh my Sultana, thank you"
Don't waste time
What is this my Sultana?
It looks like a book
İbrahim Paşa is coming
Grand Vizier İbrahim Paşa his lordship
Welcome my Paşa
The birds delivered it.
We will pay the price then
I just have a life.
He can take it
I heard that the sculptures in my yard are discussed
Everyone should know that those sculptures are the gifts of Sultan Süleyman Khan his Highness for me
They are brought here as the spoilf of war in Buda
It will be known as such
Of course
We didn't forget about you after the victory in Mohacs
Have a nice day
Thanks to our Paşa
May god bless you.
Long live our Paşa
Shame on all of you
Are you renting your tongue for a few coins?
Go home!
"Yoshimura, stop picking on them"
You don't know nothing
I was educating them
These damn savages!
I'll have you pay for this some day
Good morning
What?
Checking out guns?
Watan Robo is getting married We've got some preparations to do
Tado?
Baso?
I heard your father Mouna Rudo has mobilized lots of men for this hunt?
"Yeah, but what can we hunt in those disappearing forests?"
You've about hacked down all the trees on our hunting grounds
If we don't go hunting now we'll have nothing left once the trees are all gone
Tado Mouna!
You'd better watch your mouth!
Savages will always be savages
They have no manners at all
Wait!
Pawan?
What is the kid doing there?
Pawan!
Chief Mouna!
My hunting ground is right here!
Temu Walis?
You red-foot pheasant!
Don't you know this is the Mehebu hunting ground?
Mouna!
It's just a misunderstanding
This is the first time my eldest son goes hunting
Thank you.
Don't worry.
"When I first started, I could barely hook up an I.V."
It's all muscle memory.
"You'll get it, Inez, I know you will."
I felt like an idiot.
I didn't even know what a T-pod was.
Everybody needs help with stuff.
"When you do, come find me."
Thanks.
Page me when he's out of surgery.
Will do.
- Hello.
You're back.
- Had a cancellation.
He's this way.
"I tried calling Lee's cell, but he wasn't answering."
- Is everything okay?
"- Yeah, he's doing great."
We're just waiting for them to take him up to the cath lab.
"Ooh, that sounds ominous."
"They're going to do an angioplasty, which is a procedure where we insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, thread it up to his coronary artery, which is used to inflate a balloon that will open up the blockage."
Guess those cheese steaks caught up with me.
I've been telling him to eat better for years.
"Hey, you!"
"This is my... wife, Viv."
Hi.
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
- I've been treating your husband.
- Hi.
Everything's okay.
"I've got a little blockage, but they're gonna fix it."
"Oh, what a clever thing to say."
How brainy you are.
Got a degree?
"Just cos you earn four times as much as a nurse, you think you can cheek Richie Rich, do you?"
"Now, that's what I like to see."
"A good, old-fashioned bobby."
"Don't worry, Richie."
"These days, prison food is quite acceptable."
"Mind you, it's not so nice when they nail you to the table and shove it up your backside."
"Well, Eddie, the long and winding road is over."
"The great god, public, claims another weary showbiz victim."
Huh.
"Oscar Wilde, playwright, arrested for his beliefs."
"Lenny Bruce, comedian, arrested for his beliefs."
"Richie Rich, celebrity, arrested..."
For going nicking down the local shop.
Huh!
Lt'll be the trial of the century.
I shall be tried in majestic splendour by a jury of my peers.
"Parky, Tarby, Lynchy, Sue Lawley."
- Annie Diamondy.
- Debbie Greenwoody.
"Selina Scotty, Maggie Philbiny."
"Bloody hell, what a fantastic jury."
We might be on for a sex sesh after the trial.
"Too right except you won't be there, cos you'll be in pris."
I'll be all right.
I'm gonna plead insanity.
Damn.
Let's face it.
You've got the evidence.
Let me out!
"Well, we had a nice, long talk"
"- this afternoon, didn't we?"
- Yeah.
"Oh, my God, this is an intervention!"
"Yeah, you could kind of call it that."
"Listen, Gray, you're meant for more than sitting around answering trivia questions about history."
"Me, you, Firestorm."
We're made for changing history.
- This is my life.
- And your life will be waiting for you when you get back.
You really want me to do this?
"I could never forgive myself if I kept you from it, my husband the superhero."
Why are you looking at me like that?
Wasn't sure you'd make it.
"You left me a message, I came."
What of it?
I just wanted to talk.
"You and I, we've done a lot of thieving, a lot of cool stuff, a lot of fun."
"Anyway, I, uh..."
I just wanted to make sure
I said something important that wasn't left unsaid.
"Mick, I don't do touchy-feely."
"If you got something to say, say it."
This wasn't a good idea.
You're the best guy I ever knew.
"You may not think you're a hero, but you're a hero to me."
You got that?
"Yeah, I got it."
See you around.
You okay?
Fine.
- So did you tell him?
"God, that girl."
Is this whole house falling apart?
[SIGHS]
Oh!
"Christine, what are you...?"
Get off of me.
Just forget the sangria.
Bring some wine.
"Uh, Marly."
"You know, I don't work for you."
And I quit.
What?
"You know, I have been such a good sport up until now."
"But, I mean, I'm getting really tired of you and your friends looking down on me."
Why would we look down on you?
Since you came to this school the only person you've had something in common with is my maid.
"You know, uh, I could say something right now that would really hurt you too."
But I'm not gonna do that.
Because I'm a much nicer person than that.
You're too tan.
You know what would be great?
"If you could stop judging me for, like, a minute and give me a break."
Me judging you?
"Yeah, look, you've got it easy, okay?"
You don't care what people think about you.
You don't try to impress people with your car or your marriage.
Your clothes.
"I mean, you cut your own hair."
I don't cut my own hair.
This cost 60 bucks.
"Okay, you don't spend a lot of money on your hair."
The point is you seem very comfortable with yourself.
"- He died, Dad."
"Well, he should have spoke up!"
Squeaky wheel!
You're my squeaky wheel.
And you were magnificent.
Sometimes a man's got to do what a man does.
And a man feeds his family!
I'm taking you all to dinner!
- Yeah!
- All right!
"Frank, a restaurant?"
Isn't that a little extravagant right now?
"Oh, we're fine, Sue."
"This might be the adrenaline shot to the heart speaking, but I feel great again!"
"- Ooh, can we eat there?"
"- No, that's a titty bar now, Bill."
Your old man is gonna take you to the fanciest place in town.
"And so, you know, I had nothing better to do,"
"TV was on the fritz, so I figured, yeah, why not?"
I might as well get married.
It's funny when you pretend you hate each other.
Tell us the real story.
- It was such a lovely summer day...
- I'll take this whenever you're ready.
- Thank you.
- Your father looked so handsome.
"Grampa Joe walked me down the aisle and I wore my mother's dress, little Cindy was the flower girl, Monsignor Kreger married us."
- Who?
- He's Father Pat's father.
Long story.
And of course I didn't know then that you three angels were coming.
But I looked at your father
We like it here.
We have family and community.
And you've just come here with your new novel and turned them against yourself with your arrogance and ego.
You are to blame nobody but yourself for these things.
I don't know how to process that.
I'm not sure how quickly I can absolve you of wrongdoing and shoulder the blame myself.
I'd like to go elsewhere and talk.
Speak with you more.
"Just not standing here, outside."
Okay.
Just not back in there.
Hello.
I've thought it best for my students not to ever see me out of class.
So what do you do at night?
I stay home.
I read and I think.
It will make my life harder if people see me differently.
Does that make sense?
But you want only to be thought of as a talented writer and not as a real person?
"Hmm, yeah."
Yeah.
That's probably about right.
"In fact, that's exactly right."
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)
Thank you.
All right.
Be a good boy.
"Give me a call, okay?"
Yeah.
I never had a weekend on campus where I went to school.
I can't really quite adjust.
Last night your uncle and then me...
In what way?
Never mind.
JONATHAN:
You seem to have a decent situation here.
This place is just fine.
Yeah.
You do not need to look away every time you see me.
This is your father that I saw you with earlier?
He's my uncle.
Mononcle.
Like the film.
You look sad with him.
I don't think you're saying what you think you are.
I meant to say...
"When with him, it makes you look as though you are not happy."
Oh.
I guess that's pretty much what you said the first time.
Why this is?
Your own family makes you unhappy?
I feel uncomfortable talking to you like this.
Why?
Because we don't like each other.
Or you don't like me.
It's not like that.
I mean...
"Okay, it's true that I am upset that"
"I study for years to obtain a teaching degree, and you..."
You just publish two slim novels and get a job many would murder for.
"I, however, think it is possible we could be friendly together."
You encouraged the faculty to turn on me.
Nobody likes me here.
Nobody ever talks to me.
Hmm.
"Um, we had a fairly intense screaming match."
No.
"Wherein I suggested that you take your head and store it within yourself in a fashion that, while, while space-saving, might limit its exposure to, to sunshine."
"Well, that describes 95% of my employees and everyone in my family..."
except for my dog.
:
He's such a good boy.
Well...
"I'll see you later, uh..."
Randall Wilkerson.
Marshall Eriksen.
"Gary Dinkersfield, right."
"Great, he doesn't remember you."
Not great.
Arthur Hobbes hating Marshall-- that's no big deal.
He hates everyone.
It's the people he doesn't know that he cuts loose.
He just fired What's-His-Face.
"He fired What's- His-Face, Ted, and What's-His-Face was invaluable."
"Look, I can understand you getting upset, but it's not worth killing yourself over."
"Yeah, wait till you get laid off, then kill yourself."
Like What's-His-Face.
Although I guess now it's more like Where's-His-Face.
"Look, it was just two cigarettes."
"Okay, I can handle two."
"As long as I don't have three within 24 hours, then I'm not going to get hooked again."
What's Lily going to say when she finds out you smoked?
Lily's not going to find out.
I have a system.
"Ah, yes, Marshall's system."
"Hey, Lil."
It was just so unoriginal.
Made me feel sorry for him.
My second husband was a pinch more creative.
Cheated on me with my sister but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious.
"So at least some mind games, some intrigue."
"But my last husband, he was a gem."
He was a veritable master at covering his tracks.
"I mean, I pored over his phone records, I intercepted his credit-card bills I had him followed on numerous occasions and never found a single shred of evidence."
It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress.
"But the real master, I have to say, is me."
"Three husbands, countless boyfriends, I haven't been caught yet."
ANNA:
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"- Oh, my God, oh, my God."
I can't...
- Shh.
BEN:
It's over there.
ANNA:
"Oh, my God."
He liked the demo.
I can't believe it.
It's unbelievable.
Did you hear when he said that it was hauntingly beautiful?
"Yeah, I was there."
I was...
"I was there, baby."
Thank you.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"Dana, I'm working."
I'm still going over some offering statements.
Please.
"In consideration of a Tót family, I promise,I will look for it."
- Yes.
- But do not expect partiality of me.
Yes.
"Na, what, Mariska?"
What?
This is the aim!
This does not untie everything of course.
I hope so I may expect you to be honest.
"Who gets tired, will speak."
Yeah?
"- Of course, major lord."
- Good.
"What happened, Tót?"
"Nothing, major lord."
"Because looked at leftwards, behind my back."
Yes...that.
A butterfly was flying in.
Butterfly?
What kind of butterfly?
Well as such...on him is two yellow patch and one red patch.
And you meanwhile the make of box you deal with butterflies ?
I just looked over there only.
Did you just look over there only?
"But you gave a thought to it meanwhile, following it would be good, to take, to strike dead."
"Happened so, or did not happen so?"
I believed only a little onto its.
I suspected it.
"Look, Tót family."
"I am very grateful for your hospitality, but this may not be going so keep moving."
This makes sense if this gives us pleasure equally only.
That's...
And a few baboon friends that my brother shot.
I bagged some too down there.
But otherwise down there I usually shoot with a Steyr-Mannlicher 868 S caliber.
I have to say it's the best caliber for antelope and game because so far I've never missed a shot.
"And never needed more than one shot for an animal, thank God."
There are enough sleepers in Austria.
It's them we should fear.
Not normal people.
Them.
"And, unfortunately, there's also..."
There didn't used to be...
preachers of hate.
They preach hatred in Austria.
Why?
I don't agree.
"You have to... investigate who's doing it, who's stirring up hatred."
The Koran has both.
"The Koran has evil and bad- I mean, good in it."
It's not just bad.
"I was talking with him and asked, ""What are you?"""
"He says, ""I'm an Austrian."""
"I go, ""Sure, but at the European Cup you scream ""Turkiye, Turkiye!"""
"He says, ""Yeah, I'm Austrian, but I'm Turkish."""
You see?
But he's more Turkish.
Even if he was born here.
It's a typical case of oriental logic.
- They can't think logically.
- He has Austrian papers...
They can't think logically.
Because Islam teaches them that logic is something that goes against God.
I will threaten to go to the cops.
"She'll lose her license, her business, maybe does some time."
Or she signs the farm over to me.
"If Audrey signs the farm over to you, the other grandchildren will all have grounds for suit once the value of the land is discovered."
We'll fight them.
And you'd be tied up in legal battles for years.
"Legally, the better play would be to sign the quick claim over to the only surviving child."
- What?
- Your mother.
Maybe we can make a deal with her.
"Although shit, no."
[sigh] Julia told me she's somewhere on the West Coast.
No.
She's not.
She's here in Bridgeport.
She came back a few years ago.
She's just never contacted anybody.
I think she's just waiting for Otto and Audrey to... to die.
"Well, call her up."
I...
She doesn't have a phone.
I...
"If it's a long story, then let's go see her."
I don't know where she is.
"I have to look for her, okay?"
Okay.
Call me when you've found her.
Cheers for the drink.
That went well.
We didn't have time to prep for a rollover.
What did you always tell me?
Work the problem.
Come over
Top up Ah Cheung's stakes
Buy less
Get up
"One, two, three, four, five"
Hit his left side
"One, two, three"
Get up
"Five, six, seven"
Get up
Blue win
"Damn it, why don't you use guerrilla warfare tactics"
You're so weak
Do you need your mother to pamper you?
"Damn you, what the hell do you know?"
Don't come over
Watch him for me
"What do I know, I placed a big bet on you"
Stop...
Can you fight?
If you can go up and fight
Right...
Why not?
Can I bet on myself?
Of course
"You'll be the red side, the odd is one to five"
"Alright, I'll bet on myself"
Bet on me...
"I'll surely win, bet on me"
All for red
Bet on red...it's sure win
Bet on red
Sloppy.
They must have been delighted that you showed up.
- You next.
- Me?
"Yes, yes, you."
Enlighten us.
Do.
"Um, OK."
I'm Tony Stonem.
I go to college...
I live in...
"I actually said enlighten us, don't bore us, Mr Stonem."
"Speak about yourself, about your motives, your drive, your animus."
"Don't know what animus means, do you?"
- Yes.
I know what it means.
"- Well, I'm relieved."
"You see because at this university, we don't have room for the inarticulate."
"I think I'd better go, then."
Bye.
Good.
"So Tony, you were about to tell us just how extremely clever you are."
- I'm not that clever.
"- Oh, he's clever all right."
Really?
Touching.
Sadly lacking in substance.
"At our university you have to have verve, a sense of charisma - intellectual thrust."
"And that's what we're here to do this afternoon, is find out whether you're a giver."
- Whether you're...
- Willing to sleep with the lecturers?
- I'm sorry?
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
I was cooking dinner that night.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy roasted peppers string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets that were cut just right that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
So I was home for about an hour.
My plan was to start dinner early so I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.
Then get the package for Lois to take to Atlanta later that night.
I kept looking out the window and saw that the helicopter was gone.
"Michael, keep an eye on the sauce."
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.
"I asked my brother to watch the sauce, and Karen and I started out."
"Oh, God. I see it."
"-Look, it's right there."
-Damn!
"Yep, that's it."
We gotta get to your mother's.
"See, I told you."
It's funny.
-lt's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.
Tell your mother not to touch anything outside of the house.
Nothing.
Couldn'tve gone to your mother's house?
You had to come here.
"♪ ""Everything's gonna be all right ♪ ♪ this morning"" ♪"
Let's go shopping.
"No, I'm not nuts, this things been following me all fuckin' morning!"
I'm tellin' ya.
Alright.
He thinks I'm paranoid!
Yes?
"Tat-chi, you have realized the secrets of Shaolin."
"Chief, I think Tat-chi is skilled enough to be our representative."
Amida Buddha!
The Shaolin and Wu-tang parties have both arrived as planned.
"If they can fight each other,"
Your Highness will surely have the advantage.
You'll be the ruler.
Will the two representatives please come out?
Remember to eliminate unnecessary doubts.
Please start the fight!
Stand back!
Shaolin monks say that the Wu-tang school originated from them.
Does the Shaolin still say that?
"Amida Buddha, yes!"
Wu-tang founder San-feng broke our rules and was expelled.
That's enough!
He was expelled because Shaolin was jealous of his ability.
We are the best fighters.
Nonsense!
Wu-tang is too proud!
We're only telling facts.
Please don't argue!
I trust this contest will decide which school is better once and for all.
- Yes!
- Yes!
Who will be the representatives?
Ming-kai!
Tat-chi!
Fung-wu?
Jun-kit?
You!
Are we at a livestock sale?
"She's a woman, not a goat."
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not.
"""I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I Iove, that is all."""
"""But I Iove strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
"No, it's like something out of a novel..."
like that dreadful woman writes.
- If you can call her a woman.
- George?
"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
"We can't find anything, citizen."
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.
They're all in here.
follow me.
What the devil...
"Good God, CIaudette!"
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow!
hello!
welcome.
"well, he left the salon at that moment."
CIaudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
Do you want a drink?
"You see you don't understand, you're not a hobbyist."
Where is Nick?
I need to talk to him.
I myself wouldn't mind knowing where he's hiding.
But is he home?
Because I've got news.
"I know he is your husband, but my god!"
"What's your news, love?"
"I wanted to tell Nick first, but uhm..."
I'm pregnant.
"Jenny, love, that's fantastic!"
"Oh, my sweet, that's wonderful."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, the doctor found out while he was checking my urine for... for no reason."
I'm going to be a great-grandmother!
No!
"No, Mum, you're going to be a grandmother, you're still going to be a grandmother."
"Oh, even better."
Was it a surprise?
"Well, I have been feeling quite queasy in the mornings but..."
I put that down to other factors.
"Oh, that boy."
"I'll give him credit, hat's off, you know?"
He gets the job done.
Although you know with the extra mouth to feed and everything...
"Oh, its little mouth."
"We might not be able to move out straight away, we might need to stay a little bit longer if that's okay."
That's lovely.
"It's better than okay, poppet."
"It's better than okay, better than okay."
"I need to tell Nick, I can't wait any longer."
"Hi, hi Nick, it's me."
Out here?
-Help me!
Help me get her in.
"Okay, come on."
"Come on, come on, come on."
What happened?
-ls she dead?
-She will be if you don't hurry the fuck up.
I understand that. I'm not a fool.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Who are you working for?
(breathing LOUDLY)
I used to work for the same righteous pricks who twisted your life.
Now I work for the other side.
Just as twisted but they pay a lot more.
"They break us, you know."
Turn us into these awful things.
Broken pieces.
They push us.
Make us into men we're not.
And then complain when we no longer function.
They think we should live like this is normal.
"Like this is how we should behave, how we should think."
And our reward for this life?
We try to run away and they kill us because of what they forced inside our heads.
You think men like that deserve to live?
They deserve everything they got coming.
Maybe.
Did you stop the broadcasts?
Yeah.
Why?
Some fleeting virtue in not being a mass murderer.
Not one of us.
"Lawford, let me see him."
Lieutenant Sharpe.
Don't be stupid.
"Lieutenant Sharpe, sir."
"Where did you get the uniform, Sharpe?"
"Major Hogan, sir."
"What's that, Sharpe?"
"- It's a shilling, sir."
"- The king's shilling, Sharpe."
Our last shilling.
"London's late, the army's broke, and we owe the lads two months' wages."
"Next week, it'll be three."
Bad for the morale.
And more of our Spanish irregular support will melt away without cash.
- What do you do when you're short of cash?
"- Do without, sir."
"You borrow, Richard."
From a bank.
Our banker is Nathan Rothschild of London.
Nathan's brother James runs a banking service from Viennna to Lisbon under Boney's nose
"Ten weeks ago,"
James set out from Vienna with the bank draft.
"He was to travel across France, across the Pyrénées, and into Spain and make a rendezvous at a place called Casa Antigua."
James Rothschild never turned up.
- But...
- Don't!
Don't tell me James is a banker travelling across a country at war.
James is no clerk.
He's done this before.
"We know he got safely to Torrecastro, and from there headed south and is somewhere in these mountains."
So we're going to send out a search party led by...
Didn't I run fast?
That's fine.
"But you have the plates, don't you?"
"Yes, the plates are with me."
Kania is in for some complications.
Baba and Nawab have burnt down our godown.
That's destiny.
"If you say, I will blow apart both of them."
You are my younger brother.
I can sacrifice several such godowns in your name.
- l won't involve you in this fight.
- Then would we sit quietly?
Enjoy yourselves.
I am there to look after the business. I am your elder brother.
Nawab and Baba are the backbone of Uncle.
Everybody knows.
Only I know what the weakness of Uncle is!
Do you know what Uncle's choice is?
"He likes gold, Mona, and Mona along with gold!"
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
Let me think it over.
I am your nephew.
I am your blood.
"By working as an ordinary driver in your business not just me, even you are insulted."
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
I am constantly worried that because of your foolishness the two of them shouldn't have to face trouble.
What did I do to make such a thing happen?
So you have come?
"These are my two arms, my two tigers..."
Baba and Nawab!
What's the matter?
Why are you so sullen?
You always seem to get what you want in the end.
The only thing I want in the world is you.
That's why-- why I texted Denise:
"because I want to be a part of your life,"
- all parts of your life.
- Uh-huh.
"Well, your methodology is disqualifying."
I'm so-
- I'm s--
I'm sorry--
You traumatized my daughter.
You traumatized me in the process.
We have no future together.
"If you never believe anything I say again, believe that."
Hey.
"If you care anything about what's left of your little family unit, you might want to tell your ex-husband to cry uncle because when I get done with him..."
It's just difficult to destroy dads without daughters becoming collateral damage.
"Sometimes ex-wives, too."
Fuck you.
Finally.
You get stuck in the stairwell?
Move.
Let's look at the arrest report.
[chatter]
Man:
Yeah.
I'm on it.
You did all this?
It's impressive.
I hope my daughters grow up to be this capable.
"You're a great lawyer, Lucy, with a great future."
But not everybody is cut out for trial work.
"If you get picked up now, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in the Hole."
"Yeah, I thought of that."
I don't blame you guys for laying down on me.
"But do something for me, will ya?"
Sure.
"Yeah, what?"
Get out of here.
I don't like the way ya smell.
"Go on, all of ya."
"Come on, beat it."
"I guess I'm a sucker, but I just can't get it out of my nut."
Ross doing all those months in the Hole just to cover up for me.
"But still, he didn't have to, did he?"
"No, he didn't have to."
Remember what Ross' dame said that day about...?
"About Ross and me wanting the same thing all our lives, and he was doing something about it--?"
"Yep, I remember."
What about it?
"I think she had something there, so--"
So what?
So maybe I better do something about it.
Don't be a fool.
If you're picked up--
Shut up!
Where did you ever get the idea I was a fool?
"I broke out of that pen once, didn't I?"
And I can do it again.
"Now, listen, Stacey, you can't-- You heard me, shut up."
"You do the listening, I'll do the talking."
And pay attention.
"Because if there's any slip-up on your part of this, you'll answer to the boys for it."
"Now, here's the gag."
Although I'm gonna miss this place.
- I'm not.
This place stunk.
It's bush-league.
- Why'd you go here?
"My parents, wise investors that they are, couldn't afford anything else."
"Yeah, that 2.0 grade-point average didn't reason into things."
- Shut up.
- Between the lines.
Go die.
"Sure you don't wanna give it another go, 'cause you're darling together?"
- Thanks for the mirror.
- My pleasure.
"Hey, a bunch of us are going to Shaky's afterwards for pizza."
You want to come?
"I'm going out with my daughter after, but it sounds like fun."
You won't believe this.
There's some blue-blooded rich woman out there... setting up professional film equipment like she's shooting a movie.
- You're kidding.
- Whose mother is it?
I don't know.
Little precious must be around here somewhere.
- I hate people with money.
"- So do I, with every fiber of my being."
"Me, too."
Money people.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Are we leaving soon?
- I have no idea.
Should you have an idea?
"There was an accident, closed the interstate."
--------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
Can you believe this shit?
They started a Kickstarter account in my name called Justice For The Kyles.
"I'm not the Kyles, I'm just Kyle."
And I don't need justice.
I get it.
"I mean, you didn't sign up for this."
"If you weren't on the jury, you wouldn't have been downtown, you wouldn't have gotten jumped."
I got jumped because I'm a gay man in a world full of haters.
My mom and dad think I have a gay-bash target on my back.
They're worried any guy I meet at a bar is gonna jump me.
"You didn't meet him at the bar, you got jumped in the alley."
"Right, that's what I said."
That's what I meant.
Do you want something to drink?
"I got all these gift baskets, like fancy tequila and stuff."
What do you want?
What?
- Do you remember Sophia Russo?
She was one of the character witnesses at the trial.
"The cook at the mansion, right?"
Yeah.
I stopped by her house the other night.
"Oh, great."
How's she doing?
She's dead.
"The thing is, the last person to see her alive was a big white dude."
A really big white dude.
Wanna tell me what really happened?
"Here, tell you what."
"I'll take a stab at it, okay?"
You met him in the bar.
-That's right.
That's where I want it met.
Impossible.
"They'll turn him over to the Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI."
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
It would be like trying to kill the President.
-There's no way we can get to him!
"-Tom, you surprise me."
"If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone."
-Rocco?
-Difficult.
Not impossible.
Good.
Why did you ask me if something was wrong when I came in?
I thought you were going to tell me that you were moving your family to Vegas and that you'd been offered the Vice Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?
-Let's do business.
-All right.
"Just consider this, Michael."
Just consider it.
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
"Are they worth it, are they strong enough?"
Is it worth it?
You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?
"I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom."
"Just my enemies, that's all."
"Are you with me in these things, or what?"
"Because if not, you can take your wife, your family and your mistress and move them all to Las Vegas."
"Why do you hurt me, Michael?"
"You""re the one who will have to change."
"I don""t like it, but I work within the system."
"- Maybe you""re right."
"- Of course I""m right."
You need to spend less time with the kids and more time in the sack.
You smell good enough to eat.
"All that hot, warm syrup."
Cherries.
How could Mike not appreciate this body?
"L""d never get tired of this foot, knee... or this little spot right here."
I love you.
"I don""t know what I""m supposed to tell her."
Her own father left me.
"And the next two-faced liar I met, Bo... slept with my best friend when I was in the hospital."
"In the hospital, Lucas, having surgery on my right ovary."
Cassie knows this.
"She knows I found that slut""s library card sitting next to my birth control pills."
"Like Karen""s ever read a book in her life."
Cassie remembers how her mama struggled.
Remembers all four of us crammed in that stinky one-bedroom apartment.
- The one with the all them red ants.
- And that creepy neighbor.
He was a pervert.
Registered and everything.
I looked him up.
"L""m just trying to protect her."
"She""s my baby girl."
"Can I get some help over here, y""all?"
Hello?
"Miss Bacha, you""re gonna have to hold on."
"L""ve got a situation here."
"Why are you arguing with me, anyway?"
We should celebrate.
"I have no champagne, so here... this will have to do."
Here you go.
"Drink away, man!"
When is the big day?
All right.
"You know that I like... there's this bowling tournament in Las Vegas, I wanted to go to, so I figure..."
I'll just take care of everything at once.
"Like, I got a thousand dollars saved up already, all I need is like... 4,000 more dollars."
"Please, don't ask me for money, bro'."
"- Not from you, from the store."
"- I can't do it, man."
You told me the other day how much you're taking in a week.
- You don't understand.
- I'll pay you back.
- It's not that.
"- Then, what?"
- There's some shit you don't know.
- What?
What I don't know?
"Right now, for all intents and purposes, your father owns la bodega."
- Get the fuck out of here!
"- Mickey, I ain't fucking around."
Why do you think I took over the store?
- You think I want to run this?
"- No, but your papá..."
"Yo, listen man."
"Your father told me I had no choice,"
Eddie's into him for 25 fucking grand.
"How is he gonna give your father 25 grand, and he's not gonna give me nothing?"
What the fuck!
"Look, chill, man."
We're under attack!
Fight!
(Buwiyum's hideout in Eupru)
Follow me.
You come this way.
Sail south for hundreds of miles?
It's the only way to get food to survive the embargo.
I thank you for saving my life but I can't go on a suicide mission.
No one sets sail now because of the wind.
"(Buwiyum, pirate captain) We'll die before we reach the south."
I know it'll be difficult... but you've sailed the sea for decades.
I risked my life to come here.
Jolbon will collapse if I return with nothing.
I can't let them down when all they want is to fight the Han.
Help me.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."
We have to do whatever we can to convince him.
He knows the situation we're in.
He won't go for just anything.
What more does he want from us?
It's hard to say.
He holds the key to the deal.
Take it away.
Your Highness.
If the King won't let me go...
I'll join Jumong in death.
He'll let you and Yuri go if I die.
Your Highness.
Your Majesty.
You must stop Lady Yuhwa.
She hasn't eaten for days.
"I was too worked up,"
"So I made a few phone calls, I organized the junk drawer,"
And then I fired off an e-mail to the principal
About ms.
Rinsky.
You did what now?
Don't worry.T's good.
You wanna hear it?
Mm-hmm.
I made some very good points.
"""dear principal Larimer,"
"""I'm writing to bring to your attention"
"An issue of concern for me as a parent."" huh?"
"""it regards one of your teachers... ms."
Rinsky.
"""I have tried repeatedly to have an open dialogue with her"
"""about my son's education,"
"""but she has been completely uncaring and dismissive."
"""today, more than ever,"
"Don't we need teachers who are caring and missive?"""
"okay, that might not be the right word, but wait."
It gets better.
Okay.
"""her teaching skills in math don't add up."""
"Mm. ""Maybe 'cause when she was born"
"The numbers only went up to ten."" oh."
Mm.
"I don't remember writing that, but..."
"""if you want to schedule a parent-teacher conference"
"""with her, good luck."
"""your best bet is scheduling it with the bartender"
At beefsteak Charlie's.
Everyone has his own reasons for avoiding the authorites in their home.
"They have a very good reason, they've heroin there."
I sure wouldn't like to be in their shoes right now.
I wouldn't like it either.
What are we gonna do?
"Just leave him there, we're going to Berlin baby, aren't we?"
Sure.
We should have a wake.
There's no food.
So I go to the store and get some food.
These are no protection for aliens.
Oh!
And do you have protection for aliens?
You have a laser down in your pants?
I think I need another drink.
"Wake up, honey..."
Come on get up and take a shower.
"I feel sick, Kathy."
I know you feel sick.
You took drugs today.
No...
Come on and stand up It'll make you feel better.
Guests are already starting to arrive.
Can't miss the party.
Fuck the guests.
"You are brave, noble knight."
Why don't you go overthere and freed those two beauties from the dragon?
It's exactly what I'm gonna do.
You're going...over to the appartment?
"No the little one just went out, I want to try to warn her."
Are you serious?
Yes.
What's next?
"Then, I struggled..."
I removed the bag and saw him pointing at me with a gun.
What do you want?
You sex maniac!
What do you want?
You seduced my wife and you wanted to accuse first?
Don't kill me...
"None of my business, I don't know how to shoot!"
"That's right, it means, someone killed Ho Chun in the dark."
"Then, Ho Foon became the scapegoat."
"The key point is, did you have any secret affair with Chun's wife?"
"Master, I haven't seen his wife at all."
How could I have secret affair with her?
Ho Chun lied.
But why was he killed?
"It's alright, the key point is... your ass."
What is this triangular mark?
A birthmark.
Birthmark?
See!
Some acnes are found.
"Not serious, Madam."
You've dropped something!
It's a domino!
Can you explain it to me?
"Master, this is a kind of custom in the prison."
"In this prison, the new comers should serve the Indians and the foreigners."
That is to store gambling tools inside the anus.
"Master, would you help me to stuff back?"
"Since you have to stuff it,"
"I've brought you a chicken leg, better store it too."
"- Yes, I have."
"In fact, I may have forgotten everything I've ever known."
"- Child, what be your name?"
- Study.
Just explain the concept one more time.
And be mocked again?
"No, thank you."
- Come on.
- Maybe we're missing something.
You go to a special shooting range.
- A skeet shooting range.
- Right.
"There's two of you, and the guy with the gun yells, 'Pull. '"
The other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air... and you try to shoot it.
"- No, I don't think we're missing anything."
- I knew it.
- You shoot pigeons?
- Clay pigeons.
"- When you hit them, does blood come out?"
- They're clay.
And why do you like to do this?
"My dad shot skeet when he was my age, and he wants to pass the tradition down."
What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?
- Does that count?
- That's never happened.
What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon?
Does that count?
I've only done this once.
"If you get really good... do you move on to other animals, like clay chickens and clay sheep?"
We didn't go skeet shooting.
I made it all up.
I got to go in here.
No!
I can't do this.
You disappear for five years and now you want to move into my flat?
- Yes...
- No.
No.
"(light, melancholic music)"
"You can't work on something, look forward to something,   invest all your energy in something like I did,   then put it on hold because an old lover blames you for never calling."
"On the other hand, this was the perfect test."
"If Mr Mouthwatering could live in my flat for three months   without giving in to Miss Man-eater,   then maybe I could trust him again."
But his odds were low.
(artsy guitar music)
"Ah, Anna!"
Welcome to Paris.
And welcome to my theatre.
Did you have a pleasant flight?
Paris was just what I needed.
"A new beginning, a change of scene."
I made friends with one of the actresses:
Sophie.
"Sophie was strong, self-assured and single by choice."
Exactly the person I needed to be around.
(accordion waltz)
(music becomes melancholic)
Did I miss life back in Copenhagen?
Why would I?
Can you please take off your sweater?
Thanks.
And raise your arm.
(knocking on the door)
You have to do me now.
The director needs me all day.
I'll hold back the watchman.
I'd kiss my love for one last time.
Then follow you at once.
Do not be late.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who's within?
"Just one kiss, in case some venom lingers on your lips."
Your mouth is warm.
I will explain.
The boy has come here at my bidding.
Somebody's coming.
Then I'll be brief.
"Oh, happy dagger."
This is thy sheath.
There rust... and let me die.
Patience now.
We should not disturb this holy quiet.
- Show me the way!
"- Very well, very well."
If you insist.
"We know now how this sorrow came about, and pardon all the players in their end."
Their own forbidden love did murder them.
Yet can we take a lesson from their deaths.
"Capulet, Montague."
"See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joy with love."
"Oh, dearest Montague."
Give me your hand.
"The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head."
And join with all in grieving for the dead.
"For never was a story of more woe than this, of Juliet and her Romeo."
PECKY:
"Good, you've got it."
"All right, good."
PECKY:
"Now, low, low, lower, lower."
(Ali speaking in Arabic)
"Yes, he does."
Every inch a king.
Who are you?
(Exclaiming)
"With the ceremonies complete, the tomb was sealed."
Tutankhamun was finally left alone in the silent valley.
"Pharaoh Ay reigned for just four years, leaving no heir."
"When a new dynasty began,"
Tutankhamun's name was removed from the monuments he had built.
"With his records erased, his memory was allowed to wither away."
"Goodbye, old chap."
- All done?
- All done.
"So, was it worth it?"
"I think so, yes."
"Oh, yes."
And did you find him?
"A bit, yes."
A bit.
"During his lifetime,"
"Howard Carter received no official honour in Britain or Egypt in recognition of his unique achievements, and when he died in March, 1939, his funeral was poorly attended."
But Tutankhamun's tomb remains the most famous archaeological find of all time.
"Since I was the only black kid at my school,"
I thought people stared at me all the time because they were fascinated with me.
Check it out.
We're doing it the Tommo way.
Now we know how to make camp fires.
"Louis, you idiot!"
Right.
I think we'II just burn it like that now.
"Do you think if one of us wasn't in the band, though, the band would be this big?"
-No.
-No.
definitely not.
I don't think so either.
I think we each balance each other out.
Yeah.
"I think when we look back at this no matter what we do after this, we'II never, ever beat this."
"Yeah, but isn't that scary?"
-If the best times of your life are now...
-Don't you think it's a bit...
-...that's crazy.
"-...of a Benjamin Button thing, though?"
That we get to do it backwards.
Do you know what I mean?
"We get to go after this and then have a proper, normal life."
"Just have, Iike, a wife and kids."
Do you know what I mean?
Don't you think that's quite nice?
That's what I Iook forward to if I Iook forward to anything.
What's mad is that one day we won't be doing this.
-I know.
-Yeah.
"So do you think, Iike we're still gonna be mates?"
"-I think so, yeah."
-I think we will as well.
Do you want my e-maiI now or shall I give it to you later?
Our whole fucking lives.
- Tito:
"Okay, good night."
- Eddie:
Good night.
Show me the safe.
- I take the money every afternoon--
- Show me the safe or I'll shoot.
- I don't have a safe.
- Show me the safe!
"Don't shoot me, because it's gonna be worse for you."
- Show me the fucking safe!
- The rest of your fucking life...
See here?
The bullet shattered your father's vertebrae right there.
It severed the spinal cord.
And my guess... is that the gun was fired at close range.
- He's lucky to be alive.
- So...?
He'll never walk again.
He's paralyzed from the waist down.
Viejo?
Viejo?
Soy yo.
"Soy yo, Carlos."
"When you're working in a bodega, there's this unwritten rule that when some crazy motheftucker walks into the store to rob you, you treat him like he's king,"
like he has God-given permission to own that fucking bodega.
"You chill and you smile and you hand him the money, then you throw in a pack of Camels, for the road, on the house."
- What are you saying?
- I'll bet you that the old man-- talked trash with the asshole who shot him.
"- Baby, that guy was a nutcase!"
"- He never saw the safe, babe."
You think someone like me is afraid of being shot?
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
-lt means I could shoot you from Texas.
-(CHUCKLES)
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
That's gotta wear on a man.
That's no excuse.
I let my guard down.
"Hey, you know me, Chris."
I ain't afraid of dying.
"I just don't want to go out like that, strung up like some mangy dog."
I ain't gonna let that happen.
"Oh, no."
"You go messing with a federal marshal, they'll string you up right alongside me."
Chris.
Larabee.
Chris.
"Gentlemen, can you not picture this becoming..."
... thefinestentertainmentemporium in the entire territory?
All I can picture right now is them fixing to take Vin away and hang him.
"Now, son, don't fret."
"Besides, when we rescue him we'll need a fitting place to celebrate."
"So, what say you, boys?"
Are you ready for success?
NATHAN:
"I don't know, Ezra."
"My daddy used to say, ""Best horse you ever saw..."
"... wasasgoodasthemanriding ."""
Pure wisdom.
"Good morning, Luce."
"How have you been, Buck?"
I've missed you.
"All due respect, it doesn't look like you've been missing meals, there, Lucy."
[LUCY giggles]
"Well, it happens when you're going to have a baby."
Hoo!
-Sweet Lucy's gonna have a baby.
"Sheila, I did it."
I was selfish.
I was self-involved.
I practically invited that woman into my house.
"You can""t abandon them."
"They don""t have any money."
"I did this and I""m gonna do something about it because I have a list."
"Clara, please."
"If you quit, where were they going to go?"
"L""m gonna win my husband back."
"- Hi, Miss..."
- Not now.
"- Clara, what are you doing?"
"- Old lady""s clothing."
Boring!
You wanna go shopping?
"Isn""t this great?"
"You know, this doesn""t look very comfortable."
They are.
"It""s like you""re wearing nothing."
Only thing worse than being lied to and cheated on... is what you're reduced to.
What makes you sick to your stomach is your own demoralizing behavior.
"The paranoia, the obsessing, the dirtiness of it all... is enough to make you crazy."
It will make you damn crazy.
The liposuction will only remove 4 to 5 pounds... but the difference will seem much more dramatic.
What about my breasts?
Can you make them look fuller?
Sure.
"L""ve been thinking... you know, about you and Daddy."
"You know, you guys love each other so much."
"Amy, not now, okay?"
"Daddy""s going to be home any minute."
"Amaar,"
"I would love to help, but this is the kind of thing that takes a 125% of your energy and faith, and I just can't commit to something"
I don't believe anymore.
OK.
"Wow, I knew you were having a crisis of faith, but I didn't realize it was that bad."
Why is it bad?
Maybe it's good!
Maybe this is the best decision I've ever made!
"OK, Sarah."
"Well, I'm always here if you need to talk."
Uh-huh!
OK.
"Well, that's one Muslim down."
Let's hope the rest of them convert before you build
"That mosque of yours, eh?"
[ laughing ] [ choking ]
What a waste of perfectly good goat curry!
I could still eat that if you want.
Hey!
How do you want to pay for that today?
Uh... with my credit card.
- OK...
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Would it be more suspicious if I use cash to pay for the fertilizer?
- No.
"- Um, I disagree."
I think cash would be much more suspicious.
"And yes, to answer the question your face is asking,"
I am a Muslim.
OK...
Does that mean you get like a discount or something?
I should get a discount!
- No.
"Not a problem if you are, just be harder to join in some of the banter."
"Any part of car mechanics you're interested in, as it goes?"
"To be honest, none of it... as it goes."
"- More interested in bikes, is it?"
"- No, the media."
Or law.
"Look, no offence, but I'm never going to work in a place like this."
- Place like this?
"- You know, a place like this."
"Manual, dirty."
"Not stupid exactly, but not academic by a long chalk!"
"It's not that I'm better than this, it's just that I am much cleverer than you need to be to work here."
Steve here's got a BTEC.
Exactly.
"I suspect the mix-up'll be sorted today, I'll be gone tomorrow."
I see.
You don't mind helping out today then?
"No, course not."
"Just the once, eh?"
"Right, Cholmondley-Warner."
We need some stuff picking up from the suppliers.
Fine.
I'll just get a pen and paper.
Great.
"OK, we need two tins of tartan paint."
Tartan paint times two.
- Spirit level bubbles.
- Bubbles for spirit level.
"- D'you need anything, Wolfie?"
"- Yeah, ask him for a reach around."
- A reach around.
Well then I'll go now
Ok
Why does Lin call you Big Sis?
Maybe because I'm his BL teacher
I've been a fan of anal since elementary school
"And thanks about the ""Sex Slave"" thing"
"Yeah, no problem"
He's such a fake
"I think you just wanna say ""Fake"""
Look at this
A picture of your Big Sis and an old man
What's this?
They're in Tokyo.
Your Big Sis and my big brother
What's that?
How dare they?
The world's gonna wanna punish them for that
"You forgot the initial ""These two are fucking idiots"""
You know my boobless Big Sis's earlobes are virgins too?
How would I know that?
"Anyways, who's that chubby old man?"
"Apparently he's helping with the ""Sex Slave"" rescue mission"
"Oh, the ""Sex Slave"" thing..."
"What's ""Sex Slave's"" real name?"
It's Miyu
"She's a pretty cute girl, right?"
Yeah
"Then why is she a ""Sex Slave""?"
Not a very nice nickname
They became really good friends in high school and the three of us played together a lot
We named our local shopping mall the save point
That's so Otaku
'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm going where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anything
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith
I've got faith
Faith of the heart

We'll take them back to Enterprise.
Tell Phlox I want a complete autopsy.
The Major and I will search the port side.
See if you can access their ship's database.

It's a computer interface.
See what you can download.
REED:
My father would love to get a look at this place.
REED:
He's fascinated by insects.
REED:
Always filling the house up with bugs he's collected.
REED:
Drives my mother crazy.
Maybe we can bring home something new for his collection.
[Scanner beeping]
I think it's better this way.
"Yeah,well... you're wrong."
Moo?
How are you?
What are you doing out here?
"Hi,my name is Bella."
I think I may have found your cat.
"No,I was gonna try and grab him,but I was afraid he'd run."
"Um,yes."
Class of '92.
Shut up!
No way!
"Tommy Anzide,how are you?"
What are you doing?
AUGIE:
"Bella,you got ten seconds before I take your turn!"
"Ten,nine,"
Thank you.
Tell me you took a long time just to make me a burrito.
"Oh,look at that."
You covered your hideous mole with a Band-Aid.
Thoughtful.
"Seriously,just get that removed."
I will when it gets colder.
# I'll blame it on a place #
# Where I keep my questions hidden... #
"At this very moment, in the town of Couer d'Couers  a girl named Chuck was attending her father's funeral."
"The only parent she had ever known was accidentally, inadvertently killed  by the boy she loved  who was, at this very moment  attending his own mother's funeral, who had actually died twice."
It was a blood vessel bursting in her brain  that caused Ned's mother's first death.
"However, young Ned had a secret gift:"
He could touch dead things and bring them back to life.
"Minor shaker, Dr. Stegman."
We have them from time to time.
It will stop shortly.
"You can let go now, Elmer."
It's over.
I would have said he was totally gorked.
"Oh, he was."
What happened here?
In medical terms?
A miracle.
But there's a price to be paid for the miraculous.
And Blue Cross doesn't cover it.
This is Kingdom Hospital... where the ground is uneasy... and old secrets have begun to rise to the surface.
"Please, come again."
Thank God you stopped.
"Okay, um, I'm not even gonna get into what's wrong with the actual choreography."
"I'm gonna start with your shoes, okay?"
I told you to get Capezio jazz oxfords.
I will get those shoes today.
"You'll get the shoes, but you'll also get the steps."
"So we'll break it down one more time, and just watch only my feet."
I've been doing this since I was seven.
My sounds are a little off 'cause I don't really practice that much.
"Uh, you know what?"
"I can do that, but not the way you're doing it."
I can go...
Why can't I just do that?
Because that's not the choreography!
- There you go.
"- Okay, I'm gonna think about this."
You move your feet.
"I'll be honest with you, I did not like him."
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?
- I like chubby and nerdy.
- No.
That has nothing to do with it.
I was on scholars' bowl in 8th grade.
[ Laughter ] Wood:
Things were looking up.
"If these girls liked nerdy, I was in business."
This is where I'm a little bit of a Honda nerd.
"You notice, you guys, the floor back there is flat?"
It is flat.
"That was a big design point, 'cause normally, cars have the little hump."
"Yeah, there's no hump so when you're riding bitch, you're not really riding bitch."
"Oh, my gosh."
I actually never noticed that.
"So, Clark, this is your truck?"
"Yeah, this is my truck."
How did you arrive at buying a truck like this?
"I mean, I like it."
It's a Hemi.
What's a Hemi?
Hemi is the top of the...
It's a hemispherical.
The top of the valve is...
It's not flat.
"Wait, show me that again?"
The top of the...
[ Laughter ]
Let me just point out why chunky guys are great for hot girls...
"We'll always appreciate you, not like skinny dudes."
It's true.
I believe the number-one source of violence in our world is poverty.
"Now, we were poor in my neighbourhood."
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.
"And my best friend Ricky, he had it worse than us."
One day things got so desperate for Ricky he made a plan to rob the corner store.
And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?
"She had him over, cooked him a full meal and told him that he could stay with us as long as he wanted."
And it was then that I realised that if you feed a man... you take away his propensity for violence.
"Come on, we're gonna be late."
"Hey, hey, hey-"
"No, no, no."
That's-
"- No, that's not-- That's not--"
This is not happening right now.
"Clyde, we've had this conversation."
My boss does not like squirrels.
It's a bird feeder.
Will you at least look at me when I'm talking to you?
"Look, man, I like squirrels personally, but you're getting me in trouble."
Do you see this?
You know what this is?
Hey.
We gonna need backup?
We're working.
Come on.
- We have any more Robitussin?
"- Yes, sir."
In the car.
"No, I'll get it, it's all right."
Quiet night?
We're under attack by squirrels.
She wrote a script.
She wants me to buy a purple tank top.
- She is bananas!
- Hey.
Honey.
Mama's sorry.
"I know all this affects you, and I don't want to drive you crazy like my mom did with me."
- So...
- Were you saying something?
Oh.
Yeah.
Did you not hear me?
"Well, I just thought you were doing all this lining-up business because you heard Mommy getting crazy about Grandma's stuff."
"No, Mama."
Don't worry about it.
I've got my own crap.
You spend all day being the perfect boss.
And the perfect mom.
And the perfect wife.
"But sometimes... sometimes, you just gotta be a little bad."
"Oh, shoot."
"Guys, I gotta go finish some reports for work."
"You need something sweet and salty, just like you."
"Honey, are you eating something?"
"No, I'm doing work reports."
- Mommy?
- Mommy's busy!
Your little midnight snack is nobody's business.
"Introducing new Shhhh-nacks, from Frito Lay."
Utilizing a patented silencing technology previously only available to secretly American-funded death squads in El Salvador.
New Shhhh-nacks let you hide the shame eating you do to fill the void left by such things as:
"Maybe the wrong one, but..."
-I'll never forgive myself.
-You blame yourself too much.
You did what you morally had to do.
Here.
"-Charlie, can I speak with you?"
-Surely.
The court will come to order.
"Remain seated, please!"
Has the prosecution completed its questioning of Mrs. MacKenzie?
Yes.
The prosecution rests.
No more questions.
You may step down.
We call Dr. Matthew Swain to the stand as a witness for the defense.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Dr.
Matthew Swain.
"Dr. Swain, do you know of any act of force or violence... which Lucas Cross perpetrated against the defendant?"
I certainly do.
We've spent too much time torturing a girl who's emotionally unable... to speak for herself.
"Lucas Cross was a drunken, and a wife beater... and a child abuser!"
"I object! ""Child abuser"" is an exaggerated and inflammatory word."
"When I say ""child abuser"", I mean it in the worst way possible!"
"I object, your Honor."
The deceased is not on trial.
Lucas Cross' character as to force and violence is on trial here.
"You may continue, Dr. Swain."
I'll find your wife within the hour.
Bring him a phone.
I still say we should go look for them.
How?
All we know is Mike's somewhere in Miami and Schmidt's either with him or dead.
We can't just sit here.
They're out there somewhere.
Hang on.
Could be Mike.
"Is that you, brother?"
"Hey, Chuck, I need a favor."
I need some suxamethonium chloride for an interrogation I'm doing of my son-of-a-bitch boss.
"Uh, Mikey, that's not a truth serum."
That's a poison.
Did you want Schmidt to die?
Exactly.
I think it's the only way we get what we want here.
"Uh, Mike, if you're doing what I think you're doing, we're gonna need an ambulance."
"Oh, you read my mind."
How soon can you be here?
I'm at that Syrian restaurant on 12th and Bayshore.
How much time do we have?
An hour?
Sounds great.
I don't like the sound of that.
"Uh, they must be in a tight spot, because Mike's trying to get Schmidt out by faking his death."
"But with this suxamethonium chloride, five, six minutes in, you're dead for real."
Which is why we need an ambulance.
"Only problem is, we don't have an ambulance."
"Fi, when's the last time you talked to your EMT friend?"
The guy with the dimples?
It's been an hour!
"You play my wife, you bastard, I'll kill you and all of you..."
Do you have permission to have this Noid mutated?
Delicious breast milk for your cookies!
"It's no noid, it's Sara."
"Do not waste it, I'm too old for the way I like it."
- I know where the rebel Noids are.
- Where are they!
"I traded with them, thinking I would trade enough."
Trade with fugitive humanoids?
Maybe you get only 30 years.
"And old Sara, she should be more than happy to return to the local palaces of pleasure."
"""And give milk... for cookies!"""
- It's okay!
I'll help you!
We have to wait for them at the meeting place.
They always arrive at eight.
There are only a few kilometers.
"Okay, biscuit."
Daddy's here now.
Is Dad.
I will protect you.
"Have you no manners, son of a bitch?"
- Do you have any more weapons?
- Pissing ice balls on the icebergs?

They die like a hero.

Put this piece of gun away and I'll show you exactly how cowardly I am.
I have to go.
Gas company?
My father.
He's in prison for fraud.
"When my grandmother died, she left us some money."
He says it's to pay back the people he's defrauded.
"It's all done under this pretence of ""I wanna get to know you better."""
Can't blame him for that.
What do you mean?
"Well, he must be very proud of you."
Must want to have a relationship with his daughter.
"Yeah, I just don't trust that that is what he wants."
"Sounds like he's tying to put things right, paying people back."
Maybe you need to stop being embarrassed by him and forgive him.
"You really say what you think, don't you?"
I haven't got the energy or the time to pretend any more.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS sorry.
"Oh, it's Leo."
Hello?
"Yeah, he's right here."
Why?
What's happened?
You're right.
"It's so much better, purer, just... to do it, without recourse to who or why."
When do we kill again?
I think that'll be your last one.
What?
You've made too many mistakes.
"But you said yourself, the less we care, the more likely we are to get away with it."
I'm not sure we have the same motivation.
But I do.
I have the same ideals.
"No, like Teto"
Still an animal?
"No, a sex beast"
"Big Sis, you're too open"
It's because you passed out even without drinking
My role was supposed to be yours
"No, Bebi as Lin, and me as Bebi, I guess"
It's not like I got my tits sucked or had my anal fingered
All he did was hug me.
And only for a couple of seconds
Even so...
Good boy
What now?
It's just love... hug!
Still think you are treating me like a sexual beast
Hee hee
Umm...
"You're late, sex criminal."
I told you to come in 10 secs!
That's why you'll never have sex without paying for it

"Sorry, I've been on since midnight and I got hungry..."
You're complaining?
Even after the crime you committed?
I'm sorry...
Your heart wasn't in it
Really?
"Well then, I guess it's time I send this pic to your company"
I'm so sorry...
I truly appologize.
Lift it up.
Dump it back there.
Stop!
You put Butterscotch Betty down.
"Oh, we were just looking for a price tag."
I know what's going on here.
You're hiding the good dresses to make sure no one else can get them at our annual half-off sale tomorrow.
"Yeah, that's what we're doing."
We're hiding the good dresses.
"In fact, I just caught another Sneaky Sue."
"Oh, I'm Sophie."
"Oh, wow, wow, wow."
"Oh, look at the color."
That's not color.
That's radiation.
That dress is a one of a kind.
Meaning there's only one?
"No, we have two."
And I have two bridesmaids!
I love it when life works out perfect like this.
[indistinct chatter]
"(Public address announcement) Ladies, our half off sale will begin in a minute."
Look at this place.
There are more desperate women crammed in here than the splash zone at a Kenny Chesney concert.
I know.
It's like Black Friday at Walmart
"And like Black Friday, hopefully someone will trample me."
"Cause thanks to these dresses, my life is over."
"Max, did you hear me?"
My life is over.
You said that when the Chinese food place forgot the duck sauce.
"Well, I'm sorry, but I had a whole other scenario planned for my return to The Times."
"I may not always be truthful with anna,"
But I am always honest.
"Difficult balance, that."
One that I imagine you know all too well.
Here we are.
Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far
With a whole raft full of volatile technology.
Not far at all.
Mr. Brannis' symbol.
"Well, she looks to have seen better days."
It's still connected to the electric.
Someone's using it.
Do you have another one of those?
Someone's getting very confident.
Hmm.
Bingo.
Careful.
Some can be skittish.
Very well aware of that.
I remember you.
Nasty little bugger.
What does he do?
The constrictor causes
Involuntary catastrophic muscle contraction.
"Bones break, I'm afraid."
It was originally designed for back massage.
Hmm.
Right.
Let's call it in.
"Miss carter, I'm not sure you've thought this through."
I can't bloody well leave them here for someone else to find.
I'm not suggesting...
Inform the chiefs of all the 12 clans
Tomorrow morning... we're going to gather in Wushe
and offer a blood sacrifice
Our ancestors' spirits...
We're here for the guns.
Sorry to disturb you
- Boss...
- Welcome.
This way please
Fill them up with salt And give me ten boxes of matches
Wow!
"Lots of things to buy, huh?"
"Boss, we'll pay for it next time"
On credit again?
"- Yes, we can"
- How much is it?
"No, you can't!"
Wait!
You're buying all these on credit?
It's alright
It's alright?
But you never pay me back!
Let's give them a hand
That old drunkard Mouna Rudo really can't take it anymore?
I'll ask the young men to get ready before they all get dead drunk
"Young man, how dare you tell me these in front of the police station!"
Good morning!
Pihu Sapu?
What the hell was he up to?
That crazy boy spells nothing but trouble
"But we'd be bored around here without him, won't we?"
You call making troubles interesting?
"I believed your promises, your promises and lies."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
You made me throw it all away.
My morals left to decay.
How many you betray.
You've taken everything
My head is filled with disease.
My skin is begging you :
"""please""."
I'm on my hands and knees.
I want so much to believe.
I want so much to believe.
You fucking promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
"nine inch nails, last call, around here please, hello, over here, very good you're learning, go right in here, nine inch nails, your favorite"
you what?
what's up?
what's up dude?
"you are baby, you are donna, look at that one do it again?"
she needs a hickey mark isn't that fuckin awesome?
-what are you doing on assholes ?
-she needs a hickey mark on her wrist why is your tongue green?
"hangover, i did too many drugs and alcohol, i have a hangover"
El Duce !
you see?
yeah all right don't mind me
All of my internal organs are women.
"Listen, I have an early surprise birthday present for you."
"- When is your birthday, by the way?"
- In about six months.
Then this is very early.
You know the director Jim Jarmusch...
"Down by Law, Broken Flowers?"
"- Yeah, I love his movies."
"- Well, I saw Jarmusch the other night."
"He has very good hair, just..."
"Anyway, he wants to meet with you, give you a script to read."
- Why does he want me to read?
- He loves your first novel and he wants you to do a revision of one of his screenplays.
You're gonna meet him at a film society party tomorrow sometime and I've set the whole thing up for you.
I don't know.
I really should be working on my book.
"And look, I don't know how to write screenplays."
You need a computer program or something.
- It's crazy.
- Don't be a milquetoast.
This is a very big opportunity for you.
It could be a life changer.
Can one screenplay really change a life?
Sometimes.
Do I want my life to change?
"Most people do, Jonathan."
"Oh, shit, there's Antrem and Priscilla."
Don't turn around.
Don't draw attention.
Just sit...
Just sit there.
Who are they?
What are you doing here?
Who would have thought of seeing you?
"I was just writing to you Come in, sit down I , er"
"I've nothing to offer you but myself, I'm afraid"
That's all we wanted Well
So what were you writing?
May we read it?
"Oh, no need"
You can read it in the room
It's all up with me here
"If you'd have come an hour or two later, I'd have been gone"
"Yes, I'm selling out That's the end of another career"
Is it really as hopeless as that?
It is
"I'm so near disgrace here, they'd rather be rid of me"
And it's not just the debts
"Wait, maybe when you come back, we should just sit down and talk."
Just the three of us.
What do you think?
"You want us to come with you, Dad?"
No!
"I mean, I have to do this myself."
We really gonna talk?
I brought a six-pack.
"If things go south, we can just watch the game."
You want to laugh?
That last box of stuff that Dad packed into his car was my stuff.
No way.
Oh no.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.
"Hey, you know, I don't have a problem with hugging."
"I mean, I don't."
Sam?
So you still think I'm a thief.
A thief?
A thief who stole my heart!
We can go whenever you want. um...
Please stay
"Until the accusation thing,"
We were having such a good time!
"no, I think I should go."
I think I need to date people I haven't robbed.
And still no apology for that.
You two have shamed me in front of the chicago art world.
I bought eight of todd's photos
Out of pure embarrassment.
I hope you like silhouettes of trees.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"A pretty humiliating night for both of us, huh?"
"No, just you."
It's a naked picture of your ex-girlfriend.
"Look, i-i only put it in the show to sell it..."
To make money to--to buy you a present.
"Shut up, todd. you still want her."
-Why can't you just admit it?
-because it's not true.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, if you love me so much, where's my naked picture?"
"I mean, am I not a fitting enough subject for your art?"
Are these babies not good enough for you?
You brought a mugger to my show?
"Yeah, well, I was, uh, gonna bring a serial killer,"
But his van broke down.
"I mean, you can date whoever you want."
This thing looks okay.
Very okay.
But there is a conviction.
Criminal possession in the fourth degree.
In the fourth degree.
A 4-C.
It's a probational offense.
Practically a misdemeanor.
"Kevin, there are 4-Cs, and there are 4-Cs."
You keep looking at that as if it weren't kosher.
A cut of meat is kosher.
A piece of fish.
Savory foods are kosher.
But a probation report is not kosher.
A probation report is merely a probation report.
"I am a good Louisiana lapsed Catholic, Abe."
Don't talk to me about kosher.
Give it to me straight.
What's wrong with this?
It's too kosher.
Translate that for me.
The Virgin looks pregnant to me.
Look.
The supervisor signed this.
So what?
That's a lot of weight for a 4-C.
So what happened to the original little probation officer?
Where is his signature?
Do you know this supervisor?
His name is Schwartz.
- A landsman of yours?
- Landsman landsman.
I sure wish your mother was here.
She's coming.
Yeah.
She'll be here.
Tell your mother I love her.
I was... hard on you.
I pushed you... away.
I'm glad you... came... home.
I'm proud of you.
He's gone.
Okay...
The big toast.
"Before I start, is there anyone who hasn't written me a speech?"
"I mean, it really makes me wonder how screwed up you think I am that I can't be trusted to say a few things about my brother."
"The thing is, uh,"
"Oh, yeah, the thing is these are all pretty lame."
Not one of them mentions my brother's musical theater phase when we all thought he was gay.
Seriously.
"I mean you have not heard disturbing until you've heard him singing ""One Hand, One Heart"" in the shower every morning."
"I tease my brother a lot, but the truth is the truth is I'm very proud of him."
"I'm, uh..."
I'm proud of how kind he is...
"I'm, uh, I'm proud of how giving he is, and, uh... he's a very lucky man."
Really.
My father's dead.
We'll get through.
Get Gray back to town.
What?
W-Wait a minute...
"Come tomorrow, what's left of us will need a leader."
I think we've lost enough in that department for one day.
We're gonna need every set of hands we can get.
- I thought you didn't do that anymore.
"No, that was the new Seth Cohen."
"I'm back, Ryan."
"Cohen Classic, red, white, and me, come on."
Hang in there.
I won't be gone long.
- Did the light of dawn make any of this a little easier to take?
"- Harder, actually."
- So what are you going to do?
- I'll tell you this.
- I'm not going back to the office.
"I may tolerate Julie as my stepmother, but I will not suffer the indignity of her being"
"- Well, there's a concept."
"- Come on. you and me, a couple of bathrobes and black socks?"
- The thought of that is so...
- Liberating.
- Scary.
- Forget the black socks.
"Barefoot, baby, barefoot."
- I can't be unemployed.
I-I can't even take a vacation for more than a we
"- A vacation with you is no vacation, what with the itineraries and the sightseeing."
- I just...
I can't have worked this hard
I don't know.
Can't quit.
Can't go back there.
"Well, I don't know, either."
What I do know is...
I'm not the one you should be telling this to.
- Hey.
- Hey.
The fracture wasn't consistent with a flat surface like the hull of a boat.
It looked more like a hammer blow.
Right.
Look at the original PM.
The distribution list at the end.
Routine distribution to senior officers at the time.
Routine except for one name.
Chief Superintendent Fairbank had nothing to do with this case.
He ran Vice.
Also copied in on the missing persons report.
What do we know about Chief Superintendent Fairbank?
This.
Councillor Dale Roach with guess who?
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.
Roach and Fairbank.
Roach and Fairbank.
Chief Superintendent Fairbank retired in 2008.
"Oh, yeah."
Pat ran vice for donkey's years.
"If Oliver Stephens-Lloyd did submit a list of abusers at Sands View, almost certainly it would have gone to Vice."
Almost certainly.
Which makes the fact he was copied in on Stephens-Lloyd's missing persons and postmortem reports all the more suspicious.
"Sir, former Chief Superintendent Fairbank still lives in the area."
"Well, let's see what he's got to say for himself."
"Good work, you two."
Good work.
- Sir.
- Sir.
"Come in, please."
"Very grateful for your time, sir."
"Oh, anything I can do to help."
"And I'm retired now, there's no need for the sir."
Please let me play till that match.
If it's tennis you can still play in high school.
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
Swing the racket for me to see.
Your Zero-Shiki Drop Shot.
(Zero Degree Drop Shot)
Stop.
Being your therapist I can tell you that this is your limit point.
That move of yours will add on to your injuries.
You must not use the Zero-shiki Drop Shot under any circumstances.
Alright?
Hi.
What's the matter?
Have your injury recovered?
All thanks to you.
Recover well.
Competition is one week away.
Up or down?
Up.
- Up.
- I will serve first then.
Let's have a proper match.
"As the captain, you'll lose face if you don't win."
Give me all you've got.
You sure?
"Echizen, you're strong but if you don't get better, we will not win in the Nationals."
Give me your best shot.
I won't go easy so give me all you've got.
"Give me all you've got and improve yourself, Echizen."
Why did you transfer schools?
Didn't it cross your mind that the Nationals are filled with the best players.
- Even stronger than yourself?
Talk.
"Well, I was headed into work on 57th."
Today was my day to open up the shop.
So I took the 5:00 a.m. bus into town.
"Just got off and headed down State Street, and that's when I heard..."
It was awful.
It sounded like a dying animal.
"And I-I got to the corner, and that's when I saw him."
"And he-he was lying there on his side, and, um, there was all this blood and..."
But he was still alive.
What time was that?
It was just after 5:30.
"Okay, then what?"
"Well, he-he reached out his hand like he was asking for help."
"I tried to apply pressure to the wound, but it was too late;"
he was gone.
When did you call 911?
I called from my cell on the way to work about a quarter to 6:00.
You left him there?
"I felt bad, but I had to leave."
Man was dead?
Yeah.
My boss gets mad if I'm late.
"I need this job, Agent Gibbs."
Did you tell the 911 operator that Petty Officer Adams was dead?
"I gave them the location, my name, the address where I was at."
There any other witnesses there at the scene?
Just me; that's why I called as soon as I could.
I didn't want to leave him out there alone.
You ever watch someone die?
Not me.
Now I can't stop seeing his face.
Can you imagine Rickie in a high-security prison.
- Who'd supply his make up?
- Do you think it might be possible...
you not make everything into a joke.
"Angela, there is nothing to worry about."
"Harlin, this guy Tino knows, he's been busted with a gun..."
twice and nothing ever happened.
It's no big deal.
You know what I'd really like?
To be put out of my misery.
- Are you kidding?
This is fun.
- Fun?
Everyone running around all upset and rumors flying.
Can't you feel it in your fingers and your toes?
It's like being alive.
It is such a rush.
- You're out of your mind.
- Last year?
That rumor about me and Mark Hammer in the orchestra pit...
during the talent show?
"In that case it was true, but..."
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it.
It's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, Mr. Krakow?"
I thought a lot about what you said.
"Before, I only ate my sister's leftovers."
Why?
"My mother remarried, and I was like the third wheel."
She pandered to my new father.
"Once she had his kid, she completely ignored me."
"She didn't feed me, so I ate leftover rice in the wee hours."
I felt like a ghost.
Are you serious?
"Yeah, she didn't even take me on family trips."
You don't have to believe me.
So you ran away from that.
I abandoned her.
I stopped going home and started staying out with friends.
"Not really friends, but just people to hang out with."
"One day I came home late at night, and my mother said to me,"
"""Would you please just die?"""
"No way, I just couldn't take it anymore."
There's a threshold for how much we can endure.
So I packed my stuff and left.
You see...
"Because I was told to die, I refuse to."
"I'll sell my body if I have to, I'm gonna survive no matter what."
Aren't we doing it?
"No, we're not."
Then what's that on my back?
The body has its own ideas.
"You know, I've never done it with someone I like."
My first was with an old bald guy.
I see.
I want to.
Thank you.
What happened to work?
I have even pleaded.
Now I shall use my hands.
Ouch!
"Hey you, now when your boss is getting beaten.."
..you are planning to escape?
"Hey, Iet me go."
"I swear on God, brother you have shown such a nice.."
"..programme, wont you tell me your name?"
Krishna.
I think you are new in Mumbai.
"And you still havent got a place to stay, right?"
You also look hungry.
This means that you are a decent man.
"Brother, all this comes Iaterfirst tell me.."
..what are yourfuture plans?
I mean where will you go?
-Wherever my legs leads me to.
Thats good too.
"Then brother, tell your legs to follow me."
My mansion isjust around the corner.
"No, I dont want to be a burden on anyone."
And when my family threw me out of the house..
..I dont share any relationship with you.
Why dont we share a relationship?
We do have a relationship.
"Look you are poor, I am poor."
"And I swear on God, brother the relation.."
..a poor shares with another poor..
..is greaterthan a brother-brother and father-son relationship.
And the truth is I swear on God..
..you have made a place in my heart.
Come.
"Yeah, and we've got a cab driver out there preying on young women."
He pinned me up against that wall.
And if it hadn't been for that car horn...
"If we ever find the driver, you can thank him."
Why don't we get the SOCO's down here?
He might have dropped something.
I heard that blood expert from work died.
Is it the same bloke?
Could be.
You said you lost your keys?
Do you think they were in your bag?
"Yeah, definitely."
I was all fingers and thumbs.
"Oh, god, do you think he's got them?"
You might want to stay somewhere else tonight.
Call a friend.
Just until you've had the locks changed.
OK.
I don't really know who though.
I've only been in London a few weeks.
OK.
We'll sort something.
Both girls are employed at the forensic services lab
They both get into minicabs from work.
"If it isn't the same bloke, it's one hell of a coincidence."
There is no evidence that Kelly was sexually attacked.
But Kelly fought back.
"She got him riled, he lost control and killed her?"
It's possible.
"Yes, Casey."
"Yeah, I'll be down in two secs."
OK.
You are great subbiah For whom I should do?
-lt is for my mother
-For your mother?
-What is her age?
-70 -70?
"She wanted to do at a very young age, but couldn't do it"
- Now we want to do it
-You want to fulfill your mom's desire..
..even when she is 70 years old
You are not an ordinary son Great son of a mother
Son who doesn't disobey mother Son who has saved the mother
"- Just a minute, let me also dance my part"
-Be quick
Come before the auspicious time is over
"Yes, yes, come quick"
-What is this?
-She is my mother
For whom did you ask to do nose boring?
- For my mother only
- Did you bring me to do for a corpse?
- Are you calling my mother a corpse?
- What else can I say?
Are you calling it a corpse?
Come do it
Leader
-Arul has come out on bail
-Even before my brother's rites are over..
How did he come out on bail?
Court has said he has not died due to the hits
-What are you saying?
-ln the doctor certificate...
What is written in doctor certificate?
As long as I am still wearing a prosecutor's clothes...
I'll do everything to preserve it.
Choi Eung Chan.
Why would you you come here?
!
Our Prosecutor... became like this because he was following you.
Right?
City Hunter!
It's you!
At the site...
Because he was fearlessly running around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor became like that!
You killer!
Hey!
By any means...
I will catch you!
"I promise you, I will catch you!"
Hey!
Let go.
Let go!
Seriously!
Aish
"I came because we lost a precious prosecutor, but"
I think I should just go
I found that Chairman Cheon Jae Man and President Choi Eung Chan have something going on.
"After the President assumed office,"
Hae Won got the bid to construct the bridge over Minja Expressway.
"For that, there was a controversy over the favoritism."
"Right before the presidential election,"
Haewon moved a pile of money.
And that was used for presidential election.
And that contract was the payback.
Who's number one?
No one ever seen him.
But he once killed three ninjas... with a fingernail file.
Who's this?
"There's a place about two blocks up from you, it's look like a hardware store."
"If it's closed, that's only what the sign says."
"Hold on, hold on, I gotta take a piss."
Oh what else is it...
How many times you must take a piss and you gotta take a piss?
- Not every time
- Good spot here.
"Every single time I gotta take a piss, you gotta take a piss!"
"You're not supposed to look down when you pee next to another man, ok?"
- I'm not looking...
"- You're lookin' down, I saw you look down!"
- I'm looking at your face.
"- My man, why are you looking at me all?"
Dude you get me worried about you sometimes.
Don't you know pee etiquette man?
Let's hope she hurries.
What's the big deal?
!
Who's comin' over?
It's not important.
It's not like I'm asking you to tell me where you stashed that money or anything.
I'm expecting company because of something else I did.
What else did you do?
I robbed somebody.
Somebody else that's not our Boss?
Yea.
Who?
- Donnie Daffo.
"It takes grit, resolve."
"When I look at you, Lucy, I see how smart you are and how hard you work."
I see how much you want it.
But you don't have it.
"You don't even begin to have it, and you never, ever will."
[feet shuffling]
He sent me to tell you you're fired.
"Well, not fired."
"If anyone asks, we'll say you left of your own accord."
We wish you well.
Why do you hate me so much?
"I don't hate you, Lucy."
"After tonight, I won't even remember you were here."
[sobbing]
"Uh, there were two big booms."
"Um, that's the second one."
- You can see the fire.
- Mm-hmm.
All the burning plastic coming down.
"Uh, then came the wave."
The wave that sank your boat.
Yeah.
"Now, after the first time we spoke, what happened?"
"This guy came to us-- uh, Karl Stoltz-- and he said that there was a shipment--"
- Objection.
Hearsay.
- Sustained.
The jury will disregard.
"Why are you dressed like that, Gabriel?"
"Uh, after we first talked to you about the boat, this guy Stoltz showed up to set us up on a drug deal."
- Your Honor.
- He framed us.
Rose is back.
"Hello, Number 9."
Oh my!
Are you...?
Wow!
- I always figure you're...
- You always figure out as what?
Imaginary.
Or a boy.
Do you know what I've been doing today?
I've been watching you and your partner.
Did you hear somethin'?
That partner of yours is clean out of her mind
And she's gonna put us all in a real bad spot.
We can't let that happen.
I can't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
Do you even know what grief her little sloth is gonna cost us?
"Well, I'll tell you."
"Two of the idiots that she ventilated, were engaged."
Do you know who'll they're gonna marry?
The Police Chief's stepdaughters.
And you can bet the house once they sort out all these rubbish.
"Boss is gonna be held accountable, next to that, a garden of variety gang war would be a sunday stroll."
- There was a dead guy at the bottom of the steps.
- He saw me!
"Can I ask you a question, Ma'am?"
Do you always work by yourself?
Yes.
Is it lonely?
What's that to you?
Just wondering.
"I was gonna say, they seem like..."
Albany girls.
"Uh, so, anyway, we just wanted to drop by... and find out if you've seen this guy."
"Well, I'll let you know."
"Although, with Jerry, he could be shacked up anywhere."
"He's a bookie, for Christ's sake."
It was nothing.
Nothing.
"The word ""lotto"" never even came up."
"- See, Mr. Crazy Man?"
- Thank God!
- They were checking on Jerry.
- They asked about Jerry?
"- Yeah, yeah."
It was just routine.
- Not routine.
It's called a murder investigation.
"No, trust me."
Dale took care of every thing.
They'll find a cure for cancer before they find Jerry.
[MaleAnnouncer] Live from Harrisburg and News Center Six.
"Covering Harrisburg, New York, Lancaster and Lebanon, it's News at Five with Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer... and Russ Richards with the weather."
This is News at Five.
Our top story tonight:
The body of a local bookmaker was found floating in the river today.
Police say it was foul play and are following leads.
More on that story in a moment.
"First, let's check in with the weather center... to see if we can expect more of these spring-like temperatures."
Russ?
Russ?
"Oh, yeah?"
- How about these temperatures?
Cripes.
You think he got enough film?
Hmm.
WOMAN:
What?
Do I even want to know?
When did we knock over the coat rack?
Maybe it was that night we played drunk charades.
You remember.
"No, he doesn't remember 'cause he passed out on the couch."
"Well, I guess this explains the green light we see over here sometimes."
"Yeah, but why is this thing bolted to the ﬂoor?"
"I don't know, but I don't like it."
I don't like the sound it's making either.
"Uh, or how about the half-naked photos of me on the wall?"
That's the one thing I do like about this situation.
(SIGHS)
I knew something wasn't right about that old man.
"Hi, Mr. Kendall, this is Finn from Sycamore Apartments."
I'm calling you back about Mr. Bezzerides.
"If you can please ring me when you get a chance, that would be great."
Thank you.
What did the landlord say?
I just left a voice mail.
Okay.
I'm off to work.
"I counted the cookies, so if any go missing, there will be murder in this apartment."
I'll guard 'em.
"Well, who's going to guard 'em from you?"
(GASPS)
(SCOFFS) it's a perfect match.
It's got to be a coincidence.
Not that one.
The little one.
"- I guess we got a deal, huh?"
"- What we got here, Sal, is a test."
A deal for half a million dollars?
Maybe.
Maybe?
"Come on, the guy's in a hurry."
He wants the bread.
He wants to go back to France.
This guy's not gonna play games.
"Look, he's one ofthe shrewdest cats I ever come across."
"What am I, a schmuck?"
What's the hurry?
"He could see a couple of shows, visit the top ofthe Empire State Building."
"Don'tjerk me, Weinstock."
I spent a lot oftime setting' this one up.
"So what do you want, a badge?"
"This is your first major-league game, Sal."
"One thing I learned: move calmly, move cautiously, you'll never be sorry."
"Look, I've been damn careful up to now."
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawlin' all over you like fleas.
- He'll take the deal somewhere else.
- Let him take it and find out how easy it is... ..to put together a half a million in cash.
There's no hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We can make the switch in an hour!
"Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll split ifwe don't move."
This guy's got 'em like that.
He's everything they say he is.
"What about you, Sal?"
Are you everything they say you are?
"Then why, Luis, are you alive and Julio's dead ?"
"I'm cagey, man."
Not cagey.
Meaningless.
Got the bullet from Julio ?
Right here.
22-caliber.
Long rifle used for distance.
And not a match to Luis's gun.
"What else, Alexx ?"
"Julio's got ulcerations of the oral mucosa, stomach and intestines."
That's rare for a young man.
Yeah.
And look at this :
He's got burns and lesions on both hands.
"Now the burns could've come from drug use, but the lesions, I don't think so."
"Alexx, I want to order a CBC."
A complete blood count ?
I don't think this is drug-related.
You think he was killed for some other reason ?
Not killed.
Assassinated.
"Horatio, I've got the results of the blood work you asked for."
Ran Julio's CBC with a complete white cell differential.
And look at this :
his lymphocytes are alarmingly low.
"And you couple that with the ulceration, and, well..."
He's been exposed to radiation.
And not a little.
We're talking serious exposure.
This guy was working in this stuff.
"Thank you, Alexx."
Tell me you're sending this.
She's relaying a message.
"It says ""century""."
Starbuck's been hit.
I say again :
Starbuck's going down.
"There's really not much more on the eye in these scriptures, but there is... several interesing stories about the temple."
Listen to this.
"""Five pillars of the temple were fashioned after the five priests"
"- devoted to the one whose name..."""
- Laura.
What ?
The cylon we know as Boomer arrived with the others.
"She told our Sharon that her child was alive, and that she was on board one of the cylon baseships."
And that she had been seen on New Caprica in your school.
The child is alive.
Yes.
Yes.
The child was at the school.
"Yes, I kept her there."
And we suspected that the cylons captured her during the exodus from New Caprica.
"Yes, it's true."
"Listen, the thing you might want to know is that when she..."
Do you have any idea what we've gone through ?
You of all people... know what it's like to lose a child.
The difference is your child's still alive.
"And eventually, I hope you become grateful of that."
I want to see her.
"What you mean, she's gone down."
Gone down where ?
Somewhere in the north valley.
"Okay, get your men on the line."
How did he manage to hide a twin brother from us?
"Sir, Mikhail never communicated with him."
"If he had, we'd have known."
All right.
"Well, in less than 56 hours that bank in Nice opens the safe deposit box... and we all read about ourselves in the ""New York Times""."
If that happens... we'll be spending the rest of our lives wondering how we screwed up so badly.
Washington doesn't like federal agents... working for the Russian mob.
Our names are on that list.
Get the brother.
Convince him to work with us in Nice.
We don't have any options.
We'll get him.
"And, guys, keep this one alive."
I doubt if they were triplets.
Triplets.
"Alex, what are you doing?"
Look at this mess.
"Maybe if you told me what you're looking for, I could help you find it."
I wouldn't know what to tell you.
I'm just looking.
What'd you find?
He knew about me.
What'd you do in the war?
Sniper.
Why wait five years to find me?
Jimmy!
You in there?
"Open up, you shithead!"
This stuff's hot!
This is not your lucky day.
Tell your boss to leave me the fuck alone!
"Lvan, you look like your parrot died."
"In fact, my involvement with you and mr."
"Stark could,"
"On the face of it, be considered treasonous."
"I don't need to know the details of your past, mr."
Jarvis.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Our investigators found an open manhole cover
They assume the thief came up there.
Carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment?
Seems unlikely.
You said it rained the night of the break-in.
It was a positive deluge.
Why?
New york is one of the last cities
To still use its sewers to run off storm water.
The tide gate opens and the water runs into the river.
All mr.
Brannis would have needed is a raft and a forecast.
He could have floated his stolen treasure all the way to the sea.
I'm heading out.
Make sure the chief gets this when he gets back.
You got a hit on my passports?
Prince charming's name is sasha demidov.
You might know the rest of the story.
He was dead before he died...
battle of...
Wherever?
Finow.
"Congrats, sousa."
You are the brains of the night shift.
You ladies have a good night.
"Yes, that's a fine poem."
"So the ""glass"" remained intact?"
"Yes, it remained intact."
He'll be saved.
"- Doctor, do you mind if I smoke?"
"- No, you should mind."
- What?
- You should mind.
Not me. lt's no concern of mine if you smoke.
The air is so pure here.
It'll take more than your cigarette to pollute it.
I only measure my strength with my lungs.
"If you're in good health, carry on."
"Doctor, what's your speciality?"
I don't have one.
"That way, I look after the whole body."
"If I specialised, I'd be limited."
You must have a lot of patients then.
Almost no one.
"I have to ride around, looking at nature's beauty, calling on people, doing the odd circumcision, giving jabs, piercing ears, etc."
"If I'm no use to others, at least I make the most of life."
I observe nature.
Observing nature is better than playing backgammon.
Or doing nothing.
"This is the place, doctor."
ldleness leads to corruption.
"Well, well, it's our invalid!"
She's my friend.
She's as old as Methuselah.
"Hello, are you well?"
It's been a while!
I have things to do.
What is the matter with you?
What the fuck kind of people are they?
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.
But the first time I realized how different was when Mickey had a hostess party.
"-Karen, where you from?"
-Lawrence.
"Ah, yeah, Lawrence."
Out on the island.
That's nice.
I'm from Miami.
You ever been there?
"It's okay, but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven."
Angie stop picking at that thing.
I'd like to smack his face.
The red-haired guy?
He looks like a farmer...
I'm tellin' ya I can't get through the gate without this guys hands all over me.
"So I told him, ""Keep your fucking hands off me, or I'll cut them off."""
She means it.
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie--
How can you mention it?
Vinnie'd kill him.
"Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard, then he'll be there for life."
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?
He was in an argument.
A lousy $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.
The gun goes off.
Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears finds out he's in jail she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot.
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
- Thank you all for participating.
- Not a spectator event.
Came early to get in some laps and accidentally discovered this circus.
It's a traditional scholarship program with a charity component.
Yeah.

Ever track down your missing boyfriend?
Brooke!
Are you joining us?
"Look, maybe I was unclear."
Go away.
"I'll take that as a ""no."""
"The way he looked at me, I wanted to cry, but I also got really angry."
"That's probably natural, right?"
That's a lot of history there.
I don't know.
"I think when Audrey went all doom and gloom on me this morning, she really got into my head."
I think something is up with her.
It's also Audrey.
It's hard to tell.
- You think your dad will stick around?
- ‭I have no idea.
He doesn't exactly have the most reliable track record.
My dad left us when I was little.
"If he showed up now, I'd probably punch him in the teeth."
"Hey, Fight Club, not cool."
- You were listening to all that?
"- No, no."
Eli and his dad have a complicated relationship.
And Eli's crazy.
I get it.
I definitely wanted to hit my dad when he left.
We are so overdue for this.
Ah.
"Sun, sand, warm, blue water..."
It's not as warm as you'd think this time of year.
Tony!
I thought I was gonna be stuck all by my lonesome when they announced
"Dad's flight took off late, when what should appear but a Thanksgiving miracle!"
"Agent DiNozzo, I presume?"
The elusive Jake.
It's nice to know Bishop hasn't been catfishing us all year-- I was starting to wonder.
"Well, you can stop wondering, Tony."
"As you can see, Jake is quite real."
Unless he's a hologram that can shake hands.
NSA's actually working on one of those-
- I've seen the prototype.
"Yeah, that'd be pretty fun."
Really?
No.
Ah.
Aha.
Had me for a second.
That's too bad-- 'cause I'd like one of those.
I like him.
He's quick.
"Hey, speaking of quick, how'd you get all the way up here?"
Arrival pickups never get past Customs.
"It's all about the badge, Bish-- you got to know how to flash it."
Oh.
"Oh, my."
The classic Smelly Guy.
Yet another vivid hue in the broad spectrum of airport humanity.
Did he come straight from the gym?
- l am feeling hungry today.
I know.
"When you feel hungry, you come to my door."
"Otherwise, why would you come to me?"
What would you like to eat?
Shall I serve you the breast?
- No!
- The heart...the ears..
- No!
"- The eyes, then?"
No!
I feel like eating the brain today.
The brain?
The police has eaten away my brain.
Where from shall I serve you?
I am not talking of your brain.
I am talking of a goat's brain!
Where does the goat have brain?
"Yes, I did find a goat with a brain."
"When I was about to slaughter it, the goat pleaded not to slay him since he was appearing for S.S.C. exams."
I advised the goat against it since he had to die some day.
He didn't pay heed.
"Today, he is making rounds at the college."
How ridiculous!
What's the connection between a goat and the college?
The boys who attend college are like goats.
Sometimes they are at the mercy of a job sometimes at the mercy of a girl.
"All right, then."
"Treat me to an omlette, at least."
You will have to slog hard for that!
- Slog hard?
- Yes.
And you are never gonna believe where she works.

"Yes, I can confirm that one Amanda Baylor is in the hiz-ouse."
"Very unattractive, in case you're wondering."
"By the way, are you aware of a little film called The Graduate?"
Mike Nichols.
Fantastic.
"""Would you like me to seduce you?"""
"Wait, what?"
Were you quoting the movie or was that real?
Where's Baylor?
Secure encryption room.
She's in the middle of a 72-hour shift.
"Logged in 14.5 hours ago, before I got here."
"Once an encryptor goes in, they don't come out-- department policy."
Probably well on the way to being ripe in there.
Did you know that your hair sparkles under these fluorescents?
Really?
How much does it sparkle?
So much.
So much?
"So, so much."
Open it.
Can't.
"No in, no out."
Encryptors even have their own private commode.
There's a lot of confidential crap in there.
Here.
"I can make sure you don't lose your job, but there might be something else we could talk about you losing."
I've decided to open it.
Thank you.
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.
"Make sure your ""Open, please come in"" signs are out."
You all know what to do.
"All right, nobody panics."
Here we go!
"Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere."
"- Minny, I know exactly where we are."
"- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere."
"- Honey, please."
- Hello.
"Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley."
Legendary for its service and hospitality.
How can we help you?
"- We don't need anything, thank you."
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.
He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee.
"We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we..."
- OK.
Really.
"We're just peachy, OK?"
"- What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel."
"No, it doesn't agree with my tank."
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
"- Good to see you, soldier!"
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs.
"- Honey, surplus!"
- We have too much surplus.
I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

what I like is
Apple cider right right right.
"In fact, there are loads of cool changes you could make now you're in charge, Rambo."
"We could have - I dunno, comfy chairs, working toilets, non-squeak doors..."
"What do you mean, 'in charge'?"
"If you lower the price of grain, people will buy more."
"Whoa, steady on, Professor."
I don't get any of that business-y shit.
I said I'd leave all that to Flavia.
He's just a dickless intern!
Flavia is out of touch.
"She just sits in her office getting her nails done, while the staff get bad backs and blocked-up bogs."
"Sorry, Prof. I promised my dad I wouldn't rock the boat."
I did that at the shipping company and three people drowned.
I should just keep my head down.
Sorry...
Do you own the company?
Big time.
"Right, well, in that case, I will keep my jug still."
Sorry for calling you dickless.
"Yes, congratulations, boss!"
Great throw!
From downtown for five points...
Interception!
Turnover.
Interception?
Since when?
Just now.
He shoots...
He scores!
That's eight-all.
"New ball, please, Prof. Uh-huh, coming up."
We should make it doubles!
Then we'd have someone to pass to and high-five!
Friends?
Ha!
- You are fatally sweet.
- Hm.
I wonder if George will be there.
She has the most alarming way of turning up everywhere I go.
I'm beginning to find it unnerving.
She has a desperate purpose.
What do you mean?
A while ago she was out drinking and gambling... she leads a rough life... and she boasted that...
Let's not talk about it.
I fear I am about to commit a tremendous faux pas.
"Socially she is too bizarre, but somehow I find her very compelling."
I wonder if she is different when alone.
She boasted that you are to be her next lover.
Alfred was there.
He's still the love of her life.
He put money on it you wouldn't be seduced.
"Yes, they made you the object of a bet."
"Well, you know she's eternally in need of money."
Here we are.
You have the most priceless expression on your face.
There's Mallefille.
We can be sure George is here.
He's still following her like a tail.
"Darling, it's so good to see you."
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- I didn't either.
(CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)
Chopin hates my paintings.
No.
"Dear friend, I am just a musician."
So I had to give you some sympathy points.
Can you stand up?
Do you need me to help you up?
I must learn well.
"Someday, I must possess acting skills comparable to this guy's."
"- When I said laughable,"
- Everyone together...
I didn't really mean it's funny.
I meant it's an embarrassment.
Do you understand?
Embarrassment?
Is it as bad as that?
It is.
"To me, it is!"
You're not allowed to leave!
I want you to wear the Love Me Dept uniform with me and be my nice partner.
"Gong Xi, I have run out of other options now, so I'd like to ask you to help me."
See if you can completely undo the knot in Mary's heart.
Don't rehearse anymore!
No one wants to watch such an idiotic show!
"Mary, how can you be so disruptive?"
I also think that the jie jie's response isn't very rational.
Let's see you act it out.
Show us how you'd interpret this Lola who resents her little sister.

Solo.
Lose half.
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.
- All right.
All right.
I'd miss you.
I'd miss you more than I can say.
Help me take this.
None on that side.
Keep going.
Let's go around this way.
Mrs. Cole?
"Watch yourself, girl."
- Mrs. Cole?
- Hmm?
- I thought you was under it.
- I was in the office.
Hmm.
"Okay, coming in from the left."
I might have to borrow clothes.

Aren't they the best French fries you've ever tasted?
I'd give them a silver medal.
Silver medal?

"- No, but I've had better."
- We're gonna do a taste test.
"- Fine, if you go by the Printer's."
- Where is this place?
"- In Bruges, in Flanders..."
- it's probable in Belgium.
"- Yes, I know."
I see someone with you or with a bunch of girl friends.
- I went by myself.
- Did you?
- How many countries did you visit?
- I traveled the world.
I graduated early and got a grant from my college... to do a photo essay... as part of my thesis and that was incredible!
That is amazing.
I can't believe you did all that by yourself.
I'm so impressed!
So... were you scared?
They tried to stripsearch me in Indonesia.
"I got a little heat from my bubblelicious probe but in... other letters, smooth sailing."
And did you make...
Did you make any disposable friends?
"A couple, but no crazy night with Ethan Hawke in Vienna... but I still have this Moroccan family who writes to me."
- I have the best pictures of them.
- Really?
Then I'd love to see them.
"However, unlike Freddie Lau,"
Fenchurch has been buried in Thames silt for at least a week now.
Impossible to recover any of the killer's DNA from her body.
Freddie Lau's casino is less than a mile from Pleasure Palace where Fenchurch worked.
You think we're looking for the same killer?
I'm just pointing out similarities in their deaths.
Strangling is not a common MO.
HARRY:
Such a clumsy way to kill someone.
What?
You have to look them right in the eye for a good three minutes.
You really have to hate them or love them.
HARRY:
Who's that?
Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov.
Jumped off his penthouse balcony.
Not much left of him.
It's going to take at least another 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.
SURI:
Harry?
Kaleem intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kaleem, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Kayleigh Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone new was trying to muscle out Freddie
- but Freddie wasn't listening.
- Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Yeah, but Kayleigh Fenchurch's murder was so precise."
"You know, no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
"Freddie Lau, his body's just dumped in an alleyway."
Sloppy
Check out the CCTV in Soho on the night Freddie died.
"If you have the information you want,"
I really don't see the point of this.
I spoke to your Sergeant yesterday about Mrs. Barr's last visit here.
With a different man.
Yes.
Obviously I was as shocked as anyone by news of Mrs. Barr's tragic death.
"Yes, I bet you were."
"I bet she was a good tipper, wasn't she?"
Did Mrs. Barr usually ask for a copy of the bill?
No.
But she did on this occasion.
Now Mrs. Barr's only slightly less disorganized than I am.
Why would she want a copy of the bill when she's already got the original?
"Mrs. Barr always settled the account herself, but on this occasion the gentleman did, cash."
"She asked me to give her a copy of the bill when they left that afternoon, without the gentleman knowing."
Really?
"Thank you, Mr. Ragdale."
May the Lord be with you.
And with Thy Spirit
"May almighty God bless you, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
Amen.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
Thanks be to God.
"Hello,"
I've been looking at this confession you gave me.
"Doesn't say very much, does it?"
"Ever thought of getting advice on your mood swings, Inspector?"
Hmm?
"So, you're back on the case?"
"No, no, I'm still suspended."
"This bit's a bit interesting,"
"'Salva me, fons pietatis'."
"Right, I'd like to get started right away."
Of course.
"Sara, would you get the neutrotope, please?"
Sorry.
It's a natural reaction.
"Right, I'll get back to you as soon as I can."
You're quite sure about volunteering to stay?
We must help these people.
Must we?
"Personally, I don't care if their whole planet turns into a mushroom."
I shall stay because I don't like an unsolved mystery.
You don't think Dortmunn and his life rocket are the answer?

"So, you tell him anything?"
"No, but if anyone asks, you're Suki."
So you didn't tell them anything.
Um...actually I told them you went to Mexico for cockfights.
"You know what, though?"
"Even if they don't believe me, they'll never look for you here."
Did you seriously bring a loofah?
What's a loofah?
"Hey, you said bring whatever was around the house."
But I meant like survival supplies like rope or muskets and not...

"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Love is off the target at times""."
"""On one side is Love and on the other is the world""."
"""Love is off the target at times""."
Drink it.
Fine.
"God, you're so bossy."
Force of habit.
I'm a nurse.
"Wait, you're that Annie?"
I'm calling my lawyer.
This is ridiculous.
I already told you everything.
"Well, You didn't tell us that your husband withdrew $10,000 three days before his death."
"Yeah, that's right, we have access to his financial records as well."
Maybe you do need to call your lawyer.
You didn't tell us about this either.
I did...
I didn't do anything.
You withheld information.
I can only think of one reason why you'd do that.
Because Troy had help ending his life.
You were there.
"Yeah, well, I wasn't there."
My husband needed me and I wasn't there.
"A few weeks before he died, he came apart."
He said he couldn't take it anymore.
He wanted it to end.
So he asked you to help him die.
"And instead of listening to what he wanted, I got angry."
And we had this huge fight.
I told him he was selfish.
Why didn't you tell us about it?
"Because I realized that he'd found someone to help him do what he wanted, someone to help him die."
And I was grateful.
I'm sorry.
"Well, good-bye, my puppet."
- Come on.
Keep moving.
- Fancy meeting you here.
"Why don't you come in, sit down, put your feet up?"
- Hand over those plans.
"- I've told you, I haven't got any plans."
- Talking won't get us anywhere.
- How are you?
- Let's search him.
- You've searched.
Don't you remember?
"I was down the road, my valet with me and some colored gentleman."
"Yes, we remember."
I suppose the girl didn't give you those plans just now?
That's right.
She didn't.
How did you guess?
- Oh!
We're wasting time.
"- If you insist, I'm only too glad to help."
- Never mind.
We'll take care of it.
"- No offense, old boy."
"Well, what did you intend to do with these cartridges?"
Cartridges?
"Yes, they are cartridges, aren't they?"
"I'm rather fond of shooting— Grouse shooting, to be precise."
- That's why I came down here.
- With a revolver?
"What do you expect me to bring, a fishing rod?"
I suppose you know that grouse shooting starts in August.
"Come on, Trevor, wake up."
Preston set that up.
"Crime waves hit, property value drops."
Then Preston moves in and buys it all up for cheap.
Shut up!
"Trevor, listen to me."
He doesn't give a damn about black or white.
The only color that son of a bitch cares about is green.
"Come on, kid, you gotta believe me."
Drop the gun.
"You let her go, we can work it out."
He told me you would try to turn me.
There are no traitors!
Voicemail messages?
That's ludicrous.
That boy is mentally unstable.
He always has been.
"Clark Preston, you have the right to remain silent."
I'm innocent.
And please feel free to exercise that right.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
"If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you."
"""I'm for truth, no matter who tells it."
"I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against."""
Malcolm X.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
Emily...
I'm so sorry.
"""Out there in the field, sorry doesn't bring people back."""
Ohh.
Are you crazy?
!
Nora!
Here.
Thanks.
"She doesn't understand me, so I got nervous  and let the tray fall down."
- It doesn't matter.
"I'm nice to her and I even gave her money, because she needs money."
- I had this well prepared.
"Tom, it doesn't fucking matter."
Nothing here is prepared.
Can you make breakfast for two?
Two?
Right away.
Leave it alone!
Just leave it alone for now.
"It's okay, we'll leave it alone."
We'll leave it alone.
Just a moment.
Pull yourself together.
"Hello, I'm Josephine Reiter."
Franz is starting up a commune.
This is no commune.
I met Josephine at an entrepreneur's seminar.
She was my marketing instructor.
"Great, and what does that have to do with me?"
Actually this is a historical location here.
But now my cousin wants to set up some sort of Christian-Communist enclave.
- Certainly there are people out there that would be interested.
"Maybe not here, but in general."
Am I right?
Certainly you can turn this in to something.
Bevan?
"Yes, Bevan."
"Bevan, yes, yes."
"Bevan, your boyfriend Bevan."
Fiance.
Just rooms and rooms full of bleeding saints and fat cherubs.
"There's this room full of these Goya sketches, sort of man's inhumanity stuff."
I could hardly breathe.
Felt a bit the same when I saw Pica's stuff.
Did Goya murder kids too?
No.
And you don't judge artists by the way they live their lives.
"I don't care if he can sing, write, paint and dance all at the same time."
An arsehole's an arsehole.
Isn't it time you went on a diet?
"No, I'm a good weight."
How long have we got this room?
How long does it take to fix cancerous testicles?
Oh.
"Oh, geez, Keith must be pissed."
He never used the bloody things when he had 'em.
Found out what our boy did with his money.
Yeah?
"He paints a masterpiece, sells it at grunge markets for a fiftieth of what it's worth, then wanders around the city handing out wads of cash to homeless people."
Jesus Christ.
We're defending Jesus Christ.
I don't need money.
"That was Denny Lorton, my previous life."
Now I find it an intrusion.
So that's what you were doing in a lane that night?
You were giving Ben Rigby money?
I'd been told about him.
I wrote this song about
An 11-year-old girl who wanted to be a rock star.
"But she also wanted a normal life, so"
She pretended to be somebody else and
"That was great for a little while, but"
She's 17 now and life is even more complicated.
And she just doesn't want to pretend anymore.
Her name is Miley Stewart.
[Audience gasps]
Whoa.
Take that kitty cat flushing a toilet!
[Laughing]
Anyway.
"It's been a long time since I've sung without my friend here, so"
I hope you like it.
"[Singing ""Wherever I Go""] Oh, yeah."
Here we are now.
Everything's about to change.
We face tomorrow as we say goodbye to yesterday.
A chapter ending but the story is only just begun.
A page is turning for everyone.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me wherever I go.
Wherever I go.
So excited I can barely even catch my breath.
We have each other to lean on for the road ahead.
This happy ending is the start of all our dreams.
And I know your heart is with me.
I hate airplanes.
I don't even know what keeps them up.
They're made out of sticks and bed sheets.
Why don't they just open up in two and drop Jimmy like a stone into water?
"That's right, Evelyn, you don't understand anything about it."
You've never done it.
You don't know why I do it.
So would you please just hold it down and let me think?
That's Capital Peak.
"Now, what's Edgar doing there?"
Easy.
Easy.
I'll give you another pill.
- You can't carry me all day.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.
"- You can't, we both know that."
- I'm not gonna carry you.
You should just leave me here.
Go on ahead and if you find somebody send them back for me.
Just when I'm getting used to you?
- You mean that?
"- Yeah, I mean that."
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to make a travois.
The thing the Indians used to use to carry stuff around in the wintertime.
Pretty smart.
"Well, a pilot's gotta be."
"Put yourself down in a field someplace, it's up to you to get yourself out."
National Guard de Havillands got out after problems with their plumbing.
Why are you here?
I didn't call you.
"- Been thinking it over, Mr Moravia."
I was a friend of his and... that he talked about you a lot.
He wanted me to give something to you too.
What is it?
It's the new Barbie Sunday dress.
- For real?
- Yea.
I think it should fit.
There's something else in there too.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
"Your father was a good guy, April."
He told me how you two got lost in the mall one day and then had ice cream.
Well...
See ya.
Barbie Sunday show cancelled
What are we going to do now ?
I'll think of something.
Cold Pizza And A Warm Puppy
What's funny?
Russ didn't tell you ?
"Tell me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
He didn't tell you about Pete ?
No .
Who is Pete ?
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible because he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
What did he do ?
He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and the sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while, he heard a voice inside that said:"
"Let me see, let me see."
"Ah, the groaning board, the teeming table, the endless variety of God's bounty."
"Cheffing is a truly perfect art, far above mere painting or sculpture."
You can't eat a sheet of canvas or a lump of rock.
I don't know.
You could if you were drunk and had enough ketchup.
"- Morning, Richie."
- Do my senses deceive me?
Has Eddie Catflap emerged from the arms of Morpheus or perhaps an elephant has blown off?
No.
Right first time.
"It is I, smelly Eddie."
To whiff him is to love him.
"Ready for anything, as long as it's alcoholic."
"- Morning, Richie."
- Where's my shopping list?
Gas mask.
"Now then, shall we have seven courses or eight?"
Don't want do look ostentatious.
But don't want to look like a bloody pauper.
Better make it 12.
We could be like the Romans and throw up between courses.
Why should they get the credit for that idea?
I've been doing it for years.
"Morning, Richie."
"Twelve gas masks, clothes peg for nose, smelling salts and a ticket to Australia to get away from Eddie's whiff."
"- I said, morning, Richie!"
- Ah!
"I got you, then, didn't I?"
I got you.
"Morning, Eddie."
I trust you slept well?
"I would have preferred him to be guilty, but alive."
This hanging is a horrible story.
It's not our fault.
We should have better monitored him.
"You, especially."
"You're my assistant, right?"
I can not have eyes everywhere.
"So when the judge will be here, be available to him."
With deference.
"Otherwise, you will return to ""La Santé"" jailhouse."
If you knew the trouble I was given to be posted here.
This is an entry permit.
Mr Fandor?
"It is unfortunate that the procurator authorizes a journalist, especially today."
I know you really want to kiss your brother but will you be able to endure the test?
Open the door.
Nibet.
"We lay back Mr Dollon on his bed, Mr judge."
He seems to sleep.
"Damn, the dead has left."
"Listen, let's be serious,"
- you're in the wrong cell.
- But no!
You see that he is not here.
He was here a few minutes ago.
You're fooling us..
He was moved elsewhere.
Impossible.
I'm the only one with keys.
Anyone know where the corpse from cell 12 is?
No one came.
The dead was here.
♪ That someday ♪
♪ That we can learn to love ♪
♪ Just one more day. ♪
Wonderful!
Thanks.
"Dang, cuz."
You got to perform a gig at the shrimp truck.
Pro Bono?
At least until you win your first Grammy.
(chuckles)
"Well, since we're on the topic of regrets-- you not pursuing your music-- I'll share mine."
Years ago I had the opportunity to participate in Doctors Without Borders.
"It was a six month stint in Mozambique, but I decided not to take it."
Why not?
"Well, you know, dealing with living, breathing patients isn't exactly my strong suit."
That's why I took up a career in forensic pathology.
"Apparently, some people consider me awkward and off-putting."
"No, that's crazy."
"No way, Doc, not you."
Thank you.
"And yourself, any regrets?"
Please.
I'm a two-time felon.
I own four businesses now.
It's the oppa that acted arrogant before.
Did the owner change?
Wasn't this Daniel's shop?
Did Daniel say that he's the owner?
Daniel and I are both owners.
"Then, Daniel..."
I heard he was banned from entering our country.
I don't know that fool.
My 5-year-old niece just texted me this.
"""Uncle Jesse, you're a big fat stinking... ooh!"""
How does she know that word?
And my grandma's weighing in.
Probably just to say that she loves you and that everything's gonna be okay.
Yeow!
Now you know where your little niece got the trucker mouth.
Look Jesse you had to know that dating me.
Was sometimes gonna be a pain in the...
Well I'm not your grandma so I'm just gonna say complicated.
Dating me would be a pain in the complicated.
"But I'm worth it, aren't I?"
"Again this is where you say ""No..."""
What?
What do I say?
And to which one of you?
"Because if I'm dating Hannah, now I'm cheating on Miley."
"And if I'm dating Miley, then I'm the jerk who broke Hannah Montana's heart."
Either way I'm just...
[Cell phone buzzing]
And that's my mom.
"Ooh well if we ever get married, she is not gonna be baby-sitting the triplets."
I have very specific fortune cookies?
Would you stop joking about this?
"Listen, Jesse sometimes joking about it is the only way that I get through it."
You just stepped into this.
This has been my life for six years.
Please let's just forget about it.
Come on.
"Pizza, a movie, anything."
Let's go.
Pizza and a movie is not gonna fix this.
We're still looking.
I'll send you a copy of the report when I get one.
"Hey, tell your father not to be such a stranger."
I'm forgetting how ugly his mug is.
You're lucky you didn't get his looks.
"Oh, shit."
So you're telling me your sister is on a TV that is completely cut off from any sort of signal?
"Yes, that is why I need to call her now."
"- Anna, you know it's against the rules."
Only one 5-minute call at the end of each day.
"You know, it's easier to just deliberate and get it over with then to try to get out of it."
"If I tell the judge you think people are trying to talk to you through a TV that's not even connected, what do you think she's going to say?"
You're right.
"Look, Anna, I know it sucks being down here, but look at the bright side."
Maybe you'll make a friend or two.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
"- No, menstrual cycles are late, lawyers are on time."
"Time is money, isn't that right?"
Yeah.
It's 7:30 in the morning.
"It's 7:51, actually."
Hi.
"Can I get you a drink, sir?"
- Coffee.
He'll have a Bud.
I'll have coffee.
And he's had enough.
This is my first.
"Right, Danielle?"
Just messing with you.
Why do you do that?
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonours us.
You even sold your gold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you another son right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Your son didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
You're weak and mute.
"God, damn you!"
You have no pride.
"You have no dignity, no honour."
Look at your honour...
It's being trampled on.
You're an absolute disgrace.
It's my conscience that stops me.
Do you think I am not sad?
Traditions matter more than our conscience.
"Go ahead, hide in the barn, cover your head."
I told you when he was a little boy to get rid of the Zenne then.
You paid no heed.
God forgive us for what we've done or are about to do.
I can not act until I have concrete proof.
"We believe in the same God, Kezban."
He will whisper to me.
I wish you'd stay.
"Um, Alan, when people win awards, aren't they usually happy?"
I was just a kid who took a summer job and kept getting promoted while I was trying to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life.
"Now it's 27 years later, and tonight, I won something."
"I won the realization that I am Alan Matthews,"
"I am 42 years old, I am a grocer."
You want to quit your job?
"Ah, I just want to take a hot bath."
You don't want to get in that tub.
It's disgusting.
"Uh, what..."
Excuse me.
Could I have my robe back?
"Hey, I'm naked under here."
Enjoy.
A motel room.
Only three hours from home.
"I should be in my room tonight, not in a motel room in the middle of nowhere, with a toilet seat that has not been sanitized for my protection."
I don't believe that paper strip for a minute.
Better?
A little.
"I told you, we just got this room so I could clean up for my date tonight."
"Eric, I've been a good brother on this trip."
"I mean, I've indulged your little whims,"
I've been very supportive.
Why're you doing this?
I'm just not ready for the summer to end yet.
"Well, I am."
"I mean, I got a girlfriend."
"I got Shawn, I got school."
I got a life waiting for me back at home.
"Yeah, you do."
"That must be nice, huh?"
Won't every day start fresh for you?
He's Devadas...no he's Kalidas...
This is fine for us...
We've memory loss...
Hey Babe!
My heart will never stop...
"Isn't this loss, a big profit for us, boss?"
"No battles or wars or without history, this life is a curse..."
"So my dear, buddy..."
This life is not a curse but a big boon...
Oh God!
I'm stuck!
Is memory loss a boon to you?
I feel...
Hey stay out!
I'll kill you...
"bloody, I'll kill you..."
Let's escape!
"Is she so angry on me, bloody bitch?"
Why did you beat him severely?
I should've killed him.
He's happy forgetting the past.
Enjoying life.
"While falling in love, he was happy, while in love, he was happy, even in separation, he's happy."
Is forgetting past a boon?
"Bloody, I'll kill him..."
Sister!
"You beat him, right?"
Leave him.
I'll not leave him simply.
What will you do?
"I'll make him remember our past, I'll make him remember our love, when he remembers everything, I'll marry Kalyankrishna then."
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison, hmm..."
When your stupid bitch of boyfriend turns on you?
They kill your aunt.
They almost kill Lydia.
"Who do you really think's gonna be next, hmm?"
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
"Is that what you tell yourself, hmm?"
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
What are you doing here?
I...
That was.
-.
That was...
There's nothing to move.
I...
I was...
I had a sunburn.
"Good night, sir."
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish!
See and take in with your eyes all the beauty the ocean has to offer!
"As these new things come at you, you may not have seen them before, but be open to them and find the beauty within."
"Hey, buddy."
Yep.
Thanks a lot for bringing me to Problem Island.
What are we gonna do for an encore?
Talk about all the people that we slept with before we were married and really stir shit up?
What the hell are you talking about?
The therapist is trying to create a problem in my marriage that doesn't exist!
"Maybe he's not creating them, maybe he's just noticing them."
"Okay, you know what?"
Don't start with me.
I'm serious.
I don't need it.
"These are the best in the world at what they do, all right?"
"If Jeff Gordon told you that your oil was low, you might want to think about changing it."
"From the bucket, feed them!"
My therapist is kind of pushy.
Really?
Yeah.
"God, I like ours."
"Yeah, he said that Dave and I take each other for granted."
"That, you know, our relationship has become more like a job."
FITZGERALD:
We got horses over here!
"Hey, Bridger."
We got horses!
JIM:
What you want to do about these pigs?
FITZGERALD:
"The Lord's on our side, kid."
FITZGERALD:
"You all right there, kid?"
Your head in the right place?
I guess.
I can't help thinking about whether we did the right--
Ain't our place to wonder.
The good Lord got us on a road whether we choose it or not.
"My pop, he weren't a religious man, you know?"
"If you couldn't grow it, kill it, or eat it, he just plain old didn't believe in it."
And this one time he head on up the old Saba hills.
San Saba hills?
He joined a couple Texas Ranger buddies of his to hunt.
Pretty routine.
He done it like a hundred times before.
"Should have been a 3-day kill, but on the second day, it all went fucked."
Somehow that night he lost his buddies.
And to top it off them Comanches went and took the horses.
"So he was starving and delirious and he crawls up into this mott, this group of trees out in the middle of nowhere just sticking up in this ocean of scrub and he found religion."
"At that moment, he told me he found God."
Uh-huh.
And it turns out that God He's a squirrel.
Yeah.
"A big, old meaty one."
"""I found God,"" he used to say."
"I've only written in the figure ""1""."
Fill in as many zeros as you fancy
Then you'll see how easy forgetting is
Are you joking?
Or are you illiterate?
"I'm lettered, but not for sale"
Is it the wrong time on a wrong day?
"No, you're welcome anytime."
My decision won't change
Nice knowing a man who can't be bought whatever the price
But if you want to sell...
Are you responding to our ad?
Not quite what you assume
I'll see her out
"Om, how did you find her?"
"Forget it, Ma"
Your exams are around the corner and you're keeping up at nights
What are you upto?
Studies?
Or are you at the computer?
"I make my grade, don't I?"
"In studies, in sports, entertainment"
You ask my principal what I mean to the college
I need a loan to buy a software.
Loan...?
Yes.
Loan.
I'll pay it back
You will...?
"First, prove something to me"
Prove...?
What did Jai prove to you?
He is not a man.
He is a woman.
He's all emotion and refinement.
He has very few defences.
You must win him as a man wins a woman.
"If anyone can do it, you can, George."
This is enlightening.
Tell me more.
How does a man pursue a woman?
"He flings himself at her feet, follows her everywhere."
"Wherever she turns, he is there, pouring into her ear only what she most wants to hear."
"His passion frightens her, but a woman will always bend toward a strong man, just as the vine stretches toward the wall."
A woman is always on the point of abandoning herself anyhow.
It only takes one firm push.
You are sublime!
A true friend.
Ah!
Yes.
Those are marvellous.
Yes.
This is from...
George Sand.
Thank you.
"And I want something with a much thinner, narrower line."
"Yes, that is good, I think."
"In fact, you could make this even more..."
"No, I don't want this."
"Take it off, please."
You are so good to escort me tonight.
People shun me unless I am on the arm of someone respectable.
I do not understand your concern.
You will find nothing but friends at Eugene's.
- Is this a trick?
"- Nope, just, you know, wanted to do something nice for someone other than myself for a change."
"So hopefully, I don't know, we can all hang out, we can be friends."
Friends.
If you want.
"Anyways, enjoy the show."
"- Do you want this closed, or...?"
- Yeah.
"Thanks for letting me stay over, and thanks for breakfast."
"You finally learned how to make French toast, huh?"
"Mm, anytime."
Happy to have the company.
- I know what you mean.
"- Yeah, what do you know about being lonely?"
Hmm.
"Well, let's see."
My stepfather blackmailed me into living with my mom.
"My mom shipped my little sister off to boarding school, oh, and my boyfriend spent the entire summer with a girl, who may or may not have been pregnant with his child,"
- and now that he is back he won't talk to me thanks to D.J.
- Who's D.J.?
"Doesn't even matter since he's not talking to me, either."
"Mariss, honey?"
You ready to go?
I'm gonna go get my stuff.
Back to the gulag.
She knows I heard that.
It's a little game we play.
Mm-hmm.
So how's Caleb?
"Fantastic, never better."
"- Facing prison, we could lose everything."
- So you gonna divorce him and take his kids?
We must sink them!
Only Commander Yu Jong can issue such orders.
It will be too late if we wait for Yu Jong's orders!
"If they get away, you will be killed as well!"
Admiral Yi does not have the right of command.
He is not to take independent action.
That is the order of the King!
"Practice restraint, Admiral."
"Admiral, they have passed the big island!"
"If we don't act now, it will be too late!"
Very well.
I'll will go!
And I will assume full responsibility!
No one is to take hostile action!
What?
"Admiral, give me your command!"
Are you going to let it end like this?
Do not take action.
Your life and your men's lives are at stake.
"Admiral, we're running out of time!"
"If they pass Hando Island, they will be out of our reach."
It is high treason!
Admiral!
Go after them!
What happened?
They launched the ships.
Yi Soon-shin has taken action!
How dare he!
After them!
Don't let them get away!
Full speed ahead!
Don't let them get away!
(laughter and applause)
"Our final round, ladies and gentlemen, as ever, is a dazzlingly dispiriting display of general ignorance."
"Fingers hovering over your mushroomoid-style buzzers now, please, and let's see if we can give Alan a run for his money."

- Magellan.
- Magellan!
"- Oh, dear!"
Oh!
- (alarm bells)
- What have I done?
"- Magellan is the howler, I'm afraid."
I'm sorry.
"- What do you mean, no?"
Ring him.
"- No, he wasn't."
He wasn't the first.
Magellan was killed in the Philippines halfway round.
He never finished.
He never finished.
His ship was the first to.
"The laurels go to his second in command, the almost completely unknown J S Elcano, aka Juan Sebastian del Cano."
"I don't suppose they'll rename the Magellan Straits the del Cano Straits, but nonetheless, it's good to help out people who've been deprived by history."
"So, what was the nationality of the inventor of the helicopter?"
- British.
"- (Stephen) British, you think?"
"No, not correct."
- (express train whistles)
- Italian?
Oh!
"Italian, he said!"
"Oh, we thought you might say that."
"Yes, sir."
I have a good idea of where he is.
But we don't want lntelligence in this.
"I regret to say, sir, yes."
"That's right, sir. I ref use."
The last address Yale had for Preston was a town I'd never heard of.
"Welcome to Gulf City, Mr. Murdock."
Murdock....
"Yes, a room is reserved f or you."
Nobody knew I was coming.
"- Warren Murdock, and f rom St. Louis."
"- l don't get it, but I'll take it."
It's our best.
The gentleman who telephoned insisted.
"- Then it's f or me, all right."
"- Front, boy."
"Geronimo, the paratroopers' jump call."
"It was Johnny, all right."
We could read each other's minds.
He knew I'd want to help.
He'd seen me look at the back of his pin.
"Will call later, the message said."
That was 10 hours ago.
"How long is ""later""?"
"What to do in a hot wind, smelling of jasmine ex cept wait and sweat and prime the body to sweat more?"
A phone directory might help.
I'd never heard of Johnny speak of any relatives but I was ready to try anything.
"""Prendergast, Prescott, Prestwood. """
"Stalled again, like a jeep on synthetic gas."
48 hours since he'd called and no word.
I'd pitched the Cardinals into the pennant and set the Red Sox down in the World Series.
"Suddenly, Johnny's service record came to me like a photograph."
We'll get anything you need.
-So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
"-No, within the compound will be fine."
-We were going to New England.
-That's off.
-Am I a prisoner?
"-That's not how we see it, Kay."
"Come on, kids."
We're going back to the house.
Joe.
"Cuba, Cuba!"
Most respected gentlemen.
Welcome to Havana.
I want to thank this distinguished group of American industrialists for continuing to work with Cuba for the greatest period of prosperity in her entire history.
"Mr. William Shaw, representing the General Fruit Company."
"Messrs. Corngold and Dant, of United Telephone and Telegraph Company."
"Mr. Petty,"
Regional Vice President of the Pan American Mining Corporation.
Mr. Robert Allen of South American Sugar.
"Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada, representing our associates in tourism and leisure activities."
"And my old friend and associate from Florida,"
Mr. Hyman Roth.
I would like to thank United Telephone and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.
A solid gold telephone.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to look at it.
-Mr.
President?
-Yes?
Could you discuss the rebel activity and what this can mean to our businesses?
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.
"I assure you that, although the rebels have started a campaign in Las Villas,"
"What I mean is if he could stay in the sick bay he'd be out of their hands, you see."
- Who would be out of whose hands?
- Your son.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I can hear everything.
My quarters are just opposite.
These punishments...
Is my...
Is Mr. Crawford the only one punished?
"No, but when two or three get beaten, he's always one of them."
It's got to stop.
"On the lower deck, men are beginning to think..."
- Think what?
- What I mean is...
"Mr. Scott-Padget's compliments, sir."
"He begs you for an audience, sir."
"At once, if possible."
"He said it is of the most vital importance, sir."
"- Mr. Crawford, go to sick bay."
"- No, sir, I'm not ill."
Honestly.
"Please, may I take him your answer, sir?"
I'll deliver it myself.
- You asked to see me.
- I didn't expect you to come.
I want to thrash you and clap you in irons but that would suit you very well.
"- I fail to understand, sir."
- Do you?
I won't follow your previous captains onto the beach.
Understood?
"- Now, what do you want?"
- Only to be restored to duty.
"- I cannot do that, Miss."
Everything must be in order.
Does the letter weigh too much?
You may want to come back to the counter again!
Here's another letter for him.
Maybe they know his address.
"Wait, I'll write it down for you."
"Again, I'm so sorry."
"Don't strain yourself, Karl!"
"If I were to wait for Bruno, I wouldn't get going today."
He's still on his lunch break.
Just once I'd like to see that you did not make any excuses for your brother.
How long will you be gone?
"Well, Anna, I really don't know."
The stuff here must go to Frankfurt and Essen.
And I won't return empty-handed.
That doesn't pay.
"And I'd also like to do some sightseeing in the West, you know."
"Middelmann  Co., starting anew over there."
"What, from Berlin?"
That's out of the question!
"But Anna, it can't go on like this;"
that you're always assisting.
But that doesn't bother me.
It does me!
I want my kid to inherit something of value!
Has he stirred again?
- Are you Mr John?
"- Yes, what is it?"
I just want to enquire about an address.
My husband needs to go.
You wait in the office meanwhile.
Hey.
- Hey.
"- Any luck with the sponsor, hunt?"
Nobody's made a donation since Sonny Newman was alive.
"Check this out, bro."
They're back in town.
Been here a while I guess.
They came into the copy shop to design this for some kind of business that they run.
But get this.
"Back in 2002, they won the lottery."
Brought back the Chiefs for one season and then became these big time poker players.
- So are you thinking...
- They lived here.
They played hockey.
They got lots of cash.
"So when the Chiefs folded, we took our lottery money and we went gambling."
"Roulette, dice, poker, Vegas, Atlantic City."
We were high rollers.
"But it was an empty life, you know."
"Babes, booze, bar fights."
"Our wives left us, took our kids."
You guys have kids?
"- Yeah, we got three of them."
"- Yeah, one each."
"Yeah, the judge said we weren't good role models."
Said we have to find peace and balance.
"That night during wrestling, I saw a TV ad for Peace and Balance."
- So we bought a franchise.
- Zenovation.
- So how's business?
- Sucks.
- Real bad.
- Mm...
"Not a big chance, no."
"- Sarah, please."
In the name of all that's holy.
I am the one who bought you your first bra.
I'm not above playing the guilt card.
"Sorry, Mom."
- Who'd you tell?
"- Come on, Mom!"
You spent a night in jail for smoking pot.
This family should have a Bat-Signal for things that good.
Don't worry about it.
"If I were you, I would be trying to live great stories."
You've had too much responsibility for too long.
Yeah.
I know.
Being good for this family has been my sole purpose of existence for as long as I can remember.
I don't know.
"Maybe it's the residual cannabis talking, but what is the meaning of life supposed to be the rest of my life?"
To enjoy it.
However you want.
"Mom, you don't have to worry about being good."
You should just be worried about having fun.
You might want to draw the line at things that get you arrested.
Yeah.
"Well, if it's all right with you,"
I am gonna take a shower for about an hour.
- Here.
- Thank you for picking me up.
"Of course, Mom."
I know you'd do the same for me.
Sorry.
She was everything to me...
Everything.
Stanley is 22?
Yes.
"We were courting when Peggy found she was expecting, so, yes,"
I did the decent thing.
But that doesn't change anything.
I'd have married her anyway.
"I loved her, always did."
Were you aware of the changes your wife made to her will?
Spencer is a swine.
"I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't listen to me, and so now..."
Half the hotel.
How do you expect me to go on living when...
Everything I care about has been taken away from me?
Do you cure your own meat at the hotel?
What's that got to do with anything?
Would I be right in thinking that?
I don't know.
Yes.
Margaret was in charge of the kitchen.
Thank you.
"Christopher, I'm afraid I've got some bad news."
"Sir Ernest bannerman, the mp at the white feather, he's managed to pull rank."
"He's made some phone calls, and the long and the short of it is I had to release the lot."
Ok.
They've all gone?
"Yes, they went this morning, except Spencer."
"He's here, and he wants to talk to you."
All right.
"How can I help you, Mr. Spencer?"
"You're holding my assistant, and unless you're going to charge him,"
- Hi.
- Thank you.
You'll like it.
It's nice.
Good fries.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks."
What?
This place all right?
"So, Fiona, how are you?"
"- I mean, how are you feeling?"
- My stomach's fine.
Great.
"I must still be a bit barmy, though."
"This kind of thing doesn't go away overnight, does it?"
No.
"If Mum was going to get Will to marry her, she'd have to quit making jokes like that."
At least she looked good.
I had her put on that nice hairy jumper  and the earrings she got from her friend that went to Zimbabwe.
The kid seemed to think this was some kind of date.
"As for his mum, she was clearly insane  and appeared to be wearing some kind of Yeti costume."
This had better be quick.
We were definitely not ordering starters.
"I'll start with the artichoke, please."
Then I'll have a mushroom omelet with fries and a Coke.
- I'll have the vegetable platter.
- We're vegetarians.
I'd never have guessed.
"Steak sandwich, please, mate."
Thanks.
Don't just sit there.
Talk to each other.
"Ooh, hey, look, it's Honesty Cola's Worl Of Wrestling."
Cool.
"[Man on TV] Hear me, wrestling fans."
"I, the Human Baboon, crave vengeance!"
Beautiful Steven will know the agony of my feet!
"Uh, I mean ""efeat""."
"Well, it's been a while."
All must be going well.
"Apparently, the Tick wasn't so quick to discover my clone."
Devour brain!
Oooh.
Big brain!
Don't be so sure.
Tick will catch on.
Just you wait.
"Actually, I can't wait."
"I have to go, if you catch my drift."
Nature is one call you can't put on hold.
- Be right back.
- Be right back!
Will eat brain.
Yum!
"No offence, but you scare me."
"What's goin' on, little bunny guy?"
[Strains] I am a moth!
Are you aware that your roommate is a hideous monster from another dimension with evil plans for world domination?
"Listen, a good roommate-relationship is based on a respect for privacy."
"Look, can you at least loosen these straps?"
Because they're chafing me.
[TV] The Human Baboon has pulle something out of his baboon pants.
It looks like an unsanctione foreign object.
"Yes, it's a scale moel of the Eiffel Tower in Paris."
Is that a girl who could kill herself?
"This is 1 957, Sam."
An unmarried girl that got pregnant was an outcast.
Sometimes they'd end the pregnancy.
Sometimes they'd even end their own lives.
- Maybe Greg helped her do both.
- You really think he killed her?
Hilla tried to break up with Greg on the fourth.
She said they fought all night.
"She broke with him, Al, but it was too late."
She was pregnant.
He's gotta be the killer.
But you've got no proof of that.
I've got feelings.
Feelings?
That's a song.
You've got no evidence.
- You got no gun.
You got no bullet.
You got nothin'.
- I got her.
You got shadow and light flickering on a wall.
That's not Hilla.
What you're seeing is in your imagination.
"[ Sam ] She's trying to tell me something, Al."
"I don't know what it is, but she's trying to tell me something."
"[ Sam Narrating ] As much as I hate to admit it, sometimes Al's right."
Hilla was haunting me in a way even I couldn't understand.
"But I kept thinking about the road she had traveled to get here... and all she had lost along the way... to die alone, buried and forgotten, with her murderer free."
I had to be here to change that.
[ Lyle ] I told you this was a waste of time.
Not really.
There's a field drag effect too.
We're having to use a lot of power to maintain our speed and heading.
"Avon, I saw Mandrian with this."
Then he put it back in the bottom of Sara's flight bag.
What is it?
That's what I want you to tell me.
[ALARM]
Look!
Filtration malfunction.
We'd better get down there.
- Dr Kendall wants you.
- Filter plant?
There's been another killing.
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
Tell me what happened.
"I was coming past, and I heard a noise."
So I looked inside.
Mandrian was just as you see him.
"Sonheim was standing over him, with this dagger in his hand."
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him!
Power reserves are almost gone
"In 103 minutes, it will no longer be possible to operate force wall and main drive simultaneously."
Please decide which to close down.
Without main drive we'll never get out of this.
Without the force wall we'll be smashed to pieces!
Have the locators detected the outer edge of the storm yet?
No.Yes!
No.
Maybe.
"Which is it, Vila?"
"All we know is he's got a gun, maybe worse."
Gibbs says he's got a backup unit on the way.
We don't make any moves until they get here.
I'm gonna let McGee know.
I can't believe you do this every day.
"Well, not every day, and not like this."
You sure we're not too conspicuous?
Not if we stand here like we're just talking to each other.
We are talking to each other.
You two with NCIS?
I am.
Special Agent Ellie Bishop.
Special Agent DiNozzo.
And I'm Jake Malloy.
Lieutenant Janet Lewis.
"Now, where is this alleged imposter?"
He just went into the men's room.
Calm and cool.
Secure this whole area.
No one enters until I say.
Not quite the cavalry we were expecting.
"Yeah, well, I expected to be home right now getting my cranberries started, but we can't have everything."
You have your service weapons?
"Oh, not me."
"I'm a-an attorney, with NSA."
"Attorneys stand over there, please."
Be careful.
I will be.
Adorable.
"Okay, now, let's keep our weapons out of sight until we get in there."
Last thing we want to do is panic this crowd.
Can't we just evacuate this terminal?
Well you can have me.
I don't wanna have you.
I wanna make love to you.
I'm telling this for your own good...
I think you should go home.
You've spent all your energy trying to get me excited and then...
Want to throw me out?
Please leave...
Come here.
Ok I'd like two orders of shrimp fried rice.
An order of shrimp and pea pods.
An order of shrimp with lobster sauce.
And an order of jumbo shrimp.
Owen...get up.
-What I'm working on.
-That's what I'm working on.
Are you...a researcher?
"No I'm a TV producer, do you think that they exist?"
So you're looking for heroin and you don't want the police to know about it.
"Listen, this really has nothing to do with drug traffic."
What can I do?
Nobody really knows the true nature of these aliens.
You're from Germany?
"Yes, Berlin."
I'm jewish...
So what connections do you think there can possibly be between UFO's and...heroin?
What the fuck is going on in here?
Have you ever seen a UFO ?
"Yes, this morning, that's why I'm here."
Well that's very interesting.
Would you like a drink?
You can see it as well.
"Look at her, she's a barfly that hangs out at cop bars."
"She probably heard boys in blue talking about the case over beers, so she comes down here figuring she can get something for nothing."
"She did ask for something, didn't she?"
"C'mon, what was it?"
I gave her a cigarette.
"And if you went so far as to offer her a drink, she'll say she was on the Chicago flight with OJ."
She was in the parking lot behind St Lukes.
"She saw an Oldsmobile or a Chevy, she's not sure which."
"Two guys get out, open the trunk, lift out a body, throw it in the dumpster."
- Two guys?
She can ID them?
- She didn't see their faces.
Of course not!
"She did get a partial plate, 287, she thinks."
"Oh, so she's down here looking for a partial reward?"
She's a joke.
- She knows about the white gloves.
- What?
- You got an address on this woman?
- Mm-hm.
"Take Tim, go to her apartment, find out everything you can."
"I'm gonna have a little chat with her, find out what she knows and how she knows it."
"Frank, go slow."
You see me smiling?
"Hi, I'm Frank Pembleton."
Pamela Wilgis.
It's nice to meet you.
"Nice to meet you too, Pamela."
"So, she was wearing gloves?"
"- Yeah, I seen it."
- You seen what?
When the two guys dumped her.
- It was his hat.
- What are you doing with his hat?
Why shouldn't I have his hat?
"Hanna, maybe you're looking for something a little edgier after Sean."
- But this guy is dark.
"- Spencer, he's not that dark."
He's dark enough.
"Well, he's no Arthur Dodger, whoever that is."
"Yeah, he's just had it tough."
Are you two on speaking terms again?
- Of course we are.
- You need to be careful about that guy.
It seems to me we had this conversation once about Toby.
I'm looking for Coach Fulton.
- Is the coach expecting you?
- The coach is avoiding me.
- That's what the coach is doing.
- Are you a parent?
"Yes, I'm a parent."
Nick McCullers.
My daughter is Paige McCullers.
I have your daughter in English Comp.
I'm Ezra Fitz.
The coach.
Why don't we walk to the principal's office see if we can find Coach Fulton?
I've seen the principal and all I got was politically correct double-talk.
About the agenda in this place that's penalizing my daughter.
Taking opportunities and giving them to someone who doesn't deserve them!
"Everybody gets a fair chance here, Mr. McCullers."
We go out of our way to make sure it works.
My girl is the best swimmer on that team.
You can't give it to somebody...
With each round trip to The bluff costing thousands...
Let's go ahead and get That anchor set.
Shawn can't afford To come up empty again.
Anchors away!
It's the only miles I can hike today underwater.
"So today, he's hoping to Get maximum mobility underwater."
By trying something new...
Harnessing a mini-dredge And oxygen supply to his back.
"Hopefully, we didn't come out Here, spend all this time."
And money for nothing.
"If there's gold on the claim, I'm gonna know about it today."
On the bottom.
Big boulders.
Big boulders.
Copy?
"Okay, I got you."
Copy.
How's the visibility?
Good.
Just go ahead And cut me loose.
"Okay, shawn, I've cut you loose."
That's good.
I'm working my way over here.
There's a lot.
I cut the dredge loose From the pier.
So the dredge can go away From this big boat.
And we can stay on anchor And safe.
And look how far he just Walked.
"He just walked 50, 80 feet."
"Free from any constraints,"
Shawn marches along the Seafloor At depths of over 25 feet.
Not seeing anything here.
"Equip the ARX-7 with a rapid deployment booster and Boxer shot cannon, and have it stand by in the elevator."
Aye.
Thank you.
I want everyone to make it back safely!
She says...
The communication line just opened on its own.
Did someone let us hear that on purpose?
Who knows.
But I never would've expected Tessa to argue so forcefully with the XO like that.
"She wants everyone to make it back safely, huh?"
"What do you think, guys?"
"That's what I intend to do, of course."
"We can't make our princess sad, now can we?"
To think she'd be so worried about us...
I'm honestly moved!
It's just like her.
She's a good officer.
We have until 0600 hours.
"If you call yourselves pros, you'd better live up to that."
I don't make mistakes.
"You don't make mistakes, either."
And that's going to get everything wrapped up nice and tight.
Got that?
- Roger!
- Roger!
- Roger!
What a horrible look you've got on your face.
Are you worried?
Or maybe torn?
"What happened to the ""saint"" I knew?"
I'm disappointed.
You're full of internal conflict now.
I didn't get your name.
Shawna.
Hi.
- And you are...?
- Therapist.
From Cardiology.
Really?
Your husband has to undergo an angioplasty.
"That's where we're going to insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, and we're gonna use it to inflate a balloon that will open the blockage."
"Well, good luck, Mr. Rappaport."
I have to get back to my other patients.
It was nice to meet you.
Excuse me for just one second.
Whoa.
That was close.
Thanks.
I-I really owe you one.
"Hey, listen, if you ever need a sex therapist..."
I think I'm good.
"Now that you mention it, do you ever do any pro bono work?"
"Yes, I spoke to your resident, and he thought a hold was unnecessary, but I disagree, and all I'm asking is for a second assessment from another attending."
Watch it!
"No, Dr. Wakita, not you."
"Hey, Jerry, where have you been?"
I was getting worried about you.
Everyone was acting as if I'd sent you out in a hurricane.
Are you okay?
What the hell happened to King Funshine?
Did you get hit by lightning again?
He didn't get hit by lightning.
Here's your change.
Okay.
"- He already has, and he will gladly continue."
Get out of my house.
My house too.
No.
It was never your house.
You just lived here.
"You know, I'd like to hope that in a few months' time, we'll both have some perspective on this and be able to move somewhere, like forward."
This feels irreparable.
You accusing me of indifference?
You don't seem to be struggling.
I am.
Just not in the ways that you notice.
You need a haircut.
I know.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I'm pretty sure I'm missing a brush.
I'll bet one of those models yoinked it.
You got any plans tonight?
"Just gonna stay in, or are you going out?"
We were together for almost three years.
Do you want to come over?
We were just gonna make dinner at home.
You should come.
"No, thanks."
I don't want to be a burden.
You're not being a burden.
I couldn't tell him anything without him getting depressed and jealous.
Now he's gone.
He owes me a lot of money.
"You know, when he was writing and had no income."
Thousands of dollars.
I don't mean to bring you into it.
And why do we care if he's a deserter?
We've already talked about this.
- Hi guys.
"- Welcome, bro."
Don't call me bro.
We are now considered to be on the same team.
I'll go and think over this 5 strangers on the team business.
Enjoy your work!
What work?
"- Good morning, Uncle Metin."
- Good morning.
Can I borrow your lighter?
Perfect timing.
"Hey, we won't bring the subject up right away."
Okay?
We aren't going to mention anything about cheating or stealing.
I know the guy.
He'll start acting like a brother and will start lecturing us.
"First, we're going to go through the method of giving him a hard time."
Great.
We'll give him such a hard time that he will understand what...
- we have been through.
- Wait a minute.
Where are we going?
The road that leads to success.
Really?
"So, is this the road to success?"
We're the only ones walking this road.
Doesn't anyone know about it?
Exactly.
"See, these are your rivals."
Go and get your application form right away.
- How'd you know I'd be at this one?
- Istanbul wasn't that long ago.
"You like rooftops over windows... you like angles with the target on your right-hand side, 'cause you're left-handed."
That's right.
I knew I liked you.
Put it on.
"Michael... is this what you really want, huh?"
Helping out civilians with their little problems... trying to get your government job back?
It's pathetic.
You're better than that.
Let's go.
We have a big day ahead of us.
I gotta turn you in.
There'll be questions.
It'll be past lunch before we're done.
Turn me in?
"Sure feels good not to be the gayest guy in the room, for once."
"No, you're still the gayest."
Louis!
Go kiss Eugene!
So funny I forgot to laugh.
Meanwhile... our plan is down the poopster.
- Not necessarily.
"- What are you thinking, Gourishankar?"
"You said Ralph's boss had a guy fired for being a homosex, right?"
We send these photos to Ralph's boss.
He get Ralph fired for being a homosex.
That create an opening with Mick Jagger.
"They fill that opening with their only floater,"
Mr. Rockefeller Butt.
"But wait a second, we can't just out this guy."
Why can't we out a homosex?
I don't know what you're doing.
"Whatever it is, I don't want to talk about it."
"For a little magazine, we have very good sources."
You want to know why?
I am relentless and driven.
I make it easier for them to tell than to resist me.
I know about the grand jury.
I know about Rick's indictment.
lndictment?
He hasn't even appeared.
- That's just what I hear.
- From who?
And you're going to print this?
I thought I should let you know.
"You're going to print an article that says Rick is going to be indicted when you haven't interviewed him, and you are not naming any sources?"
I can't.
The testimony's sealed.
You are not going to print this.
Because it's a lie.
- You know it's a lie?
- lt's a lie.
- How?
- How do you think?
He told me.
"He has done nothing wrong, and I will not be party to anything that might hurt him, not to mention protecting you in a libel suit."
Whoa.
Lily.
Ferocious in defense of her man.
I'm serious.
- And what if you're wrong about him?
- l'm not.
I'm just not.
This is new territory for me.
"No, it's new for me too."
"I, uh..."
Maybe this trip and the juggling everything...
"Too much, too fast."
I think you're right.
Maybe we should go home tomorrow.
"Yeah, I think-- I think that'd be best."
♪
"So I'm the best man, standing in front of... 300 people?"
Mmhmm.
"And I hear ""beep, beep, beep."""
So I silence my pager.
It was a pager.
"90 seconds later,"
"""beep, beep, beep, beep."""
You got to be panicking at this point.
Think about how the guests feel.
Everyone assumes it's an international emergency.
"I know I have to take it, but it's in the middle of the ceremony, so I go back down the aisle, past the 300 people, and out the door."
Everyone must think China's invaded Russia.
Everybody's thinking China's invaded America.
"So Arthur's outside making the call, and the priest-- and I swear to God this is true--"
Starts leading the church in a prayer for our nation's safety.
So what was the page?
Low battery.
You two are like a comedy team.
"Yeah, we're thinking about taking our show on the road."
"Well, from what I hear, you'll get to do that sooner rather than later."
"Come on, we both know you invited us here to talk about the ambassadorship."
- Guilty.
- No.
Don't rush.
Do I want to know what you had to promise him
To get him to come?
"No, it wasn't me."
"It's not like he even listens to me,"
And he probably just ran out of girls to have sex with.
"I, uh, want to apologize."
My absence has been inexcusable.
"Well, I know my situation brings up a lot of issues for you."
You've had to deal with so much loss.
But I'm not gonna lose you.
"I'm here for you,"
Every step of the way.
"You, uh, you look good, Lily."
"In fact, you look better than good."
You look great.
Thank you.
I feel great.
So you had better be prepared
"For a lifetime of family brunches,"
Because I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey.
I bailed on the Columbia gala.
I was kind of in the mood
For watching a pretentious movie I don't understand
With you and Vanessa.
"No Vanessa, but pretentious movie?"
check.
"Look, not that I'm not thrilled to expose you"
"To the joys of Russian cinema, but does this visit of yours"
"No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
"- Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
- Really?
Then what is this?
"- Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
"- All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"- Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."
- Terry feels like a whore.
"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
"Great, Hitchcock's in."
Who else?
- I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"- Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"- What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"- Yeah, about that."
"Um, there were no tickets left."
"But I brought my minivan, so..."
- Road trip!
- I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
"Needles, needles, need-- whoa!"
You don't know?
He doesn't know.
Well!
"But surely,"
This is very important evidence.
"I mean, mrs."
Enright could have ripped it from the sleeve
"Of her perpetrator, right?"
"All right, tell me, where is it?"
Where is this bloody cuff link that you photographed so ably
At the crime scene?
We've been unable to locate it.
It disappeared...
"Just poof, hmm?"
"I mean, evidence that could prove"
That someone other than my client
Murdered victoria enright.
Yes.
So you wouldn't mind if they searched your house
"For that cuff link, would you?"
You're not gonna find it there.
Why?
Did you hide it somewhere else?
That's not what I meant.
No.
What you meant...
"Was to be judge and jury,"
Hiding evidence that would vindicate my client.
And you know what?
You very nearly succeeded.
Thank you.
So...
And then--
"- So wait a minute, wait."
The Homicide gang were chasing them.
"- Thank Christ, at least from our point of view."
"So these ill-fated Jolly Stompers run past us and we're standing there frozen, can't move, and this running mob runs around us like a herd of buffalo and we're just standing there and then ten seconds, just standing around us yelling."
"Homicides, Homicides, and running after these poor souls, who are probably dead by now, by the way."
And--
"And ten seconds later, they're gone."
"Just me and my daughter, standing there, my 13-year-old daughter and me, and we still have nothing to talk about."
(women laughing)
"- Hey, Pete."
Give me another one?
- Cash first.
- What?
"- Horace, come on."
What is this shit?
- Hey.
You ain't paid for the last three I poured you.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Cash first.
- So Iâm broke.
I've got...
I've got a quarter.
You know what?
What if I could make a one dollar bill that you gave me change into a twenty.
"- Ooh, I wanna see it."
- I wanna go dancing.
- Then you'll give me a free drink?
- What are you talking about?
- If I can make your one into a twenty.
Can I-
- Can I borrow this?
You folks need any help?
We're fine.
Just a little trouble with a tire.
"For your own safety, you shouldn't be on the shoulder any longer than necessary."
"We're leaving now, officer Thank you."
We're clear.
It started.
Briefing's started.
We're not going out today.
We don't have to go to briefing.
"I know, but nervous is nervous, and when he doesn't see me..."
- ... he starts to think I'm in trouble.
- That's just his overactive imagination.
I have a feeling he's gonna see you soon enough.
So the records of gasoline consumption and mileage have not been accurate.
Therefore the logs are gonna have to be adjusted.
The following officers will report to the clerk immediately following briefing.
Patterson.
Wilson.
Sylvia.
"Johnson, T.J."
Poncherello!
Get away from the door.
I said get away.
Excuse me.
"Sorry, sarge, I couldn't hear you."
"We couldn't hear him, right?"
"- No, actually, we're looking at these..."
- Baker.
That's aiding and abetting.
I don't want to see that face.
"Come on, we're not even on duty."
The enemy is cloaked and is fast!
"It seems to be using arrows, which is probably to..."
"Right, muzzle flashes would make it easy to pinpoint its location."
This must be to avoid that.
Optical camouflage?
Does invisibility technology even...?
It must be based on...
"Anyway, it's ingenious."
"There's nothing on my thermograph, and it's not casting a shadow."
But...
It definitely exists.
Yeah.
"You are giving this to me, Milord?"
Customize it however you like.
I've already discussed the matters of your peerage title and activation factor with Princess Lemrina.
Milord Slaine...
The arrow has been loosed.
There is no turning back now.
"Yes, Milord!"
Count Sebring.
Count Raffia.
Inform Count Orga.
Tell him to swear fealty.
"Smoke grenades, loading complete."
"Ready here, too."
Fire!
"He's right, it definitely exists."
And if it exists... it will have an effect on air currents!
Target located.
Right!
Open fire!
- Lieutenant!
"Whatever we do, we gotta do it fast."
"I gotta get back, gotta find my wife, you know?"
What do you got?
You see her?
That's my wife.
Jennifer?
Shane?
"God, Shane, there you are!"
I've been looking all over for you.
"Jennifer, what are you doing here?"
"Look, I heard at the salon that you were coming to this crazy singles' island, so I just felt a strong sense of urgency that you and I needed to talk before it was too late."
"Jennifer, you left me, remember?"
"I know, I know."
But then I was hoping that you would come after me.
It wasn't like you walked out of a bar!
It was a divorce.
And why are you even at this place?
Do you know this place is insane?
I'm getting called names.
"I've been called a cougar, a black panther, a puma!"
I had to smack this one kid.
That's the last time he'll walk up to a woman talking about cougar!
Yeah.
I've been looking all over the place for you.
And where have you been?
"Well, actually, I'm staying on the other side, the couples' side, with my girlfriend."
What?
Who?
Her name is Trudy and she's aspiring to be a manager.
Put it in my mouth!
"Go, go, go!"
Trudy?
That apartment of yours looks like it belongs in a homeless file.
"Then it's off to Crate and Barrel for a knife a fork, a spoon and a glass while you're at it."
Then I'll need a dishwasher.
Just throw them out after you finish eating.
It's on me.
Get a life.
I've got yours.
It's quite enough.
You read this?
Today's Times editorial?
"""Judge or be Judged""?"
"""Notwithstanding Judge Stern's distinguished record one must ask, 'Would he be on the bench if he were not a former law partner of the mayor's?"
"'"""
I didn't appoint him.
"He was nominated, like everybody else."
Everybody knows the party arranges nomination of judges.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on yours and I always will be.
But I smell a hanging party.
We should put distance between ourselves and Walter Stern.
- Distance is shit.
Distance!
Distance is something you do to your enemies.
It's the thing of the '90s to make friends extinct.
Distance is the absence of Menschkeit.
Translate that for me.
You don't know what Menschkeit means?
I don't.
Menschkeit.
"You know, something between men."
"It's about honor, character..."
Untranslatable.
- A first date like a game show.
- I didn't mean to lecture.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call it a date."
It's just rare that I meet a person I can discuss these things with.
- Some pepper?
"- No, not for me."
Could you bring me a side dish of extra dressing please?
"I don't particularly like salad, I just like the dressing."
Ah.
"This twin-prime conjecture, it's interesting."
Are there still pairs like that past a million?
I can't believe you thought of that.
That is what is to be proven.
I have concert tickets next Saturday.
I was wondering if we can do this again.
- Sure.
- Great.
Terrific.
What was it you wanted to discuss about my teaching?
I have a confession to make.
That was just an excuse to meet you.
I hope you don't mind.
Mind?
I found it interesting.
"I have many questions, the first of which is, how do you get them to stay?"
Well?
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?
Don't ask.
- You won't be seeing him again?
- We're going out next week.
"So, he must like you."
You don't have to be on such a death-defying mission.
Not anymore...
What?
I don't want to see it happen anymore.
Don't want to see it anymore?
That's right...
Like your older brother.
"Don't look so worried, Kuya."
But...
Your brother is about to venture out into unknown technological territory.
I can understand your concern.
But a tremendous amount of money and the best brains in the world are behind this experiment.
That's right.
"Don't worry, Kuya."
"Elbow No. 1, EM level, clear."
"No. 2 and 3, clear."
No. 4 clear.
"Gravitator, active."
Unlock quadro-main capillary.
Insert reactor.
Confirm reactor load.
Result code normal.
Confirm all circuit connection.
"Dangaioh, ready to start."
Let's start the operation experiment.
Start operation experiment.
Move to start position.
Release anchor.
Release elbow lock.
There's abnormal pressure in the main converter!
Can you bypass it?
I'm trying.
Very well done.
- No.
No.
Isabel!
- Roderick?
"- Please, no!"
- Roderick.
"Roderick, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
- After all the girls I brought through this place you owe me.
I want the Porter girl.
- One would wonder if you had her admitted to have your way with her.
- I've always loved that girl.
- Let's say we revisit the topic of Isabel Porter's future after tomorrow night's event.
- Hmm.
Fine.
How's the exposure?
Should be fine.
- I want her to hear it from you.
I fear she has too strong of a connection to my voice.
- I'm a surgeon.
- It's not a request.
- Fine.
You are Mary Bradbury.
You are awaiting trial for witchcraft and immorality of the highest order.
"Mary Bradbury, you are accused of crimes most heinous."
Admit that you are wrong and repent or you will be condemned to murder by hanging.
"But of course what interests me, my dear, is how an evolution in identity can manifest itself in the amygdala."
"But then again, a tree is still a tree, is it not?"
"- Mm, Gunther."
"- You need to eat, Mary."
- Please... help me.
But any more griping from ya and I'll put you out of your misery.
Understood?
"Oh, fresh water."
We should be heading farther inland.
"And if I wanted your opinion, captain taylor, I'd have asked for it."
"I'll have you hanged for this, moore."
Not if I put a hole through your skull first you won'T.
"Jacob, he's a valuable hostage."
Do you seriously propose to throw away an asset like the captain?
Take him back to the beach!
You're asking me?
If you're so pleased.
This way.
Mutineers.
"Friday, that's an english ship."
That means escape.
But it commandeered by mutineers.
What if the captain and his crew were reinstated?
"That is a very big ""if"" under these circumstances."
The crew is circled.
The captain is wounded and the mutineers are at least 25 strong.
What are those?
Where?
There.
Womenfolk.
Must be the captain's wife and daughter.
Your womenfolk are shaped like bells.
No wonder you went to sea.
Then we have to know that the captain would be on our side before we try anything.
Come on!
No stopping!
Push it!
could you describe your relationship?
"well, we,re very close."
"THEY,RE CLOSE."
"We,re different, but complementary."
Describe CIaudine.
"She,s sweet."
"She,s strong-wiIIed, knows her own mind, meticulous."
- How do you show that?
- For exampIe -
Hands up.
"At first, Jean-MicheI expected me to serve him."
It was always me who brought up breakfast.
"He,d never think to bring me breakfast."
- You lived in a house?
- A house?
"You said ,brought up breakfast.,"
"It,s just an expression."
We live in an apartment.
- I see.
- Very good.
What about politics?
What role does it play in your life?
politics?
"We,re neither left- nor right-wing."
NEITHER LEFT
- NOR RIGHT-WING
"We,re not activists, but we keep up with the news."
"Jean-MicheI and CIaudine, you know why you,re here."
"We,re designing an experimental Urban Center, and we want its inhabitants to feel comfortable."
"You,ve been chosen as typical users of the year 2000."
"We want to Iearn about your desires, your fears."
We want to measure your basic level of social integration.
That's what I meant.
it's crazy but I like it.
Bull.
I know you're a little upset about this poem thing. but--
"He said I could make $10,000 a night."
Ten thousand dollars?
Ten thousand American dollars?
"Well, Bull, you're not serious about this?"
"You know, you people always assume you know what's best for me."
"Well, I'll tell you something, you don't."
Maybe it's time to shake up my life.
"Bull, you don't just become a wrestler overnight."
It takes a lot of time and training.
"If you decide to take up wrestling, you're gonna have to quit your job here."
"Now, I want you to take some time and really think about this."
okay-
I quit.
Oh.
He's not serious.
"Well, I mean, he'll cool down and then he'll change his mind."
I hope he's wearing boxer shorts.
[WOMAN SCREAMSI
Briefs.
This is ridiculous.
Bail reports don't just vanish into thin air.
Bull has been gone a week and this place has already turned upside down.
"Yeah, and it doesn't just stop with the paperwork."
It's open season on us in the courtroom.
"Well, word's out on the street Bull's gone."
Somebody's gotta keep order around here.
"Well, that's Dirk's job."
Hi. everybody.
"# And, oh, I need to show"
# That I am more than just my name

"In the time I have known you,"
I have always sensed you wanted to be a good man.
Do you want what happened to Thomas to ever happen again?
Of course not.
"Then go to Inspector Mallory, confess your crime and expose your superiors and the corrupt system that protected you."
"Father, I'm not sure that I'm brave enough."
I think you are.
God has given you the chance to salvage some greater good from your acts.
I strongly suggest that you do the right thing.
"Afternoon, sir."
Is the Inspector in?
"He is, sir, yes."
Go straight through.
Thank you.
"Oh, Sergeant, there's a man outside, he's behaving rather strangely."
I think he must be drunk.
Is there?
Right.
Thanks.
I've got nothing more to say.
Mrs Lightman?
Who are you?
I'm Max.
I am so very sorry... ..for what I did to Vera and to your son.
How did you get in here?
I want to confess to the murder of Vera Blanchett... ..and to my role in a barbaric police cover-up.
You what?
I should have known it was too good to be true.
"Come now, Mrs McCarthy."
Not every man who invites you out to lunch will turn out to be a murderer.
And I didn't even get to taste the Dover sole.
There must be some way to stop him.
Things are out of control now.
I'm running out of options.
Wait.
Mace...
You can't be serious.
"- I mean, what would the Illuminati say?"
- If I wasted the gargoyle?
"Lt'll be a black mark, no question of that."
I'll be severely reprimanded.
"But if I allow Goliath to become the first prisoner who ever escaped Hotel Cabal, the flushing sound you hear will be me and my 75-year pension going down the drain."
Notice the one-way mirror.
(thud)
- I can't miss.
"It's checkout time, gargoyle."
"- I don't think so, Mace."
Bluestone!
Whoa.
- Going up?
"- As a matter of fact, I am."
Hold on!
"You played me for a fool, Bluestone!"
You and the gargoyle were in this together!
"What can I say, Mace?"
"(laughs) When you're right, you're right."
"I'll see that you get yours, Bluestone."
Nobody double-crosses Mace Malone!
Nobody!
Poor Mace.
Wonder how long it'll take him to realize he dropped his key.
"(Matt) OK, I admit it."
"To save Goliath's life I had to forfeit my chance to get in good with the Illuminati, bust their organization wide open."
Our torturers are very unhappy people.
They don't know what they are doing and are subjecting themselves to eternal suffering.
I'm living here and now and not elsewhere!
And God for me...
I beg your pardon.
If you don't believe in God what do you believe in?
I believe that there is God.
But he doesn't give a damn for me and my troubles!
Stop shouting!
I can't sleep.
It's time to go to sleep.
You had a rough day today.
"Solomon, your decisions frighten me."
The petitioner is right.
You're not building a road to God.
You're building a wall of fear.
Hundreds of people bow to me.
Fear is the only thing that makes them succumb to me and create something.
Piss faster!
Why are you jumping around like a drunken kangaroo?
He shoved me.
Who?
He... there he is sitting.
In black.
He is staring at me all the time.
Calm down.Tell me who is staring at you?
The man in black sitting on a toilet.
He is holding a piece of paper in his hand.
Close your eyes and touch your nose first with your right and then with your left hand.
Are you making an idiot out of me?
You do have problems.
Has it ever happened to you before?
"Fine, but just for the record, you cannot be more wrong."
Spies are supposed to be better liers.
Enjoy your walk.
Come by the house this afternoon.
I'll show you around.
I guess I could check it out.
"Normal fellows, right?"
"From the beginning, you were stuck at OC because of your dad."
- Now you're not stuck with those guys.
- They're were not all bad.
A cappucino for Evan.
- How's it going?
- Good...
Just drinking coffee.
We're gonna have a special meeting this week on you coming back.
Just hang it tight.
You guys are losing a great pledge.
I don't think we're losing anybody.
You have a history of letting great people get away from you.
You know what?
I've tried to be nice to you by not kicking your ass.
"Last semester, I've put up with the digs, with the insults out of respect for Casey."
She and I are not together anymore.
You do the maths.
- He's just sticking up versus...
- I can do maths.
I'm good at it.
"I hear a lot of buzzing, but no actual words."
That's what insects do.
"They buzz around, try to sting you."
"Be careful, insect!"
Some insects are quite deadly.
-No need for gunplay here.
-l wouldn't be so sure.
YATES:
"This ain't your fight, mister."
-Who the hell are you?
-Name's Yates.
I'm a U.S. federal marshal.
Vin Tanner...
... you'reunderarrestfor murder in the sovereign state of Texas.
We've come to take you back.
Let's go.
"Marshal Yates, all I'm saying is that a man's actions should speak for him."
Couldn't agree more.
But I got papers say...
... thisfellowTanner'sactionsin Tascosa were that of a murderer.
Just because some papers say it doesn't make it true.
A lot of people will attest that Vin Tanner...
... hasriskedhislifemany times to protect this town.
"Mrs. Travis, I'm not the judge and I'm not the jury."
I'm not ever after that bounty on Tanner's head.
I'm just a lawman sworn to bring him to trial for the killing of Jess Kincaid.
"Good afternoon, ma'am."
"Marshal, you ever heard of a man by the name of Eli Joe?"
Should I?
He's wanted in Texas for the slaughter of two families.
"Well, what's that got to do with me?"
Tanner claims this Eli Joe set him up.
You know that for a fact?
Then what you have to say don't count for much.
MARY:
I'll wire the judge.
"You can do that, ma'am, but a territory judge..."
I'm yourJagadish
I'm yours!
Jagadish
I got something to tell you
I have sold my engine design for 2 million dollars
Don't you want to know why I sold it?
For my sake?
I mean... for our sake for the sake of our future
Yes Nitu.
But the future for us lies in India
In India...?
Our house is being auctioned
I'm going back to India
Will you come with me?
"Jai, take care of yourself"
"Nitu, you never wanted to marry... someone who was weak, a man without a backbone"
"All along I knew, you were hinting at me"
But what are you doing now?
Jai is a man of substance
You'd like him to become like me?
"Feeble, spineless...?"
"Look, someone who doesn't value relationships remains a loner"
You want to be lonely all your life?
- Lonely...?
Our next big act is Marcus Brewer singing Roberta Flack's beloved Killing Me Softly.
He'll be accompanied by Simon Cosgrove on the recorder.
"Marcus, I can't do this."
- That lot's going to shit all over us.
- But you said...
I'm sorry.
Here's your £5 back.
Any moment now.
- Can't you just do what I say?
"- Of course, dear Anna."
Don't I always do what you want?
"Well, just get going..."
"Morning, Mrs Ziemann."
Is everything fine?
"Selma, you shouldn't place the child here in the fumes."
It's so unhealthy.
"Outside it's too cold, in the stairwell too draughty, and here it's too fumy!"
Where shall I take the little mite?
"Well, maybe you can make yourself useful at least!"
"Come, help Mrs Ziemann with the basket."
I need to lie down for a bit.
"Are you not feeling well, Mrs John?"
"Oh, Mr Hassenreuter, it's the usual, you know..."
The child is coughing!
It comes from smoking.
"Mother smokes all day and because the child coughs, she cannot sleep."
and I'm fed up with it all.
That's tragic!
It makes one ask oneself who the real mother is.
"Well put, Mr Hassenreuter, and so true!"
Sometimes it seems to me as if I gave birth to it myself.
"Are you looking for me, Anna?"
"Man, did you give me a fright, Bruno!"
Where have you been?
Upstairs.
What are you doing here?
As if I didn't suspect that we'd need rat poison again.
I've just brought some from the drugstore.
You lay it out tomorrow so we'll get rid of that plague.
"Using the Lisol, you mop up here."
"Ooh, but there is a ""Whittle Your Own Banjo"" workshop at 5:00."
I have whittle-to-no interest in that.
"Ooh, it says they have the loosest slots around."
I guess the Darby sisters from my hometown are here.
I did see a bunch of lounge chairs over by the swamp exhibit.
"I guess we could sleep there tonight, and then the next night, well, hopefully we'll be dead."
"Come on, red!"
"Max, no!"
That's all of our money!
No more bets.
"Oh, that is so stupid, and not cute stupid like when you thought Velcro grew in nature."
And red is the winner.
"Well, rootin' tootin'!"
"I always bet on red because my last name's Black, and that's ah-not been a winner."
"Okay, now that we've doubled our money,"
- maybe we should stop.
"- Come on, red!"
- No more bets.
- No!
I didn't even get to touch it before you lost it.
Why do you hate having things?
Red again.
Just call me Al Roker 'cause I'm making it rain.
"Max, we're winning at something."
"Don't just stand there looking pretty, toots."
Order daddy some wings.
"Oh, my God, I look pretty and I get to flag down a waitress."
Waitress!
I'll have a sarsaparilla and some wings for big daddy.
Sophie's calling.
"Pfft, like I'm gonna get it."
"Well, Caroline's not answering."
"Hey, I need your help."
We need to go over to the medical center.
Is everyone in there?
Yeah.
We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered and outgunned.
"If we split our force, and try to defend each one of these farms, he's going to overwhelm us."
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
"We choose a place to stand together, deliver a good, hard counterpunch."
"Let them know that, if they intend to take from us, it's going to cost them dearly."
How?
"Well, right here."
Stanley Richmond's farm.
"It's the last place before this road divides, and they start taking ground faster than we can keep up."
Plus which it's the highest point in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
The Talbot farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

"Grandpa, you're drunk."
Why?
Did something happen with SBK?
Nope.
Something happened with Chivonne.
There's a banger.
Lucien.
"He a player, runs some corners."
He got it in his head that Chivonne is gonna be his girlfriend.
And he don't care what she got to say about it.
What do you mean?
Happens sometimes.
"Youngblood sees something he likes, decides it's his."
Doesn't matter that she don't like him.
It don't matter that she just 14.
"One way or another, he gonna get what he wants."
"Now, this boy, Lucien, he keep coming at her, got his boys following her, just making her life hell."
Did she talk to the police?
You mean did she snitch?
No.
"She worried that it's gonna come back on her and her aunt, and it would."
That's why she came to me.
What did she ask you to do?
I wouldn't let her say the words but I know what she need me to do.
And truth is...
I want to do it.
That's my baby girl.
"Anybody mess with her, they deserve what they get."
"Crazy, huh?"
"Everything I've been doing, working with you, working with the police, it was so, eventually,"
I can be a father to her.
Turns out what she really need is a gangster.
I don't blame you for wanting to protect your daughter.
"No, I only stopped by to--"
We were discussing something quite different.
"All right, never mind."
"Oh, put them right over there."
Has anyone else been here this evening?
Anyone called?
Just Enos Watterton.
He wanted to make sure you got away all right.
- I didn't know then you'd missed the train.
- Enos Watterton?
- Oh.
- Sandy-
"- Sandy, if you won't tell me, will you please tell Perry what's been upsetting you so lately?"
"I mean, that's part of the reason I wanted to talk to him."
"Oh, for heaven's sakes, Beth, I don't care what you do."
- Sandy!
"- Driver, wait."
"Taxi, taxi!"
[jazz playing]
"Sellers, Sellers."
[phone ringing]
Yes?
Who?
"Oh, Sandy--"
Ha!
"Well, I guess we all miss a train once in a while."
"I'll catch the first plane in the morning, sir."
The only reason I bothered you was to double check to make sure that I have all the papers they'll need in Phoenix.
What?
"I mean in the briefcase, sir."
I had the impression that you put everything in there yourself and--
"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't actually."
There you--go.
[Spits out drink]
Warm.
You can't do anything right.
- Help me up.
- Where are you gonna go?
"- Shut up, nurse!"
- And don't bump it.
Fat bitch.
Why do you put up with that guy?
I've had it.
"Arthur was famous for two things, bad wigs and carrying a gun."
You've owed me money for 30 years!
Musicians!
Ah!
They're the scum of the earth.
"He raised his palsied hand, and took aim."
"Every one of you, you'll all die!"
Arthur!
"Put the gun down, Arthur!"
I'm the genius.
I made you!
[Screaming]
"By him shooting down at his own bottle, he hit the weakest part of the bottle, which is where the valve is connected, 'cause there's a hole in the bottle."
"That would've forced the valve up, the bottle would've opened up like a--a flower, instantly, blown all the oxygen out of it."
"It would have been a catastrophic, uh, explosion, and he was as close as you can get to it, so it would've taken him out."
Who are you?
Arthur screwed everyone he ever worked with.
I'm the genius!
I made you!
[Screaming]
"But in the end, he gave Jerry and the Atrics an ending to their song."
"No, it's fine."
"Saul, this is my daughter Rebecca."
- Saul and I work together at Ojai.
- Oh.
"Yeah, it's so nice to meet you, Rebecca."
Your mother never said that you were so lovely.
"I guess Mom doesn't talk about me much, because I doubt she'd use the word ""lovely""."
"Becca, that was a compliment."
Say thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Is there any cereal left?
"- Uh, yeah."
Try the top shelf.
"Well, I didn't realize it was getting to be so late."
"It's very nice to meet you, Rebecca."
- Bye.
- Bye.
We'll talk more at the office.
Sorry about interrupting the mid-morning booty call.
Maybe you should put a sock on the door.
Saul was just helping me with the coffee machine.
Is that what the senior set is calling it these days?
"Yes, we are seeing each other, if that's what you mean."
At least that embarrassing little run-in clarified some things.
"The sudden windfall, the winery, the Maserati, the expensive housewares."
No.
Saul has nothing to do with any of that.
- Right.
"- Rebecca, I told you the truth."
A close friend died and left me some money.
"This is a good thing, Becca."
These stories don't have a long shelf life.
"If we don't give him more ammunition, this Silk will move on to somebody else."
- Then...
- Then what?
Daylight again?
- Definitely.
- Good.
And I could totally take that guy.
"You just worry too much, Nora."
You always have.
I know Sarah and Joe are going through a rough time.
Are you sure that's all?
I really think Tommy's decision to buy this winery with Holly is bothering her more than she's letting on.
Tommy and Sarah have a very strong bond.
William never would've brought Sarah to Ojai Foods if he thought she and Tommy couldn't survive sibling rivalry.
You're right.
You're right.
"I mean, look at us."
- What do you mean?
"- Our family wasn't exactly a picnic, yet here we are, after all these years, still speaking to one another."
- You want a green bean?
- Thank you.
"- It's a small miracle, isn't it?"
"- Yes, it is."
I don't know.
I think maybe I was wrong about her.
- About who?
- Holly.
- What do you mean?
- You're seeing her.
Tommy is starting a company with her.
"As much as I hate to admit it, maybe William was a good judge of character."
"-Yes, I did some writing."
-Did you get any of it published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't by any chance publish those books with the... the plain wrappers, do you remember?"
"Yes, you do."
Remember?
"You were always afraid, and everything frightened you."
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
"-Really, you look great."
-Thanks.
Though you never said good-bye to me when you left Peyton Place.
-Never even said good-bye.
-I'll never forget that Labor Day.
-I won't either.
-I see you have 2 Purple Hearts.
-What brings you home?
Vacation?
-Haven't you heard about Selena?
"-No, what?"
"-She killed her stepfather, Lucas."
The trial starts in two days for murder.
"Lucas was always a bad Joe, but she always seemed to put up with him."
Who ever knows what anyone's able to put up with in this world?
"Well, that's true."
"It sure took me a lot enough time... to know a little about myself, understand Peyton Place."
-Cigarette?
-Thanks.
I'm going to go back and try to work things out with my mother.
Maybe we'll both be happier.
"If not, maybe at least I've made the effort."
You know?
I always wondered why you enlisted.
Some sort of serrano thing for Brooke?
- Why would I do that?
"- Well, I asked you first"
"Look, don't underestimate Brooke."
She's full of surprises.
Its just part of her charm.
She told me to listen to track 13.
There are only 12 songs.
Honest mistake.
"Yeah, I guess."
"Anyway, sorry about this morning with your dad."
I had no idea he was there.
It's cause he usually isn't.
I thought you were happy with your setup.
That's what I tell him.
"I make up stuff in the emails I send him about how happy I am being on my own, and how responsible I'm being even when I'm not."
"He loves his job, you know?"
"And after my mom died, it's just not fair to ask him to give that up."
But I miss him when he's away.
You tell him that?
He worries.
It's just better not to.
"So listen, I don't have a lot of quiet time these days."
You mind if I just sit and read while you draw?
As long as you don't act out the parts.
Alright.
My mom said you wanted to see me.
Yeah.
"Hand me that ratchet, would you?"
So how are you holding up?
Why?
Are you going to report it back to my mom?
Did you talk to the Queen?
- I can not talk to the Palace.
And the Prime Minister?
- Still unattainable.
Do you want to be reached?
We are ready.
"- Carlos, what does he do here?"
We will not go anywhere.
- Why?
There is an emergency meeting.
- What the hell is going on?
All flights were canceled due to cosmic interference.
"Excuse me, one that?"
"- A solar storm, exactly."
"The satellites are dead, some are precipitated."
"For security reasons, you have to stay here."
Here in Istanbul?
"- No, here at this hotel."
All foreign dignitaries will be concentrated here.
How long will we have to wait?
"- One day, one week."
You do not know.
"Do you remember the Icelandic volcano, Eyjajafufukukul?"
Eyjafjallajökull.
- Yup.
I have to go back to Belgium right away.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
This situation is a disadvantage for everyone.
I had to receive a promotion this week.
"If we can not fly, we'll be in the car."
"By car, through the Balkans?"
- Yup.
But you will not get 20 lakhs.
You will get 50 thousand or 1 lakh.
I will get it ready in 2 days time.
- You won't do it.
- Why?
"Though people can work hard, you provide rice for Rs. 2 per kg."
And make them lazy fellows.
You give houses for the poor.
You provide employment for the youth.
You provide free electricity and loans to farmers.
"During elections, you waive the loans."
You give everything to everyone.
Why don't you care about children?
What sin have they committed?
Is it because children are not eligible to vote?
How much can we get selling this house?
To the bankers?
This house is on loan.
How much do you have in your account?
Rs. 10 lakhs.
Give me a cheque.
For what?
"I said do it, father."
Rs. 10 lakhs...?
What made you think that I will give you the money?
"Since he married my daughter, I forgave him  made him my PA."
I challenged you that I will make you fall at my feet.
What made you think that I will forgive and give you the money?
Who won?
Me or him?
To make my heart wet...
Came this drizzle of smile...
"Once he's got him, she's got all of little Stempington."
- Does the whole town know about this?
- No.
But those who do are too frightened to talk.
I haven't told you about The Wicker Barn.
"God's sake, get down, Joyce."
Ah!
"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
I'm pissing blood all over Margaret's new rug.
- It's Scotchgard protected.
"- Better answer that, Joyce."
"You might want to move the Panda, Joyce."
We've decided to issue a little warning.
"You could help us take her down, Joyce."
- How?
- We've never had anyone on the inside.
Think about it.
That's all I ask.
- You should go now.
(Pam) Welcome to Little Stempington.
"(Hilary) Hello, Joyce."
- ..someone I'm dying for you to meet.
"Joyce, at last."
"Hold this and press that little red button, would you, Joyce?"
You're the only suspect in that nasty little business back at The Wicker Barn.
(Hilary) I wouldn't want to be separated from my husband if he had buns like that.
"(Camilla) You don't want Jeremy's first day in the job to involve sending you to the click-clink for the next ten years, do you...do you...do you?"
- They made me do it.
"- Too late for excuses, Joyce."
"darling, please."
I'm afraid...
I'm gonna have to take you straight upstairs for questioning.
And all for a water bill
"The Popular Front, what nonsense"
Professor... it's the last one
Naturally it hasn't been chilled
And your hiccup?
It's fine
"July 5, 1939..."
I danced with him
Feeling his warm breath on my skin drove me crazy
"I think he loves me, but we mustn't."
We must be strong
"I rather pity cousin Julien, poor fellow"
"If he knew a great love, it would transform him"
"My goodness, it's all so difficult"
A soul
Don't expect a letter.
We're not pen pals
Don't look at me like that
"I'll be' back, I don't intend going off to war"
"Write to me, your Aunt Agnes"
"Now, you be good"
Goodbye
I'll come to the station
Answer Julien
He can do what he likes - I can't stop him
Thank you
Why're you mad at me?
I'm your pal
"Maybe you think we're friends, but we're not"
Out of her head
What's this thing?
I wondered where I put it.
"No, no, in the crabbing area."
"It's just that you were fishing for bass, so..."
That probably explains why we didn't catch anything.
"You fish in the Apachaway a lot, so I thought that you would know that, but..."
I don't fish a lot.
"- I thought your equipment was pretty sophisticated, but..."
- There's a difference... between wanting to fish and having time to fish.
Tell me about it.
- And he freed the slaves and won the Civil War.
- That's right!
He was probably our greatest president.
- Even greater than George Washington?
- It's a running debate.
- Laine Hanson.
"- Oh, Mr. President."
And you must be one Timothy Hanson.
Timothy Muskie Hanson.
"Well, Timothy Muskie Hanson, how would you like a great big cookie?"
Any kind.
"- No, thank you."
- Any kind at all.
"Oatmeal, white chocolate..."
"Actually, we just had dinner, but thanks."
"In that case, shall we have our picture taken, young man?"
Hmm?
- How do I look?
- Your tie's a little crooked.
"Well, can't take a picture like that."
Will you straighten it for me?
Your mommy tells me you know more about the presidents than most grown-ups.
- I like to study them.
- Mmm!
"David, my wife Sally."
"David, hi."
Pleasure.
Pleased to meet you.
Shall we get you home?
(Door opens)
Just passing.
Mm-hm.
Am I correct in remembering you handled a drug case two years ago with a key witness who's a guy called Shrimpton?
Stanley Shrimpton?
You got a conviction on the basis of his testimony.
That's what you've come here to talk about?
"Yeah, I think I might be defending a genuinely innocent guy."
"I mean, an actually innocent guy."
Why did you go to bed with me if you didn't want me?
Hmm?
Was it just about landing me?
"Once I'm flapping about on the deck, I'm just a dead fish."
"What are you talking about landing you, Red?"
We'd already done it before.
"So you tell me, then."
Why did you want me?
"Because at that precise moment, there was no-one more beautiful on Earth and I had to have you."
"No, no, no, you're so full of shit!"
OK.
"Because I was drowning, and because you were a lifebuoy and you were in the same wet place."
Stanley Shrimpton.
A piece of vermin who got off child abuse charges by becoming a police informant.
"Now, go, will you?"
"Thanks, Red."
"OK, I'm sorry."
I was bored stupid.
Quick debrief to discuss the coincidence of four ice villains attacking on the same day.
We shouldn't be long.
COMPUTER:
"Recognized Batman, zero two."
"Aquaman, zero six."
"Flash, zero four."

That's it?
"You promised us a real look inside, not a glorified backstage pass."
It's a first step.
You've been granted access few others get.
"Oh, really ?"
Who cares which side of the glass we're on?
"Roy, you just need to be patient."
What I need is respect.
They're treating us like kids.
"Worse, like sidekicks."
We deserve better than this.
"You're kidding, right?"
You're playing their game?
Why?
Today was supposed to be the day.
Step one in becoming full -fledged members of the League.
"Well, sure."
But I thought step one was a tour of the H.Q.
Except the Hall isn't the League's real H. Q.
I bet they never told you.
It's a false front for tourists and a pit stop for catching Zeta Beam teleporter tubes to the real thing an orbiting satellite called the Watchtower.
"I know, I know."
He's doing what?
Get me satellite surveillance on a 50-mile grid around the exchange point.
Where's Scott?
I had to bring him back Khartoum along with that bloody journalist woman.
- He took a bullet to the spleen.
- (SIGHS)
SINCLAIR: (OVER COMMS) He's lost a lot of blood.
"They're prepping him for surgery, now."
"You've let Stonebridge go off on some suicide rescue mission, with the only lead..."
to Latif...
Please tell me
Crawford gave you the intel beforehand.
- Negative...
- Sinclair.
And I think I'm about to get arrested.
"Walk away now, you don't know me, go."
(YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(MUMBLES IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(YELLING CONTINUES)
"JACOUB: (CONTINUOUSLY) Wait, wait, wait..."
There are two wells near here.
The Janjaweed will be close to one.
The nearest is Bir an Natrun...that way.
"And we're trusting him as our guide, why exactly?"
It was Tahir's men who destroyed my village.
And my family.
"And, your friend, Scott, he promised me much money."
"And a new car if I help you, yes?"
You gotta love that mercenary spirit.
"So, what's your reason?"
"This isn't only about Latif, is it?"
Not for you.
Hopefully not too much to interpret.
Slept well?
For the first time since I've been here.
Good.
"Until yesterday,"
I was not permitted regular prayer.
We receive comfort from our prayers.
- We?
- Human beings.
I say something wrong?
You placed us on the same level.
- Aren't we?
"- Well, here..."
I am thought of as less than human.
"And in your Jihad, I am."
Gideon... what do you really want from me?
I already told you.
I want to understand you.
And if that is not possible?
Then that would be my loss.
It's almost time for your midday prayers.
May I return later?
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you.
Most of these tips are so new they haven't even been authenticated yet.
"Yeah, but there's nothing in the established information that's remotely helpful."
Wait a minute.
Anthrax.
- What?
- Genimmune.
A dutch biotech firm reported that they may have had a security breach
- involving anthrax last week.
A Japanese that is active overseas.
"Today, we're in the popular chocolate shop in Paris, L'atelier de Bonheur."
"Ah, it's Bonheur."
"Geez, I want to go to Paris."
I want to eat Bonheur chocolates.
"No matter where you get them, chocolates won't be much different, right?"
"What are you saying, onee-chan?"
It's totally different.
(T/N: onee-chan means older sister)
Bonheur is special.
"And in this place that's called the world's best chocolate shop, there is a Japanese employee."
Hee...
- It's been six years since he came alone to Paris.
"Built up his expertise, the young chocolatier Koyurugi Souta."
Making chocolates in Bonheur was my dream.
- No way.
"But next week, I will be returning to Japan, and opening my own shop."
"Chocolates that won't lose to the taste of Bonheur,"
I want to let the Japanese people enjoy them.
"Then, I'll be taking it."
- Yes.
"Wow, it's as pretty as a picture."
As expected of the prince of chocolate.
Not at all.
"Ever since I came back to Japan, there's been nothing but good things."
"Dad accepted the renovation of the shop without any complaints, thanks to Bonheur's reputation, for good or bad, right after I landed in japan,"
I even got the label of prince of chocolate.
Take care.
Ah...
Excuse me.
Souta-kun.
See.
Police have arrested a man and charged him with the murders of five women in London.
"Gerald Wiggins, a railway ticket inspector, was apprehended at his home yesterday"
Inspector Lawley of Scotland Yard said that Wiggins appears to be mentally frail
Police believe they have found evidence linking him to all five murdered women.
The petrol and fuel oil shortages at home maybe worsening...
"That's it, isn't it?"
He's gone.
"Lucy, I'm so sorry."
It's not your fault.
Did he take anyone from the train?
Not that we know of.
No -one's been reported missing.
- The police must have scared him off.
- That's something.
That's a lot.
- That's a life you saved.
"- I know, but he's still out there."
We still don't know who he is.
"I do know who he is, actually."
(Clears her throat) He's Malcolm Crowley.
- You got a name from Cavendish?
- Who's Cavendish?
He headed up a classified department during the war.
He trained Crowley.
Jean found him.
So we have a name and whatever else is in there.
Bloody hell.
- How's your friend?
- Recovering.
- What happened to her?
- Harry beat her.
It's not the first time.
-Indiana...
"Yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked."
"Yes, they are nice."
They're worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
"But the people I brought are important, and they're waiting."
What people?
Army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
They wouldn't tell me what they want.
"Well, what do I want to see them for?"
"What am I, in trouble?"
"Yes, Dr. Jones, we've heard a great deal about you."
Have you?
"Uh, professor of archaeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?"
Obtainer of rare antiquities.
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.
"-Oh, thank you."
-Thank you.
"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
"Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago."
"Yes, I did."
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
"Uh... well, just rumors, really."
"Somewhere in Asia, I think."
I haven't really spoken to him for ten years.
"We were friends, but, uh... had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid."
Mmm.
"Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?"
I understand.
"- Yo, Graff."
Why don't you come driving with us tonight?
That would be exciting.
If I were in a coma.
You'll be excited.
Later.
- l could have handled that.
- Yeah.
You're doing great.
"No, no. I'm asking a particular question. ls it fair?"
- What does fair have to do with it?
- Fair has to do with what?
Anybody?
Fair has to do with the right to come to school...
"and be able to do your work, and not be terrified."
Not have your heart beating fast.
Not jump every time there is a loud noise.
The right to come in and be left alone.
No?
Maybe not everybody is left alone anyway.
Meaning what?
"You don't know what goes on around here, okay?"
Maybe some people have guns to protect yourself.
"Maybe some people who have guns are like victims, too."
And they're like forced to carry.
You think kids with guns are like gangsters or dealers.
Your saying that if someone is threatened it's okay for them to carry...
a gun in school?
You don't think the school authorities can protect them?
"Man, you don't know what goes on around here."
Yes. lf l was--
"Say I was threatened, and I'm not saying that I am..."
REED:
"An Insectoid ship, sir."
You destroyed them?
REED:
They were opening a vortex.
They would have escaped.
The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
Sir?
We could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."
If you'd explained to them why we were here... you might have avoided a fire-fight.
"With all due respect, sir, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
ARCHER:
Archer to Major Hayes.
HAYES:
"Go ahead, Captain."
ARCHER:
"Report to my Ready Room, on the double."
HAYES:
"Aye, sir."
I'm relieving you as Tactical Officer.
ARCHER:
"From now on, you'll report to Major Hayes."
I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
-Captain!
-Dismissed.
"Yes, sir."
ARCHER:
Are you done with that translation?
Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.
Are you hurt?
"Oh, no."
"I tripped earlier on the-- on the cobblestones, and I-I must have cut it and--and not noticed."
"Well, I'm glad you're safe."
You must be Annie!
"Uh, I am."
I forgot to tell you we have dinner guests.
"These are my dear friends Blanca Gonzalez and her boyfriend, Hector Serrano."
It's lovely to finally meet you.
We've heard so much about you.
Yes.
So much.
♪
You found a real catch.
We just love Simon.
Really?
How often do you get to see him?
Every few weeks.
He's doing some business deal with Hector.
That must be frustrating-- always losing your boyfriend to a business meeting.
Tell me about it.
Hopefully I'll have him back to myself soon.
He tells me this deal is basically finished.
"Three mojitos-- the personal vice of your countryman and fellow Cubaphile, Ernest Hemingway."
I wonder what
Hemingway would think if he saw our country after 50 years of the embargo?
I bet he'd still be enchanted with its natural beauty and free-spirited people.
I know I am.
Mm.
We hear that sentiment a lot from tourists.
I find it incredibly condescending.
"Hector, please."
- Does Vicki know about this?
- No.
And I don't want her to know.
I've been targeted and that puts everyone who's close to me in danger.
"Oh, gee..."
Thanks for bringing me into this.
"Okay, if only one of you can work this town, how do I know I'm not going to like this other vampire more than you?"
"Because I'm the devil you know, detective."
"Yes, you are."
Okay.
Two conditions.
"One, we find this thing, we put it down."
I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What's the second?
- Full disclosure.
"I ask you something, you answer."
"I want to know what color your underwear is, you tell me."
You got it?
Red.
"Silk, actually."
"I'm not actually asking, Fitzroy."
When do we start?
As soon as somebody phones the police about a dead body.
Got a quarter?
I feel so bad for that Evan guy.
He blames himself for Gene's death.
Does he have reason to?
Typical Friday night.
Go train in from the burbs.
Burger and a movie after the Underground.
They must have up to something.
"Come on, you don't go out for a burger and wind up as the main course at an insect buffet."
What happened to the Poncherello School of Cool?
"Well, I'm always open for suggestions, Jon."
"Go up to her and say, ""Hey, my name is Frank and I'd like to get to know you. "" Take it from there, just be honest."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm gonna let her discover me.
I'll put these on and go outside and polish my bike.
"Chicks can't resist a nice, shiny bike."
And me in these shorts.
There she is.
I can't see her feet.
Got it.
Dalecki's Baby Food.
One of my officers?
Loose load cite?
"Not so far, but we'll check right into it."
"Yes, sir, we'll start an immediate search for the two boxes."
Right.
15-5 Mary L.A.
"11-82, southbound Harbor freeway at Exposition."
"15-7, Mary L.A."
"11-79, northbound Hollywood Freeway at Vermont."
Attention all units we are requesting all area agencies to assist in the search for two boxes of contaminated baby food.
"The boxes were lost on the Golden State, southbound, near Ninth."
The food is contaminated with botulism.
"Repeat, botulism."
I can't find the blue one.
Which goes best with these shorts?
Come on.
You're not going to a fashion show.
- You're going to meet a girl.
"- Yeah, maybe I don't need a shirt."
Just tell me what you need.
All right?
I'm easy.
I'm going to keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
"All right, listen to me very carefully."
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA!
All right?
Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
"If he does, you're dead!"
Why don't you just kill Badger?
"Follow me, guys, but if a mosquito's buzzing around you, it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney."
You go grab a flyswatter.
"I mean, so to speak."
"I mean, all due respect, do I have to spell this out for you?"
"We're not killing Badger, yo!"
Then you got real problems.
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
I mean.
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb here, but he's not gonna like prison."
He's gonna sing like Céline Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognize your cough.
Take that mask off.
Get some air.
Go on.
Take it easy!
"Breathe in, breathe out."
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
'Cause I got bad knees.
That's better.
Ok.
"You know when you just wake up, and you're sick, and you're just waiting to suck it down."
"Aw, man you could hawk one of those ten feet, easy."
"No, no, no... it's better to blow them out your nose."
"No, no, it's better to suck."
"Now, those are not the best loogies."
My cousin hawked a loogie from the top of the Empire State Building.
Hit a lady in the head.
Killed her.
He's in prison now.
In prison for snot.
"Boom, boom."
"Okay, you guys, come on."
We place here in the time capsule...
The sacred shoe box.
"Okay, in the sacred shoe box, the things we do not understand, to be opened again when all the mysteries of the universe have been revealed to us."
Who's first?
Kevin.
"I found it in my mom's secret drawer, in this plastic box."
I know what this is.
It goes in the bottom of the bathtub to stop the drain.
"No, it doesn't."
It's a diaphragm.
It prevents the passage of sperm into the uterus... in girls.
How do you know that?
I saw it on Nightline.
"I'm telling you, Frank, it goes in the bottom of the bathtub."
I think it's a travel drinking cup.
She'll never miss it.
"Wait, don't drink out of it until we know what it is."
Yeah.
Brad.
I found it in my sister's room.
"I mean, if it's too complicated for you, and your kids and your divorce and your..."
And not to mention your presidential bid.
We can honestly just pretend that last night never happened.
"I mean, no."
Not that it wasn't memorable...
"I mean, it was."
It was...
"You know, it was great."
But...
"But if you don't think this will definitely work, you're probably right."
"Well, there's just one problem."
I like you.
Oh!
Great!
You like me.
"So, what does that mean?"
We get to hold hands at Cindy Burke's Roller Rink party?
"No, I was thinking maybe dinner."
Maybe sushi.
"I don't rent out entire restaurants, unlike some people."
"Oh, no."
He...
"Actually, he owns it."
My point being...
"People are gonna see us, Kitty."
And I want you to know that I won't be caring.
Previously on Brothers and Sisters:
You're gonna buy my interest in Ojai Foods.
Holly and I are going to take the proceeds from the sale of the stock and buy Greendale Winery.
Sex will replace my drug addiction with...
After rehab you're sworn to celibacy?
Although...
"I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now...
Why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferassin root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock, now, would we?"
"No, father."
"Seriously,"
Have you seen anything like this before?
"No, I have not."
She is unlike any wraith I've ever encountered.
What if it's all an act?
"If she were a killer,"
Why would he protect her?
"Well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too."
"They live here together, Rodney."
"If she were like other wraith,"
He would be her first victim.
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Go ahead.
We just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's going to take him up to the cave.
I'm going to check in with the villagers.
What are you going to tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
"Mac became ""Dr. John."""
Seemed like a whole 'nother life...
Another person came in and started something new over here.
"He's a character, man."
- What's his deal?
- He's an original cat.
He's cooler than you.
And he's cooler than everybody you'll ever meet.
Did you create Dr. John to be a front man?
No.
"I was gonna make Ronnie Barron be ""Dr. John,"""
"and I was gonna call him ""Reverend Ether."""
"Frank Sinatra's manager or arranger, or whatever the hell he was, said, ""If Sonny and 'Cheryl' could sing, and if Bob Dylan could sing, you could sing, asshole."""
I think he hit a raw nerve with me and it hit home.
"He's amazing, you know?"
"It's like, everything that he plays is the best thing ever."
It's perfectly behind the beat.
Everything he knows about music is so pure and so... complete.
"It's like, nasty and dirty, but intelligent and, uh... you can hear a million years of music in everything he does."
It's that guy's bachelor party this week.
I fucking met that dude yesterday.
Right there.
That dude with the fucking headband and the sunglasses.
"- Oh, not him."
- No way!
Yep.
I told him we were playing here tonight.
And his dad!
He's with his dad!
What's up?
"Look, dude's in the headband."
He brought his dad on his bach' party.
Is she dangerous?
She's a Wraith!
"Although, I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Now remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferrison root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock now, would we?"
No father.
Seriously.
Have you ever seen anything like this before?
No I have not.

I just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's gonna take him up to the cave.
I'm gonna check in with the villagers.
What are you gonna tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
"Let's start by analysing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Yes, of course."
"Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor."
I'm fried.
"Honey, I think the fear was a lot worse than the actual attack, which I can totally appreciate, but the good news is you weren't hurt, so let's not ruin the evening over it."
I'm sorry?
"Honey, you weren't hurt."
Good night.
Dave!
Where you going?
Dave.
"Come on, okay, you got bit by the shark."
"You got bit, I believe you!"
"We're here all the time, so let's take that opportunity to go to bed."
"Honey, we'll go to the waterfall with you."
We'll grab our drinks and go.
Yeah.
We could all go together.
It'll be beautiful.
Hon?
"I was thinking that maybe we might go back to the room, huh?"
"Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh?"
Just shut the whole world out and sit Indian-style and really explore our feelings.
Daddy!
Wake up!
It's too deep!
"Yo, you having a nightmare."
You ain't even in the water.
It's night time.
"Look, you said we was gonna have fun, so let's get up, let's dance, let's do a shot, let's do something."
Anything.
"Baby, let's just go back to the room, all right?"
I don't want to go back to the room.
I don't want to go to sleep.
Please.
"Thank you, Sister."
"And you, Mother, for agreeing to see me."
"I'm sorry, but this is a personal matter."
"Don't worry, there are no secrets here."
"And, anyway, Sister Marie has taken a vow of silence, so there is nothing to worry about."
Please speak freely.
I may need your help soon.
"And I apologize if I'm being presumptuous, but... this is a place of God, and..."
Yes?
"If there were any other place my friends could turn, believe me..."
You need us to hide some people who may or may not be in trouble with the authorities?
I'm not sure that they will be free to come.
- A very small number of them.
- Men?
"Yes, but only for a short time."
I'm so sorry.
But I can't.
"Mother, please!"
They'll be recaptured in the woods or killed.
The Germans are very thorough.
Every inch will be searched.
These men will be found.
"When the sisters of the Abbey St. Germain were caught trying to hide refugees, only four Sisters were left alive that night."
Barely.
I'm so sorry.
I will pray for them.
"For you, in this fight."
But I cannot let anything happen to the Sisters in my care.
I understand.
Thank you.
You are very brave.
"Xiamu, since we were young until now, have I not been with you?"
"When you graduated, when you entered the university, also... when you get married, I'll be with you giving my blessings!"
"You will do the same to me, won't you?"
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you for the attendance!
Thanks a lot!
Good!
Continue!
"Qu Weiran, the love child is finally legitimated!"
Love child?
"People from Haide Industry said, his father had an older son with his wife."
"The older son likes to exploration, and got himself killed in a snow mountain two years ago."
So Qu Weiran was naturally promoted to be a project manager.
Qu is such a lucky guy!
"Yes, he is."
"However, the point is..."
"Qu Weiran with his Bentley, is less adorable than our Zhang Jingwu with his broken car!"
- My car is fine!
- Pervert!
It was just a kiss!
Why did you scold me?
Don't you take it personally too quickly?
- I was referring to Qu Weiran.
- Oh...
He is a pervert!
Did you know?
He messed with and occupied woman before.
"So the woman's boyfriend went to his house, beat him up and broke few ribs of him!"
- Good!
- Really!
Don't worry!
So now I'm gonna take care of it!
"No, you will not."
You will have your boys sweep every room in this place.
"And you will come with me, as planned."
Find him.
You don't talk to me like that in front of my men.
"- I don't, huh?"
"- No, you don't!"
Ten years I've known Bobby!
Twice the guy saved my life.
This doesn't go unanswered!
"Drop the tough-guy shit with me, junior."
"Now, I know your story, Emil."
I know what this country did to you.
We're in this together.
So be calm.
- I'm calm.
- Good.
- I'm still gonna kill him.
- I don't have a problem with that.
But I need the president alive.
Don't forget that.
You promised me the leader of the free world.
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
We'll get him back.
"But without him, what kind of time frame we looking at?"
"We have 15 minutes to load in, then maybe another 3O or so to crack the protocols without his code."
"After that, it's on you."
- What about securing the basement?
- I brought a party favour for that.
- Good.
- Do you know you've got a bit of something right...
"Well, you tell me when is the right time?"
"Sharon, don't forget you owe me."
"If you need me to remind you, why, I will."
"Thank you, Sharon."
You won't regret this.
ILLEGAL FIREARMS TRACED TO SMUGGLING NETWORK
Good morning.
Okay.
"Good morning, everyone."
Let's get started.
- Shouldn't we wait for Anna?
"I got my ass up out of bed on time, now I gotta wait?"
"Well, while we're waiting, I just wanna put this out there to everyone that if we keep an open mind, there's no reason why we can't go home today."
"Excuse me, before we actually start, can I make a quick announcement?"
It's a query.
I am missing a very nice pen.
A Montblanc.
Has anyone seen it?
Is that directed at me?
- No.
Have you seen it?
No.
"- Okay, if anyone does see it,"
I would very much like it back.
It was a gift from my wife on our anniversary.
"Aw, that's so sweet."
We're deliberating a murder case and you're talking about a pen.
"This pen happens to be worth more than you make in a month, so you can go fuck yourself."
"Yeah, I'll do that."
- Charles.
He's...
Anna.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
"I said to Axel, ""Go back into the apartment."""
"I said, ""Eat something."""
"But then the phone rang, and he answered, and then he asked me to go back into the shop and not to listen."
"But he only spoke for a very short time, and then he went out."
"Who was it on the phone, Lisa?"
"He didn't want to tell me, but I know."
I know it was her.
Miss Morrow?
How do you know?
Because she called early this morning.
Carl told me.
I made him tell.
Did your brother tell you what she said on the earlier call?
Yes.
For Axel to call her at a number.
"At, uh, at Mountain 33497."
"Sorry, but the lodge is full up."
No checkouts today.
We're looking for a woman.
She was driving an expensive convertible with a man asleep in the back.
They told us at Conley Corners she stopped there about 8 a.m. asking for a room.
We do mostly vacation business.
"The woman was around 40-- very striking, silver haired."
"Now, did she, uh, stop here?"
"I sent her down to Joe's Cabins, a few hundred yards down the road."
"I guess she found a vacancy there, all right."
What makes you think so?
I've seen her car shuttling back and forth to the junction once or twice.
"Matter of fact, she went in that direction not ten minutes ago."
Toward the stores.
You stole millions but I see you in a toddy shop.
Foreign liquor is boring.
Local toddy is too good.
You ruined all the money.
Moreover they were dollars not rupees.
What if I lose?
"Boss, you must live long."
You're the king who gave us party on losing.
When will you lose again?
Winners have the say.
We are losers and they are winners.
Winner boss...
When will you win?
"When you win, we will party."
You are right.
You're trying to cover up your defeat very well.
Cover up?
I don't know that.
Only now I knew there is lot of kick in losing.
Yes boss.
Every time I win and I've lost the kick in winning.
I lost for the first time in my life.
Now I know the kick in losing.
I'll pay the bill.
"When we lose, we should never worry."
You must celebrate it.
"When a man understand this, no loser will cry on losing."
Will party all the time.
Drinks all the time.
That includes you too.
Superb!
I mean your philosophy.
[Collective chatter]
[Sirens wailing]
Magnum .44.
I bet it was from the same gun the exterminator used.
Who the fuck are you?
"Agent Shaw, from the c.I.A."
So far you haven't been very cooperative.
And just why is the c.I.A. Interested in this case?
"We're interested because in these sensitive times, two months before elections, the exterminator has been stirring up a lot of resentment against incumbent politicians and the entire judicial system."
"This could easily be the work of the opposition party, or maybe even a foreign government."
"Dr., uh, Megan Stewart, please."
What do you think?
I think you have to take a shit.
It's coming out of your mouth instead of your asshole.
[Phone ringing]
Hello...
Dr. Stewart.
Hi.
"- Hi, there."
"- Hey, listen."
What time do you get off work tonight?
I'm on call all night.
Damn it.
There is another solution.
"The nurses call it, ""midnight admission."""
Midnight admission.
"It's, uh... it's an empty, private room."
Shame to let it go to waste.
Okay.
See you soon.
[Pa announcement] Coronary emergency.
"Dr. jenester, to emergency."
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
"Cos when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice, cosy cell and you won't be with me."
I'm still here.
"- What do you do for them, Calum?"
- You know...
Pretty much what I've always done.
"Multi-tasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
Doof!
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"# Oh, know how I love you"

"Morning, flatmate."
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you but that was the last of the bacon.
- As they always this noisy upstairs?
- Mm.
I like it.
There's some good stuff here.
"You know, a little kid that's staying over at the motel found this medallion."
"I thought it was yours, but I see you're wearing yours."
Where did you find that?
A little kid found it in the RV.
That's not mine.
I see that.
That's Stu's.
"Well, give it back to him."
"Oh, Stu's going to be happy about this."
Look at that.
Where do you think that came from?
- I don't know--
- See the work in that?
Think anybody does anything like that these days?
You know how much that's worth?
You know what gold is these days?
You know where it's going?
[chuckles] Nobody knows where it's going.
"I'll tell ya, people are gettin' the fever for it now."
Everybody's looking for it.
"Everybody wants it, everybody's after it."
"You know, you could help me, if you would, you and Stu."
Sure.
"I got to go back over to the gulley and look around, and you guys know that country better than anybody."
"I thought maybe if you'd ride over with me and help me look around, we might come up with something."
"- Well, you want to go look around?"
- Yeah.
"Sure, that's no problem."
- The kid's at the motel?
- Yeah.
What's his name?
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Yeah, well, it's-- it's a mess."
Would you like to grab some coffee?
That's a spectacularly bad idea.
You're right.
I grabbed the wrong file.
"I meant to grab the file of ""reasonably bad ideas,"""
"but I grabbed the ""spectacularly bad ones"" instead."
Been that kind of day.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Just one.
"This is dumb, hanging out here waiting for him."
"Well, do you really wanna go on a tour of a video arcade or a $2 movie theater?"
Or he could be hiking in Griffith Park for all we know.
"I know, I know."
We should've put one of those things that they put on dogs so you can track 'em.
Don't be snippy with me.
I'm not on your damn TV show.
"God, I hate this day."
"Well, I'm not exactly over the moon about it, either."
I know what Jonathan would do.
"He would call some friend in Washington, and there'd be some really fancy, expensive detective here with Justin in about four hours."
"Well, why don't you call him?"
"You know, you really can tell me the problem with him."
I swear I won't judge.
The problem... doesn't feel like you and Dad.
I guess they don't make 'em like that anymore.
Oh.
Look.
"Oh, yeah..."
- We've just had too many damn blessings.
That's just how life is though.
- A marvelous woman with a marvelous voice and a marvelous song.
Nora and the Pope dancers!
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
I'll play along for a little while.
To take advantage of this would be wise.
As long as I'm a part of the game.
"- If I were to leave, I wouldn't know where to go."
"If I order a schnitzel, she says I'm too fat."
I should get myself something vegetarian.
Why is it my mother's business what I eat?
- I don't get involved with her life.
I don't tell her what she should and shouldn't eat.
You also have a mother who's sticking her nose in everything?
... for such a long time.
Shall I leave?
- It couldn't do any harm to have men and money on your side.
"Here, just give her a ten."
She doesn't need money.
What's with you!
?
Why are you taking my money?
What are you doing here?
He shouldn't be giving her money.
She doesn't need money!
"Please, goodbye, and thank you."
Here comes another one.
That was Nora and the Pope dancers!
"Now, ladies and gentlemen..."
"And now, yet another dream comes true."
- It's finally here!
What we've all been waiting for.
I'll get rid of all the weaklings who have spent the last 66 years relying on other countries and other people to take care of things.
Given your outstanding ability to gather information I'm sure you can make any idea a reality.
just say the magic word.
Hey.
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ok.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling,"
I could maybe do with a teenth.
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Gee, I don't know."
How about over there?
That brown van.
"- That's yours, right?"
- What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
Another one right over there.
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on!
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just want to get high."
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
Seriously.
"And I don't mean to disrespect, but if you put a bunch of cops in the back of a garbage truck, there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
- Unless maybe that's what you want... - Cohen!
- What?
Come on!
Just wait a second.
- I believed you.
"How you were changing, that you just wanted to be friends."
- I do!
That's...
Maybe I just...
I can't be just friends with you.
"Well, then, I guess maybe this is it for us."
I'm so tired right now.
I

"- Oh, dude, the only thing holding my head up is my lungs. - Sorry, man."
- I handled that Summer situation so wrong...
I just...
- I really shouldn't have returned her phone calls.
- She never called you.

- Not the girls.
- Not the girls?
- No.
"Uh, Johnnie."
- Johnnie?
- Is there an echo in here?
- Why him?
- Because he's the hero.
- So?
"Well, how do we know he's the hero if he never does anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
Johnnie can't go in the water.
"He's injured, badly injured."
"A manly slash on the bicep, for Christ's sake."
He's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.

They're girls.
Girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to be had by him.
Yes.

Is that Irish or English?

"Fact is, your nephew's gonna get out in no time."
That's wonderful.
"There's still a few details to be ironed out, but now that the DEA is involved,"
I think he's looking at time served and probation.
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"Excuse me, the DEA?"
Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
"I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news, but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers."
I understand that.
But what does that have to do with the DEA?
"They're after some mystery man, some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg."
They want this guy like the ax wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up!"
This is good news.
"I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
"Look, look."
I think...
I just think that we should
She doesn't know that it looks as though he was alive when he was buried.
Does she need to know that?
She's asked to see the body.
"Well, you should do your best to put her off."
"Well, you can't stop her if she wants to see him."
Some people don't believe it until they see it.
I know.
But it's her son in there.
I think maybe I should do this.
Sure?
Just don't let her see the body.
"Oh, please."
No.
Not David.
I'm sorry.
Who did this?
We hope to find out more from the post-mortem.
Can I see him?
"You have the right to, of course, but I'd advise you not to."
Many changes have occurred to the body.
"He was my baby, my boy."
"From what I've read of David's work, he had a strong belief that death was not the end."
"You did well there, Nikki."
I remembered that stuff about the resurrection of the body from my gran's funeral.
Wouldn't want too many resurrections of the body.
We'd be out of a job.
I worry about you.
You'll be speaking in tongues next.
"When are you going to accept the truth, sinner?"
I wish I could find some truth right now.
Still looking for a reason?
I'm not sure there is a reason.
"Yes, Pauline."
It'll all be fine.
Have a seat first...
- I won't go back!
"- Now come, first sit down."
It's so hot...
- Won't you take off your coat!
- Yes.
Do you see that?
"What should I see, Mrs John?"
"Well, take a closer look!"
Where is the child that I'm having?
Mrs John!
"Well, it just happens that one loses a child before it's born."
But for me it's the second time and it'll always be that way...
But you were seven months pregnant!
Was I?
"No, it happened in the fourth month... quite suddenly..."
My husband had just gone on tour.
Thank God he didn't notice anything.
"Yes, and..."
"Then I wanted to adopt a child, but... the girl left..."
And since then I've played a part.
No one has noticed anything.
But why haven't you told the truth?
"Because he is a man, Pauline!"
"A handsome, strong man..."
"Because there are plenty of young things that can have a baby, like yourself!"
Because our greatest happiness would be if we were to have one...
I've always wished for one and so has he... to raise someone...
small for the future...
"Well, why do you think he's so long on the road?"
I haven't taken advantage of my employee benefits yet.
I'm entitled to 50 Euros worth of goods per month.
That includes former employees as well.
I looked into it.
Now's the perfect moment to start in with that.
They owe me 44 Euros and 10 cents now.
That costs 5 Euros and 90 cents?
That stuff is expensive.
Are these friends of yours?
Can't you see this has been blocked off!
?
"But it says, 'shopping free of charge' outside."
They haven't torn down the sign yet.
Please exit the building!
Why?
We want to go shopping!
This is the scene of a criminal investigation.
"It just doesn't work like that, if it's written on the sign..."
"Get out immediately, otherwise you'll be shot out by the task force."
Toni's dream
Can you help me with my tie?
What?
"My tie, I forgot how it works."
No.
Why don't you just ask Franz?
"Okay, okay."
It was just a question.
I just can't do it.
That's fine.
Would you come with me?
No.
Would you please leave me alone now?
- Jesus!
Are you sure?
Take her by car did not help.
I'll take care of it.
How will you deal?
"We will aim, Carl, until we learn."
- What can we find out?
- If you are scared.
- It's already scared.
- Can not scared enough.
"Thanks, Kate."
"Miss Keesey,"
I'm Special Agent Adam Frawley.
I deal with the bank robbery investigation.
Need to tell you we take fingerprints to eliminate them from the list of suspects.
I see that you have given us a preliminary DECLARATION.
I want to talk about your abduction.
Well.
I understood that you were threatened.
One of them stole my license management.
You tried to escape?
No.
We can identify in any way?
Do you have evidence to stand as witness?
I tried to escape because they were înarmaþi.
I understand.
Then they let you go?
"Yes, I have let you go."
You should not have a lawyer here?
"You're not charged, but anyone asks a lawyer is guilty."
- I believe that you did not need.
- Okay.
Hey.
Ohh!
"♪ let's jam that boogie, babe ♪"
I didn't tell him anything!
I didn't tell him nothing!
"Not a thing, I..."
♪ let's jam that boogie ♪
"♪ let's jam that boogie, babe ♪"
thank you.
Rose?
What is it?
"Oh, peggy."
It's too awful.
Sousa:
"Really puts you back there, doesn't it?"
"You realize could happen anytime, any day."
How did it happen?
Professional hit.
Him and our only witness.
Must have been watching us at the scene.
I knew something was fishy about that anonymous tip.
Who does that?
A concerned citizen?
Concerned citizens call the cops.
This guy called us directly.
It's not like we're in the phonebook.
"Somebody targeted them, and I'm gonna find that bastard."
"Whatever happened last night, don't any of you forget..."
Krzeminski would still be with us today
"If it wasn't for howard stark,"
Whether he pulled the trigger or not.
We're only neck-deep in this mess because of him.
-So he comes again.
-Brought some pastries.
-Is he taking a nap?
-Yeah.
-Is he driving you to drink?
-I can drive myself.
I needed that.
What's the matter?
Spent a long time in the hospital last night.
The shit that goes on down there.
I wasn't expecting visitors.
How about those Mets?
Don't start with me and those Mets.
"You know, I was thinking about you."
-So you're drunk already.
-No.
I was thinking about the way you are.
"How you always have this little smile, like you got your own private joke."
"You don't talk much, do you?"
I wish I knew your secret.
Lose a leg and start making websites.
"That's the whole purpose for people like me, to inspire people like you."
"-Jesus, no offense."
-That's the trouble with you Americans.
You expect nothing bad ever to happen... when the rest of the world expects only bad to happen.
-They're not disappointed.
-That's a fucking grim outlook.
"You have everything, and still you complain."
You lie on couches and bitch to your psychiatrist.
You got too much time to think about yourselves.
Sounds like me all right.
You're not so bad.
"Doc, I have something to tell..."
Doctor.
Are you alright?
I suck.
I've been treating that man's nephew for so long.
But he hasn't gotten better.
"In the end, I made the wrong diagnosis."
"Talk about bad luck, having me as your doctor."
Maybe you should've gotten better sooner too.
"No one wants to waste time seeing a doctor, right?"
I am sorry.
I....
"I know I am not that good, but I try."
I'm trying my best.
Shit think of something to say to make her feel better.
What should I say?
And what the hell is wrong with me?
"Standing, eating this junk food with nitrates."
As a kid I ate so much of this I went to the hospital.
"But if eating it makes you feel better, then it's okay."
It's not standard medical practice but..
the better you feel the faster you heal.
"Shit, it rhymes."
Sounds sweet like a poem.
Am I seeing a doctor?
Actually I just realized that being a doctor is tough.
You have to say things that make patients feel better.
I feel I've been a bad patient all this time.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
You aren't busy today?
It's a distraction for him.
Can you imagine the pressure that he's under?
"Plus, it means that Patty... whatever her name is is going to have to bear more of the burden, which is great."
She's never tried a case.
You've never tried a case.
I didn't go to Laverne Law School.
Wow.
"Look at you, so confident."
- [click]
- Lucy:
Thank you.
So McBride is going to file for a continuance.
It would be malpractice not to.
And I say that we oppose it strongly.
- Are you sure about that?
- Absolutely.
"Every single day that this case drags on,"
"Borns Tech is vulnerable to a decline in stock value, and that makes America vulnerable."
"I mean, letting a nobody like Billy McBride hold up a great corporation with a frivolous and ridiculous lawsuit?"
"It's not just wrong, it endangers everything that matters to our c-c... c-c-c... c-c... [deep inhale] country."
[exhale]
Ahem.
"Lucy, do you need me to fill a prescription for you?"
F-- [chuckle]
I'm fine.
Yeah.
You seem...fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I swear.
I'm fine.
Man:
Loads.
- Tell her how much you enjoy the work.
"- Oh, it... it..."
This... this job would...
You were inspired by Florence Nightingale to bring cleanliness to the wards.
"- Oh, God, you know?"
- Don't say God.
She might be religious.
Shit!
- God was better.
- It isn't a complicated job.
"I've done it before, I can do it again."
What more is there to say?
Oh.
I don't think there's...
anything more to say.
Knocked back from wiping up shite.
"Er... well, that was an inside job."
"They'll be forced to advertise for legal reasons, but a cushty number like that?"
"I mean, she'll have a mate lined up."
It'll be fine.
"I'm not quite sure how, exactly, just yet."
"But there is a perfect solution to this, and..."
Oi.
Trust your guardian angel to find it.
They shouldn't let your sort work in a hospital.
Our sort?
Does the FA Cup here make you wear that uniform while he's doing you doggy style?
"You're in enough trouble, young man, without getting pervy."
Trouble?
That's my dad up there.
This is no worse than a baby sucking its mother's tit.
I don't know how long its been since I've seen that.
You're like a miracle worker.
It's all a part of the process.
"But for now, your chest only, okay?"
It feels so good.
Could you maybe...
Not on the first visit.
It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.
"I know, but--"
What if this is the only erection I ever get?
I may not have another chance.
You will.
I promise.
Please.
"I wouldn't ask, except... it would mean a lot to me."
"I-I'm not a young man anymore, and..."
Please?
I do not understand it when we've gone over and over this time and time again!
I'm so sorry.
I-I--
You risked compromising his entire treatment!
And for what?
I felt he was so distracted by his need.
- I thought that if I just--
- You crossed a line that cannot be crossed.
And if the surrogate doesn't understand the boundaries--
"But I do know the boundaries, and-- and he did end up feeling--"
Do not tell me that it's okay because it worked.
You cannot play fast and loose with my patients that way.
I am sorry.
You're right.
I-I really apologize.
Now shut your trap.
- You mean you won't go?
- No!
And if you mention gold temples again to me...
I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel.
"Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice."
I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down.
"All right, I'm going alone."
Wait a minute!
"Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission."
Give me that bottle.
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.
"But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition."
I'm an expedition.
Out of my way.
"Cutter, sit down before I throw you down."
"Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you."
Goodbye forever.
Stand back.
I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move.
Out of my way before I split your jaw.
"- Cutter, I'm warning you."
"- Come on, put 'em up."
"Come on, out of my way."
"I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do."
"Come on, put 'em up."
I'm afraid I have to do it.
Sgt. Ballantine.
- What?
- Come here.
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
david:
Get off!
Get the fuck off me!
(REWlNDlNG)
(GUNSHOTS)
DAVID:
I don't know how they got in.
"I mean, how can they have gotten the door code?"
It changes every shift.
Unless someone...
They knew the code and I told Mere... I told Meredith to lock herself inside the broadcast room to broadcast over the emergency channel.
-(pounding)
-Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
They've cut into all our other secure lines of communication.
I don't know how.
"I mean, who could know that much?"
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
Wait.
What did he just say?
(REWlNDlNG)
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
katherine:
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.
Yes.
"I swear to God, if you were pretending to talk to someone..."
"Katherine, I gave him the code."
He verified the code.
"Yeah, but did you verify him?"
- Are you bullshittin' me?
[Grunts] That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
[Jimmy] Tear it right out.
Tear it out!
"Nothing here, Jimmy."
Look in here.
[Coughing]
This is all solid.
[Loud Hissing]
[Tire Bouncing]
[Whirring]
There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
"I don't buy that, Irv."
The stuff is in that car.
"Well, you find it."
I can't.
[Indistinct]
[Speaking French]
"Look, the car was lost some time last night."
"First, they send us to Pier 1, then they send us here."
Then what?
I don't understand why you parked the car down by the waterfront.
You tell me you're staying at the Doral in midtown Manhattan... and you lose the car out by the Brooklyn Bridge?
"Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television."
He probably left the car to look at some point of interest.
We were told by the police commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage.
I demand its immediate return.
"You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux."
"We get 400, 500 cars here a day."
Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of this country.
I am still in Tangak_
He is not late.
Put it down!
What did they do to you?
I had to bring it so I did.
- A man must honor his promises.
- Well done!
"Well done, what?"
A man must honor his promises;
"I said ""well done"" for it!"
- So?
- So what?
- A man must stay to his promises!
"- I did promise nothing, did I?"
"Bashirou, why did you put the cradle here"
"Bashirou, what happened to you?"
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
I like you;
I liked your father too.
"- If I would say something to you, it's because of"
- I understand!
"It's because you don't want me out of money, you want me to take re of my family."
"But Mr. Zaer Kheder, I said something else to you before going to Tangak."
"Yes, you said!"
But I can't burden ketfledrum to you.
To whom I should say not to play and let this little boy play kettledrum?
"Whoever you see, was waiting from last year's Moharram to this year's to play kettledrum, cymbal, and horn and morning Alam Iifling"
Everybody has his own vows.
All of them have their own intentions.
Whom should I ask for'?
"Mr Zaer Kheder, ifs cheating!"
- I'm clean.
You?
- I'm clean.
I had my tubes tied.
- Fuck the condoms.
- Great.
"This isn't all some scheme to get back control of Isabelle's money, is it?"
"This isn't some hostile way for you to get back at Dean, is it?"
- I'm not sure what it is.
"- Me, neither."
- I'm not sure I care right now.
"- Me, either."
My cousin live in a village where all the babies born one year look like those Oompa Loompas.
"Then they stop the crop-dusting, and the next year, all fine."
Do they dance and sing morality songs?
"No, but a lot of them are tossed in bars to make a living."
I used to have nightmares about the boat scene.
I remember that.
I used to have to crawl in bed with you and read to you from the real-estate section to get you to fall asleep.
Which got me into trouble at school.
"When we were starting Roosevelt,"
"I proudly announced to the entire class that FDR stood for ""Formal Dining Room."""
I like this part!
"Oh, can we say chicken parmesan?"
No.
"Oh, no."
I promise I won't yell.
No ultimatums.
- I just want to talk.
Can I come in?
- Bad timing.
What's going on?
I'm stuck on something.
I could use an extra set of eyes.
And I'll let you insert your own blind joke.
"I'd love to, but I'm on my way out."
I just came to check a few emails.
I like it.
Banker's hours.
Make that banker's half day.
"Hey, you want to grab a beer later?"
"I'll try not to smash a bottle over anyone's head, but I can't make any promises."
"As nice as that sounds, I'm on my way out of town."
Did Joan put you on an assignment I don't know about?
I'm taking a few days vacation.
Really?
"This from the woman who's never taken a day off work for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Kwanzaa."
It was a spontaneous thing.
"Now, that is more like the Annie Walker that I know."
Where you going?
"Michael's taking my sister away, and they need me to watch the girls."
What about Michael's parents?
Didn't they just move out there?
They're on a cruise.
And they just now asked you to come out?
They're not big planners.
"Listen, I'm gonna be late for my flight."
"I'm fine, Auggie."
We'll catch up when I get back.
I've never pulled a job like this in three hours.
I included a rush fee.
This is fully biometric?
I used a blank R.F.I.D. chip from the actual Thai facility the GPO uses.
- And she can travel anywhere?
What are you talking about?
Welovethisidea.
"No,  you love this idea, and you love it so much that you made me love it, too."
How many people do you know that would actually pay money to party on The Mystery Machine?
A lot of people.
"There's Tom, my co-worker Sam-- he loves this idea."
"And, uh..."
Crap.
I'm an idiot.
Oh.
"No, you're not."
Come on.
Just because this idea isn't great doesn't mean the next one's not gonna be.
I believe in you.
Oh.
"Oh, now we're out of wine."
I don't want to go all the way to the store to get it.
Why can't wine just appear whenever you want it to?
- Bye.
- Where are you going?
"Uh, I just want to go look into something."
But I'll catch up with you later-- maybe when you're done sucking that cork.
Shut up.
I don't do that.
"[ Door opens, closes ]"
"Dang, sad pitt."
Why the long face?
I was dropping mad knowledge on these shorties till this wangsta scrub came in and ganked my crew.
"Oh, I was helping out with a children's music class till another teacher came in and took my spot."
"I mean, me and the kids were having so much fun-- you know, really connecting."
And then this guy just came in and took over.
I feel you.
Hmph!
Teenagers.
They think they know everything.
"You give them an inch, they swim all over you."
Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
"Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss."
None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense.
"No, sir."
I'd keep her under tight control.
"- You're right, Sebastian."
- Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
"Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble."
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
[Sebastian] How do I get myself into these situations?
"I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager."
Hmm?
What is that girl up to?
[Sebastian pants]
[Gasps]
Huh?
"Ariel, are you OK?"
[Ariel] If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.

- Month or month and a half
Will you hold this for me?
And turn around
Moron!
Did I bring you up to see this day?
"No, don't drop that"
"Are you all right, Pops?"
"Pops, you're right."
I ought to take care of your business
You've become so old.
- You tell your father that?
"Pops, I've decided against Europe."
I'm joining the offices from tomorrow
"In this house, only your father decides."
You're going to Europe
No.
I've had enough of a goodtime.
My years of youth are over for me
Never say your youth is over.
All my life I've slogged to give you whatever I couldn't do
"When youth came and went, I never got to know"
"But I wasn't sad, because I knew that my son will have my years"
"If you think you've had enough of a goodtime... if you think the years of youth are over for you, well no problem"
Just go and live my years for me
Ajit's letter?
Lajjo!
"Look, what's here Letter!"
From my friend
From Ajit
"Just smell it, lady!"
The fragrance of Punjab!
Stop this.
I'll be beheaded if you don't choose francis anyway.
I'd rather die today
To show you that I mean every word that I say.
Is this some kind of trick?
Test me.
Ask nostradamus to explain
How the future he sees for you and francis
Has altered since clarissa's death.
"Oh, yes."
Be sure.
Be very sure.
"I would want every certainty, too."
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure about anything.
"I believe you, but..."
You don't know what you want.
I love them.
I love them both.
"Begging your pardon, your majesties,"
But the king demands your presence.
A messenger has arrived with news
About the line of succession of England.
Their queen...
Is dead.
And she has named me her successor?
"After all her deliberations, they say she died"
Suddenly...
In the night.
"But England is yours by bloodline, by right."
"You must claim it immediately,"
Or your cousin elizabeth will seize it from your grasp.
"Settlers of Catan, the world's most powerful aphrodisiac."
"No, Jack, this is just a cover to keep prying eyes from... my eight-year plan for getting together with Emma."
You're going to want to just skip past the first seven pages.
Just me spit-balling our married names.
"""Clark and Emma Cho-Robertson."""
"""Ark and Clemma Chorobert-cho."""
Page eight is where the fun really starts.
"Yeah, he made a flowchart of every possible path he can take to end up with Emma."
It's inspiring.
CLARK:
"It has to be perfect, Jack."
"I don't want to have to sit our children down one day and say, ""Sorry I blew it with your mom"", and that's why you don't exist."""
There are endless opportunities all leading to the same outcome.
"Oh, a newscast with your neighbors standing in front of yellow tape saying,"
"""Oh, he was quiet and kept to himself."""
No.
Me and Emma in love.
See?
"Here's a section I like to call ""Sub Chart 0-41A."""
"Or ""Getting Emma and I to Hold Hands."""
Mmm.
That doesn't happen for four years?
!
"Clark, you are way overthinking this."
"In the wilderness, you act fast or you die."
"Or worse, you miss out on a threesome with Swedish hikers."
Jack's right...
Just ask Emma out.
And 20 bucks says one of those hikers was a dude.
"Eh, they're all beautiful over there."
"Wait, how did you know I like Emma?"
[laughing]:
What?
You turned a block full of headlights on.
This should be easy.
Are you serious?
You said I look for ways to slack off.
This I take seriously.
"You have to challenge that brilliant mind of yours, and someone has to fill in for that Foss guy, right?"
"Well, that someone, my friend, will be me."
Really?
Just- make 'em blink.
Hey.
Is it working?
Not really.
Thinking about Amanda drained all the voltage out of him.
Oh.
"Yeah, I heard."
"""We need to talk. """
Sorry she left you hanging.
Typical woman.
"Um, anyway..."
I need to look for my digital projector.
"You giving that away, too?"
"No, I need it for a lecture I'm giving at U.W."
You're giving a lecture?
I mean... you're giving a lecture.
I've been asked to speak at a symposium tomorrow.
Are you getting paid for this thing?
"Because you're supposed to bring home the bacon, Dad, and I eat a lot of bacon."
"For your information, Josh, I have already had a job offer."
This lecture is about showing my expertise... for free.
"Well, I think your expertise is worth more than that."
"Thank you, Kyle."
"Well, this is a perfect test site."
Little traffic and low real estate value.
"It's adequate, I suppose."
"Ok, let's get this over with."
This thing on all right?
It's ready.
What do you want him to do this time?
I want you to climb that fire escape to the absolute top.
Wait a minute.
This is as high as I go.
You want me to break somebody's leg?
Just tell me how many pieces.
"But up there, I don't go."
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.
I will fall.
"That is true, Victor."
He has acrophobia among other things.
Find a different test for him.
Acrophobia is not a problem with my device.
Start climbing.
"I will do anything else you say, but I am not going up that building, understand?"
- I...
- Sickle I command you to climb up that fire escape.
"You will go to the very top,"
"You will turn around, and you will look down."
And you will not be frightened of heights.
Off you go.
It's working.
It's working!
It seems to be.
No.
"I've just come from work, actually!"
I just thought I'd...
I'm trying to make my hair and coat sort of join.
So we don't know where one ends and one begins?
Like a sort of Camden owl.
LAUGHTER
"Now then, where does your style come from?"
Em...
"And this sounds rude, but were you always like this?"
I guess so.
My mum's quite stylish.
Yeah.
My dad used to be.
"In the '70s, he'd wear mental clothes."
"Like yellow flares and tops with stars on them, then he went quite straight in the '80s."
You had young parents.
Your mum was 18?
"Yeah, really young."
So they were really cool and dressed like they were in Black Sabbath.
Then all of a sudden in the '80s my dad got quite square.
"""That's enough of yellow flares."
"I'll just wear a shirt and some leisure trousers."""
"He just stopped, but my mum carried on."
Where was this?
In South London.
What was hilarious was they had this three-wheeler car called a Bomb Bug.
An orange thing and the roof went up like that.
So not only did they wear yellow flares and had a three-wheeled orange triangle car...
I was just a laughing stock!
"It sounds like you grew up in a cartoon, didn't you?"
"It was a bit like Roobarb and Custard, yeah."
You didn't call!
- Don't come here and intimidate me!
I waited all day.
Who are you?
How can you stand yourself?
"We tried to contact you several times, but we couldn't find you."
Come on.
You're filthy rich.
You could have hired an army.
It abviously took more than an army to find you.
To find a junkie drinking in India with hookers.
You hid my daughter for 20 years because I cheated once?
"Do you really think that's why, Jacob?"
Because you cheated once?
You're a very small person.
- What are you telling me?
- You're not listening.
- Then tell me.
Tell me!
- Let's all calm down a little.
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?
- We'd have figured something out.
- I didn't know until I got back.
I met Jørgen and...
"No, Jacob, I don't owe you anything."
You don't owe...
Aren't we talking about your daughter?
- Shouldn't she know her father?
"- She has a father, a good father."
I don't know what the hell to say.
What you did is so wrong.
"You know that, right?"
"Oh, that's good."
will you excuse me while I put on my pretty new dress?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
I understand there's to be a little card party here tonight to which we ladies are cordially not invited.
That's right.
Where--?
Where is stella?
She's out there on the porch.
I'm going to ask a favor of you in a moment.
"well, now, what's that gonna be, I wonder."
Some buttons in back.
You may enter.
How do I Iook?
You look okay.
"well, thanks."
Now the button.
"well, I can't do no more with them."
"You men with your big, clumsy fingers."
-May I have a drag on your cig?
"-Yeah, have one for yourself."
"Why, thank you."
It--
It looks like my trunk has exploded.
Me and stella was helping you unpack.
You certainly did a fast and thorough job of it.
"well, certainly looks like you raided some stylish shops in Paris, BIanche."
clothes are my passion.
How much does it cost for a string of furs like that?
"Why, these were a tribute from an admirer of mine."
He must have had a Iot of admiration.
"In my youth I excited some admiration, but look at me now."
I'm home!
Welcome back.
"Good evening, sensei."
Good to see you Tomoko.
came to see me.
"She seemed very lonely, so I invited her to come see the ocean."
Oh.
Did you eat?
Yes.
Then you should take a bath.
"Alright, we'll practice more later."
Take your positions now.
Take a fan.
"You can hear the waves, can't you?"
"Tomoko, the time I've spent as your teacher will fade into the distant past."
"Since I was a child, I think I've been too dependent on the love and good will of others."
I think I got too dependent on the goodness of your heart.
I think that I hurt your chances of being happy and finding someone to marry.
"No, that's not true."
It wasn't a sacrifice.
It was I who was dependent on you and Shinako.
I didn't do anything.
"There's something worrying you, isn't there Tomoko?"
There's something I've been keeping a secret from you two.
What is it?
Do you have some problem?
"If there's something bothering you that you can't tell me about, please talk to Shinako about it."
I'll leave you two alone.
What's going on?
I'm drunk.
Oh.
"Mother, Takehara is over there."
Move out of the way.
You.
"Yes, you."
Get out.
"This is private property, get off it now."
Move!
Who let him in here?
Do you have any idea who that is?
That's Vigol from The Daily Mail.
All he's responsible for is stirring up trouble and writing malicious gossip like that bloody curse story.
Communication with the press is only allowed with The Times.
I will not tolerate any exceptions.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes.
- Where are you going?
"- Home, Howard."
I'm not a schoolboy.
CARNARVON:
Are you looking forward to the opening?
Everything's ready.
I've emptied it all out apart from the two guardian statues.
- I thought they should stay.
- Why not?
"You will cover up our little hole, won't you?"
I wouldn't want Lacau seeing that.
I wish we could get rid of that bloody man.
"But we have to deal with him, we mustn't forget that."
Try a little flattery.
Always works with the froggies.
You know you should never have signed that deal with The Times.
It's only made matters worse.
I thought it was what you wanted.
"I love you, Buddy."
[Sniffles] I love you.
[Whispers] I love you.
Where are they?
"Dick, you don't have to make a statement."
Herb covered 'em foryou.
No!
"[Herb] Gentlemen, Mr. Nixon is a man who is graceful in defeat, and if he was here with us..."
[Reporters Shouting]
"Can I have some quiet, please?"
[Shouting Continues]
Give the- just a second.
I
"Can I have some quiet, please?"
Quiet!
- Thank you.
I - [Reporters Quiet]
- [Reporter] Mr. Nixon.
I
- Uh-[Clears Throat]
"- I believe Governor Brown has a heart, - [Shutters Clicking]"
Even though he believes I do not.
"Uh, I believe he's a good American, even though he feels I am not."
I'm proud ofthe fact that I defended my opponent's patriotism.
"Uh, you gentlemen didn't report it, but I'm proud that I did that."
"And I would appreciate it, for once, if you would just printwhat I say."
"[Nervous Chuckle] Uh, for 16 years, uh, ever since the Hiss case, you've had a lotoffun."
A lotoffun.
"But recognize you have a responsibility, if you're againstthe candidate, to give him the shaft."
"But ifyou do that, at least put one lonely reporteron the campaign... who will report whatthe candidate says now and then."
"Uh, I think, all in all, I've given as good as I've taken."
"Butas I leave you, I w..."
That should be me.
I should be doing that time.
No.
We went over this.
It's good.
How's it good?
"It's a minimum-security place in Phoenix, and, no, I am not going to tell you which one."
She'll get out of there and she'll be fine.
"You keep your promise and steer clear, and she can have a good life."
She can do what she's supposed to do.
"I mean if I can't be there for her, man, you gotta promise me that you will be."
I promise.
Then you should do something for me.
I was able to fence the watches.
"Don't judge, I'm giving it all to her."
And the car.
"I got a clean VIN number for it, so it's legit, and it just..."
"It'll feel like I'm there with her, you know?"
"Money is not what she needs, not for what's ahead."
Can you just see that she gets it?
Sure.
And one more thing.
"If anything changes, like she does her job, this insanity ends, if she's free..."
I'll send you a postcard.
(SCREAMING)
I'm not what you think!
"You're a thief, and you poisoned me, so, yeah, I'm pretty sure you're exactly what I think."
No!
You have a compass.
I need it!
I don't care what you need.
"(GRUNTS) No, for my son."
"Without it, we'd keep doing"
The same useless things over and over and over again.
It's nature's way of saying
"That what you're doing is futile,"
And that it's time to let go.
Got it?
Depression is nature's way
"Of weeding out the weak and the useless, rhade."
Which one are you?
What?
You heard me.
Don't you-
Quiet.
We're being boarded.
"Rhade,"
"We've got intruders, heavily armed,"
And they're packing
Pretty interesting tech equipment.
They've restored the power here.
Which raises the question- Do we stop them?
Could get me out of my mood.
"Hold on, cowboy."
Let's see if they fix the ship first.
Then you can go crazy on them.
You owe the lady an explanation.
"When i first built you, all i had was a hand-Comp"
"And core fragments of an al, all right?"
"Every time you woke up,"
You'd just..
You'd start yelling at me
And try to leave.
"Pretty much like every relationship i've ever had,"
"Come along, dear."
I'll tuck you in again.
"He's wicked, isn't he?"
"Was there anything else, Julian?"
"One of these days, Auntie, somebody will cut that iron umbilicus... and maybe your throat in the bargain."
"Go to bed immediately, Merle."
And see that you stay there.
"Hello, Corbett."
Is Merle ready yet?
"Miss Gilbert, won't you come in?"
I'll tell her you're here.
Thank you.
"Well, good morning, Miss Gilbert."
How very nice to see you again.
"Hello, Mr. Langley."
Where are you two young ladies off to this time?
"Lunch, fashion show."
I'll be taking some pictures if sleepyhead doesn't make me late.
Merle had a restless night.
"You know, Mr. Langley, it's always been my one great ambition to be able to sleep in till 11:00 every morning."
"Well, you'll just have to marry a rich man."
"Unfortunately, they've all been spoken for-- especially the handsome, distinguished ones."
Gina--
"Well, it's about time, lazy bones."
"Hello, Mrs. Langley."
"Good morning, Gina."
You're looking very attractive today.
Thank you very much.
I wish I could have clothes like that.
This?
It's only 14.95.
But it's so sophisticated.
And you know why?
Because they're ignorant and they're dumb as shit.
"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is democracy."
- God damn it.
- It's the 12th Amendment.
- I have 20th Amendment.
- Why are there so many amendments?
"Get it right the first time, people."
It's actually both. 12th is superseded by the 20th.
They give the House until January 20th to elect the president.
Each state gets one vote.
First candidate to 26 is the new president and the Senate chooses the VP.
It's a close election with a ton of House races too close to call.
What happens if it's a tie in the House?
Right.
- Is it a dance-off?
"Well, vice president-elect becomes president."
Whoever the Senate has picked for VP will be president.
"- Wait, that means..."
- That Tom...
- What?
- Could be the president.
"Well, I..."
I had literally no idea.
It's good to be prepared.
"So, wait."
So you mean that I...
I might lose this election to my fucking vice president?
"At least it'd be somebody from our team, ma'am."
"I mean, that's good, right?"
I didn't mean to make her cry.
"There, there."
Did you make the milk?
What the hell is going on here?
You're a humanoid!
Why do you have hair?
"My husband told me that I am the first blonde but unfortunately I am brunette, so"
"Where are you from, Sara?"
- I was born in this cabin.
"- No, that's impossible!"
Tell me the truth.
- Where are you from?
"- You're far from home, Spartan!"
"""Do you want to tell me what you do in my cabin?"""
"- He's a friend, Cage."
There is no reason for the weapon.
"With her, I'll blow your face away!"
I'm looking for a girl.
She was kidnapped by a Humanoid.
My partner said that maybe you could help me.
This is no help for the Spartans.
I do not like to waste time with Federation slag.
"Spartan, my ass!"
As I said...
I would appreciate any information you or Sara may have about the girl.
You must be five now.
"If you can not help, let's go our way again."
And we do not ask questions.
"A gun does not want to help you, son."
What if I do not want to help you?
What happens then?
Question answered?
"Rat, piece of Spartan garbage!"
You and your Indian slut can kiss me in the ass!
But in the area of death the ice is ruthless.
"Looks like someone had your bright idea, Bishop."
An accident rarely comes alone.
Sauber!
"It seems that your drug addicts friends are condemned here,"
What?
"Are we going to play now ""Cowboys and the damn Indians""?"
Only we are the damned Indians.
"Everyone knows the damn Indians never win, my friend!"
Noids have no combat training.
We do.
Re-assemble and prepare.
Check the Noid for DNA reconfiguration.
I'll contact the base.
I say:
We hide in the next camp.
The next camp is 100 miles from here.
We're dead before we get there.
Do not look so serious.
I will not let you die.
"Very well, little one?"
"Fuck you, Hatta!"
Accept the shit.
We contacted the enemy right outside the Death Zone.
The truck is gone.
Subutai has fallen.
"But we ended up mutated humanoids in the process,"
So it was a mutated humanoid Ash-393?
"Negative, but it has been hormonally changed."
We took a sample for an exam.
I do not care about mutated notions.
I want Ash-393!
- Asshole!
"So I don't care about a neurotical, I mean... he got me to stop eating sushi for about 20 min."
But then I said... seize the damn!
I'm not gonna be sway
"I mean... it's not that I'm dying to tear it out but... honestly, what's the worst thing that can happen?"
"I get a tapeworm and I eat what I like, and still..."
lose 20 pouds?
"I'd rather be like Karen Carpenter... on the top of the world, looking down on creation."
Wouldn't that be dreaming?
"But enough about ""moi""."
What did you say your name was again?
- Jocelyn.
- And you work at...
- Skirt Magazine.
"- Roxanne Rochet, I love her like a sister!"
- What do you do there?
- You know... this and that.
"Details, darling!"
"Are you a writer, a stylist?"
"- I'm a ""head plan""."
- Excuse me?
- The resident xerox core.
- And what is this?
I'm an intern.
She's an intern
She's an intern
"A pathetic, nulling intern"
Slaved little intern
Fax this Xerox that
Slaved little intern
Get me coffee Kiss my ass
Sometimes she may get the blues But everyone would spin and lose
Let's go home.
"A peaceful, stay-at-home kind of day in a town  very much like your own."
"But then, suddenly, without warning atomic holocaust!"
But how does one survive an atomic attack?
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?
He says his boat ran into a sea monster.
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.
It was a metal meteor.
It ate his boat.
My dad says--
It wasn't any of those.
"What would you know about it, Poindexter?"
Don't make me come over there.
Hands over your head Keep low to the ground
Time to duck and cover The bombs are coming down
Duck and cover
It's about 50 or 60 feet high and it only eats metal.
"Shut up, you little spaz!"
It's been sent by foreigners to take over the country.
We should bomb it to smithereens before it does.
'Cause all the kids who don 't Will cease to be around
Thanks for the scrap.
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this...
... thislargebiteout ofit.
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.
-What could've done this?
-I told you what.
Strange invaders.
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.
"She went back inside caressing his hair, and..."
It's the Iast time I saw her alive.
You stayed with the others?
"No, I was tired, I had to work early the next morning."
"I let them deal with it, I jumped into my truck and I went straight home."
"You're here now, so you came back later."
- Is that it?
- One hour later.
"Yeah, one hour later."
"I don't know why, but I couldn't sleep."
I drank some water and looked out the window.
"Lights were on at C,duIie's, so I went over right away."
"Just as I got there, I think I heard a gun shot."
Then the lights went out.
"So I slowed down, down, then... a second shot, and the lights came on."
"I stepped on it, then I saw the kid with the gun."
"I just had time to lean over, then another shot."
"There was a hole where my face was before, the black guy was gone."
I got out of my truck and ran across the lawn.
"There's Touchy, Ducky with Josée, and C,duIie, covered in blood."
What happened?
", I asked."
Touchy couldn't answer.
"C,duIie wasn't moving."
Ducky was speechless.
"Josée, was crying."
Touchy was trying to bring her to...
I felt something in my back.
"I turned, saw polo."
He had blood in his mouth.
"We tried to bring her to, but she was gone, gone for good."
polo walked towards where the black kid was.
They're gonna lock you away.
You come here to get my statement?
Huh?
Expecting me to... say I'm innocent?
I was gonna make that boy walk.
I was gonna put him on that back road.
"Leave him to the boogeyman to rip him apart, or return him to whatever ungodly dirt he came from."
And if the road couldn't do it...
"I'd do it myself, 'cause sometimes that's just what you got to do."
"Well, you've done enough."
Ah.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
Asshole.
Ken Mersey didn't go home last night.
He's been reported missing this morning.
Boys need stupid things to do.
That's how their mamas wire them.
"Well, his mama wasn't no electrician."
Explains the dim bulb.
It's not like you to be so funny so early.
Well...
I always figured Ken Mersey liked you a whole lot more than you liked him.
Maybe he just don't want to show his face.
"He's missing, I'm worried."
"It doesn't have to be so black-and-white, Lilly."
For fuck's sake.
All I'm saying is that... maybe he's gone because he wants to be gone.
"This ain't hardly about Ken, is it?"
This is about Wallace coming back.
"Hey, do you want to take care of this?"
"Oh, Jerry, you're just aching for coffee, aren't you?"
Here.
Good night.
Lita.
[sighs] [elevator humming] [sobbing]
Lita.
[Sandover's voice] The perfect embezzlement.
It may be said that Rome was not built in a day.
"Well, neither was Fort Knox;"
neither was the treasure of the Incas.
"The undiscoverable acquisition of $201,000, bill by bill, month after month, year after year, is a financial feat worthy of Clem P. Sandover... [jazz playing] [clock ticking]"
- Having trouble?
- Oh no.
I do this for exercise.
It helps my strawberries get ripe.
Anybody home over there?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Why?
"Oh, I'm looking for real estate."
"Well, you can have any of mine, this truck included."
You know this is the second time in three weeks that I've missed the early market?
You know how long I've been asleep in that cab waiting for it to be light enough to fix this thing?

Lita Krail murdered?
She-- she can't be.
She just can't be.
"Beth, why are you so frightened?"
"Last night you told me that you didn't like her, that you didn't trust her."
It's just that I can't believe it.
I'd like to talk to your husband.
He's-- he's gone out already.
I-
- I don't know where.
"I'm only thinking of you, josie."
What about nick?
He's disloyal!
He goes down with the rest!
"Must everyone go down except you, jim?"
You don't realize what you're doing.
People are losing everything.
They're suffering.
They're being ruined.
They're killing themselves.
"You're hated, jim."
"But only by the little people, josie."
"Are we any different than little people, jim?"
I was one when i met you.
You made me big with your courage and your ideas and your money.
"But if this is what it means, i don't want it, jim."
It comes too high.
What do we care what the world is saying?
"Tomorrow, i'll buy it and give it to you!"
I don't want it!
"Right now, there are only two people in this world that count-you and me!"
I'm just beginning to feel the power that's in me.
I know now that nothing can stop me.
Whatever stands in my way must go down!
"Jim, i don't know you."
I'm almost afraid of you.
"No, you're not afraid of me."
"You're afraid of life, josie."
But i'm going to make you love it as much as i do as much as i love you.
"What's happened to you, jim?"
You used to be kind and generous.
You were the kindest man i ever knew.
"We take a dog, tie him to a bicycle..."
No!
It's just not good enough!
Mom's home early!
"You do not pinch, you do not poke, you do not bite, youdonotspit,youdonot eye-gouge, you do not vomit intentionally on other babies!"
A lifetime ban from Gymboree!
A lifetime ban!
I can't believe it.
She didn't even see the board.
This is a sign we were meant to have this.
"We were meant to do something really, really great with you."
It'll come.
We just have to be patient.
No!
This is Mommy's purse!
You can't have it!
"Please, it's the only thing in the house that's Mommy's!"
Lois...
"Well, he has a million toys."
Why does he only want to take my things?
"Honey, honey, you're taking this too personally."
He doesn't understand what he's doing.
He's just a baby.
"Look, if you just give it to him for just a couple of minutes, he'll get tired of it."
You're right.
"I guess I was just feeling that if I gave in to him, he'd see it as a sign of weakness."
- I'm going to stop this right now.
- Yeah.
"Here, sweetie."
Mommy's purse.
"You can have that for five minutes, okay?"
I thought you said he wasn't eating anything.
Far too much flogging.
There was a man killed.
- Under punishment?
"- Yes, sir."
I can deal with Mr. Scott-Padget.
"Maybe, sir."
Do you know what happened to the Beedle's captain?
The lordships of the Admiralty broke him and his two previous captains.
Influence?
"When somebody of enormous power has a mistress and that mistress has a son, the son has great influence at his back."
- I see.
- He's a most brilliant young officer.
A future Drake with a vicious streak and a silver spoon.
"Sir, it could be his making."
Good evening.
Can I offer you some Madeira?
- Yes.
- I'll be going.
"Thank you, Mr. Goss."
Would you like to know our orders?
"We join the fleet at Corsica, report to Admiral Jarvis."
Convoy duty.
"Orders say ""with all possible dispatch."""
"We'll not put in at Gibraltar, but you'll have time to train."
I hope so.
I'd like to practice gunnery next week.
Good.
I know how hard it is working up a green crew but I'd like you to go easier on them.
"The first few weeks, we use methods none of us like."
- You're questioning me.
- I haven't said so.
I know the value of discipline.
"Hey, Ken."
- What's up?
- You're getting skinnier on me.
Yeah.
Where's my money?
Your friend was late four hours last week.
And he's late again today.
I see... go have a talk with him.
The talk is happening right now.
You're going nowhere until Clive gets here.
"# Yeah, the kids call him Conejo #"
# 'Cause he was fast on his feet #
# And he was quick with his fists If he had trouble in the streets #
# But when his old man would hit the bottle #
# He'd kick Conejo's ass #
# And with a wounded heart Conejo swore he'd outrun his past #
"# Run, Conejo, run #"
"Never seen no speed limit on this road, Sheriff Kilbaught, so I... so I made a... a modest estimate."
"Never been anything modest about your modesty, Clive."
"This truck don't go a mile over 50, Sheriff."
"Now, you were driving a different truck this morning."
"I've been watching you the last few weeks, driving back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
"Now, we both know there ain't nothing in this town worth taking a second look at."
Yeah.
"That against the law now, Sheriff?"
"Okay, come on, out."
Even your mama thinks you're a piece of shit.
You don't belong here.
You got me thinking.
Two trucks...
hauling the same junk in the same day?
Your wife told me to ask if you could help me.
She's in bad trouble.
Her neighbors complained to the landlord about her dog.
He told her to get rid of the animal.
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.
"When the landlord found out, he got mad and told her to leave."
Now she can't stay even if she gets rid of it.
I'm so ashamed!
He said he'd get the police to throw us out on the street.
"I'm sorry, but..."
I could give you a couple dollars to help you move.
I can't move!
I want you to talk to him!
Tell him I want to stay here!
What's your landlord's name?
His name is Signor Roberto.
"He lives on Fourth Street, near here."
"They break the windows, they dirty the floors..."
"A real pig-sty, eh?"
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.
She says she's been evicted for no good reason.
"She's a poor widow, she has nobody to take care of her."
"She has no relatives, no money."
All she has is this neighborhood.
I already rented the place to another family.
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.
She got rid of the animal that caused all the trouble.
So let her stay.
Impossible.
"Sir, uh, turns out the camera's broken."
Sometimes the things you think are going to work don't work out at all.
"Son, it's a party-- lighten up."
"Whoa, where you going?"
Where you going?
Where you going?
"- I little wine, if you don't mind."
"- Oh, here's one."
Here you go.
Julian... why don't you show my dad that new sketch you did for me?
"You know, the one in my bedroom."
"Oh, yes, perhaps you can help me name it."
"I'm torn between ""Lame Excuse"" and ""Transparent Distraction."""
"Julian, just give me a second, okay?"
"First of all, I'd like to make a little toast, everybody, okay?"
It seems that some magazine decided that my daughter is a great catch.
"I don't need a magazine to tell me how great she is-- she's beautiful, she's bright--"
I'm damn proud of her.
- Hear hear.
"- Not done, Johnson."
Sh.
He is not done.
"Alex, I just want you to know that I couldn't be more happy if you'd find a nice fellow out there, someone who cares about you half as much as your old man."
He's out there somewhere.
"Hey, I know that ring."
Why do I know that... ring?
What the hell are you doing here?
"Okay, Dad, first--"
I loved your toast.
"Yeah, I heard it through the door."
"Very moving, sir."
Is there something going on between you two?
"The, um, autograph defense."
Exactly.
"So if the print won't do it, maybe what's inside"
The print will.
Now you lost me.
I'm gonna break down
The chemical compound in coop's fingerprint.
"Within that, I think there may be something he can't refute."
"Dimethicone silicone- based lubricant,"
And cells consistent with lambskin.
Lambskin?
That's a condom.
Exactly.
Coop was wearing a condom.
So was anna's rapist.
This spectra has a unique chemical signature.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna run it against the spectra from anna's sex kit.
¶ ¶
"So, um, what kind of condom do I use?"
What's my favorite?
My brand of choice?
I rarely use them.
"So it's kind of a, um,"
Personal question.
"Actually, it's evidence."
Really?
There were specific traces
In anna kitson that we also found
In the oil of your fingerprint.
That print is the same as the one on the murder weapon.
"So, just to get this straight, you raped anna,"
Will he kneel down when he asks her?
They always kneel down.
"What is wrong, dearest?"
Willoughby?
What is the matter?
Forgive me...
I am sent...
Lady Allen exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin.
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?
What a disappointment.
"Your business won't detain you for long, I hope?"
You are kind.
But I have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire.
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait for our invitation?
My engagements are of such a nature...
I dare not flatter my...
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.
"Willoughby, come back!"
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea for Marianne.
"- What is wrong, my love?"
- Do not ask me questions.
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves of his regard for Marianne.
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?
- Why was his manner so guilty?
Only your gargoyles can save us now.
Are you out of your mind?
You almost killed us.
"I won't give up until I get the truth, Elisa."
The truth about you and the gargoyles.
I know you're out there!
"Oh, I know all about you."
Now show yourselves!
(door shuts)
I know.
I know.
This is where you shake your head and tell me I'm wasting my time.
They... they don't follow me everywhere I go.
Come on.
This time I'll drive.
This sounds like a stall.
What do you mean we have to wait?
We didn't get back in time.
You can't see them now.
Meet me back here ten minutes before sunset.
You won't be disappointed.
I promise.
"The rest of the day wasn't a total loss, not a by a long shot."
I have a meeting with the gargoyles tonight.
Your information was accurate.
So much for our good faith.
- Now we come to yours.
- Just tell me what I have to do.
Bring us a gargoyle.
"A few hours later, Elisa and I rendezvoused in the clock tower."
"She took me outside, but I still didn't know what to expect."
Statues?
We mean get arrested by the store detective.
It was just a pun.
We have every intention of paying for this item.
"Ooh, Eddie, it'd be funny if somebody knocked that lot down."
"Not particularly, no."
I'm disappointed myself.
"Come, Eddie, for fruit."
It is the absolute sophis thing to offer fruit after the meal.
So refreshing and it comes in handy for the sex games.
"No, not this."
"Look, ridiculous."
"Oh, this is disgusting."
All this fruit is crushed and bruised.
I shall write to Esther Rantzen.
"- Ah, the meat, Eddie."
- Ha.
Load up the trolley.
They'll have been playing golf
- so they'll be ready for hearty vitals.
- Look at this little lamb chop.
"It was probably once a pig, gambolling in the mountains."
Yeah.
"Doingy, doingy, doing."
I could quite fancy myself as a farmer.
"Well, it's a good job you do fancy yourself cos I can't see that anyone else is going to do it."
"Eddie, do you see this frozen chicken?"
"Er, yes."
"Oh, urh."
Frozen tackle might teach you not to cheek me.
"Richie Rich, do you see this frozen chicken?"
- No.
- I think you do.
"""Why are you still watching this?"" ""You missed a lot of other stuff."
"He hates women."""
I looked at one of those fake asses for about five...
"Shut up, guys."
Not now.
Not this close to the end.
Don't you leave me.
Lock those doors.
They are locked?
So all the doors are locked.
I looked at one of those things for five minutes.
"I was like, ""You know what?"
"If no one was ever gonna know, then, yeah, I'II have sex with it."
"I'm gonna jerk off anyway."" Fellas, am I right?"
The shittiest choreographed ending.
All right.
Just me.
Just me.
"I thought we'd all stand up and get into it, but..."
"Women, I don't know if you know this about men... but when we're in our 20s and our brain is, ""Jerk off right now,"" we're like, ""You got it."
"You got it."""
"When we're in our 30s and our brain is, ""Jerk off right now,"""
"I promise you, all of us are like,"
"""When the fuck does this stop?"
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.
It's been 20 goddamn years.
I haven't liked it for ten.
I just kept doing it 'cause I thought I'd die.
"Stay away from me... and stay away from my family."""
"My question is, if you buy one of those fake asses... where do you even keep that?"
"""I keep mine under the bed."""
"Do you, you lunatic?"
You're so naive.
"Decontamination work only pays 10,000 yen per day, 20 days per month."
The fish cake factory pays 750 yen per hour.
"You know, even deciding to buy clothes used to be a dilemma, pacing back and forth, not sure if I should."
"Now, if it's under 20,000 yen, I just buy it."
Being poor is unthinkable now.
"Talking with the cast and crew is fun, and I get to meet cool people."
"When I get makeup done and wear costumes,"
I start to become someone else and forget the bad stuff.
"Porn is legitimate work, so I don't feel guilty at all."
"Can you tell Mom and Dad you're doing porn, then?"
No.
You shouldn't do work you can't tell your parents about.
What about you?
Why are you here?
Weren't you at Grand Pacific?
I was fired.
Why?
None of your business.
This is a love hotel.
Can you tell Mom and Dad?
What if I do?
Go ahead.
"Sorry, excuse me."
"Azusa, we're ready for you now."
- Okay.
- Thank you.
"Don't tell Mom and Dad, okay?"
It'll make them sad.
It makes...
Will you take a picture with us?
"Sure, of course."
While behind the wheel of a car with headlights on.
So?
"- Marisa, how long have you smoked?"
None of your business.
- Just humor me.
"I don't know, since, like, 10th grade."
When I was 15.
- You've always smoked Camels?
"Pretty much, except for when I've bummed from friends."
You've seen that pack of Camels thousands of times.
Think real hard about the man on the package.
Was he sitting on the camel or is he leading him with a rope?
"Oh, come on, Marisa, this is a fastball right down the middle."
This is ridiculous.
"- Ah-ah-ah, no cheating."
Come on.
"Okay, fine."
I am 99 percent sure that the man is leading the camel by a rope.
Shit.
There is no man.
"Wow, that's crazy."
What people see and what they think they see are often two different things.
How can we put so much weight on what a witness saw in a flash in the middle of the night?
"Trick question or whatever, the fact is you don't admit to murder if you didn't do it."
They wore him down until he believed what they told him to believe.
- I want another vote.
Judd?
Okay.
All those favoring guilty?
"Hey, Jean."
Yeah?
- Did you clear out my messages?
Johnny's build.
It might be Johnny.
It might not.
No hardware on him?
Wilson had a wristwatch.
Nothing.
He'd been cleaned as though somebody didn't want him identified.
"The only thing was a hunk of melted gold, like a tooth."
Only it's big f or a tooth and it's got some black stuff on it.
Black enamel and gold.
Johnny's senior society pin.
"So, Johnny had taken his last jump."
- What's it look like to you?
- Gold bullet?
Are you kidding?
That's an idea.
The newspaper boys will go f or that.
Kincaid would check with Missing Persons and find out I'd never been there but I wasn't worrying about that.
"I was thinking, now I won't have to say goodbye to Johnny."
I remembered him in Berlin.
The crazy song he always sang.
"I used to say, ""You drive me nuts with it. "" Yeah."
"Why, I used to say to him--"
"Let's just say I remembered Johnny, laughing, tough and lonesome."
Let's just say that.
But I knew all at once I had a job.
They don't give out the Congressional Medal to guys wanted for murder but he was gonna get it.
I was going after whoever tried to gyp him out of it.
Why should anybody kill Johnny?
Because he hadn't shot Chandler and maybe knew who did?
There was a photo in the Gulf City Statesman.
"Louis Ord, a waiter at the Sanctuary Club."
Oh.
"Well, I-I guess we might have a minute."
Uh... is there...
anything you'd like to share with the students?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I got somethin'."
"They tell you you gotta learn your a-b-c's, but what they don't tell you is, you gotta learn them backwards while balancing on one foot with a flashlight in your face while some guy you went to high school with"
calls you a punk on account of he became a cop and you swerved a little and hit a fire hydrant.
Ha!
(Bell rings) Oh!
Look at that.
Time for lunch.
"Let's please form a line, uh, by the door."
Go!
(Children speaking indistinctly)
"Hey, come on."
I'll take you to lunch.
"Uh, I don't know."
I think I'm supposed to tell the principal if I leave the school.
"No, we don't need to bother the principal."
"You know, they don't want some stranger coming in, saying he's gonna take a small child. (Chuckles)"
Hmm.
"Bye, guys."
Gotta go.
Taking aunt Ginny to the movies.
"Of course, she calls it ""The Picture Show."""
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
(Door opens and closes) Isn't it nice how good mom is to the aunts?
(Scoffs and chuckles)
What?
You cannot be that big of an idiot.
You really have no idea where mom's going?
I love cats.
I used to have two cats.
"But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down."
[Captain Boots purring]
I'm joking.
"We've done several focus groups on the show, and what I've gleaned... the blond, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays."
Jenna.
That's my friend Jenna.
"And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49."
I'm not missing them.
They're just not there.
I think I can fix that.
"So, your job is you take things that are already working, and you fix them."
That's a great job.
"Why don't we, uh..."
You're missing that third kind of heat.
I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
"Okay, the black guy?"
The black movie star.
"I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining."
"Isn't he, um... crazy?"
Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
The important thing to remember is he was never charged with a crime.
It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof.
Nor should it be.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
I think I do.
What are you doing?
"No, I want you guys focused on possible external threats."
Let them do the babysitting.
You're supposed to be lead on this.
Don't let them push you around.
They're not.
You ready?

"Apparently George Salt left for work early yesterday morning for an emergency meeting,"

What time did he get to the office?
"And by ""champagne"" I mean wine, and by ""bottle"" I mean box."

We'll take it here.
Would there happen to be a 7 Eleven Merlot?
"Max, wine in our room sounds so much better."
We can relax and focus on each other for once.
"Mm, great."
What's the room number?
Oh.
I think she means oh-six.
I don't think so.
That room is still an active crime scene.

I know you killed Vera Blanchett... ..and let an innocent boy swing for it.
"I don't know what you're talking about, Father."
Your work took you to the Crown Court regularly.
That's where you met Vera.
"She was young, impressionable."
You were a Detective Sergeant.
How could she refuse you?
But she did.
"And that's when it went horribly, horribly wrong."
I presume Max is your middle name?
If you leave this restaurant I will call the police.
Was it your idea to pin Vera's murder onto Thomas?
"It was my boss's idea, and his boss's."
"To protect their reputation and the ""good name"" of the police?"
But I did nothing to stop them!
Did you poison Henry too?
What?
No!
Surely he needed to be silenced.
Thanks to Iris he knew that you were Vera's killer.
But I only just found that out from Mrs McCarthy.

Nine months ago.
You sleep with him that night?
No!
That's right--
I forgot you're from a good catholic family.
Did you sleep with him the second night?
Your husband never knew.
"I would tell him that I had a late showing, and I'd meet james at the house on larson lane."

I should have talked of the weather.
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.
Should I hide my regard?
- No.
But we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.
"Seven years is too little for some, seven days is enough for others."
- Or seven hours.
In this case.
- I feel I know him already.
"Had I more shallow feelings, I could perhaps conceal them as you do."
- I'm sorry...
"- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne."
I do not understand her.
Marianne...
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No.
Patience.
You're not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?

Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
It's weird how something has to happen sometimes... to see how you actually feel about something.

It means somebody's going to die.
How come we got to sit here in the dark like this?
Because I don't want to be a sitting duck if they show up out there.
I told you they won't be here until they call.
Where you going?
To get my cigarettes.
They're in my purse.
You can have one of mine.
"I smoke menthol, baby."
You know that.
I'll get them.
"I forgot that thing was even in there, baby."
Ray gave me that for protection.
I don't even know how it works.
You pull the damn trigger.
"Dale, what are you looking at me like this for?"
"What, did you think I was going to shoot you or something?"
That's crazy.
"Now can I have my cigarettes, please?"
"Can I have a light, baby?"

"Yeah, well, let's work quickly, Mr. Palmer, while we still can."
Abby said our dead fake air marshal's name is Norman Dopps.
Norman.
"There's a name, huh?"
"Well, the Normans were Vikings."
They settled on part of the coast of France.
"Yes, on what one day would become known as Normandy."
"See, now, that history is great, but I just couldn't do it to the little guy."
Norman is a bit too Psycho- ish.
You could always shorten it to Norm.
Norm?
Norm!
"Nah, see, I'd have to fight the urge to give the kid a beer."
Oh.
Here we go.
Ah.
Murder on the lavatory.
Bishop sent these in the second e-mail.
"Yeah, it's quite a... nasty and narrow puncture wound."
"From a plastic knife, or something that could get past security?"
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Something stronger, to pierce the rib cage."
A nylon dagger.
"Or carbon fiber, perhaps."
"And based on the incision, it seems to have been twisted, twisted on entry."
For maximum damage.
"Mm, clearly, an expert kill."
How soon till we get these up to Jethro?
Oh...
I can bring them on my tablet.
Do you know the meaning of the name Jethro?
- Sure.
And smiles.
Many people need it.
It's the British specialty.
And we must remember the Belgian spectators
That the current conflicts between Flanders and Wallonia
Are counterproductive.
- Unbearable.
The image of our king is the only force that unites us.
That's why it must be perfect.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
Excuse me.
- You are welcome.
Belgium.
Is it a real country or just a geopolitical compromise?
I do not know.
But he has a palace and a king.
"And a queen, who hired me to shoot a documentary about her husband,"
"Nicolas III, the King of the Belgians."
"Mr. Lloyd, I remember the rule number one: no interviews."
And rule number two:
No improvisations.
Sooner or later I would like to discuss this.
His contract speaks clearly.
Just follow the script.
"They did not know I was filming, which gave me hope."
Here's the boring part.
I follow their script and film the king who makes the king.
Have you been here already?
This is the first time.
But the scene serves to appreciate this unlikely story.
His own story.
Is my husband with you?
Have you found him?
You're the only one we've found so far.
What about your husband?
I don't know.
We ran into trouble... and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river.
"The ice broke, and - and then some of our dogs died."
Two days ago my husband went out to look for food... and he hasn't come back.
Do you think he's dead?
That's a pretty good guess.
What are we gonna do with her?
What can you do?
Take her to Dawson and leave her.
"You're forgetting one thing, pal."
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.
And they had the map - the original one.
"You'll find my husband for me, won't you?"
There's nothing we can do.
We're a thousand miles from nowhere.
"Either the cold got him, or the wolves."
- Get on the sled.
We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.
He isn't dead.
I
- I don't believe that.
"Hey, listen, lady, in this country when a guy is gone for two days, he's gone."
I refuse to go until I definitely know about my husband.
"If you don't wanna stay and look for him, you can go without me."
No!
No!
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at EST."
"No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan, but I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me."
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"Have a seat, please."
I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
"I think you can help with that, and I think you will help with that."
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
"I-I'll write you a check right now if you want, but... that's not why you're here."
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
"- Oh, just until I make one."
- What time is your appointment?
Why?
My teeth are straight.
To justify charging me more money that I don't have.
Robert Dumanjik from the District Attorney's office.
The District...
"Oh, yeah, okay, put him through."
- [telephone rings]
- Hello?
"Hi, Karen, This is Bob Dumanjik, We haven't met, I'm the,"
"- No, I know who you are."
"- Oh, good, good,"
"I understand that you're representing that suit against Atlantor,"
"Yes,"
"I wondered if we could talk about it,"
Talk about what exactly?
"Well, that's what we'd talk about,"
But I don't think that I understand.
"Well, we'd talk about that too, How about tomorrow?"
What is this about?
Should I be expecting a subpoena?
"Oh, no, no, I just think there are some things that are in our mutual interest to talk about,"
Let's say 10:00?
- Downtown?
"- If that's okay,"
- Okay.
"- Great, See you then,"
What was that about?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.
Does this much slate exist?
They'll have to dig up Rhode lsland to find this much.
How's he holding up?
Same as he always was.
"They wanna lock him up, he says, ""Yes, sir, lock me up. """
"They wanna put him on trial, he says, ""Yes, sir, put me on trial. """
He'd help tie the noose if they asked him to.
He's your father.
What's the matter with you?
When I was about 7 years old...
... ourownersdecidedtosell him and us kids away from our mother.
Put us on a wagon and we ended up going to Alabama.
She stayed behind in Georgia.
"And after a while, he had told me that she died."
"Now, I was just a little boy at the time, but all that time..."
... Iwaitedforhim tofind away  to keep our mother with us...
... oruswithher .
But he never said one word.
He didn't do anything.
"He didn't argue, he didn't even beg."
He didn't put up one damn ounce of fight to keep our family together.
Harsh.
He should have done something.
What are you doing with all that string?
Keeping my mind busy.
What's a white lady doing in jail?
My own son locked me up.
Sometimes they don't rightly appreciate what you do for them.
Truer words were never spoken.
[EZRA chuckling ]
"Well, well."
"My, my."
"It's a touch baroque, but I like what you've done with the place."
-What do you want?
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't...
see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal -- they were fake."
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those... kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
Thank you.
Pushing more dye.
"Oh yeah, there we go."
Look at the shape there.
All squished up like a Takotsubo vase.
like a Takotsubo vase.
"See that, that's textbook."
"Um, Nik..."
"What you got baby, you got a broken heart."
"- Oh Sam, don't..."
"- No, baby."
"No, I'm serious, baby."
You have stress cardiomyopathy.
"Yeah, it's also called broken heart syndrome."
"It's associated with sudden, intense emotional or physical stress."
The muscles around your heart took such a beating when you got the news about Stephanie that they're just having a hard time keeping up now.
You really do have a broken heart.
But we can treat this.
"I can't lie to you, we've got to go through this entire night incident-free."
"If we can do that, you're gonna be fine."
Hey!
We need a doctor!
What the hell happened?
Kid started complaining of a sore throat in the car.
"- Started wheezing, choking..."
- Let's get him on the bed.
Pike!
No verbal or motor responses.
What the hell is...
That's bruising around his neck!
Looks fresh.
Sats at 90 and falling.
And I think one of these men either has the coins or knows where they are.
Our deal was for me to find Marquesa.
"Well, I did that."
"These coins, however, present a whole new business opportunity."
So you want to be my partner?
This is the guy Marquesa went after.
That's him coming out of his condo.
I got names and addresses on all of them.
You need me.
Not anymore.
[Snarls]
[Growling]
[Beeps]
"So, Mr. Adams, you must have found something that wasn't good for you."
Adalind?
"Hi, Juliette."
I'm glad you remember me.
Of course I remember you.
"Well, I just wasn't sure if I should come by since things didn't work out with Hank, you know."
"Oh, stop."
I don't take my patients based on their owners' social lives.
"I'm glad you came in, and I'm glad you brought your cat."
"Well, I am relieved to hear that because Majique"
- seems to be pretty sick.
"- Oh, no."
What seems to be the problem with miss Majique?
She's just not herself.
She's sluggish.
She won't eat.
I'm pretty worried.
Do you think it's serious?
"Well, I hope not, but I'm probably going to want to keep her overnight to run some tests."
The midwife was Joanne Braxton.
She stole the dead woman's child?
It's the only birth she attended that fits with Roland's age.
And then she and her husband left the area shortly after.
What about Roland's father?
Is he still alive?
He is.
He was working out of the province at the time of his wife's death.
He never questioned the official report.
My God!
No one knows the baby exists.
No one misses him.
No one mourns him.
"He is yours, Julia."
Is this good news or bad?
What would William say?
He still doesn't know.
Keeping a secret this profound from him would be a betrayal of the trust between us.
But if I tell him...
He will feel duty-bound to return Roland to his father.
So leaving him in blissful ignorance could be the better path.
If you think you can do that.
Sir?
I found a missing persons' report that matches our victim.
- Who is it?
- A Hugo de Jaager.
Left his family home in Peterborough for Toronto a week ago.
Hasn't been heard from since.
- What's all this?
"- Sir, this is his research."
He told his mother before he left he was sure he was going to find her this time.
"- ""Her""?"
That's true‎.
Do you know the Helcats‎?
Yes‎.
I spent two years training maneuvers in the field with 827‎.
I came here and started to be in action in November‎.
Does the 827‎?
Seriously‎?
It is part of Division 12‎.
Correct‎.
So where did they get the Helcats‎?
‎
- I have no idea‎.
Only appeared in March‎. ‎
- Marzo‎?
"We were in Togans for most of the war and then change us by M18‎, just 2 weeks of training maneuvers‎."
Why‎?
Helcats is that we removed in February and look at this log ‎.‎.‎.
and it seems quite familiar‎.
Seriously‎?
"¿Oye‎, Simms‎?"
What‎?
Think you telling the truth‎?
Which part‎?
Do you think your Helkath was run by a bunch of black guys‎?
No‎.
He's lying‎.
I know why I do not like‎.
¿Fuistes you who assaulted the officer with an ax‎?
I know some white soldiers assigned to your battalion‎.
You hear all kinds of crazy stories‎.
Always leave the Helcats unguarded‎.
"They are always looking for pissing places to sleep‎, hide‎."
- Isabel.
- Isabel.
"- Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter I wish to discuss with you."
"Um, Nurse Oaks?"
"- Yes, Madam?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse Oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
- It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"- Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.
"The gardens are lovely, don't you think?"
- Roderick.
"- They're quite nice, I must admit."
"- Yes, indeed."
- What order shall be taken
- with the prisoners?
- Shoot them in the head.
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.
Where the evil which thou has driven to mingle with my being will slip away like a dream.
"- Lucy, this is not a good time."
- Like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers... which will no longer taint my breath in the Garden of Eden.
- Is that Hawthorne?
- What do you mean?
"- You were quoting one of Mr. Hawthorne's Twice-Told T ales, were you not?"
- I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"- There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, Nurse Oaks."
The plan worked.
I did it once.
I can do it again because I believe in myself.
"- No, granddad, my point is..."
"- Less talk, more training!"
Let's go!
"The more you fight, the more he fights."
"It's your ego, granddad."
You're the problem.
"I'm rising to the challenge, redeeming my honor!"
That's a nice way to say you want payback.
What's the opposite of a nigga?
- I don't know.
- Think about it.
- Mr. Rogers?
- Perfect.
Can you imagine Mr. Rogers in a nigga moment?
Of course not!
"So to end a nigga moment, you have to be Mr. Rogers, and what would Mr. Rogers do?"
He would follow normal white-people rules.
So if Stinkmeaner confronted Mr. Rogers in a parking lot...
"Oh, yeah, he wouldn't fight."
He would walk away and call the police.
And if he keeps coming back?
"File a complaint, get a restraining order."
"Eventually, they would put Stinkmeaner in jail."
"But then he has to snitch, and then I got to live with that shame!"
"Yes, dumb idea, Huey."
Stinkmeaner get away with beating me in front of everyone!
I never get redemption!
But it ends.
You're saying that I should just let him get away with beating me in front of the whole world?
"Uh, Anezka and her friends are trade-show models for the tournament this weekend."
They're here to take publicity photos with the team.
You're police.
Did Joey do something wrong?
NG:
"No, we just..."
We're clearing up a misunderstanding.
"Hey, why don't you, uh, go hang out with the team, okay?"
I'll be right there.
"So, you were talking about why you were angry with O.G."
Right.
"Yeah, I was angry with him."
But I had no reason to kill him.
I won.
Tendu signed with Team ProFine.
"Now, O.G. was furious, okay?"
"He kept badgering Tendu to change his mind, but..."
Something wrong?
"Tendu was supposed to be here by now, for the publicity photos."
"Called him, like, an hour ago, but he didn't answer."
"Wait, you don't think whoever tried to kill O.G."
"went after him, also?"
We can't rule anything out.
You know where he was staying?
I could send a car to check on him.
"We need to talk to him, too."
"I don't know for sure, but I bet he was at the same hotel as O.G."
There was only one room registered under O.G.'s name.
Then try looking under Tendu's real name.
I only learned it when we were drawing up the contracts.
It's Marcel Otolik.
O-T-O-L-I-K.
"Now I hear people say, ""But Ellsberg did itforthe good ofthe country."""
"You know, ""The people's rightto know."" You know."
"Well, well, neverthe case,"
"Alger Hiss said the same damn thing, and so did the Rosenbergs."
Look what happened to them.
[Imitates Electrical Charge]
Old Sparky got'em.
"They always underestimated old Nixon, see."
We're gonna fight just as dirty.
"This is sudden death, gentlemen."
"We're gonna getthem on the ground, stick in our spikes... and twistand showthem no mercy."
"So, uh, starting today, no one in this room talks to the press, uh, withoutchecking first with Mr. Haldeman here."
"And, uh, thatmeans, Ron, a complete freeze on the New York Times, CBS,"
"PBS, Jack Anderson and the Washington Post."
"Um, Mr. Haldeman is the chief high executionerfrom now on, so don'tyou come whining to me when he tells you to do something."
"That's me talking, okay?"
"And ifyou do come to me, I'll be tougherthan he is."
"Anyone who screws with us, his fucking head comes off."
You gotthat?
"Well, thank you very much, gentlemen, and, uh, good day to you."
- [Nixon] History will never be the same.
- [Man Speaking Spanish]
- We're taking a step into the future.
"- Liddy, give them the folder."
- We have changed the world.
"- Five, ten."
- Let's see whatelse you got.
[Anthem]
[ShutterClicking]
"- I mustsay, you look very good."
- [TranslatorSpeaking Chinese]
- [Speaking Chinese] - [Translator] Looks can be deceiving.
She won the money.
Maybe they have joint bank accounts.
"Yeah, or maybe he wants Craig for something else."
You know what?
Freeze their accounts.
"I want thorough backgrounds on Dawkins, Craig and Dana."
Run their names through NCIC.
"Chin, what about the phone you found?"
Dawkins got it from the car he stole.
But the call history was erased.
"He must have made some phone calls, reached out to the phone company and sure enough, two calls were made right after the escape."
The first one went to a local woman named Sofia Archuleta.
Archuleta.
"That's, uh, Dawkins girlfriend."
Warden said she's a regular visitor.
She's the first one he's going to for help.
What about the other call?
"That one was made to a local lightweight ex-con by the name of Makani Huku, they spoke for three minutes."
"Kono, follow up on the call with Makani, find out what they were talking about."
"Chin, pull Dawkins' jacket."
See if we find any links on Dana and Craig.
Easy.
- We need to get an address for Sofia.
I'll get it.
You should change your shirt.
You look like an animal.
"You should go apologize to your sister, she's been sitting there for five hours."
"Thanks, buddy."
I'll take it from here.
"Mary, I'm sorry."
You okay?
Yeah.
It won't happen again.
You're damn right it won't!
Next time something like that happens the little girl is coming out of the window with a bullet in her head.
ERIC:
Mary.
"Oh, what the hell, Ray?"
Leave the little girl alone.
You stay right there.
You sad little man.
Who do you think you are?
God?
You shut up.
"He's not God, Dorothy."
He's just a poor excuse for a man.
A man without any faith.
Faith?
You're gonna talk to me about faith?
"God comes down and, pluck, there goes your son, no more Luke."
Bye-bye.
Why?
"Dale, why?"
Because He's up in His Heaven and all's right with the world?
Or because we live in a stinking sewer where nothing makes one bit of sense?
RAY:
But you have faith.
"Your son dies for no reason, but you have faith."
"You get taken and tortured, but you have faith."
( Ray laughs )
"If I didn't, then I wouldn't have any reason to go on living."
"Then you crawl away and you die, because this right here-- this is as much sense as the world will ever make."
What are you doing?
I told you I didn't want anyone killed.
"- mom, i told uncle bob -- - i don't care."
please don't leave me alone here with her.
"- these bullies are hassling tim again, and just because someone had him kick them in the nuts."
"- well, that's not my fault!"
it's his dingdong haircut and his silly eyeglasses that make him get in trouble!
- mom!
"- oh, you know what i mean."
come on.
"i'm your mother, and you're staying right here."
damn kids!
- dang kids.
- da-- dang kids.
"[chuckles] yeah, they're always listening to their friends and not their parent."
"- it, um, appears the only items you have in your refrigerator are two cans of cheese-please and a liter of pop?"
"- yeah, it's -- it's grocery day."
- it's grocery day!
it's grocery day.
"look, i know these kids."
"they -- they eat a full balanced diet 'cause they're still growing and crap, so..."
- oh.
so you do have a job?
- no!
working's for suckers!
- [chuckles] - skoal!
"- i'm, actually -- um, i'm, like, in this transitional phase right now."
- i've seen enough.
"[door creaks] uh, who is she?"
i-i don't have her on my list.
- oh.
"um, she ain't really mine."
"see, her daddy is my friend with benefits."
so she just comes around here sometimes.
I told them I was on sabbatical.
"Uh, where was I?"
When did I get back?
What the hell is a sabbatical?
"Relax, they're not coming to see you."
"They're going straight to school, say hi to Ritchie and be out of there before their beers get warm."
Don't answer that.
"Hi, we're not home right now, so leave a message for Christine,"
"- Ritchie, - and... say it."
Matthew.
"Oh, come on."
"Hey, it's me, just thought I'd true you again."
"Get that, I'll wait."
I'm at the door.
She's coming.
"I didn't want to just stop by, but it was either this or drop leaflets on your lawn from a plane, so, here I am."
I was going to return your calls but I've been super-duper busy.
"Yeah, since Witch Detective took off, we hardly see her anymore."
Get out.
Come on in.
"What-what, um, what are you doing here?"
"Well, I can't stop thinking about our date."
I thought it... it was great.
"But then, when you didn't call me back, I thought maybe it wasn't great."
"And then I started thinking about the other things I thought were great, and maybe they weren't great either."
I-Is baseball great?
Is democracy great?
I-I don't know anymore.
"No, it was;"
it was a great date.
So let's go on another one.
"Oh, I don't know."
"All right, off to bed."
It's late.
Smells like a giant jock strap.
Maybe 30 years ago it would've been fine.
"Oh, my Lord."
"Okay listen, honey, try not to touch anything or breathe deeply."
There he is.
Should have worn a hazmat suit.
Those are some extremely nice skates for rentals.
We don't open till 10:00.
"You're Shayne Baker, right?"
Girl's league MVP?
I hear you're pretty good.
"What do you say, maybe sometime, you and me, we could go scrimmage."
I am good for girl's league.
Maybe you should just go scrimmage yourself.
Okay.
It's a very generous offer!
More than this place is worth.
This ice has decades of history for the town.
I'm not going to just sell it off because you wanna put some office building here.
"Well, actually, I was thinking more of a boutique mall and day-spa."
"Rick, history only matters if people care, and no one does around here any more."
This town belongs to me.
"And one way or another this ancient scrap heap you call an ice rink will be mine, too."
So think about my offer.
"Let's go, Kain."
Stay away from her.
"- Now, Kain!"
- All right.
"Well, Dad?"
- I said no.
From my days in Monte Carlo.
"You been to Monte Carlo, Sam?"
No.
Have you ever been to Pahrump?
[Both Chuckle] Exactly how long have you been planning this?
"Ages, gumdrop."
"Now let's run along, shall we?"
"You know, I'd thought you had your work cut out since Mr. Wu's departure."
"It's so unfortunate, this haunting."
I had no idea when I had that newspaper delivered to him that it would upset him so much.
"[Chuckles] So, you had the newspaper delivered."
"- Oh, I'll get that."
- I'll have those then.
Hmm.
Knipex.
"If I held on to these, would you die a slow and painful death?"
"Well, if I did, you wouldn't be able to say you were Vegas's top host."
"Yes, but it suddenly doesn't seem so important, compared to your certain suffering and demise."
You'd rather kill me than compete against me?
"That's pathetic, really."
Honestly thought you were better than this.
I am better than this.
[Wind Howling]
[Siren Wailing In Distance]
[Phone Beeps]
Hello.
"Hey, Mike."
Yeah.
"Sorry to disappoint you, but it's not a ghost."
It's just a dislodged cable.
"Uh, must be the wind."
"- Yeah, right."
Don't you remember what you used to say to me?
You swore you'd wait for me.
"She was convenient for you, wasn't she, because she was here."
You took very good care of Mother and Zina.
Very good care.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
I'll leave you to each other.
Are you alright?
"Yes, thank you."
"Oh, wait."
Take me to the police station.
Your name?
Clementi Sabourin.
What do you want?
I have some valuable information.
Information?
Concerning whom?
"Concerning a very rich man... who is in this country illegally, forged papers."
I'm sure you'll know what to do with his very considerable assets.
Anything we impound goes to the government.
Naturally.
What's this man's name?
"If I tell you, I want the necessary papers to take me to America."
If you are telling the truth... it will be arranged.
Alright.
He's living here under the name of Gerry Monte.
His real name is Sabourin.
He's originally from Czechoslovakia.
He runs a little antique shop near the Porta San Giuseppe.
Treasures stolen from all over the world.
Thank you.
"He thinks you are planning an attack at the school with someone, he doesn't know it's with me."
What are we doing here?
I'm getting you safe.
Nicole Carter
"Isaac's not on anyone's books, he's got guns, he's got men, he can protect you."
You think because he's your brother he's just gonna forget what happened?
"There is something inside that box and they're after it, so where is it?"
Ben Grimes
What is it?
It's a list.
Sleeper cells.
"These codes go out, they launch attacks all over the country."
Where's the chip?
"Government wants this list,"
They're gonna have to pay up.

"Rebecca,"
It's Carter.
Ben got away.
Please tell me you're still tracking him.
"We were, he left the construction site heading east, but we lost him on 13th."
"Fortunately, this yet to be completed formula... was stolen by a Jewish Scientist, who intended to sell it to the Americans."
"Since the Jew's nanny taught him Mandarin, and to evade attention, the deal was carried out in H.K."
"They cold named the formula the ""Beast""."
"On knowing this, Hitler sent 2 Gastapos to H.K."
"To catch the ""Beast""."
Nothing can stop the world from rotating.
But there are always exceptions.
"You're always so fast, only takes you less than a minute."
"That's simple enough, even a dog can do it."
Someone's at the door!
- Who's turn?
"- Yours, of course!"
Give me a hand!
Hold on!
- O.K?
- O.K.!
"Hello, this is Yoyo Private Eye's, I'm Super..."
No...
I'm the Great Super Yoyo?
What?
Your No.8 concubine has walked out on you?
"Such a simple case, why bother me?"
Wait till all 8 of them walk out on you!
What?
The Mayor inviting me to dinner?
Haven't got time!
I wouldn't be Yoyo if I can be so easily invited.
"Old man, what can I do for you?"
I've come to connect the telephone.
"Oh yes, you haven't paid the bill for 6 mouths."
I spent all my savings yesterday to pay for it.
Smart girl.
How did you get to do this?
Writing I mean.
Parfitt.
He's making comedies for Baker.
Used to click gangs of heard into me sung in the pub.
Many a time.
He'll think you were born into purpose.
Certainly spent enough time in 'em as a kid.
He was a soldier.
In and in the last one.
"The thing about men who get sent away to war, Mrs.Cole, is that some of them don't come back at all... some come back as heroes... and some of them come back drunk squalid bullies."
I was better off it this way.
In the pub?
Or the pictures.
I liked the pictures best.
Once in a while you just need to make one that's worth it.
Worth...the hour and a half of someones life that's gonna see it.
Ah!
I really thought this one would be.
Bloody Yanks.
Hm.
Would be alright if all we had to do is look at him.
We strip him down to the essentials and use a voice-over.
"I wasn't there at the beginning of the story, but it all began in a little fishing village in Englo..."
Yes.
Yes.
"Inarticulacy, authenticity."
He's too cut out.
Nah!
No.
He really can't.
But Hilliard can.
I always asked them if they wanted coffee.
"Some of the wives, like Mickey Conway used to curse at them and spit on the floor."
She used to spit on her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.
It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.
"♪ ""Happy birthday to you"" ♪"
We always did everything together and we always were in the same crowd.
"Anniversaries, christenings."
We only went to each other's houses.
The women played cards.
"And when the kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy were always the first at the hospital."
And when we went to the Islands or Vegas for vacation we always went together.
No outsiders ever.
It got to be normal.
It got to where I was even proud that I had the kind of husband that was willing to go out and risk his neck just to get us the little extras.
But I got Mom to watch the babies tomorrow night.
"-Can't do it, Karen."
-Why not?
I just can't do it. I got something lined up.
"Yeah, but tomorrow night's the only night she can do it."
-Pretty please?
"-Karen, I can't do it."
What do you want me to do?
-l got to go.
-Wait a minute.
"I wanted to go shopping, can I get some money?"
How much do you need?
That much.
This much...
Give me a kiss.
See you later.
Oh...all right.
"- You're a long way from home, Ray."
"- Yes, so are you."
But I'm not the one who's been ruffling feathers.
Where did you hear that?
I got a call from Director Hendricks who heard of a Michigan senator who was responding to a call from a local mover and shaker.
Marcus Van Sciver.
Is that the guy you've been accusing of killing people?
I didn't accuse him of anything.
But this has to do with that local cop that you've been chasing.
"Starts there, I don't know where it's gonna end."
"It's gonna end right here, Ray."
Right here.
"It's time to fold up the tent, people are tired of the sideshow, Ray."
You're asking for my gun?
Do I have to ask?
- Do you have a spare?
- No.
I'm gonna believe that.
Is there something else?
What?
Van Sciver isn't human.
"Ok Ray, I've gonna get..."
"No, you have to believe me, I've seen things."
- I don't buy this...
"- No, listen to me!"
There's a conspiracy here.
And it goes way back.
"I, I'm not sure who it involves, but these... these people, these things..."
"Hey, I'm gonna make you promise, hey look at me, look at me in my eyes!"
"We're gonna go home, you're gonna get to talk to..."
I'm not talking to another doctor!
Talk to Hendricks.
- I didn't know the map was a swindle.
- You and your emeralds.
You ought to be put in a padded cell.
"If we'd found them emeralds, we could've left the army... and lived like dukes."
See?
That's the fellow that sold me the map.
Just a minute.
"Let me take care of him, will you?"
Take your hands off that man.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
"Speak up, MacChesney."
Speak up!
"We were swindled, sir."
- We?
- Who swindled you?
We don't want to make any charges until we have further proof.
Further proof?
You practically wrecked a village.
"You surely didn't do that, MacChesney, without proof?"
"Sir, we had our suspicions."
Suspicions of what?
Come on.
I've no time to wheedle the story out of you.
We bought a map.
Go on.
"From a private in a certain Scottish regiment, sir."
"No, I did it."
"I bought the map myself, sir."
"Now, listen."
"Don't you try to shield your friends, Cutter."
And it won't do you two any good to hide behind Cutter's generosity.
Out with it.
MAN:
Careful!
It looks like there are four of these shrine covers before we get to the sarcophagus.
We still can't really work out how they ever got them in.
Getting them out without damage is proving to be the devil's own job.
Excuse me one moment.
"- So, can we repair this thing?"
"- Well, I'd like to see what Lucas thinks."
What's this?
Oh...
We found those yesterday in the treasury.
Mace thinks they're almost full-term.
The one on the left is a little girl.
You can still make out some of the hair on her scalp.
I think they're the saddest things I've ever found.
HOWARD:
I'm sorry.
(Operatic music playing)
- Mr Adamson.
- Mr Carter.
- You like Verdi?
"- Not particularly, sir."
But I find he's more effective than any guard dog.
The locals like him even less.
A lot of men would be nervous about sleeping overnight in a tomb.
"Yeah, the dead are dead."
I don't bother them and they don't bother me.
"Going well, sir?"
"To be honest, I'm a little disappointed."
"Oh, yes, sir?"
I thought I'd found him.
(Exhales deeply)
- Lauren.
"- Oh, my God."
Don't get me started on that girl.
How could you be so cold and frigid?
- She's like a freaking speculum.
- She's here.
"Hi, Kenzi."
Hey.
"You know, as your doctor I should recommend against excessive intoxication."
Who's drunk?
"Well, we don't know the effects of cocktails on your abilities."
"Well, I am not a guy, so I can promise you booze does not affect my ability to perform."
"I wouldn't wanna be on the receiving end of a drunken Succubus booty call, so take it easy."
- No promises.
Keep an eye on her.
"Okay, I don't know if it's from the buckthorn hallucinations but that was some serious sparkage."
- I think she likes you.
"- No, it doesn't matter."
"It doesn't matter, because Lauren is human."
"I sleep with her, and she dies."
This guy-
"- This guy on the other hand, he has sexual chi to burn."
He's right behind you.
A woman as lovely as yourself shouldn't be alone.
"Well, I'm not."
There's two of you.
I'm Samir.
- Bo.
- I know.
Everybody knows.
"The one who won't choose a side, neither light nor dark."
Exciting.
It's called angioplasty.
- Sign for me.
- Cath lab will be ready in 30 minutes.
- He's a hot MI.
- They' re finishing a pacer.
"While they' re messing around, he's killing heart cells."
- It'll give us time to medicate.
- V-tach.
- Like I said.
- Charge paddles to 200.
- No pulse.
Starting compressions.
"- Abby, open an intubation tray."
Let's get Cardiology in here!
"And, clear."
The doctors there will give you antibiotics.
"Lynn got her tattoo in NewYork, right?"
"It was a Japanese master, in the classical style:"
Hiromitsu.
Classical style?
The classical era of Japanese tattoos was between the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Japanese have little interest in naked bodies.
The purity of virgin skin means nothing to them.
The Hiromitsu
He only did 12 tattoos.
This is Lynn's.
Number 3.
They are true works of art.
The Japanese passion for tattoos
led people to collect skin.
Collectors bought pictures from the living and waited for them to die.
Skin collectors.
"Hey, kid, over here."
"Hey, uh, listen."
You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do
"- I think, you need to ease off a little bit."
- Huh?
"Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you but actually they all getting really annoyed."
They are?
"Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a thirdgrader but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy."
I don't blame them.
"All that singing and dancing, I can't stand it."
You don't like doing it?
It's just don't me.
What I really wanna do is just-- play basketball.
- Basketball?
- I love it.
Always have.
I've missed a game on TV.
When my dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
Dude.
You should do that.
"You should join the basketball team, right now."
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want."
- Really?
- When you grow up into a fourthgrader you'll understand that you'll have to be tough and direct with your parents.
Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.
Isabel.
"Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter"
I wish to discuss with you.
"Um, nurse oaks?"
"- Yes, madame?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.
"The gardens are lovely, don't you think?"
Roderick.
"They're quite nice, I must admit."
"Yes, indeed."
What order shall be taken with the prisoners?
Shoot them in the head.
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.
Where the evil which thou has driven to mingle with my being will slip away like a dream.
"Lucy, this is not a good time."
"Like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers, which will no longer taint my breath in the garden of Eden."
Is that hawthorne?
What do you mean?
"You were quoting one of Mr. hawthorne's twice-toldtales, were you not?"
I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, nurse oaks."
It won't happen again.
You're like the good-looking guy from high school who knows how cute he is and just won't take no for an answer.
"I've got your black Mercedes,"
I'm sending you the grid coordinates and imagery now.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"Next leave, beers are on me, okay?"
"Oh, you are not getting off that easy."
You got her to use a military recon satellite and then you made a date?
I'm a multi-tasker.
Impressive.
"There, address that."
He just pulled in to Makani Kai Aviation.
It's a helicopter tour operator.
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
- Fly.
"Please, I'm begging you."
We didn't do any...
- Will you shut up?
"- Hey, where do you wanna go?"
There's an airport on the north side of Molokai.
Get me there and I'll let them go.
- Danny.
Dawkins has hostages.
"No, no."
"According to Makani Kai Aviation, their bird took off with a pilot and a family of three coming back from a tour."
"- Chin, where's your friend?"
- On his way as we speak.
"Danny, contact Honolulu approach."
"Get me the direction that island bird is headed, okay?"
- You got it.
- Good.
"- Hey, it's all good, bro, mahalo."
- No problem.
"If it wasn't on a boat, I don't want it."
Stop buying things from Italy.
You are not a millionaire.
We
- We are not millionaires.
"The first thing we gotta do is find a reliable, non-asthmatic person... to cash in this ticket A.S.A.P., or we're dead."
Funny you should mention that.
- I think I have another candidate.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Who?
This guy that I was seeing when I was waitressing at the racetrack.
I think he still works there too.
A real sweet guy.
"Bought me a really expensive parrot, too, from Brazil or something."
My cat bit its head off.
"You hated that fucking bird, didn't you, sweetie?"
"The racetrack, eh."
"Well, actually, he's an unofficial employee."
He injects horses with some shit that makes them run faster.
Forget it.
Cross him offthe list.
Forget him.
Who else?
"There is Scatter, the guy who installed my carpet."
- I went to high school with him.
- The man's name is Scatter?
"Yeah, well, he's a total coke freak, which could work in our favor because he usually needs money."
"No, junkies are problematic."
Let's keep thinking.
Mm-hmm.
- Wanna have sex?
"- Oh, yeah."
Get rid of him.
John!
What are you doing?
"Well, this way you can have the flat all to yourself."
"John mate, please."
I've changed a lot since then.
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please!"
John!
Please!
What you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
That's the only thing that should be on your mind just now.
Do you think that I won't do it?
All right.
"Next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it."
There's some goodie bags in your room and other essentials.
"Are you gonna tell me who you are, then?"
"No, you'll have to wait until tomorrow now."
ATT:
JOHN MERCER
That one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
It's red and don't be so cheeky.
I thought you'd be bursting with curiosity about the new recruit.
When do I get to meet him?
"Oh, wait, when you decide the time is right."
You know me so well.
You're not scared he'll do a runner?
"No, he's not that stupid."
"So, when do you put him to work?"
Fortunately I do happen to have a case for him.
Good.
So we wanted to also widen the track width of this car.
This car's eight inches wider than a C6 Corvette.
So the track width and the turn-in and everything is so much better.

MATT FARAH:
"Removing the complete carbon and fiberglass body work takes two men only six minutes, revealing a skeleton that is more NASCAR than Woodward Avenue."
A tube frame chassis with every bit of racing technology you would ever need lurks underneath.
There's an adjustable brake bias with two master cylinders powering 14-inch Brembo brakes.
"There's a 28-gallon fuel cell, beefed-up [INAUDlBLE] suspension, and a triple-disc clutch."
"It has modular front and rear frame components, which means if you crash, you can replace the entire front or rear section for less than five figures in your own garage."
"Thanks to the ease of access, one man can change a clutch or transmission in under an hour."
"There's ducting, cooling, tons of down force, and massive square-stance 305 section slick tires."
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"Most people think of a race car as a Rolex or a World Challenge 253 $100,000 race car."
"We wanted to develop a track day car for $60,000-- a fraction of the money-- that will compete with those."
MATT FARAH:
And Wayne should know-- he benchmarked the GT1 against his LG Motorspots World Challenge car.
"And without the restrictions World Challenge cars face, the"

"We've taken our years of race car experience and developed an extremely fast, reliable, affordable race car that will compete with the top cars out in a track day."

Let's see if we can take the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x power.
"And you might say, hold on a second."
We know how to take the derivative of e to the x.
But what about a base like 2?
We don't know what to do with 2.
And the key here is to rewrite 2 to the x so that we essentially have it as e to some power.
And the key there is to rewrite 2.
So how can we rewrite 2 so it is e to some power?
"Well, let's think about what e to the natural log of 2 power is."
The natural log of 2 is the power that I would have to raise e to to get to 2.
"So if we actually raise e to that power, we are going to get to 2."
"So what we could do, instead of writing 2 to the x, we could rewrite this as e."
"We could rewrite 2 as e to the natural log of 2, and then raise that to the x power."
So this is the x power in yellow.
And so let's do that right over here.
"So instead of taking the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x, let's say, let's just take the derivative with respect to x of the exact same expression rewritten, of e to the natural log of 2 raised to the x power."
"Let me put this x in that same color, dx."
"Now we know from our exponent properties if we raise something to some power, and then raise that to another power, we can take the product of the two powers."
Let me rewrite this just to remember.
"If I have a to b, and then I raise that to the c power, this is the exact same thing as a to the b times c power."
"The good news is, that you'll get feedback immediately from the computer as you're taking them."
"And, and for the assignments, you have the whole week."
"Whereas for the final, I'll let you know how much time you have."
"The real good news however, is because I'm interested in you learning rather than just testing you just once and saying, forget about it."
This guy or gal doesn't know something.
"I'm more interested in what you know, rather than what you don't know."
So I'll give you two attempts at each of one of these.
"Each assignment two attempts, final two attempts."
"But you have to finish within the deadlines, both attempts."
Otherwise you cannot.
The score cannot count.
"We have to have some criteria, right?"
"Now, dealing with me or the teaching assistant and this is one of the things that I think is a little bit of a disadvantag e in the online class."
This class is really large.
I do not want to get into the numbers because I want you to think of this class as just for you and I mean I think that's the beauty of online class.
So it's a
"large class, what can't we do?"
"I would encourage you, please don't attempt to contact me, or my teaching assistant Nathan Brown."
And the reason is you can easily find our emails and shoot an email.
"It's not that, we don't love you."
I love you all.
"There's a heart that beats in each one of you and that's my requirement for loving, you know."
"And in fact even plants have lives, right?"
"So, but in anyway, I'm coming back to the basics."
"I cannot afford to answer emails and Nathan cannot, because it would become unmanageable at our end."
So we encourage you not to try to contact us.
So what will we do?
We'll provide all the resources on a weekly basis.
"They'll come, you'll know what you want, you'll know exactly what, what's needed to be done and the teaching assistant, Nathan, will monitor the class for any errors, and so on, so forth."
But our goal is to make this class self-sufficient.
How?
"There's only one teaching assistant, and only one of me."
These URLs are eligible for the feature because they come in key value pairs or name value pairs.
"What it looks like is ""key equals value"" and then perhaps an ampersand."
"And then ""key two equals value two."" And Google, when we see these parameters will treat this URL as equivalent to this URL."
Because the ordering in the parameters doesn't matter.
URLs that are ineligible for this feature are those that don't use the key value configuration.
So if a site uses a bunch of plus signs to separate their parameters.
Or they just use a directory structure.
Or they use their own type of encoding.
None of these types of URLs can actually be used.
Because this feature requires the name value pairs.
Alright.
I know that was a long intro.
But now let's get started with the feature.
Step one is to specify parameters that don't change the page's content.
"So you can ask yourself,"
"""Do I have parameters that don't affect page content?"" Things like a session ID."
An affiliate
ID.
Or a tracking ID.
These types of parameters don't change page content.
"And so in the feature, you can actually mark them as ""does not change content."" And once you've said that, Webmaster"
Tools will put one representative URL as the setting.
And then Googlebot will act accordingly.
"Once step one is completed for all the parameters that don't actually change page-content, then"
let's move on to step two.
Which comes in two parts.
The first part is to specify the parameters that change page content.
So you'll select.
"""Yes, this changes, reorders, or ""narrows"" page content."" And then you can have a type of page content effect."
"Whether that sorts,"
"""narrows"", specifies, etcetera."
And we'll cover more of this in depth.
I'm not sure what I've seen.

"Now, I'd like to ask you about what happens as the number of flips or events, in general, becomes a very large number."
Check all that apply.
The probability of every individual sequence becomes small
The probability of every number of heads becomes small.
"So for example, does the probability of having one head or hundred heads or million heads, any specific number does that becomes small."
"Does the probability of every given proportion, for example, one head out of 100 flips, 10 heads out of 100 flips or 1500 heads out of a billion flips becomes small."
Does every given range of proportions have a smaller and smaller probability.
Are there some ranges of proportions for which the probability becomes small as we have many flips.
Check all that apply.
"Also, assume that the probability of heads is neither 0 or 1."
"That is, we can get both heads and tails from this coin."

How to make giant soap bubbles
"We prepare a mixture of water, Marseilles soap, paper glue, sugar and a little of glycerine."
"This mixture is poured into a flat bottom container, where we dip a hoop and then lift it."
"Better than any comment, the video shows the successful development of the experiment in front of a young audience."
"The soap and sugar in the mixture has reduced the surface tension of water, which allows to create thin films of a huge surface and that can last long."

2 - with 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 zeros to the right.
Definitely significant because there is a decimal point in the number.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9.
9 total significant figures here.
"And finally, the number here."
Zeros to the left of significant digits are never significant.
"Zeros to the right - these three will be significant because of that decimal point, which means that there is a total of six significant digits in this number."
"So to quickly review our three main cases - zero sandwiched between non-zero significant digits - always significant. zeros to the left, or coming before non-zero digits - never significant. and if zeros come to the right of non-zero significant digits, they're only significant if there's a decimal place in the answer."
So - now I hope all this is crystal clear.
I hope you're really comfortable with it.
So now we'll go on to the next videos.
"We'll talk about how to multiply, divide, subtract and add numbers that have zeros and significant figures."

Still today the number one  cash crop in the world.
"And it's the best crop for keeping indigenous people in the jungle, so that we don't cut down our sacred forests."
"Every time you choose to buy chocolate, organic chocolate, and or,  what I prefer -- raw chocolate, you are voting with your money  to save the rain forest, and it is a vote that counts."
It's the best vote you can have.
It grows in a little pod.
What an interesting looking plant.
It grows right off the trunk.
The fruit does.
And inside -- there's the flower.
This is the glory of chocolate.
Look at the different colors there.
Inside we see this.
"These are the cacao nuts,  or the beans, or the nut that all chocolate is made out of inside."
And around each nut is a white pulp.
"And that pulp was traditionally  in Amazonia and Central America where chocolate is from,  was only eaten by women."
But men ate the nut on the inside.
This is what that pulp looks like.
That's what we call 'The best day ever'.
"When you have that much chocolate,  real chocolate, original chocolate, raw chocolate, the fruit than nut,  the pulp, everything, but you gotta watch out,  because all the creatures in the forest eat it."
"And in fact, it is known that if you have a forest with 140 species of different birds then when you put a cacao orchard in, and you put it right into the jungle; no trees are taken out,  nothing is cut down."
"You take your little baby cacao plants or ""chocolate trees"", you put them right in the forest, and that will attract at least  40 more species of birds."
Birds love to hang out in chocolate trees.
"It comes back to this; the coin of the realm, the great cacao bean."
The secret inside.
We had an amazing discovery early on.
"In that, that cacao bean, the thing  that all chocolate is made out of, is the highest antioxidant food in the world."
This was a discovery.
This was not known ten years ago.
It is known now.
"Chocolate contains 15 times  the amount of antioxidants as wild blueberries, 20 times the antioxidants  as what's in green tea, 30 times the antioxidants as red wine."
"All of those pigments of color,  that are captured, that beautiful purple color that's the antioxidants;  it's actually the color."
And the brown of chocolate  is the polyphenols that protect yourselves and actually  protect you from aging.
"Now, if you remember that problem, and even just to do that problem, when we thought about this statement, such that the trace of A is not divisible by p, we figured out that this was exactly equal to saying that A does not equal 0."
"So one way to view the result of problem 43 is if you assume that A is not equal to 0, there are p minus 1 squared members of T sub p where the determinant is divisible by p."
So we're starting to count some of the A's whose determinant is divisible by p.
But these are the only-- the matrix A's whose a entry is not equal to 0.
"So if we want to count all of them, we have to also count the ones where a does equal 0, so where a does equal 0."
So let's think about that case.
"We can figure out how many matrices there are where a does equal 0, and the determinant of A is divisible by p."
Add it to that.
Then we have the total number of A's whose determinants are divisible by p.
"And we could subtract that from the total number of possibilities, and hopefully, we'll get one of the answers up here."
So let's think a little bit about what will the determinant look like over here?
"So in this situation, the determinant of our matrix will be-- it's a squared."
"It's a times a minus b times c, a squared minus bc."
"Now, we're assuming that a is equal to 0."
"If a is equal to 0, it's equal to negative bc."
"And we need to think about how is this going to be a multiple, or how is this going to be divisible by p?"
So this has got to be equal to some multiple of p.
"So the first thing, just think about b's and the c's."
They are both non-negative.
So this value right here cannot be negative.
"So if you put a negative sign there, it cannot be positive."
So it can't be any positive multiples of p.
It could be 0.
So we could have negative bc.
"We could have negative bc is equal to 0, which is equivalent to saying that bc is equal to 0."
"That's one possibility, where it equals 0 times p."
That's still a multiple.
Or maybe it could be negative.
Maybe we could have negative bc is equal to negative 1 times p.
"But when you think about it here, if this was true, that would mean that bc is equal to p, so b or c would be factors of p."
"Now, we know that p is a prime number."
"Its factors are only 1 and p. b and c-- I mean, one of these guys could be 1, but then the other guy would have to be p."

So you believe that Emily had epilepsy... ...which developed into a form of violent psychosis... ...a condition that can be controlled with Gambutrol?
Yes.
"And it would've been, if she'd continued her treatment."
"In your opinion, if Emily had continued with her medication... ...would she be alive today?"
- Absolutely.
"If treated early, psychotic epileptic disorder is rarely fatal."
"I mean, this..."
This was a very sick girl.
The defendant should've realized that Emily was in need... ...of continued medical treatment.
"Thank you, doctor."
Your witness.
"Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol could've controlled Emily's condition."
How do you know that?
It's the inevitable result of taking the drug.
It would've controlled her seizures... ...which were the root cause of her psychosis.
But wasn't Emily still experiencing psychotic symptoms... ...even after she started taking the medication?
Yes.
Because Gambutrol has a cumulative effect.
It takes time to build up in the system.
"You assume that Gambutrol would've helped her, but you don't know."
"It's a reasonable assumption, but..."
"No, of course, I can't be certain."
"Doctor, is ""psychotic epileptic disorder"" a common medical term... ...or did you just make it up?"
"Well, I distinguished and named the..."
So psychotic epileptic disorder is really your own pet theory?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Sustained.
When Emily chose to stop her medical treatment... ...what do you think should've been done?
I'm staring out the window
Wonder where you are
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour
Across every ocean
For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
Across every ocean
For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion

These

They grow on the forest floor.
The module on responsiveness by saying that the worst thing about going to the doctor is waiting.
I think I was wrong with that saying.
I think that the worst thing that can happen to a patient in a care process is to experience a quality problem.
"Experts estimate that there are close to a 100,000 people dying because of medical errors alone."
I'm in no position to judge this number.
Sometimes it is cheaper to buy five little packets of something than to buy one that includes five in the bigger one.
"And like I said, you don't think that that is the way it is going to be, but sometimes buying smaller times the number you need is more cost-effective than buying larger."
"And, if you go to looking you will see that they are doing that more and more now."
Okay?
So something to watch out for.
Then your chapter talks a little bit about warranties and you need to make sure and read those.
I'll tell you we don't buy a whole lot of warranties.
"Usually vehicles, products"
last as long as whatever warranty they are going to sell you.
"So, or whatever warranty comes free."
Usually it is going to make it that far.
I have found that computers is one exception.
We have bought warranties on computers.
When you use them you take them in.
"You know you are at college, you don't have your computer for a couple of months, I don't know."
"As cheap as things get, you just have to weigh the cost of buying a warranty and look at what all it is going to cover."
"Now, the next thing it talks about, it talks about researched based buying."
So many times instead of researching something we just go out and buy it.
"We decide, Oh, I would like to have a new TV !"
"Okay, let's go buy one."
"No, you need to do some research based buying."
Now four phases.
First the
Pre-shopping Activity.
There are things you do before you ever get there.
"Secondly, Evaluating The Alternatives Phase."
Then the Selection and Purchase Phase.
And then the Post-purchase Activities.
And there is a great deal of information given on all four of these different steps.
But phase I. If you will look on page 194 as you are gathering information there on the left you see key websites for consumer product information.
These are places you can go to learn about a product.
And these are from organizations that don't sell advertisements.
The same count rate.
"It doesn't sound like a very interesting experiment, but at that time he was working with a person named Geiger, a post-doc named Geiger."
The same Geiger as the Geiger counter.
And Geiger wasn't too happy about the results of these experiments.
"And in addition,"
Geiger had this undergraduate student hanging around the lab.
This undergraduate named Marsden.
And Marsden was really excited about doing science.
He just hung around there.
He really wanted to do something.
"And Geiger was, jeez, what am I going to do with this guy?"
"Geiger goes to Rutherford and says I've got Marsden here, he really wants to do something, what should I do with him?"
"And Rutherford said well, okay, let's have him build a detector that can swing around that gold sample."
"Let's have him build a detector that will rotate around such that the detector can be positioned this way, so that we can look for any alpha particles that might be backscattered, backscattered meaning scattered back in the direction from which they came."
"And Geiger said ah-ha, this will keep this guy busy and not in my hair."
No problem.
"So he goes down to Marsden,"
Marsden is all excited to build this detector.
"He builds the detector and gets Geiger, okay, we're ready to go."
Let's try this.
And so they put the radium bromide there in this arrangement.
"They're sitting there at the detector and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, particles at the detector."
"And they go, oh, well, that must just be a general background."
"So what they do then is they take this gold foil away, so that presumably all the particles are going in that direction and they listen and they hear nothing."
And they put the gold foil back.
"And they listen and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc., 20 alpha particles per minute."
"And they then pick another foil, platinum foil, basically the same result."
"They go up to Rutherford, they get him down in the laboratory."
"Rutherford's looking over their shoulder, tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, there are some alpha particles coming off."
Not many.
So you've essentially gone from hundreds of channels in your TV line-up to millions of channels just with the implementation of a browser.
How do you search all of this content?
"Well, we thought of that, too."
"So I'm going to bring down the search box again, and from here I can type in the name of a channel and"
I could see that right now this is a show that's playing.
"With one click, I tune there and I'm done."
People don't have as much time as they used to.
We want to get them there quicker.
"But the search box is interesting not just for channel searches, but we can search for anything."
Let me search for Star Trek.
You'll see here that we're integrating
TV search as well as pages from the web.
I can even search TV and video content and this takes me to a page where I can access all the content about Star Trek that I ever want to watch.
I can browse movies.
"I can go to specific shows, specific episodes, and even clips from the web."
"Now, it doesn't matter what's on right now."
What matters is what do I want to watch?
Google TV lets me watch it.
And this is--some of this is free and some of this is paid.
We're doing integrations with different video on demand providers to allow users to pay for things instantly and watch them immediately on their TV.
"So now you have all your TV, you have all of the web, and you have a way to search it all."
It gets even better.
I'm going to go to my home screen really quickly and navigate to one of my recordings for Top Gear.
"Now, this specific episode of Top Gear is all about the Ferrari."
And let's just say for a minute that I was so captivated by this show that
I wanted to buy a Ferrari.
Check this out.
"With one button, I can collapse the screen into a smaller screen size and I do a search for a ""buy a Ferrari""."
"Granted, this is just a demo, I'm not really going to buy one today."
"Now, I can go online and do that just now."
"Now, you can imagine all of the use cases where this can be very compelling."
I'm watching a breaking news story and I want to go see what people are saying on Twitter or Facebook or I'm watching a game show like Jeopardy and I want to go cheat and get the answer before the people on TV do.
"Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant  to me."
"Straight up racist, the sucker was simple and plain."
Mother your man John Wayne.
Already I'm hyped cause I'm amped.
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamp.
"You want to find something that you are engaged with, that you are engaged in, that something that keeps your interest because some of you are going to look back at this time in your life when you were a revolutionary radical and then you grew up and you had kids and stuff."
"I was going to transform the world, now I'm a corporate lawyer with 10 clients, making half a million dollars."
I want to come and visit you then.
"Because life is like that, but the point is you evolve."
You grow.
You deepen.
Let's end the bigotry against young people.
I know some of they sag their pants like they live in sag harbor.
"Maybe if you lift their hope, aspirations, and dreams they're pants will follow."
[Applause]
"Martin Luther King Jr. didn't just change black people, he changed America."
He made white people more human.
He made white civilization more tolerable.
And he brought the humanity of black people to bear.
But he refused to give up on white brothers and sisters and said there is something dignified and beautiful in the consciences of America when we can appeal to those consciences to transform America.
This rather unusual looking car can reach speeds of up to 180 kilometres an hour but that is not what makes it special.
All is revealed when it unfurls it propellors; this car can also fly.
The Personal Air and Land Vehicle or PAL-V is a gyrocopter that can both fly and is allowed on the road.
So what do you need to drive this machine?
"Robert Dingemanse, CEO and founder of Dutch company PAL-V, said:"
"""A normal drivers licence."
And for flying a personal or private pilot's licence and that's something you get in around 20 to 30 hours worth of lessons.
So it's pretty easy in a gyrocopter.
"It's a gyrocopter and that's the easiest way of flying, also the safest way of flying."""
"If the PAL-V sounds like the answer to the traffic jam, there is a hitch."
"It requires 165 metres of runway to take-off, 30 metres to land and can only be flown from an airport."
"It is expected to retail for somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 euros."
"Come on, you know, representing sets of integers, this is pretty dumb."
Suppose I want to have a set of characters.
How could I do that?
"Well the idea of a hash, in fact, what's called a hash function is to have some way of mapping any kind of data into integers."
"So let's look at the second example, all right, -- I keep doing that -- this piece of code from here to here gives me a way of now creating a hash table of size 256."
Ord as a built in python representation.
There is lots of them around that takes any character and gives you back an integer.
"In fact, just to show that to you, if I go down here and I type ord, sorry, I did that wrong."
Let me try again.
We'll get to exceptions in a second.
I give it some character.
It gives me back an integer representing.
It looks weird.
Why is three come back to some other thing?
That's the internal representation that python uses for this.
"If I give it some other character, yeah, it would help if I could type, give it some other character."
It gives me back a representation.
So now here's the idea.
"I build a list 256 elements long, and I fill it up with those special characters none."
That's what create is going to do right here.
"And then hash character takes in any string or character, single character, gives me back a number."
Notice what I do.
"If I want to create a set or a sequence representing these things, I simply insert into that list."
It goes through and puts ones in the right place.
"And then, if I want to find out if something's there,"
I do the same thing.
"But notice now, hash is converting the input into an integer."
"So, what's the idea?"
"If I know what my hash function does, it maps, in this case characters into a range zero to 256, which is zero to 255,"
"I create a list that long, and I simply mark things."
And my look up is still constant.
Characters are simple.
So I guess the books get stacked that way.
"And they labeled this right here, this dimension is x."
"And they're saying, will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?"
So essentially I'm going to put the first 10 in there.
"So the first statement they say, is that x is equal to 50 centimeters."
"Well, that doesn't help me because I don't know how big the first 10 volumes of the encyclopedia are."
"If each of them are, at least the first 10 are,"
"less than 5 centimeters each or on average less than 5 centimeters, then maybe I could fit them."
But one by itself doesn't help me.
Two:
12 of the volumes have an average thickness of 5 centimeters.
"Well, that doesn't help me either because remember, they're saying will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia?"
"Maybe the 12 that have an average thickness of 5 centimeters, maybe those are the volumes 8 through 20 and maybe volumes 1 through 7 have an average thickness of 50 centimeters each or 5 million centimeters each."
So even both of these conditions combined don't help me know if I can definitely fit the first 10 volumes of the 20 volume encyclopedia.
So that is E.
Both statements together are still not sufficient.
Problem 39.
A circular tub--
"OK, so they've drawn this circular-looking tub."
So the top looks like that.
And then there's two sides.
Let's me see how well I can construct what they've drawn.
And the bottom looks something like that.
"And then they shade in a little area, a strip of this, like that."
And they say a circular tub has a painted band has a band painted around its circumference as show above.
So this is the painted band around its circumference.
What is the surface area of the painted band?
And they tell us that the height of the painted band is x.
"So in order to essentially know the surface area, you'd have to know the height, which is x, times the circumference of the circle,"
Right? which would be the length.
"So if you knew the height times circumference of the circle, you'd be able to know the surface area."
"So they tell us, the first statement, x is equal to 0.5, whatever, meters."
"Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he is one rich pig farmer, and he is good for the environment, and he spends his days doing this incredible service, and he smells like hell, but God bless him."
He's making a great living.
"You ask him, ""Did you follow your passion here?"" and he'd laugh at you."
"The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas."
He didn't follow his passion.
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way.
And I hear that story over and over.
"Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk, if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots."
"Now, he's selling them to Walmart."
Follow his passion?
The guy's -- come on.
"So I started to look at passion,"
"I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness -- as Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction."
"I started to look at teamwork and determination, and basically all those platitudes they call ""successories"" that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now."
That stuff -- it's suddenly all been turned on its head.
Safety -- safety first?
"Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: what if OSHA got it wrong?"
"I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say -- but what if it's really safety third?"
Right?
(Laughter)
"No, I mean really."
"What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done, they're not out there talking about safety first."
"They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first, the business of getting it done."
"And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat with the ""Deadliest Catch"" guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season."
We're about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:
"50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?"
"Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen, and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down."
"So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean."
Unspeakably dangerous.
"I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse and I say, with some level of incredulity,"
"""Captain, OSHA."""
"And he says, ""OSHA?"
The suitors are doing all the wrong things when it comes to xenia.
"When they cross this threshold and act so ugly, in such an ugly way to Odysseus."
"Yeah, they're, they're treating a beggar poorly, and they should have treated a beggar better."
But they're also running afoul of this critical code that is built into what it is to be Greek.
You ought to treat strangers well.
"So, it's not just that you're doing something that's a little bit rude to this one person, you're violating a core social custom of what it is to be a Greek."
So these suitors are violating something quite strong here and being quite so rude to Odysseus.
"Also, they are violating a code that is a strong, strongly knitted into the Greek cultural fabric."
But it also comes from Zeus himself.
So they are committing a kind of offense against Zeus by not treating a stranger well.
And this comes out.
Gods arrive and disguised in every way.
We hear again at page 370.
Gods arrive disguised in every way.
That person who you don't who it is could be god.
You should treat them well.
"And if you don't, you are violating even the great authority of Zeus."
"Looking forward to book twenty, one of the suitors comes up and says, you want a guest gift, you beggar?"
"Fine, I'll give you guest gift."
"And takes an ox hoof and he hurls it, hurls it at Odysseus."
Further perversion of the custom of the xenia.
"What you are supposed to do is not take the hoof which can be used as a weapon, but take the meat which is nourishing."
"Give it to somebody who comes to your house, take care of them but they're not doing that."
"As this book, you know, carries forward book seventeen."
We see further Eumaeus develop in his role as messenger.
He brings a message from the stranger to Penelope at 371.
"Then comes back and, and talks to Odysseus and Odysseus asks then Eumaeus to bring a message back to Penelope."
"That message of Penelope, hey, stranger who has just washed into my house."
I'm so far away from my husband.
Maybe you'd like to have a private audience with me?
And invites him to go ahead and come on in and talk to her.
"Already a little bit forward, that maneuver."
That's what I think the drawing implies.
"They say the inside of a rectangular carton is 48 centimeters long, 32 centimeters wide and 15 centimeters high"
OK.
So that's the inside.
Kind of from the other wall.
This is the floor of the inside of the container and then there would be another up here.
But I think you get the idea.
The carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in the figure above.
OK.
So this is like a top view of it.
"So we could say that this side up here, this is 48 and then this is 32."
"So we don't care so much about the height, I think."
"So, let's see, the carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in figure above."
If the cans are 15 centimeters high--
"OK, so each of the cans are exactly 15 centimeters high."
So they literally are exactly as high as the carton.
"If the cans are 15 centimeters high, what is the value of k?"
So we have to figure out how many of these cans will fit in this area essentially?
And then they tell us point number one: each of the cans have a radius of 4 centimeters.
Radius is 4 centimeters.
"Well, if we know that each of them have a radius of 4 centimeters then we know exactly how much square area each of these circles will take up, assuming that they're packed exactly like this, right?"
"Because if you think about it, what is this area right here?"
"Well, there's a bunch of were different ways you could think about it."
"The easiest is that if the radius is 4 centimeters, that the diameter right here is 8 centimeters."
"So if this is 8 and you have a 48 length, you can only do 6 of these, right?"
6 times 8 is 48.
So you can only do 6 that way.
"And then if the diameter is 8 this way and this length is 32, you can only do 4 this way."
"So statement number one, alone, is enough to figure out how many you can put."
It would actually be 4 times 6.
"You could put 24, k would be 24 cans that you could fit in."
"So statement one, alone, is enough."
"So, it looks like this."
"The story can be told in multiple ways, but in English we have a phrase, ""What goes around, comes around."""
"On the religious side, there's the golden rule, ""Do onto others..."""
"And the story we heard earlier on the Polish farm, basically internalizing in economic systems, what is otherwise thrown away,"
literally makes certain or ensures that the resources that we have are reinvested in our present and our future.
"You wear, as I do, the same phosphate molecules that were in Socrates, that were in Copernicus, that were in Tyrannosaurus Rex."
"We're breathing the same carbon dioxide, the carbon cycles unrestfully pass through us."
"And we either reinvest the carbon in the landscape, we reinvest the resources, or they are gone."
Here's my sampling 100 points.
I'm going to turn off the light just to highlight this.
I want to highlight some regions here.
"Look I've got some sampling here, notice in here, I don't sample at all."
"Do you think I'm going to be able to get signal in there, because you don't want to go by Shawn's theory."
Shawn said.
"There is no way you have any business making a statement about what's going on in that, right?"
"You got no information there, how are you going to get frequency content when you've not sampled the ups and downs?"
"Oh, look at this region over there!"
"I got a huge stretch, 1.2 and I got all this stuff going on Okay?"
Nyquist would say you're screwed.
You're done.
"Like, why, what are thinking about?"
Like seriously?
Drop math now.
"Compress sensing would say wait a minute, but you told me that this is sparse signal."
Which means I have a constraint on the number of freq uencies that might be active which means.
I might be able to get it.
And I'm going to try to get it that optimizes the fit to what I have with a small number of frequencies that are consistent with the data I have.
"You get it, okay?"
"Actually, in this case you're, you're right at the edge of reconstruction, okay?"
"But still, it's we'll, we'll come back to this."
"It's pretty impressive, still, what you can kind of."
"Get out of this, piece."
"So almost, but not quite, everything I need to do."
Someone want to point out to me what it is I have failed to consider in this situation.
[Inaudible].
It's the what?
[Inaudible].
Yeah. ? trying to make null point to something [inaudible].
Exactly.
So if my queue is totally empty.
So in these cases like
"- one thing you can often think about whenever you see yourself with this error, and you're dereferencing something, you have to considered, well, is there a possibility that that value is null."
And if so I'd better do something to protect against it.
"So in the case of the new cell here, I'm setting aside and not clearing that cell."
"We know it's valid, [inaudible], we've got good memory."
"That part's good but the access to the tail, and that's assuming there is a tail, that there is at least one cell already in the queue that the tail is pointing to."
"When that's not true, this is going to blow up."
It's going to try to dereference it.
So what we can do here is we can just check for that.
We can say if the queue is empty then what we want to do is say that head equals tail equals new cell.
"Otherwise, we've got some existing tail and we just need to attach to it."
"Now, this is what I meant about that often there are little bit of special cases for certain different inputs."
"In particular, the most common ones are an empty list or a single link list being distinguished from a list that has two or more elements."
So sometimes it's all about - a single link list has problems and so does the empty list.
"In this case, it's exactly the empty list."
"Like a single cell is actually fine, you know, one, ten, 6,000 all work equally well."
It's that empty case that we have to work on setting our head and tail to that.
So with this plan we go back to my use of this.
"And stop talking about my stack and change into my queue, end queuing instead of pushing."
[Inaudible].
"Oh, 591 errors."
"Well, that's really - 591, what is that?"
[Inaudible].
"Oh, yeah, this is the year I was going to talk about but I failed to do."
Use the time wisely.
"(Announcer) In this risotto elimination challenge, many are struggling."
"Oh, my God."
"(Announcer) At the end of tonight, another one of these 17 home cooks will be leaving the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Taste.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Start thinking&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;about the execution.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Everything.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 60 seconds to go."
Come on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Check the plate.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let the risotto relax.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Seasoning.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Butter in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Cheese in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You want rich lava.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Ten, nine, eight, seven, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;six, five,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;four, three, two, one,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and stop. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Everybody.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
[Cheers and applause]
Well done.
"And the sad news. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tonight, somebody&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;will be leaving&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen."
(Announcer) The judges will taste each risotto dish.
"Then the three worst dishes will be singled out, and one of those home cooks will leave the competition."
"Okay, let's start off back row."
Monti.
I'm a little freaked out right now.
But I'm not going home.
"I came here to cook, and I came here to win this."
"This is risotto made with white wine and chicken stock with a pancetta, pine nuts, sundried tomato, and white asparagus."
"It does not look like a risotto, does it?"
Uh...
They don't look like that ever. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So there's the risotto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;down there.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I've got to dig for this one.
The pancetta is crispy. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's the nice thing&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;about it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Unfortunately, your garnish tastes better than the actual body of the risotto."
Have you ever eaten risotto before?
- No.
- That's bizarre.
That I've never eaten risotto?
How are you holding up?
I'm doing all right.
"The thing is, as whoever you're cooking it for is getting the bite, they should get &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a tiny, little piece&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of asparagus,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; a little pancetta, all those things, not huge long pieces that don't really fit on the fork and are just garnished on the top. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you, Monti.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"The judges, they expect us to be at a certain level, and I was far below that level."
[Sniffles]
And the answer is no.
"But if you say, is there a way to reduce the two terms to one to a good approximation, the answer is yes."
"And the reason the answer is yes, is because to a good approximation, if you know, if you know R, and if you know this angle in between that angle."
Which we know that angle because we know all the coordinates.
You can estimate R prime with good accuracy.
"If we can find R prime, in terms of R, possibly also using that angle, Then we can reduce this expression from two terms, down to one."
Can you do that?
I'll leave it to you to see if you can figure it out.
So we'll conclude this segment with this nice picture of one of the main quads at
Duke University.
Thank you for watching this problem session.
We'll see you in the next segment.
Good evening friends.
"I am Shinzo Abe, representing the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan."
Hearty congratulations India Center on 10th Anniversary.
I am very impressed with this grand ceremony.
Mr. Vibhav is a good friend for the last ten years.
"I do not know anyone, who has passionately devoted his life to the relationship of India and Japan."
It was from Mr. Vibhav that I learned the greatness of India and the significance of strong friendship between India and Japan.
"Last year, Mr. Vibhav gave me an opportunity to visit India and there I have met many dignitaries."
"Including Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan."
India and China are the top two growing countries in Asia.
I believe that the key to the prosperous future of Japan is by learning from these countries' progress and growth.
"To strengthen relations between two countries, it is important that each countries think earnestly about the other."
This is the first step forward.
Mr. Vibhav is a very passionate man.
"Sometimes we get exhausted, because of his enthusiasm."
But I have realised that it is this passion and enthusiasm that is significantly inevitable.
"I am now in the position of the President of the LDP, and I attach importance to the friendship of India and Japan."
"With common values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and feudal society,"
let's strategically establish and develop the relationship between the two countries.
"My grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was the first Prime Minister to visit India."
"And that was talking about how if you stretch out heart cells, and all of the things within heart cells-- all the proteins-- that it actually changes the force of contraction."
"And actually, force of contraction is very much related to this length-tension relationship as well."
So I'm going to put that up here.
Force of contraction.
"And instead of using that terminology, though, we're going to use the term tension."
"I mean, you can essentially think of them the same way."
"But classically, the word tension is what everyone uses."
So we're going to use that same word.
"And then, as far as length, specifically the length that we're talking about is the length of a sarcomere."
So I'm going to write sarcomere here.
"And the sarcomere, just keep in mind, is really going from one z-disc to another z-disc."
"So to draw this out, to actually write it out maybe, we can start with myosin."
"And so maybe this is our myosin, right here."
And I'll draw some myosin heads here.
"And maybe some myosin heads on this side, as well."
"And, of course, you know it's going to be symmetric looking, roughly symmetric."
So this is our myosin.
"And actually, I'm going to make some copies of it now, just to make sure that I don't have to keep drawing it out for you."
But something like that.
"And we'll move it to be just below so that you can actually see, when I draw a few of them, how they differ from one another."
"So I'm going to put them, as best I can, right below one another."
"And we'll do a total of, let's say, five."
"And I think, by the time we get to the fifth one, you'll get an idea of what this overall graph will look like."
So these are our five myosins.
"And to start out at the top, I'm going to show a very crowded situation."
So this will be what happens when really nothing is spread out.
"It's very, very crowded."
"And you recall that you have actin, this box, or this half box that I'm drawing, is our actin."
"And then you have two of them, right?"
"And they have their own polarity, we said."
And they kind of go like that.
"And so, in this first scenario, this very, very first one that I'm drawing, this is our scenario one."
"let's say it's this one fourth of the pie, right?"
And we're going to add it to another one fourth of the pie.
Let's make it this one-- let me change the color-- pink.
"This one fourth, this pink one fourth is this one fourth of the pie."
"So if I were to eat both one fourths, or one fourth and then I eat another one fourth, how much have I eaten?"
"Well, you could look from just the picture,"
I have now eaten two out of the four pieces of the pie.
"So if I eat one fourth of a piece of pie or one fourth of a pie, and then I eat another one fourth of a pie,"
I will have eaten two fourths of the pie.
"And we know from the equivalent fractions module that this is the same thing as that I've eaten one half of the pie, which makes sense."
"If I eat two out of four pieces of a pie, then I've eaten one half of it."
"And if we look at it mathematically, what happened here?"
"Well the denominators or the bottom numbers, the bottom numbers in the fraction stayed the same."
Because that's just the total number of pieces that I have in this example.
"Well, I added the numerators, which makes sense."
"I had one out of the four pieces of pie, then I ate another one out of the four pieces of pie, so I ate two out of the four pieces of pie, which is one half."
Let me do a couple more examples.
What is two fifths plus one fifth?
Well we do the same thing here.
We first check to make sure the denominators are the same.
We'll learn in a second what we do when the denominators are different.
"If the denominators are the same, the denominator of the answer will be the same."
"And we just add the numerators. two fifths plus one fifth is just two plus one over five, which is equal to three over five."
And it works the same way with subtraction.
"If I had three over seven minus two over seven, that just equals one over seven."
"I just subtracted the three, I subtracted the two from the three to get one and I kept the denominator the same."
Which makes sense.
"If I have three out of the seven pieces of a pie, and I were to give away two out of the seven pieces of a pie,"
I'd be left with one of the seven pieces of a pie.
So now let's tackle-- I think it should be pretty straightforward when we have the same denominator.
"Remember, the denominator is just the bottom number in a fraction."
Numerator is the top number.
lignified carbon sequestration fertilization.
And if every farm in America practiced that we would sequester all the carbon that's been emitted since the beginning of the industrial age in fewer than 10 years.
Wow!
That's how efficacious it is.
"So when you eat your grass finished steak, not only is it good for you, it's good for the whole ecology."
"Is there also a movement in the beef raising industry towards this, because of the increasing demand?"
"Yes, and this is probably growing faster than the pastured poultry, the pastured pork."
Beef is probably growing faster.
"I don't know why, except that probably the beef industry has not been vertically integrated"
like the swine and the poultry industry.
There are still a lot of independent operators out there.
"Whereas the swine and the poultry industry have been, you know, Tyson's and Smithfield, they've vertically integrated it."
"So there's a lot more ability to be creative and move in the beef industry, and for sure there's a tremendous increase."
"And to increase the awareness, what should consumers look for?"
Should they look for grass finished?
Or is that term being bastardized too?
"Well, what they should do is go visit the farm and see."
But many people aren't going to do that.
"Well, they should."
"So that's the first step, visit the farm."
"Yes, visit the farm, see if there's any grain around and ask the farmer, ask around."
"But mainly, visit the farm and see if you see any grain."
"Cause most farmers will say, yeah, they're grass finished but we grain them the last 30 days."
It's more common than not.
"If you hear those terms, that is the cue to find a new farmer."
"That's exactly right, that is the cue."
"The question is, have they ever gotten any grain in their lives?"
Period.
"If the answer is yes, then find a new one."
"I mean, you know, not that there might not be a, for example, we buy a lot of calves."
"We don't know, some of these calves probably got a little bit of grain maybe when they were weaned from the cow, for a week of two."
"But that's way, way back, 12 months ago."
"Kyle, are you here?"
"So, that is my work -to try to bring  a change in the vision of education which is basically about people  getting jobs and doing skills rather than becoming a complete human being."
"Holistic education is about educating  the whole person, the body, mind and the spirit."
"Gandhi said they are an invisible whole, as soon as you try to break off one, you commit a gross fallacy."
And we have committed the gross fallacy in education.
"So, the aims of holistic education,  in my view, are the development of wisdom, and compassion and happiness."
Wisdom and compassion.
"Not intelligence, but wisdom."
That deep understanding of how things are.
"So in holistic education, what is really important, and I think in any education, is the presence of the teacher."
"And so much about teacher's education  and even in service education, is about technique, is about theory, but there is nothing about how  to enhance the presence of the teacher."
"So, how does one enhance  the presence of a teacher?"
"It is simple, it is through practice."
It is through practice.
"So, my practice has been meditation,  and so, in my courses, starting in 1988,"
"I required all my students to meditate for six weeks, every day."
Starting with five to ten minutes  and working up to about half an hour.
"And they kept a journal, they still do  keep a journal, cause I am still teaching."
"And at the end, they write  a one page reflection."
Also I introduce mindfulness activity.
"I have them eat a raisin mindfully and then for the rest of the week, do something mindfully, take some  small thing and do it mindfully."
The final thing is I start my classes  with loving kindness meditation.
"This is in a public university, University of Toronto."
"I think one of the reasons  I came to Canada,"
I do not think I could have done this in US.
"So, since 1988, I have been introducing meditation to over 2000 teachers."
"And to read those journals and  to read that one-page reflection, has just been one  of the greatest joys of my life."
(Half Bell) (Laughter)
So I taught this summer and I have one student that was in my summer class and I am really delighted  to see the students come up to me.
"But I just want to read the journal  of one of the students, just a few words."
"In the meditation,  he was counting one to four."
"So exhale, one..."
"Yes, if you're trying to do like a full blown formatter, then you actually do need to worry about the position."
"- The point of the Wonder Helpers, by the way, is that formatters you can only...well, from the binding, from binding, you can only use them on components that expose a formatter finding."
Wonder Helpers you can use on any binding.
- That's nice.
- I don't think I've used those.
- You should because you steal them.
- I will.
"- Right, right."
You can have multiple...
- They can be extended into something else.
- I usually just chain the formatter instances.
- No instances.
- We won't go there.
"OK, so, moving on to our final topic, I think we're, are we out of time Pascal, or Keep going.?"
"Deployment, trying to get through here quickly."
There's really not much to say about deployment that hasn't been said in other places.
"Manage dependencies, plan for change."
It's going to happen.
"Web Object extensions directory sounded like a great idea when it first came out, jammed all kinds of jars in there."
It was wonderful.
Then I needed to update one app in the server and I couldn't update the other apps and it was terrible.
"For deployment, my advice is just delete everything in that directory."
It's just a dependency nightmare waiting to happen.
"Instead, if you need it, if you need jar files, put them in a framework, use the framework in your application."
Framework goes into your subversion repository wherever your repository is.
Manage the dependencies like that.
"In fact, I'll go one further and say,"
"""You should embed all frameworks."""
"All frameworks, I include the Web Objects ones as well because that way you can deploy applications using different versions of Web Objects, different versions of the jars on the same server."
You don't have to worry about conflicts.
"And Yeah, people are going to say,"
"""Oh, it's going to be bigger."
- How are we on our medical experts?
- Not good.
The psychiatrist you wanted is tied up in another trial.
And the neurologist is sailing to Costa Rica.
"This book I'm reading, it's by an anthropologist."
"It's about contemporary cases of possession, mostly in the Third World."
People there are still primitive and superstitious.
Maybe.
Maybe they see possession for what it really is.
Maybe we've taught ourselves not to see it.
- You saying you believe in this stuff?
- No.
Maybe we shouldn't just try to invalidate the prosecution's case... ...by punching holes in the medical approach.
Maybe we should also try to validate the alternative.
- Validate possession in a court of law?
- Yes.
Okay.
I guess we could bring in some priests to talk about exorcisms...
"No, the archdiocese won't let us do that."
They wanna limit the Church's exposure to Father Moore.
I've got three articles by the anthropologist who wrote this book.
She approaches the subject of possession... ...from a scientific perspective and doesn't try to debunk it.
- You want me to track her down?
- Yeah.
Keep looking for a medical expert to refute Dr. Briggs.
But send the case file to this Dr. Sadira Adani.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...as you know by now, my name is Erin Bruner... ...and I represent the defendant, Richard Moore."
"Mr. Thomas has contended that Emily Rose suffered... ...from a serious medical condition... ...that required medical treatment, nothing more."
"He has asserted that any attempt by my client... ...to help Emily by anything other than medical means... ...was not only inappropriate, but criminally negligent."
I'm now gonna ask that you keep an open mind... ...to what our evidence and testimony will show.
Medical treatment was not the answer for Emily... ...because she simply did not suffer from a medical condition.
She was neither epileptic nor psychotic.
The Zande have dozens of names for illnesses and they also have hundreds of medicinal plants that they use to cure those illnesses.
"But when the treatment doesn't work, if the illness gets worse, they pay less attention to the medicine, and they turn their attention to the witch that is behind the person getting sick in the first place."
"For example, stubbing your toe is not extraordinary."
So if you stub your toe usually gets better after a few days.
"But if it doesn't get better, if it gets infected, if it turns into gangrene, that's witchcraft."
Or lots of people catch the flu.
And you get over the flu in a few days.
"If you don't get over the flu and it gets serious, and you catch pneumonia, that's witchcraft."
"So if the Zande can't control the illness through medicines, they turn to something they can control: social relations."
And I have a couple of stories that I'll show you how that works.
Medicines-- or caught not that one.
Here's a picture of Lucy and her son Benjamin.
Benjamin was just a few weeks old when I arrived.
And he had conjunctivitis in one eye.
And I always carry small bits of medicines with me when I travel.
So I had antibiotics and I treated him every morning; every evening.
I put a drop in his eye.
It got better.
"Lucy wasn't really concerned because it's very common for babies to get conjunctivitis, and it usually clears up, and it did."
But then the conjunctivitis came back in the other eye.
And so now she was getting a little worried.
I then treated the baby every morning; every evening for five days and the eye cleared up.
"So, Lucy was kind of wondering what was happening, but she was okay because it-- then it cleared up."
But then it came back again in the first I.
"And this was really a sign that something was going on, and that there was probably witchcraft involved."
"Now, babies are not usually victims of witchcraft because they really can't offend people."
And he was never really in danger of dying or anything.
"So Lucy interpreted his eye-- is conjunctivitis as a sign that someone was upset with her, and she knew who it was."
So now I want you all to think like a Zande.
Who could possibly be mad at Lucy and her baby?

I do not understand the question
What is it Spock?
I do not understand the question Mother
You are half human.
The computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
Spock...
"The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings."
"But as my son, you have them."
They will surface.
"As you wish, since you deem them of value."
But I cannot wait here to find them.
Where must you go?
To Earth.
To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
"I do this because I was there,"
Spock.
Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
I would accept that as an axiom.
"Then you stand here alive because of a mistake made by your flawed, feeling, human friends."
They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one
-you- was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
"They do, indeed."
"Hey guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer and it's Wednesday, time for some YouTube tips and advice and this week I want to talk about the new YouTube trailer option that we had to add to our new one channel design that had rolled out like a couple of weeks ago."
"I've actually already talked about this on the ReelSEO channel which you can click right here and go watch that, but I want to take it a little bit further this time, because what I said there is some things that I have observed about what makes channel trailers work well and what kind of doesn't, just based on the limited, you know, interaction I seen with them across several channels that have already implemented it."
And now YouTube's coming out with some best practices that they are seeing as well and actually almost everything I said in that original video is also what YouTube is saying so I feel a little bit proud of myself about that.
But let's look at what they say and then I have another tip to add to the end that I think is very vital and crucial that they don't include.
"But first of all, the first thing they say is to have a very clear call to action to subscribe."
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about transforming.
"Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen."
This is happening by itself.
It transforms through the magic of lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about touch.

Let's see it one more time.
"Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it."
"And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before."
It's about bringing nature to the inside.
"In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --"
I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.
It's about stimulation.
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.

"And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,"

Thank you very much.

"To set your grasslin timer, turn the dial on the front until the dial pointing to the correct time"
Slide the tabs to the outside for the period you want the timer to be on and ensure the remainder of the tabs are all pushed towards the middle.
In this example the timer will be on between midday and 6pm and off for the rest of the time.
"There is also a sliding switch on the timer, when at the bottom the timer is always off and when in the middle."
It is governed by the tabs around the dial

The Power of Thought.
A person's thoughts are basically a processing of information and situations before him and we all have ideas and thoughts in our mind
We just showed that at least one player can gain by changing strategy holding others constant.
The same would be true if we went the other way around.
"If we held B constant at 25, A could gain by changing his strategy, could go right over there."
This is not a Nash equilibrium.
"Then regardless of what state we go to, if we go to this state, it's still not a Nash Equilibrium."
"If we hold A constant,"
"B could improve by increasing his production; or if we hold B constant, then A can still improve by cheating even more."
None of these are Nash equilibriums.
"From any one of these states, if you hold A constant,"
"B could produce more; or if you hold B constant,"
A could produce more and get some gain.
"Over here, A's going from 130 to 160 and getting some gain."
You can imagine this keeps happening incrementally.
They keep producing more and more and more.
"We kind of go there, then we go there, then maybe we go there, then we go there."
"Then maybe A cheats some more, then B cheats some more, then A cheats a little bit more,"
"B cheats a little bit more, maybe a little bit more past that, then A cheats a little bit more."
"The whole time the whole economic profit pie, which is the sum of A and B, is getting smaller and smaller until finally A finally cheats and they're at zero economic profit."
Now let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium.
"Clearly, they won't want to move backwards."
"If you hold A constant,"
B would not want to move down.
Then he would
lose economic profit.
That doesn't work.
He doesn't gain by doing that.
"If you hold B constant, A wouldn't want to move to the right."
A would also lose economic profit.
Now you might say what if they produced beyond 37.5?
Why can't they keep producing and go beyond there?
"Holding A constant, if B were to produce more than 37.5 from this state right over here, then the total pie will get negative and it doesn't matter if B's getting a larger or smaller chunk of that pie."
B's chunk is going to be negative.
"little thing that says, I would say, dude that is totally singular."
Just so you know.
Don't like be messing around doing back slash with that matrix.
Okay.
All right.
That's it for today.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Maile Ohye:
Hi.
I'm Maile Ohye.
I'm a member of Google's webmaster support team.
And I'd
like to help you better understand how to use the URL parameters feature in webmaster tools.
URL parameters is a fairly advanced feature.
So some of this information might be more complex than one would expect.
"Before you further watch this video, please check out the URL parameters page to see if you have a message from Google explaining that we already believe we have high crawl-coverage of your site."
And therefore no adjustments to this feature are necessary.
"The message would say ""Currently Googlebot isn't experiencing problems with coverage of your site."
So you don't need to configure URL parameters.
Incorrectly configuring parameters can result in pages from your site being dropped from our index.
"So we don't recommend you use this tool unless necessary."""
"For those of you who have that message, you're good to go."
And no further viewing is even necessary.
But for those of you who don't have that message please keep watching.
And one of the main takeaways is that improper actions on the URL parameters feature can result in pages no longer appearing in search.
"Again, it's an advanced feature."
The settings in the URL parameters are used by Google as a helpful hint in our crawling process.
"For stronger directives, you want to use things like a robots.txt disallow."
Or a meta noindex.
But using the URL parameters hint is still very helpful.
"In 2010, the Google store only sold about 160 products."
And that seems fine and fairly easy to crawl.
"But the thing is, that of these 160-ish products, it actually created 380,000"
There were two standout risottos. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The first one belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Frank. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Great job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However, there was one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that stood out head and shoulders above its competition."
That dish belongs to...
David Martinez.
Both of you will become team captains in the next stage of this competition.
But you know this elimination challenge comes with a departure. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;There were three dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that stood out&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; all for the wrong reasons. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And at least one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of those three&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;have cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; their last dish in this competition.
"The first dish that was out of character, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bland, subpar,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and on the verge&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of an embarrassment,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that dish belongs to..."
"Dave Mack. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come down here, please.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Please stand over there.
Thank you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This next dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; had very bizarre flavors and techniques.
Helene.
"The third of the worst dishes had a mix of ingredients that made no sense, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;didn't even seem to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what a risotto was supposed to be. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That dish belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I was trying to not lose my grip on my countertop, because I know I'm gonna be in the bottom three."
I know it.
"The third of the worst dishes had a mix of ingredients that made no sense, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;didn't even seem to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what a risotto was supposed to be."
That dish...
Belongs to Tali. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Those three risottos&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; were embarrassing. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Who will be sent home?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I did what the challenge asked for, you know, so I feel safe."
I screwed up.
My risotto was undercooked.
"I'm feeling, quite frankly, scared."
My food tastes great.
What do the judges want?
Why didn't they see it on my plate?
"Dave Mack, one step forward, please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You can't turn out&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;undercooked rice&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with every mouthful just full of grit."
"Dave, you are not safe. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stay there, please.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Helene.
Your dish was really bad. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We were bitterly disappointed.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
But it wasn't one of the worst two.
"Back to your station, please."
Thank you.
Thank you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
And yet what we are doing about?
Our State Department isn't making peaceful contact
So we must.
Our Department of Energy is not funding non-classified projects dealing with these  science and technologies
So we must
And certainly the Pentagon is not disclosing this information and therefore
We must.
So this returns this whole issue to perhaps where it should be
"And that's us, we the people"
And not just the people of America or of Europe
But of Africa and India and China.
"Every man, woman and child on earth has a stake in this."
The Disclosure of this information will enable us to move forward as a People
With all the science and technology that we need to have thousands of years of abundance and peace on this planet.
This is really what this is about and I hope you will help us.
Thank you very much.
"So if 2π radians is one full circle 360°, what do you think will be 1π radian or just π radians."
Can you tell me where in the circle you would wind up if you walk 1π radians?
Select the appropriate check box.
"Fifteen years ago, if anybody would have told me"
"I'd be standing in front of you guys talking about food,"
I would have said they're totally nuts.
"Because I was in Texas, in business school, on a full scholarship."
"I was about to graduate as the top woman in my class, and I was being recruited by Enron, (Laughter) and the oil and gas industry."
I so wasn't a foodie.
"But I was so type A, and I channeled that into academia, and what I decided to do - I wasn't really interested in Enron, thank goodness - and I decided to go into the investment world as an analyst, and I covered the food industry."
"And I was so completely inept at this whole food thing that when Martha Stewart came through our offices bringing her company public, and everybody had her sign the cookbooks,"
I had her sign the financial statements.
(Laughter)
I couldn't cook.
"So when my husband and I decided to move here 12 years ago,"
I traded the briefcase for a diaper bag.
"If you did capture them, which we did occasionally, you could use it until it runs out."
"But without a code sheet, you would have to break the code."
And you would have to do that with mathematics.
-What was the key?
What was wrong with Enigma?
What was its weakness?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
Let's have a look at what the flaw is in the Enigma machine.
"So the Germans thought it was unbreakable, but there is a flaw."
If I press a letter K--
"For this quiz, your goal is to define a procedure."
We'll call it abbaize.
"This is very useful if you need to come up with names, and what it does is take 2 strings as its inputs and outputs a string that is the first input, followed by 2 repetitions of the second input, followed by the first input."
"As an example, if we called abbaize, passing in the string 'a' and the string 'b'-- single character strings-- what we should get as a result is the string 'abba'."
"If we called abbaize, passing in the string 'dog' and the string 'cat', what we should get is the string 'dogcatcatdog', and there aren't any spaces between the strings."
They're just all pasted together.
"Ermira, you have led the session many times, what would you say about it?"
This is the last chance you have as a trainer to do teaching practice actually.
"And it's your last chance to make sure that all the participants have understood correctly the importance that children should have to make this working groups alone or in pairs or working as a group of five or more, depending on the number of children they have."
"But in the same time, it's the last chance for them as well, for the participants, to make sure that they can prove to themselves that they can do it and can demonstrate they can use this techniques."
Then let's plan together.
Do you agree to plan together to see what kind of supplies we can make for work?
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
"(BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP)"
"ME, ME, ME"
It's my day off.
I can't reach it.
Ugh.
(And there was another drive-by shooting today...)
"Blah, blah, blah!"
Get to the weather already.
Martin:
"Yes, it's also one of the things we are allowed to tell you people, that you may well start thinking about everything as in movement because everything is basically motion and the more one goes into the movement, the easier life you get it is no more than a few years ago it dawned on me that our beloved Greeks didnt have a word for music"
"What is called ""musica"" is a blend of all the musical expression, so"
"If one started playing, there was of course one that began to dance, another who sang and everyone attended there was no real audience until far into antiquity"
"I think we could learn something from that, and it's also what you say that the movement becomes a part of it"
"I'm sorry to say so but if you want to continue the illusion as a earthling please do, but I would love to help you so if I may, in the other dimensions, you let me know in any case, I think we should all lean at Ole Fogh Kirkeby's wise words"
"A true philosopher, I hope it plants seeds out there in small ponds"
"And so I thank you for your participation, Kirkeby's one of the good guys in philosophy master's in human and Dr. Phil of management philosophy at Copenhagen business school. and director of the ""Centre for Art and management""."
Did I say that the right way?
Ole:
Yes
That is very much in one person
Thank you for joining and send me a letter at:
"Martin@tvfraenandenplanet.dk and if you sit at home and think ""wish it was me who was alien"" then you may very well be"
"Look into my eyes and be inspired, then perhaps we'll meet in a dimention"
Thank's for now
"So that's, you know, coming along."
I'm working with a vocal coach.
Strengthening the...
Lot of guys ignore the laugh and that's about standards.
I mean....
"If you want to get into the evil league of evil, you have to have a memorable laugh."
What?
Did you think Bad Horse didn't work on his weenie?
His terrible death weenie.
No response BTW from the league yet.
But my application is strong this year.
A letter of condamnation from the deputy mayor.
That's gotta have some weight so...
Fingers crossed!
E-mails!
"Too-sly-for-you writes ""hey, genius!"""
"He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing."
He's looking for those genes as well.
"And I said, ""Well, if you can find those,"
"I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."""
And so he agreed.
And so that's what we're looking into.
"If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it."
"Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand."
"But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing."
"But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand."
"It has the three fingers, the three digits."
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
"We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,"
like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
"And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail."
"But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it."
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
"So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus."
(Laughter)
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
"And people always say, ""Why do that?"
Why make this thing?
"What good is it?"""
"Well, that's a good question."
"Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things."
"And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece."
They targeted Harry Belafonte.
They targeted Eartha Kitt.
"They targeted anyone who supported the struggle for civil rights, that they considered to be dangerous."
It is in that context we need to look at what happened on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973.
"What they call Joanne Chesimard, what we know as Assata Shakur, she was targeted by the FBl, stopped."
And the allegation that she was a cold-blooded killer is not supported by any of the forensic evidence.
"If we look at the trial, we'll find that she was victimized, she was shot."
She was shot in the back.
The bullet exited and broke the clavicle in her shoulder.
She could not raise a gun.
She could not raise her hand to shoot.
And she was shot while her hands were in the air.
"Now, that is the forensic evidence."
There is not one scintilla of evidence placing a gun in her hand.
No arsenic residue was found on her clothing or on her hands.
"So, the allegation by the state police that she took an officer's gun and shot him, executed him in cold blood, is not only false,  but it is designed to inflame."
JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"But, Mr. Hinds, before we get into more of the details of the case, this whole issue of 40 years later—"
LENNOX HlNDS:
Yeah.
"UAN GONZÁLEZ: —suddenly branding her a terrorist and also insisting that she is a threat to the United States government at this time, could you talk about the significance of that declaration?"
LH:
"Well, I believe that we have to look at it in the context of what has just happened in Boston."
"I think that with the massacre that occurred there, the FBI and the state police are attempting to inflame the public opinion to characterize her as a terrorist, because the acts that she was convicted of has nothing to do with terrorism."
"The acts that she was convicted of, if you look at the evidence, she was convicted of aiding and abetting, and therefore was present during the shootout."
The FBI and the state police's theory was that Sundiata Acoli shot Officer Foerster.
That was their theory during his trial.
JG:
"One of the people in the car with her, that—"
LH:
"One of the people in the car, yeah."
AG:
"I used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats, and I remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net, because it leaves a black slime behind."
So that must have come from the shark.
"Now, we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable."
We would use conventional methods;
"I have a crossbow -- you see it in my hand there, which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well."
"So I tried that, I tried many techniques."
"All it was doing was breaking my arrows, because the shark's skin is just so strong."
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that.
That wasn't going to work.
"So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,"
"I thought, ""If you take what you're given in this world ..."""
So I scraped it off.
I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
"So I scraped the slime off and sent it to Aberdeen, and said, ""You might try that."""
And they sat on it for months.
It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man.
"But I kept emailing Les, saying,"
"""Have you had a chance to look at my slime?"""
"And he was like, ""Yeah, yeah."
"Later."""
He thought he'd better do it because I never met him before; he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him.
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.
"They amplified it and they tested it, and they found, yes, this was actually basking shark DNA, which was got from the slime."
So he was very excited.
"It became known as ""Simon's shark slime."""
"And I thought, ""Hey, you know, I can build on this."""
"So we thought, OK, we're going to try to get out and get some slime."
So having spent three-and-a-half thousand on satellite tags ...
"I then thought I'd invest 7.95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle, and even less money on some oven cleaners."
And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle and ... (Laughter)
I was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.
"And this was into August now, and normally sharks peak in June, July, and you rarely see them, or rarely can be in the right place to find sharks into August."
"And you can see that in 2000s that 1.3 percent or yeah, 1.3 percent gap basically doubled to 2.5 percent gap in the next decade."
Health care cost mushroomed.
"Now, this is a somewhat complicated slide but I just talked to you about the fact that o ver four decades, we've have this big growth."
Basically 2.4 percent above the growth in the GDP in health care.
Taking more and more and more of the GDP into health care arena.
This is projected by the Congressional Budget Office into the future.
It's not all health care spending.
It's just federal health care spending which is predominantly what?
Medicare but also have a big portion of Medicaid.
And this is to see what happens if there is no excess cost quote.
"That means, if healthcare cost which I haven't done in 40 years equal GDP."
That solid line here is what happens over basically the next 25 years if health care cost do not rise any faster than the growth of GDP and what do you see?
Just interpret the graph.
What do you see?
It's still growing right?
"This is a percentage GDP, Medicare and the Federal portion here is about five percent and you can see, it goes over eight%, 8-1/25 in 25 years."
"This in the GDP, if it doesn't exceed GDP."
"If it exceed GDP by two percent which is slightly less and what has been doing in the last 40 years, you can see it balloons past ten, eleven%."
"And if it has slowing growth down to 1.7 percent points, okay?"
You can see that it still goes over ten%.
"So, the federal budget contribution to health care is extremely."
"Dependent on how much healthcare grows above GDP but even if it doesn't grow above GDP, it's going to be bigger and bigger drag on the federal budget, okay?"
"This is one reason people who are budget [inaudible], who worry about the healthcare, worry about the federal budget."
The predominant worry is not social security but healthcare.
"We're going to do a few international comparisons so that you could get a feel for how our healthcare spending compares to the rest and well, as [inaudible] percent, how mush more does the US spend on healthcare than the number two country in the world?"
"32%, say 30 percent were third higher."
"32%, say, 50 percent of quarter, say, 40%."
"Before we get there, who is the next highest country in the world?"
"It's Norway, that's right."
They are number two.
"And they spent we spent rough, they, we're at 50 percent higher than what they spend."
Look at this graph.
"It didn't have a clear designed aesthetic, it didn't have an approach to consumers."
So it was a very powerful product and if you couldn't figure out what was really the best user experience you'd build both and have a pref for it.
"It was known as loaded and overweight and technically good, but a poor product."
That was 2002.
"About a year later,"
AOL decided they were tired of investing in the browser.
"They still had, I don't know, 75 or a 150 people they were paying to work on the browser and they weren't really getting anywhere with it."
"At long last, they became interested in taking mozilla.org assets and giving them to those of us who'd been running the project."
"Again, to give you a sense of what life was like in those days, mozilla.org assets were the trademark, the name, mozilla.org, four big servers we fought for that ran all mozilla.org"
and some seed startup money.
That was really it.
"Yeah, Mick."
[Question]
That's definitely the timing.
"Yes, so that was why it may well have been."
What Mick said was
"""wasn't it the case that the reason AOL stopped investing in browsers and in Gecko is that they just completed a deal with Microsoft where they had agreed to use IE or the Microsoft rendering engine in their browser."""
Is that right?
"Yes, that's right."
"The AOL client, that I forgotten about."
So Microsoft managed to buy AOL out of their own browser effort.
But it was good for us.
"Because that didn't seem like a lot of assets, but it was really critical to us."
"We had thought before about starting our own effort at mozilla.org but without the name, it would have been really hard."
"And four giant servers doesn't seem like much today, but in that era it was a big deal."
"We also got some seed money from them, we got 2 million dollars."
That was a funny story too because
"I had ended up working with Mitch Kapor,"
"I don't know if you know, from Lotus, those who remember Lotus 1-2-3, and Mitch had come to see that open source was really important, after he left Lotus and he had his own open source organisation, and I was working with him."
And he really stepped in to help us.
So Mozilla has a history of things appearing when we need them.
"There is that saying that is it luck, or is it effort, or is it skill."
"We was at the Leoncito, working for my dad, and then we started riding horses, probably when I was 5 or 6 years old -- getting on some horses by ourselves, and my brother and I would go to the corral and rope the milk cow's calves and ride them."
Put the rope on and ride them.
We wanted to be cowboys.
The skills Charlie was acquiring to manage cattle and horses would later help him to compete in rodeos.
"When we were marking lambs, he used to tell us"
"leave 10 or 12 lambs outside, and talk about fun"
"I had for Welsh horses, and they were good."
"They'd just follow a lamb like a dog, you know."
"And we had those little maguey ropes and we used to rope them, and put one lamb in front of your saddle and rope another one, and then get two and take them to the corral and then go rope some more."
Rodeo is a Spanish word that referred to the semi-annual roundup of cattle borne from the Mexican ranching tradition.
I must have been 16-17 the first time I went on the roundup.
When they started the roundup they would call to see who was going to go.
They would come to town and ask you if you wanted to go to the roundup for 40-45 days.
"If you said yes, they would tell you what day they would pick you up."
"So you had to roll your bat, and have it ready."
"And your saddle, and they would come in the truck and pick you up."
"By the time we got gathered and getting close to where the camp was going to be the cook had lunch for us, coffee."
We changed horses to start sorting.
You always kept the best horses to sort cattle because you always used the best horses for the cutting.
You ride the broncs in the morning.
My uncle says that on the 06 ranch you could ride on horseback from dawn to dusk and never see a fence.
He started working in the first grade to help support the family and had dreams of buying the perfect horse to take him to the main event.
He learned quickly that if he didn't have a good horse there was no use in showing up.
They had this rodeo in Fort Davis.
There were college boys and I'm working on ranches.
We used to rope a lot of baby calves.
"I had the rope in my hand and this guy who used to go to Sul Ross, he says what are you going to do with that rope, Charlie?"
So I told him...I says
I'm going to beat you guys in the calf roping tomorrow.
This other guy had a nice calf horse and I used him.
So I went out there and roped this brahma calf and I went out there and flanked him and tied him.
And won the calf roping... with that raggedy rope.
"I had two speedlights in the background, one just hanging under the ceiling, attached to a ceiling lamp."
The other one standing on the floor.
"Both shooting into the background, exposing the background so that it's white."
The mannequin standing in the middle in front of it.
The main light coming from left and right.
It's exactly the same setup left and right.
It's a white shoot through umbrella at roughly a height of 1.60 meter.
"Both speedlights, left and right, are on 1/4th, and because I don't want to have a harsh contrast, (there should be nothing in the shadows),"
I also have a fill light right above the camera.
"It's also going through an umbrella, filling in whatever shadows there could be."
"The camera is just on standard settings 1/200s, f/11 for nice sharpness, ISO 200 for good quality."
And that's pretty much it.
"The white balance is set to ""flash"" however, don't trust the white balance."
"I mean, if you do catalogue photos you really really need to have an accurate white balance."
"So shoot with a grey card, ideally even shoot with a color calibration target"
like the color checker passport or something.
"But at least you need a neutral gray target like a gray card, or I used this gray cube and that helps for having exactly the correct white balance."
You really need that.
Alright.
What other tips to I have for you?
"Before you put the clothes onto the mannequin, iron them!"
Use a steam iron.
"It is so much easier to iron clothes, iron out the folds in the clothes with a steam iron than it is to iron them out in photoshop later on."
So do it upfront.
Another thing:
"When you are shooting trousers, put the mannequin up onto a stool."
"That way you don't shoot so much ground, the paper that you have on the ground or whatever floor there is, you are shooting the trousers against the white backdrop."
Just like you shoot the jumpers or the sweaters or whatever you have.
That's already it.
I mean it is really simple.
It's that simple.
"So if you haven't done such a shoot, now you don't have any excuse anymore."
A morning conversation with Andrew Feldmar
"In Vancouver, from where I've just arrived, a woman was being beaten and raped on the street a few weeks ago."
"It took place in a public place in broad daylight; and they were surrounded by a lot of people, who were simply watching them."
"Worse yet, those people were taking pictures of the attack; and the pictures were posted online within 15 minutes."
But nobody!
Nobody came to the lady's aid.
"Well, this is the comparison I see:"
"Agi Gereb is in prison, and life goes on as if nothing has happened."
Control
Over Life and Death
Bio-politics is exactly that
In those situations when I feel weakest: at the time of birth and death; when I lose my sanity or turn ill
"Who, besides me, will make decisions about my life in those situations?"
"It is unregulated; it is absolutely out of control at the moment But not only here, it is that way everywhere."
Instant Fashion
"Insurance companies want a kind of psychotherapy, which would heal us in three, four, five hours at most."
"Speed and efficiency are our newest fashions, and they are often tied to things that are good."
"But, then again Is it better to make love fast than doing it slow?"
Space
Time
Control
"The ancient Greeks had two words for time, one was called 'Kronos', which is our 'clock time' and the other is 'Kairos'."
Kairos is the point in time at which apricot ripens.
"The answer to the question 'When will we harvest the apricot?' is not 'Friday at five', but rather 'When it ripens'."
"Kronos was a giant, who ate his own children."
So even the ancient Greeks knew that measuring time with a clock is cruel.
It is absolutely cruel.
"Therefore, it is utterly cruel to speed up the birth process or induce it without waiting for the moment when the 'apricot ripens'."
Love and gentleness can never be effective in such regard.
When my daughter was born - our second child - the doctor was impatient to leave on a sailing trip; and he accused my wife of having a 'lazy uterus'.
He found it much too slow.
"And of course, he gave her Oxytocin and she was made to push the baby out very quickly."
For example what do Stanford alumni most want to see?
Sat scores.
"Winning state championships and, and national championships."
What is it?
What resources are considered most and
least important?
"On the other hand, does the availability or supply of the resource influence its value?"
Is the resource scarce?
Do only some of the other organizations have it?
How concentrated is the resource?
"Are there, are there alternatives to this resource."
Can another kind of resource be substituted for it.
Who else has it?
Let's consider Stanford again.
What does it offer?
"What, what does Stanford offer that is unique, that no one else can provide?"
It's an open question.
Leave it for the forum.
Discretion over a resource also defines relations of resource dependence.
Discretion is defined in at least two ways.
"First, who controls the resource?"
Can the exchange partner dictate how you use the resource?
Is the resource regulated by the government?
"So changing, districting to increase the resource or, or pool of available students for a particular school."
Is your firm dependent on the supplier for materials and funds?
Or is it dependent on consumers like students and families?
"Second, what controls dependencies?"
What laws are in place?
What are the copyrights or contracts and
licences that exist that prevent us from sharing certain curricula?
"So, for example, in this course I can only afford to use images from the Creative"
Commons.
"They, I'm sure you know, their paper has improved as a result of this."
"Right, right."
"So you know, that, that does not hurt."
"It's everybody's instinct, I think to at first be a little defensive when you get your review back."
Yeah.
Because you have to go back and.
Yeah.
Tweak the language a little bit.
"Right, right."
"To make sure your, you know polite."
"That's a good tip, yeah."
And can you give us some words of encouragement for young scientists who might have submitted their first paper and actually got an outright rejection?
"Can you, what are some words of encouragement?"
"Well, I would just say, fix it and if it's totally rejected by that journal, their not asking for resubmission, fix it."
"Try to respond to the reviewers comments that you feel are justified, and submit it elsewhere, and persist."
"I've had my, as an author, I've had to submit papers to as many as four journals til the, finally got accepted."
So I think persistence is important.
Don't take the rejection personally.
"It's hard not to, and I sometimes do, but you realize that some reviewers may not be very competent, may not really understand what you're doing."
This will often happen if you've submit[ted].
Epidemiologic paper and it gets reviewed by a clinician who does not really understand.
Um-hm.
Principles of epidemiology.
"They'll feel that if you write a paper about stroke if, if every case was not reviewed by a neurologist then it's not a valid paper."
Right.
"So or, or maybe they're competent but just had a bad day and, and didn't really pay close attention to what you wrote and miss some passages that really would have answered their questions."
"So just realize that reviewers are human, just like you just like authors and, And."
That's just the way the system works.
"Yeah, yeah."
It's not perfect.
And then talking about the system a little bit.
"You know, what changes do you anticipate are gonna occur in the publication process?"
"And as I learned how these other countries had either not allowed these ingredients, or insisted on labeling, believing that their citizens had a right to know about these ingredients in the food,"
I couldn't unlearn this information.
"And I know correlation isn't causation, but we have one of the highest cancer rates on the planet."
The American Academy of Pediatrics has linked pesticides to ADHD and hyperactivity in kids.
"And the President's Cancer Panel has recently urged all of us to reduce our exposure to these chemicals in an effort to try to prevent the onset of these diseases, which according to the New England Journal of Medicine is placing an increasing burden on our economy."
"And I got it, it was a business model."
"But at the same time, I couldn't unlearn this."
And I struggled with what people might call me.
I'd dismissed it as a hippie thing;
lifestyle of the rich and famous.
And I really didn't want to put my face on this movement.
"And yet I sat across the table one night from my husband and I said, ""I can't unlearn this."""
"And so we sat the kids down the next morning, and I said, ""You know how mom's learned about how we have all these ingredients in our food and we didn't know?"
"I'm going to have to try to teach others about it."""
"And one of the boys looked at me and he said,"
"""Mom, how many people are on your team?"""
(Laughter)
"And I said, ""Well, it's you four... and daddy."""
(Laughter)
"And he said, ""Mom, you need a bigger team."""
(Laughter)
"And people were telling me to reach out to Erin Brockovich; they were saying, ""You're food's Erin Brockovitch."""
And people were telling me to reach out to Bobby Kennedy because he was really involved with food politics.
"And I'm from a conservative family, (Laughter) and I thought, ""I can't."""
(Laughter)
"But at the same time, I thought, ""You know, I have to at least try, and I do have all of these type A genes."""
"And so I harnessed them, and I spent a couple of weeks around the Christmas of 2006 drafting a very short e-mail to Erin Brockovitch."
"And when she actually responded,"
"I thought, ""You know, maybe one person can make a difference."""
"Then later that spring, I took all of the data and of the research that I had done, and I spent a good two weeks in a Kinko's office binding it, and shipping it off to Bobby Kennedy."
"And when his Chief of Staff called, she had me on speakerphone."
"And to this day, I still don't know who was in that room, but she said,"
"Senator Harkin has been a key defender of the program, chairs the Senator Appropriations Subcommittee."
He will be retiring.
He will be here for two years.
"That's going to be a big, big change."
"In the House, Congressman Rehberg of Montana has been the chair."
Montana is a big CSBG state.
"It's a very, very important program there."
I think something like 10% of the population are beneficiaries of it.
"Of course Jim Nolan now retired, a great advocate for CSBG had helped with Congressman Rehberg who was defeated in his run for the Senate."
So the new Chair of the Labor HHS subcommittee is going to be very powerful for the future of CSBG.
"A gentleman by the name of Jack Kingston comes from Savannah, Georgia."
"How do you, Arley and Mark, see over the past several years, the approps process has unraveled."
CSBG has gone onto a continuing resolution which actually has helped CSBG because it forced all the cuts.
"What do you see happening this year with the change with Rehberg gone with a new Chairman who perhaps is not interested in CSBG to the degree that Rehberg was, how do you see that playing out in the approps process?"
"Arley: in working with CSBG, especially the last two or three years, because of Senator Tom Harkin and his support, and others in the Senate and people in the House, they concentrate a lot of their efforts in the Senate."
We know full well that Harkin and others in the Senate have held CSBG.
You know the
President wanted to cut it a couple years ago.
"Going forward, we know Senator Harkin was a big supporter."
"We know that he'll still be Chair of the subcommittee that he chairs, and we expect that there will be some strength there."
"The House has always been a bit more difficult to navigate, even before when David Obey was Chair, CSBG was also very well supported."
When Obey left it became a bit more trying.
Rehberg was a big supporter.
Kingston is a lot more frugal from what we can tell.
He's been a lot quicker to cut programs and cut overall federal spending.
We're beginning our meetings and our discussions with that new committee and with the new Chair as we begin to navigate the CSBG water.
It doesn't help us that the cut is coming from the administration.
"It's a very progressive, democratic administration that's saying that they want these cuts as well."
"It's an uphill battle, I will kid you not."
But we will pull out all the stops.
"Initially, I would say it's not favorable going in, but we remain optimistic at all times."
Brad:
"This stream cipher consumes in the beginning both a key and IV, as we've seen, but does a computation 100 times to produce an internal state that is then mapped onto the output that's then XORed with the message is basically the output message."
"Interesting is this part, though."
Each of these links is such a small computation that you can easily reverse it.
"It is nonlinear, meaning you cannot really reverse it without 100% certainty, but it's such a small computation that you can just kind of brute force the input space."
[Dave]
Okay. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Carson]
Right?
So little--
[Carson]
But the input space is small.
[Carson]
"Yeah, just a few bits change in each of these steps, so you can just go through all the possibilities of input space and see which ones map back to your output."
Right?
"Now, you may end up with several, so it's not always that only one of the inputs would have produced."
That's exactly the nonlinear property.
"However, this may look as a complication at first but does, in fact, help the hacker because each of these also generates a key for some given IV that you assume."
"Well, at least some."
Some may be dead ends.
But at least in a lot of cases you can track one point that you store in your table back to different keys. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
Different starting key IV pairs lead to the same output.
"Exactly, and on average, for each value that you store in the table you have 13 keys that you find every time."
Only one of them will be the correct one.
Sometimes even all 13 are wrong. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
[Carson]
But if you do find a key it will just be one of them.
"However, storing this point in the table is equivalent to storing 13 points in this table."
[Dave]
"Right, and now each lookup is the equivalent of doing 13 lookups."
[Carson]
"No, the lookup is actually the same effort, but the storage is decreased."
You loved me and I frozen in time

Professor Charles Bailyn:
"Okay, here's the plan for today."
I want to do one last foray into relativity theory.
"And this is going to be a tricky one, so I hope you're all feeling mentally strong this morning."
"If not, we--gosh, we should have ordered coffee for everyone."
"And, in so doing, I want to introduce one key concept, and also answer at least three of the questions that you guys have asked before in a more--in more depth, and also relate the whole thing back to black holes."
"And then, having done that, we'll have some more questions."
"And then, having done that, I want to get back to astronomy; that is to say, to things in the sky that actually manifest these relativistic effects."
"So, that's where we're going today."
"And along the way, as I said, we'll deal with some of the questions you've been asking in a deeper kind of way."
"In particular--so, questions."
Watch out for the answers to these questions.
No rumours were published.
"I know that sounds obvious, but it's not as easy as it sounds [laughter]."
"It's not that easy, and no rumours were published."
"The only rumour that was heard one day was whether something had happened to a kid in Barcelona, but they immediately rectified... that is if they actually ever published it."
"They said over and over that nothing had happened, and asked people not to spread rumours."
"And in the end, everything works through soft leadership, where anyone can do what they want as long as it's inspired in the collective, very interesting projects appear."
"Take the Square, the 15-O (october) from the beginning, Stop Evictions as a warning and alert platform when there are evictions..."
"Things start to happen that transcend the traditional strategy of communication in social movements, and they transcend the strategy of political communication of any self-respecting political organization, they would love to have the richness of communication that the 15M had."
ST:
"Not related to what you've been talking about just now, although maybe it does form part of it, I'd like you to tell me what has the 15M done wrong?"
JL:
(thinking)
I don't know what to say... because to personify it's hard.
What has the 15M done right?
"15M, since I'm convinced it doesn't move..."
ST:
I define the 15M as a state of mind.
JL:
Exactly.
You could say that the 15M is a state of mind.
But I understand what you're saying.
"The black spots, right?"
ST:
Yes.
Things that weren't pretty?
"There have been obvious mistakes, others less obvious, some of them that you have experienced..."
JL:
I understand the problem with the media.
"I understand perfectly the grudge, or if you prefer another word"
less contemptuous: the indignation against the media.
That indignation can't disappear in three days.
There is damage that the media has done in the poverty of everything.
"I really want to communicate a message with everybody, I'd just tell everybody."
I certainly wouldn't pick languages that die off and things that are temporary.
-Thomas Payne made a very good argument that god would never use anything written to communicate a message.
-I happen to agree.
Maybe god knows something that I don't.
Maybe there really is some benefit to vaguely inspiring inviduals to write down those important messages on manuscripts that get lost and destroyed in languages that change and die.
But somehow I've missed the obvious benefit of all that.
-Right.
"If god really wanted to do that, he could have."
"But apparently he was unaware of this technology when he wrote with his finger, according to the bible, on stone tablets, the 10 commandments."
This is in Exodus.
"Instead, he used magic lightweight invisible crumble-stone."
Where do we get that?
"Well, it's magic because he made it."
"It's lightweight because Moses carried, a 90-year-old guy, was carrying them up and down the mountains."
"-But back then, 90 was like 20."
-I guess so.
"And invisible because we don't have any trace of them today and crumble-stone because they all broke, supposedly."
And god seems to have some issues with metal.
He hates these molten calves that they make of images of little calves that people were worshipping.
And he just thinks that's really awful.
And this is one of your favorites.
"In Judges 1:19,"
"'And the lord was with Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.'"
Spooky.
Spooky.
"So, mostly likely the mythology surrounding the stone tablets was a coveting of some other stone tablets somewhere else, the Code of Hammurabi, dating to 1772 BCE, that currently exist, for real, unlike the stone tablets of Jewish"
law.
These are housed in the Louvre museum in Paris.
I've seen them.
"-Although to be fair, the 2nd set of stone tablets supposedly still exist, hidden away in the ark which supposedly still exists in a location that only the devout are aware of."
"Nice open format there, god."
"So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around, and particularly, we looked into the teeth of skulls, hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers, and we found much better quality DNA."
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.
It's there.
So we got it.
OK.
What could we do with this stuff?
"Well, George Church, in his book, ""Regenesis,"" has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA."
"We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form, and then, much like we've done with the Lazarus Project, get that stuff into an egg of a host species."
It has to be a different species.
What could it be?
Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?
"They're related, distantly, to thylacines."
And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end.
"Critics of this project say, hang on."
"Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?"
That's going to hurt.
"No, it's not."
These are marsupials.
They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.
That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
"It is, shortly, going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world, so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going."
Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time.
"And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing we want to think about."
"They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome, but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue-green in the mouse baby."
"In other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA, it would be able to be recognized."
"When the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues."
"And that tells us if we can get that genome back together, get it into a live cell, it's going to produce thylacine stuff."
Is this a risk?
You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal.
Are we going to get a Frankenstein?
Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?
And the answer is no.
"When I was studying in London, I took part in Malaysian and Singapore student organizations, and I dare say a couple of them were pretty radical."
"I thought they wanted to know my activities in London, for which I was mentally prepared."
"However, I began to feel disoriented after their repeated questions."
They kept wanting to know what instructions Tan Wah Piao had given me and what he had told me to do before I left London for home.
I was puzzled to say the least.
I knew not their target was Tan Wah Piow.
I did not know that there were so many people who had been hauled up.
Let me share with you this anecdote.
"I remember in the first few days of detention, our breakfast consisted of a boiled egg, two pieces of bread and a glass of tea with milk."
Almost the same everyday.
It could be the second day when I was one of the first to be served with breakfast.
I was jolted when I saw there were more than a dozen eggs in the bag the Gurkha adjutant was carrying.
I was stunned.
"Prior to this, I knew that one of my friends had also been taken in."
But I never thought there were so many people involved.
One of the detainees asked to see her lawyer.
The cold reply she got was:
"""Your lawyer has also been invited to ""have tea"" with us."""
"It shows how unprepared we were mentally, really!"
"It was strange that when I came to know they were spinning the yarn of a ""Marxist Conspiracy"","
I kind of sighed a heave of relief.
I surmised it must be another of those stories in Arabian Nights.
That same old story!
Why the ISD bigwigs decided to pick Tan Wah Piao as the vortex to get all of us sucked in.
I have yet to find a satisfactory answer!
I told one of the senior officers in ISD that I didn't know many of those arrested.
The answer given was:
"In a conspiracy, you needn't know all of the members involved!"
We may giggle at the reply given.
"But the stark reality is that the 1987 incident did act as a dreadful deterrent to more than a generation of Singaporeans, particularly the youth."
"For over 20 years, people were so wary of politics that they exercised all-round self-censorship."
"Even now, people still recall events in those years with considerable trepidation."
The letting go one is the hardest one for people to understand because they don't know what they're supposed to let go off.
"It's not letting go of the grief, it's letting go of the person that doesn't want the grief."
It's letting go of the controlling.
"Because sometimes when people have grief, disappointment, broken heart, anger, fear, when we try and do letting go we think letting go means destroying those emotions."
That's disrespect to those emotions.
"Instead, we let go of that person inside who's trying to do something about this, the controller, the one who says ""I don't want these emotions, I have to get rid of them""."
That's the thing we have to let go of.
The control-freak.
"So if you have those emotions inside of you and you try to suppress them, get rid of them, destroy them, of course what happens - they get worse."
"If you're fed up and you say ""I shouldn't be fed up"", that's what we call being fed up about being fed up."
[laughter].
We have something called suffering - the word for suffering in Buddhism is dukkha.
We call such things double-dukkha.
It's like I'm angry
"- ""I shouldn't be angry!"
"I'm a monk!""."
You're getting angry at being angry.
"You're depressed, and I'm fed up with being.., I don't want to be depressed anymore!"
You're being depressed about being depressed!
Or you're afraid of fear.
Those are called double-dukkha.
Double-suffering.
And of course from double-suffering we go into the next stage of treble-suffering.
[laughter].
I'm angry about being angry about being angry.
I'm so sad about being sad about being grieving.
Now this is actually what people do.
"They actually build it up by their reactions of trying to get rid of things, controlling things."
"The first part of the Buddhist reaction, the wise reaction, is just accept this is your reality."
"Let it go, let it be if you like."
"So stop messing around with these emotions in this moment, stop adding negativity to the emotions you're experiencing right now."
"If someone is grieving for the loss of a child, or they're disappointed because a relationship they cherished is no longer viable, or if they're afraid - be honest to that fear."
Not to win either in this life or in the hereafter
And his remain go to hell (audience clapping)
"""O son, our country looks like this oven which was cracked by mice """
The ruler is like the burning fire
The government is like firing

Many problems occurred after this poem
"We lost our jobs, and then we started traveling"
From Sinai to the southern side
By everything inside it
For 2 years &amp;amp; 8 months
Every kind of singing in Egypt (El Nubba_ El Gaafra) (Luxur-Carabek)

I wrote before them (Ahwa sada)- black coffee
"""Ahwa Sada"""
""" Black coffee for those who died in the foggy years"
"Those who died are ""we"""
Not the population of the grave
Black coffee for such a city without clouds
For the poor who sew the warm coats
From mirage
Black coffee for virgin who bear depression
Black coffee for old branches
That its water is youth!
Black coffee with bitter test that injures throat
"Black coffee for the streets, that can't accommodate us"
"O nation, as long as your dream not from our heart,"
"As long as any dog barking shaking us,"
But you still can have a circle of 35.
The circle comes from indigenous people's.
It is a long tradition and this is the most healing way that we can actually be together.
"I am a strong believer  in the circle but also using other variety in things like tribes which is a way to do small groups, and there are kinds of support  mechanisms for that."
Those are just a few little things that I would say.
"-(Man) That last one you said, a tribe?"
"- (J. Miller) Tribes, yes."
Jeanne Gibbs has written a book called 'Tribes'.
Many of our teachers in Ontario  and Toronto are using it.
It is a powerful technique for dealing with large groups and breaking things down.
It gives a guideline to how small groups can work.
Because you can't just put students in small groups and then give them a framework.
(J. Bell) I would like to offer another idea.
Sometimes I've seen teachers  scratch their heads.
What should we do about this issue  when the answers are among students?
"I think if we change our model from thinking we have to control and set it up to saying, ""We are building  a community together."""
"This takes a lot of time up front, setting the rules together, making contracts, agreements for each other, how do we want to treat each other, to talk with each other."
Establish all those things.
"What if somebody doesn't talk like that,  what should happen?"
"We should bring that up, how should  we handle 'the discipline' issues."
"If you create a collective experience, they are getting that sense of ownership, of democratic decision making, a being mindful of how their behavior is part of the mix."
It is much more and you have much less behavior problems if you have 35 students helping  to create the classroom culture.
There are lots of other things.
The use of constant appreciations and shout-outs.
What I noticed Tommy doing well the other day.
"Jose, how did he do well as a leader."
Keep building it a constant thing so they are inoculated with a sense of loving speech and respect and cooperation in the classroom.
It doesn't eliminate every problem  but it goes a long ways.
(Half bell)
(Bell)
(Man in the audience) I am trying to still sort my thoughts as what exactly my question is.
Thank you first of all for the panel.
Question from Diane.
I noticed some attendees at the NASCSP conference asked how they could apply for Promise Neighborhood funds.
Are you seeing more of this happening in the CAA network?
Mark: there are a couple of agencies that are receiving/applying for Promise Neighborhood funds.
I don't know that I've seen a lot of increases in this.
Promise funds are a relatively smaller program right now and it has a very specific focus.
"I have not seen a large number of agencies that are looking at this as a source of funds, but it certainly is similar work to what a lot of agencies are doing."
Brad:
"Bob Scott, are you still with us?"
Bob:
I am.
Brad:
"Bob thanks for being patient through this very long discussion, and as we approach the end, having heard what we said earlier regarding the FY ""13, we hope to hear on the reallocation within a matter of days on FY ""14."
What are your thoughts?
Where do you see the program right now in terms of funding?
Bob:
"Well, I still think that we're at levels below what is really needed to sustain a national weatherization program, and I hope we can make that impression on Congress that $184 million minus a possible $24 million for the multi-family initiative will not keep maintaining this program."
Can we survive 2013 on $68 million plus whatever might be added by DOE?
Perhaps we can.
"I'd like to think we can, but it's only a matter of time before these types of numbers destroy the network."
"We're on very thin ice with it and I hope something can change, and we'll be working to do that."
We need to at least get to those pre-recovery act levels of $225 million.
So I hope we can get by.
"I think most states can hang on for another year, but I think the term, ""we could get starved to death"" is a good way of putting it."
It's certainly something that I fear and hope we can change.
Brad:
Certainly our strategy is to get the funding back to the pre-recovery act levels.
We're talking with
"Senators Reed and Collins right now about an ask in the range of $225 million for FY ""14."
"Elyse was with us Earlier, Senator Reed's Legislative Director, and when she referred to the member request letter, that's where we're having the conversations right now."
And we're looking at the figure right in the range of $225 million.
That's where strategy is.
I'd like to thank Beth for her presentation today as well as Robin Riat for helping to monitor today's briefing.

[crowd chanting]
Stand for the people!
Don't take from the people!
The people are oppressed!
Police your area.
"[yelling, indistinct]"
Everyone has something at their core that they're really upset about.
And here at least it seems that it's all molding together to be like a structural change.
That's what people have been working on.
That's what the general assemblies are here.
"That's why the working groups are forming, so that people can go into a specific corner like sanitation or environmental, or whatever, and start forming their own demands."
Right now we're just practicing first aid on people.
"You know, some people are hurting their feet, or, you know, hurting their ankles, we give out ice packs and stuff, but that's really all we're allowed to do."
"And if we feel someone needs to go the the hospital, we'll call for them and send them there."
"These medical supplies came from all over the country, people donated them."
We got a big shipment in on Tuesday.
"You know, they really sent a lot of stuff, which was, like, heartwarming."
This is the comfort station.
"Essentially we provide warm, dry cloththing, tents, blankets, we have men's socks, women's socks, men's shirts, women's shirts, men's pants, women's pants, umbrellas, tarp, everything to keep everyone comfortable while they're camping out here."
"Makes no sense that one percent of the population owns sixty percent of the wealth,"
"It makes no sense that people are trying to live the American dream and they go to college, and kids are knee-deep in debt, and they can't find jobs, so that's why I'm here."
We're basically feeding everyone.
"I don't know, I feel like my mindfulness practice brings me closer to this conversation."
"I have to teach, right."
The curriculum is not outside of this.
"There are ways that we can definitely skillfully use curriculum, the choices that we make, so that they nourish the young people."
"We don't just cover them with stuff,  this is the thing, we just deliver the lesson with this type  of languages that we have in the school."
I am just sharing here.
I think there is this moment where touching and  really looking clearly at what is there.
"And then, that also begins to tells us  what is not there."
That begins to inform our practice in terms of other ways of being that we can occupy and  what we can offer into the classroom in the midst of the essay and  the pre-writing and the brainstorming and all the things that we are doing.
"I work in an English reading  and writing classroom, so I have been looking at how mindfulness is an expression of literacy of reading."
"What do you see,  what do I see as a teacher."
Do I see just a student?
Or do I see somebody that I don't like?
"Do I see my own perceptions,  and live through those perceptions?"
What am I listening to?
What can I hear?
Do I even have the space to hear?
Maybe I feel really overwhelmed.
So I just hear the noise and I get aggravated and I lash out.
"I think, I am using my professional practice and the language around teaching or the educationist things and trying to disrupt that a little bit,  to try to wrestle it back."
Just like we are doing here.
"We are trying to reclaim walking  so that it is nourishing for us. and not just this thing that ends up  wasting our energy, aggravating it."
"So, in your classrooms, all the things that you do in your classrooms, so many tests right, just to even started in the day."
"When you get into your classroom, what are some things you can do to re-purpose, re-energize, re-use, re-strategize,  deal, adapt that moment for yourself."
"So for instance,  we just got new computers, so I have to check them everyday."
So I can make that really aggravating for myself.
"Or I can sit, get my chair and sit there and breathe and take my time, right?"
"I sweep in my classroom, this is one thing I have to do."
"But you know,do I get angry, ""The kids, they don't know the trash can"", etc."
(Laughter)
"Or I take my time, I don't have to think, right?"
Even better.
"I can go only one way, there's 2 exits, there's one in the lower left corner and there's one in the upper right."
"And as you saw, the maze itself will turn according to where the ball is positioned, so you have a better view of where you are and where you're going to."
You will also notice there are green cubes and there are red cubes.
"The red cubes are those that can't be accessed, and the green cubes can be accessed."
"What I didn't put into this maze but is possible, are one-way cubes: you can go into them one way, but you can't come out of them the same way (you can't go back)."
What I didn't put into them are prison cubes: you can go into them but you can't get out.
"And what I didn't put into the maze are rewards, where I need to hunt through the entire maze, to collect rewards before I am allowed to leave."
That's all possible in the proof of concept.
"And of course, I can go back to the original position of the ball."
"In the mean time, there's a position counter here that says where I am, that shows in which bar and cube I am."
"I'm now in bar 18 cube 1, when I go up I'm in bar 19, still cube 1."
I go back:
I wind up in cube 0.
"I go up: and I wind up in 0.0, which is exactly where I need to be."
That's it.
I hope you enjoyed this.

We begin to pursuit the way to each other
Looking for live together with each other
Each of us always having question and looking for the answer
When we will meet each other?
No matter how long distance from here
Or passing through endless time
The remaining time of my life
I knew and believed that we will be together
Where are you?
And who you are?
Where are you?
I'm waiting for you... you really exist in my faith
We are born this way.... to be each other's soul mate
This is the instruction from above
Bestowed to us and across in someday this life
"God was throwing thunderbolts down like Zeus in the cartoons, but churches, they built churches on hills as shining beacons."
"And, as such, they attracted lightning bolts."
"And when these churches were hit by lightning, it often destroyed them, and a lot of bellringers got killed from that lighning."
"And the clergy, who were doing their best to suck up to god were at a loss to explain how this was going on."
What was happening here?
Why did god dislike them so much?
"So, based on his understanding of electricity, Ben Franklin, who was a deist, solved the problem with his lightning rod, and his lightning redirection system in 1749."
"And, today, all churches, lo and behold, have lightning rods."
"Yet, they claim god is still protecting them."
I find that amusing.
What about rainbows?
"Well, in Genesis 9:11, we have god talking to Noah."
This is right after the flood.
"And god says, 'And I will my covenant with you."
Neither shall flesh be cut anymore by the waters of the flood.
"Neither shall there be flood to destroy the earth.' And god said,"
"'This is a token of my covenant, which I make between me and you and every"
living creature that is with you for perpetual generations.
"I do set my bow on the cloud, and it shall be forever a token of the covenant between me and the earth.'"
"So, according to the bible, rainbows are a remembrance of god's promise not to kill everything on the planet again."
-Promise not to kill again with a flood.
He can kill it again in other ways.
- Okay.
"And you can contrast this rather silly kindof creepy story with the Feynman lectures on physics, where Richard Feynman explained how and why rainbows appear the way they do."
"And he worked out the angles and the diffraction of the light and all this good stuff, and there's no psychopathic connotations and there's a lot of beauty."
And that's what science has done instead.
"So, materials science."
"So, say you're god and you wanted to communicate a message to humanity."
"And if you wanted to write something on a slate or a tablet, and you wanted it to last for centuries, you might use sapphire-coated titanium."
That might be a good choice for a writing surface to send a message.
-I'm down with that.
"The thing is I'm pretty sure if I'm a god, and"
This discotheque owner is also DJ in order to save money.
The only cost for music is the two percent to composer and lyricist.
A cost of no more than SEK 200 a night.
A popular orchestra would cost tenfold.
-Most of them refuse to play disco music.
The play socially critical music you can't dance to.
They are welcome to play that but then they can expect to be unemployed.
-We've tried the last two or three years to play seventy percent disco music but it is apparently not enough.
-The new technology is here to stay.
"It has many advantages in terms of stimulating the music scene, interest in music and so on -"
- but it can't serve as an alternative to a job outcompeting the live music.
"Beer to thirsty disco dancers, but now the Musician's union want to retract liquor licenses to dance halls who don't play live music."
-I refuse to play music my guests at large does not want to deal with and then some bastard blackmail me and take away my rights.
It is the part of Swedish society today that I must strongly protest against.
Also amusement parks begins to stop using dance bands.
This weekend saw the premiere of the dance to video discotheques and the Musicians' union advice all artists to not participate in these kinds of video recordings.
No aunty I can't do it
What is it that you're worried about and can't do? you will go on stage and sing the songs that you know say couple sentences and you will be done she's right we will do what we usually do in weddings

All what is happening to us is because of Cobra
If you want I will go on stage.. you can't do it
No don't intervene in this matter.. we've everything under control just sit here
We'll spin and shake our waist twice then we'll be done how can this happen Aunt kadriyeh it can.. it can
Everyone is waiting for you sisters they didn't die yet! you don't leave an artist speaks two sentences here..

Mini-Mobile Concerts project entails musicians who play on the streets
"We play not in a cafe or a certain space but on a street corner, next to a bus station, a train station..."
"The musicians in Egypt, or in Alexandria, are very talented and people would like to listen to them"
"However, the market does not give them the opportunity, people do not have access to them"
At the end there is a miss-communication happening
"What is happening on our streets is that they are full of noise full of headache, and full of harmful sights this makes us all agitated and impatient with each other we get angry at each other too we think we need music on the streets good music that can really reach our hearts to calm us"
"The project's idea began in 2011, and the first concert was hosted in April 2012"
"And we had 15 concerts during three months and we started again since January 2013 and the first concert was at the end of March and here we are now, and we plan to host 50 concerts"
"Independent musicians, or the musicians presenting an art that is not necessarily targeted but is unique and original to be known more because people like them and the idea is not that people don't like them but it is that people do not know this art exists we made a website www.eventsrun.com so that when people on the streets like this music they have a way to reach those musicians again because they don't know where these concerts take place or when they are hosted the idea from this website is to present the different events happening in each city so you can go on the site and see what is happening in Cairo on any giving day as an example and you can know the different spaces that have music so you can attend something similar to what you saw on the streets"
Hi guys!
Hi everyone!
I'm Jana
I'm Ju!
Jana:
So the time has come for us to talk about our favorites of the month!
August!
"An emergency fund could take the form of cash, checking accounts, savings account money market funds or even certificate deposits at a bank or a credit union."
"These funds, should not be subject to any sort of major market risk."
"Some people might consider equity in their house or access to their credit part of their emergency fund, but, still a foundation of cash and cash equivelants is, is, still the best and very important, because access to credit could suddenly dry up or be hard to get in an emergency."
An emergency fund is also vital to tapping into assets I'm sorry emergency fund is also vital to avoid tapping into assets that may have been earmarked for your long-term goals.
"In the next lesson, we'll talk about setting some financial goals."
"Have you ever stood naked, in front of the mirror?"
And looked at yourself?
I mean really looked
I did.
This morning
How was it?
Completely horrifying
Guys have it so easy.
"The expectations for a woman are hellish, Harrison"
"You go into a store with raving PMS zits*, and you turn, and who do you see staring at you?* 17 magazine cover girl."
She has perfect skin and one of those killer bodies you see in late night abs crunch machine commerical*
So you buy baskets of products and go home and sweat to the oldies*
But it eventually dawns on you.
"You'll never be a 17 girl, because they don't allow airbrushing* in real life"
"You know Sam, I'm not saying because we are friends* but"
"Sometimes, under the right light* you totally escape troll status"
Am I foxier than Brook McQueen
Let's go Sam.
Time to get up
And what was I thinking planning that cruise!?
What am I doing?
I'm not going
"Oh, you're going Mom."
You've been planning this for a years
"I've ironed the shorts, you were looking forward last night."
They're already packed.*
"Shorts packed, check"
I'm going to show you one last technique.
"And in fact, we're going to put quotes around the word better, but it does better than even this kind of binary search, and that's a method called hashing."
"You've actually seen hashing, you just don't know it."
Hashing is the the technique that's used in Python to represent dictionaries.
Hashing is used when you actually come in to Logan
Airport and Immigration or Homeland Security checks your picture against a database.
Hashing is used every time you enter a password into a system.
So what in the world is hashing?
"Well, let me start with a simple little example."
Suppose I want to represent a collection of integers.
This is an easy little example.
And I promise you that the integers are never going to be anything other than between the range of zero to nine.
"OK, so it might be the collection of one and five."
"It might be two, three, four, eight."
"I mean some collection of integers, but I guarantee you it's between zero and nine."
Here's the trick I can play.
"I can build -- I can't count -- I could build a list with spots for all of those elements, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
"And then when I want to create my set, I could simply put a one everywhere that that integer falls."
"So if I wanted to represent, for example, this is the set two, six and eight, I put a one in those slots."
"This seems a little weird, but bear with me for second, in fact, I've given you a little piece a code to do it, which is the next piece of code on the hand out."
So let's take a look at it for second.
This little set of code here from create insert and number.
What's create do?
"It says, given a low and a high range, in this case it would be zero to nine."
I'm going to build a list.
"Right, you can see that little loop going through there."
What am I doing?
I'm creating a list with just that special symbol none in it.
So I'm building the list.
I'm returning that as my set.
"And then to create the object, I'll simply do a set of inserts."
"If I want the values two, six and eight in there, I would do an insert of two into that set, an insert of six into that set, and an insert of eight into the set."
"And maybe eh, the star goes first so he sets the balance to 100, 500 minus 400."
"And then the buffalo sets the balance to negative 200, 100 minus 300."
And you know what we just did?
We just robbed the bank.
[LAUGH]
And then they both report true and you've got 200 dollars ahead.
"And that's not to good Actually BYOB will try to stop most of these, and this case it does."
There's no raised condition here because
"BYOB fixes it but this code does create race case, Race Condition."
There're two more problems of concurency problems that we want to talk about.
The first one is a deadlock.
The two people or multiple threads or multiple cores are trying to grab the same information but they won't give up the information that the other needs.
"So in this case, eh, two people are, need to draw a graph and one grabs the pencil, the other grabs the paper and the guy with the pencil wont let go of his pencil until he gets the paper and draws his graph."
And the guy with the paper wont let go of the paper until he gets the pencil.
"And they're just stuck there, always waiting, and that's not to good."
There's also this image of these cars that none of them can move forward because there's a car in front of them.
"I think if this guy got out it would slowly get fixed, but it's a bit hard."
[LAUGH].
"Similarly, there's a livelock."
"When, deadlocks are very common and eh,"
"You say, okay if you've got the pencil or the paper and you can't get the other one maybe you can put yours down for a minute and come back, and that's a good way to solve it right?"
"But what happens if both people, one grabs the pencil, one grabs the paper and tries to grab the other one but they can't."
"So they both put it down at the same time, they both go away for a minute, they both come back, grab the same one and they can't get the other one again."
"So they put it down, go away, they come back and they still can't do it."
And that's a livelock.
"You're trying to get rid of it and, but because your algorithm eh, keeps matching itself, it actually doesn't work."
"The other very common example eh, that we love, and I'll let Dan and Luke show it to you guys when they do, is that if two people are trying to pass each other in a hallway sometimes you both lean in the same way and then the other, but livelock is that you infinitely do this."
That you just can't get out.
You're stuck in the hallway all night.
What to do?
Cool.
"So in summary this move to parallelism is a big sea"" change""."
"Several core members of the TED community, during what was a 2-year transition process, really got behind it, Jeff Bezos, John Doerr, Sunny Bates,"
"Linda Stone, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and -- actually some people in this room who I won't embarrass, but thank you -- really swung the community around to believing that TED could go on."
"And so, the first event did pretty much sell out well ahead of time."
"As a junior at 2003, there was one of the things that I felt like really needed to happen."
"I felt like this sense of inspiration and possibility that always hit people at TED, we just needed to do something with that."
There was so much potential there to make a difference in the real world.
What could we do?
"So, at the end of TED 2003,"
"I urged the audience to consider getting behind some of these big, wild causes"
"like AlDS, fresh water, you know,  the ocean's crisis."
"And, some people loved it."
"And, some really didn't."
"I mean, the truth is, one person's cause is another person's ""Dear God, please shoot me now""."
"And, it is!"
"In a conference filled on how people re-discover wonder, a sense of possibility, curiosity, you have to be really careful what you kind of do that might be perceived as cramming something down someone's throat."
"So, a few longstanding members of the TED community were thorouly pissed off, and actually left. and I thought I might have blown it."
"However, that little kerfuffle led to something very special."
"A group of us went away for a weekend, and we brain-stormed about, look, there's got to be a way to do this."
This stuff really matters.
"It's actually, inherently, quite interesting"
How do we bring to it to TED in a more TED-like way?
"And, what that led to was this."
"So, every year, we bring 3 remarkable people to TED and give them this unique proposition."
Come and make a wish.
Tell us your dream.
You can make one wish without restriction.
"This process has, first of all, allowed us to bring people to TED we could never have brought."
"Second, it brought to the conference, the world biggest issues in a way that seemed different, magical, exciting, and in a way which led to an extraordinary range of collaborative projects that frankly wouldn't have happened in any other way."
"One is ""One.org."""
"Cameron Sinclair is in the room actually, TED prize winner, Cameron."
Where are you?
Here you go.
And then this 1 is right over here.
"So now, I think we are ready to think about what would happen if we wanted to make 50 houses."
So let's try to do that.
Let me do that in orange.
This right over here is our 50th house.
So this is the shared left wall it has.
This is the 50th house right over here.
So how many total toothpicks for 50 houses?
"So if we have 50 houses, well, we can use the pattern that we came up with."
"It's going to be equal to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6."
"And then we're going to add 5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each incremental house."
And how many incremental houses are there going to be?
"Well, there are going to be 50 minus 1 incremental houses."
Why minus 1?
"Well, you already built one of them with the 6."
Then for every extra one-- so there's going to be 49 extra houses-- you're going to add 5 toothpicks apiece.
So this is going to be equal to 6 plus 5 times 49.
And that is 245.
So 6 plus 245 is equal to 251 sticks.
And what's really neat about this pattern we just came up with is you could use it to figure out how many sticks you would need for a million of these little toothpick townhouses.
What is hypothesis testing in the constant expected return models?
So what are the kinds of things that we can test hypotheses about?
"So our model says continuously compounded returns are equal to a constant mean return plus a random, noise component that represents news that enters the market."
"This noise component is assumed to be, independent identically distributed as a normal random variable with mean zero and a constant volatility."
"And we also assume that covariances, contemporary covariances between assets are constant."
As well.
So there are a number of things that we could test in this model.
So here are some examples of. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Possibly interesting hypothesis test.
We can test for specific values.
"For example, we can test hypothesis that the mean return is equal to some particular value."
For example we can say we want to test hypotheses that the mean return on
Microsoft is two percent per month.
Which blueprint they follow depends on the weather.
"If their pond remains full... the harmless small heads dominate, feeding on plankton."
"But if the summer rains fail, a shrinking pond means more big heads."
"Armed with curved teeth and strong jaws, the big heads feast on the defenseless plankton eaters."
The big heads become so bloated they can barely swim.
But this is gluttony with a purpose.
"As the drought worsens, the pond shrinks."
And the explosive growth of the cannibals pays off.
Skin toughens.
Gills disappear.
Lungs grow.
The bigheads are air-breathing adults.
The tiger salamander walks into number 7 because it turns cannibalism into a sophisticated insurance policy.
But eating each other is a short term survival solution.
"Some animals can go without food for months, or years, or decades!"
NARRATOR:
The Arctic.
One of the harshest environments on Earth.
"In winter, temperatures plunge to -50 degrees."
One animal sleeps in the storm.
The polar bear.
It survives in the frozen wilderness by saving energy.
"The polar bear looks white, but its skin is black and absorbs heat."
There are two layers of fur-- a soft undercoat; and guard hairs up to 6 inches long.
"The fur, coupled with a thick layer of fat, is such an efficient insulator that a bear loses little heat."
"Look through an infrared thermal imaging camera, and a polar bear is almost invisible, appearing little warmer than the frozen land."
"Wrapped in the ultimate survival suit, males spend their lives exposed to the elements."
Pregnant females use a different strategy.
"At the start of winter, they disappear--underground."
"Outside, a male wanders far in search of food."
"Inside, a female travels through time."
She slows her metabolism and sleeps.
"""I think everyone at some point in their life has felt like they don't belong to something."
"They're not being set apart, they are included in what every other kid they see gets to do."""
"There are more than 80 Sparkle teams all across the country, but those are only in middle school and high school."
"Here at UW Platteville, this is the first Sparkle squad at the collegiate level."
"""It's actually really fulfilling."""
Nate Stikes is a cheerleader and a mentor for one of the Sparkles.
"He's never worked with special needs kids before, and he was nervous at first, but that feeling quickly went away."
"""There's really nothing like it"
"I just see in their eyes that this is the most fun that they've had and they love every minute of it, and that's what makes doing it worth it, is seeing the smiles on their faces."""
"""Kids with disabilities are just like everybody else, and don't be afraid of them."""
Mitch says the program has had a profound impact on her life as well.
"""The first couple practices I'll admit I left and I was just so overwhelmed, I was in tears, and now I leave and I'm just smiling."
"The joy and excitement and the pleasure they get out of this, and their parents..."
"I still tear up a little bit because it's amazing."""
This team is special because each and every member makes it sparkle.
"""To know them and meet them is to love them."
"And you meet these kids for ten minutes, you're going to fall in love with every one of them."""
Stéphane (ST):
"Juanlu, thank you for coming"
First I'd like to ask you to give a brief presentation; who you are and what you do.
Juanlu (JL):
"My name is Juan Luis Sánchez, I'm a journalist and I'm one of the people who started periodismohumano.com"
"And, well, we were in the Puerta del Sol from beginning to end"
And we try to follow what has been happening around the 15-M phenomena before it was called that.
ST:
"Yes, afterwards we will ask you in detail about the coverage you gave to that."
"The first question is ""THE question""."
"I'd like you to tell us, from your point of view, what is the 15-M movement?"
JL:
"I think the 15-M was, for many weeks, a physical space where people could share ideas, that came from a non-physical space, a virtual space, from the net, from indignation."
"And all that soon spilled out from internet onto the street, and people started talking about politics, and that it should be OK to talk about politics, and come up with a common diagnosis to society's problems."
"Global problems, not just local."
One last thing about prerequisites.
Algebra and Statistics are other formal subject matters that we need and I think even this for everything.
"With so much data available on anything under the sun, knowing Algebra and Statistics is very important, and I hope my treatment of the s ubject matter will motivate you to learn a lot more."
Rather than seeing it as a hurdle to understanding things.
So these are the formal things you could think about.
But don't worry about it.
"As I said, if you have curiousity and a bad attitude."
"And a bad attitude is one which says, you know, give me anything."
"I'll, I'll handle it."
"If you have that attitude, you will do very well in this class, and you'll learn a ton."
"Not just in this class, in life."
"And so, bring that attitude, and we'll be fine."
"Now, I'll talk about something that's very important and it's called Pedagogy."
How do I conduct the class?
"This class, because of the value of Finance being both theory, framework, and practical, is all driven by problem solving."
"I will always force you to do problems, because that's how you learn."
What does that mean?
Everything I introduce in class will not be preceded by a formula.
"Finance is a lot of Algebra, a"
lot of formulas but I will always tell you why we are doing something not what it's all about.
"Why is far more important in life than the what, the what you can"
Google right?
"So if you can Google and get what I'm providing you in the class, I'm not providing you much."
"So because Finance is applied, we'll emphasize problem solving, and everything will be introduced with an example."
"However, I want you to recognize that you have to do most of the work."
"I'm a coach, you have to do the work."
"I hope I'm a good coach and I motivate you and give you the main issues you need to worry about, right?"
"In life, there are not that many issues, four or five."
One is love.
"The rest is, kinda follows a little bit."
Number two is financing my book.
"But anyway, so you'll be doing assignments every week and I encourage you whether they're called quizzes or not, quizzes or assignment, do them."
I tell it every time
"Now you're all here for eternity which I hardly need to tell you is a heck of a long time, so you'll all know each other pretty well by the end"
"But for now I'll have to split you up into groups, will you stop screaming? thank you"
"Now murderers? murderers over here please, thank you"
"Looters and pillagers over here, thieves if you could join them, and lawyers, you're in that one"
"Fornecators, if you step forward, by god there are a lot of you"
Can I just split you up into adulterers and the rest male adulterers if you could just form a line in front of that small gillotine in the corner
"The french, are you here?"
If you'd just like to come here with the germans
I'm sure you'll have plenty to talk about
Ateists
"Ateists over here please, you must be feeling a right bunch of nitwits"
And finally Christians
I'm afraid the jews were right
"Are there any questions? yes? no, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets"
"If you've read your Bible, you'I notice it was damnation without relief so if you didn't go before you came, I don't belive you'll enjoy yourself very much"
But I believe that's the idea
"OK, so it's over to you, Adolf, and I'll catch you all later at the BBQ, bye"
well this is a plane is this a UFO?
"This is my uncle, Charlie Rodriguez and that's his horse, Lucky."
My Uncle Charlie has won all-around cowboy at the Fortuna Rodeo more times than he can remember.
"In fact, he won three consecutive years in the 1990s."
"Charlie's won buckles for calf roping, calf branding, team roping, team penning, wild cow milking, and steer wrestling."
(music)
"Charlie was born into the vaquero tradition in Fort Davis, Texas."
This is a style of horsemanship based on respect and communication between horse and rider.
Now everyone knows that cattle were not indigenous to America.
"It is rumored that in 1521, a Spanish sea captain, Gregorio Villa Lobos, set sail for"
"Vera Cruz, Mexico, with six cows and a bull."
"Along with the introduction of the cow the Spanish also introduced Vaquero working skills, which were further developed in Mexico and became the foundation for the cattle ranching culture in Texas, which brings us to the place where Charlie got his start: the Kokernot 06 Ranch."
My grandfather worked for the 06 for 45 years.
He was the main boss.
And we did find a lot of stuff.
"We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex."
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
"It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex."
"And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16."
"We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet."
But this one died at the age of 16.
"We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone."
"Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant."
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
"She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid."
"Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left."
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
"There were flexible, clear blood vessels."
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
It was extraordinary.
"But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones."
"And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins."
"But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground."
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
"And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples."
And we did.
We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
"I mean, it was wonderful stuff."
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
"So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast."
"We're just not going to be able to do what they did in ""Jurassic Park."""

The President:
It's nice having your own band.
"Please have a seat, everyone."
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
"Thank you, Secretary Salazar, for that introduction and for your hard work to preserve and protect our land and our water and our wildlife."
"I also want to thank Minister Rogers for the beautiful invocation, as well as Neil Mulholland and everyone at the"
National Park Foundation and the National Park Service who helped put this outstanding event together.
"I'd like to thank Carson Daly and Big Time Rush, and all of tonight's performers for joining us to kick off the holiday season here at the White House."
"For 89 years, Presidents and Americans have come together to"
light the National Christmas Tree.
And this year is a special one.
"This year, we have a brand new tree."
The last one stood here for more than 30 years -- until we lost it in a storm earlier this year.
But we all know that this tradition is much larger than any single tree.
"And tonight, once again, we gather here not simply to light some decorations, but to honor a story that lights the world."
"More than 2,000 years ago, a child was born to two faithful travelers who could find rest only in a stable, among the cattle and the sheep."
But this was not just any child.
Christ's birth made the angels rejoice and attracted shepherds and kings from afar.
He was a manifestation of God's love for us.
"And He grew up to become a leader with a servant's heart who taught us a message as simple as it is powerful: that we should love God, and love our neighbor as ourselves."
That teaching has come to encircle the globe.
It has endured for generations.
"And today, it lies at the heart of my Christian faith and that of millions of Americans."
"No matter who we are, or where we come from, or how we worship, it's a message that can unite all of us on this holiday season."
"So long as the gifts and the parties are happening, it's important for us to keep in mind the central message of this season, and keep Christ's words not only in our thoughts, but also in our deeds."
"In this season of hope, let's help those who need it most -- the homeless, the hungry, the sick and shut in."
"In this season of plenty, let's reach out to those who struggle to find work or provide for their families."
"In this season of generosity, let's give thanks and honor to our troops and our veterans, and their families who've sacrificed so much for us."
And let's welcome all those who are happily coming home.
(applause)
"At this time though, the end results are dark in the viewport."
"Unlike Mental Mill, 3ds Max does not have a ""Brightness"" shader."
"Instead, you use the Gamma/Gain shader from the mental ray maps rollout."
You need to insert that node by dragging &amp;amp; dropping it on the connection  between the Phong illumination Node and the Map to Conversion node.
You can then adjust the Gamma/Gain parameters to suit your liking.
"If you wish, create a similar shader tree for the eyes,  using the supplied bitmaps."
"As you can see, building metaSL shader trees in 3ds Max  is a simple process."
It is not as elaborate as Mental Mill but does provide you  with the basic tools to build simple shader trees.
"If you are interested in Mental Mill, you can view the How-To movie  entitled:"
How to Use Mental Mill.
I do want to test this question we're all interested in:
Does extinction have to be forever?
I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about.
One is the Thylacine Project.
"The other one is the Lazarus Project, and that's focused on the gastric-brooding frog."
"And it would be a fair question to ask, why have we focused on these two animals?"
"Well, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own."
We've lost a whole family.
That's a big chunk of the global genome gone.
I'd like it back.
The second reason is that we killed these things.
"In the case of the thylacine, regrettably, we shot every one that we saw."
We slaughtered them.
"In the case of the gastric-brooding frog, we may have ""fungicided"" it to death."
"There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus, and it's nailing frogs all over the world."
"We think that's probably what got this frog, and humans are spreading this fungus."
"And this introduces a very important ethical point, and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up."
"What I think is important is that, if it's clear that we exterminated these species, then I think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it, but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something, if we can."
OK.
Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project.
It's a frog.
"And you think, frog."
Spent the whole day running around the museum.
It was awesome.
I had a wonderful time.
- I went to the Secular Student Alliance Leadership Conference in Columbus where I helped poison the minds of the current and future leaders of the secular movement.
- Good for you.
- All in a day's work.
- Okay.
The devil must be very happy.
- Yes!
"- Today I have yet another installment of my Failures of Chritianity series, and I've"
"- Which we could do forever, by the way."
- That's right.
So we're just scratching the surface.
I'm up to number 8 today.
"The idea here is there's so many failures, how could there possibly be a god behind all this?"
Or maybe there is.
I don't know.
"Previously, I've talked about the failure of christian based abortion policy, the christian genocide of the Jews, the failure of the catholic pedophilia scandal, the failure of prayer, the failure of the 2nd coming, the failure of social engineering, failure of biblical morality, and today I'm going to talk about the failure of"
'christian science'.
Got to put that in quotes.
So what is chrisitan science versus real science?
"Well, christians supposedly worship the creator of the universe, the creator of the earth that created all human beings, all animals, and supposedly the bible is divinely inspired and sort of written by the hand of god indirectly."
"And, supposedly, he talks to christians through prayer, and supposedly he knows everything."
He's omniscient.
"So you would think that there'd be all sorts of interesting facts about the way the world works in the bible and believers would know all these things, and there'd be all sorts of special insights there."
But that's just not the case.
"What qualifies as science in the bible would fit on about 4 pages, comments about he nature of reality."
And what is there is almost complely wrong.
It's pretty abysmal.
"So, christians like to use this word 'science' and grab on the coattails of science and use the word 'creation science' and try to make it science-y and make it all better."
And it's really just marketing.
"So, often there's sort of an attempt to steal the work of other people or steal the credit."
He studied business and I studied economics and Sinology.
"When he finished his studies, he asked himself, what to do?"
Then he had the following idea:
"This is myrrh, a natural resin from the myrrh-tree."
And this myrrh-tree finds extremely well climate conditions in Somalia.
Therefor this is the resource - here you can smell it - please give it to your neighbors -
- for which the world still needs Somalia.
Then Ahmed had the idea to import myrrh from Somalia to Germany.
"This is used in shampoos, in many cometics, medicine as well. - the back rows will be happy if you pass it on."
"Ahmed founded a firm for this export business, here Mercatus GmbH, in Hobrecht Street 28, Berlin."
This firm is also the kitchen of his flat.
"The business works well, but sometimes he looses control."
Which is mainly due to Somalia and the civil war there.
And now actually comes the main punchline of this evening.
"Mister Liu Xenfang from Hongkong, who built the National Theatre in Somalia, who now runs a shop in Nairobi, found Ahmed's firm on the internet."
"He had the idea to invest in this myrrh-business, buy myrrh from ahmed, sell it to the far east."
But he heard that the myrrh from Somalia is often shit.
"There's goat-shit in it, or splints of shell or other shit."
"He didn't want this, therefor he wanted to check the situation on the ground himself."
"In summer 2011 Ahmed and Liu planned a journey to the Horn of Africa, in order to sort things out with the farmers there."
"And Ahmed asked me to join this journey, to make research there, and develop a theatre play out of it."
And then I searched in Germnay for people to participate in this.
"Hello, my name is Chang Bee, I come from Taiwan."
"I studied classical singing in Taiwan, this means, learning to sing in the way that the european opera needs."
Therefore I wanted to go to Europe when I finshed my studies in Taiwan.
"In order to learn it even better, where this aesthetic comes from."
And I went to Berlin for an entrance examination.
Somalia is not the kind of country where one can travel spontaneously.
I wandered about security concerns in advance of our journey.
"I wanted to plan it well, wanted to know which places are really dangerous, then we could figure out a route which is not critical, or do I have to cancel it all, because it's to dangerous everywhere?"
"When you make a good plan in Taiwan, you ask an authority which can tell you."
I asked my teacher when I wanted to go to Europe.
"(shouts, claps)"
"Hello, everyone, my name is Jonathan, and I am from Taiwan."
My project starts with my friend Jack.
"My friend Jack couldn't see, and he wants to know how people around him ""look"" like."
"How his friends, his family look like, but he was too shy to ask, so I designed little invitation cards that he could give to his family, or to his classmates, to his teachers, and to his friends."
"To tell them that he wants to feel their faces, and see if they accept it."
"Through the project,"
"I learned that it is the first time that Jack ever touched his mother's face, and I am very touched, and by the same time I feel very warm."
"And I think there are many people like Jack out there, so I printed more cards, and I spread them out to other organizations."
"We hope to help more people, and this is my story."
Thank you.
"(claps, shouts)"
"Hi, everyone, my name is Danielle, and I am form Guadalajara, Mexico."
I am here to share my story about
"""The Kilometer of Love,"" my project."
"Well, it all starts well..."
"I invented the project, so that we can help our children that have cancer from all around the world, so that they have better medications, and so that they could live a better life."
"And I believe that this program, it can help everyone, it showed me to never give up, no matter what the problem is, and that we can all make a difference, even someone like me, and we do it all from the heart, thank you."
"[claps, shouts]"
"Hello, I'm Katelyn Freedberg from Pearl River,"
"New York, and my classmates and I did a project."
"We tried to prevent bullying from happening in our school, because it's a big problem, and we wanted everyone in the school to have someone there for them when they need help, so we decided to have ADDvertisements instead of regular advertisements because they subtract from us."
"But we wanted to add something to someone's life, so, yeah."
"Our ADDvertisements were posters that display positive messages, such as ""Kindness doesn't cost anything"","
"""Be a friend not a bully"", and ""This is a bully-free zone""."
And we display these messages throughout the school.
"As soon as our peers began to understand what these messages meant, words began to turn into actions, and soon enough you couldn't find anyone who is lonely at lunch table, everyone have someone there for them."
"So, thank you."
"[Car starting, tires screeching]"
The first sight of Pyongyang is pretty dismal.
[Anthem playing in background]
We're in a hotel that's about 47 stories tall.
like it was quickly ported over.
"It doesn't convey that level of effort, and people are going to see that and make judgments off of how much effort you put into it."
It's kind of a negative note to end it on.
"All right, well thank you for coming."
Hey there.
I'm Paul Irish.
I'm a Developer Advocate on the Google Chrome team and today
I'm going to show some advanced uses of the core Chrome Dev Tools features.
"First, let's enter into the dev tools."
It's common to use the app's menu.
"And you can also use a keyboard shortcut, like Ctrl-shift-I on Windows or Cmd-option-I on Mac."
But I prefer to open them by right-clicking on an element and choosing Inspect.
"Now that we have this open, I can navigate the DOM by clicking on the arrows, but it's much quicker to use the keyboard arrow keys to traverse up and down the DOM tree."
"You'll notice as I'm selecting these elements, I get an onscreen blue highlight, but I also get a css selector that represents that element, along with its current width and height."
"Sometimes, I like to zoom out of the page with ctrl - to get the full view while I do this."
"Now, over in the Console tab, I'd like to share a few things."
"Let's say that you have a big string coming from your app, and you want to copy it into your clipboard."
"While you certainly could highlight the entire string with your mouse, it's much more effective to use the console's built in copy method."
I can now paste this wherever I am going.
Sometimes you get too much text in the console.
You can use the clear() function to clear it out.
"Or, of course, the clear icon below will do just the same."
"Now sometimes, you have a reference to a DOM element, and you want to inspect it."
"Right now, I have a reference to the big headline on the page."
A simple way to do that is the console's inspect function.
"Now, let's say you have the reverse:"
You're
"looking at an element in the Elements tab, but you want to access it via scripts."
What
I used to do is add an ID onto the element and use getElementByld.
You'll notice I brought up the console right here.
"In fact, I can toggle on a console on every tab of the dev tools with the escape key."
See you!
Jana:
Byeeee!
Ju:
Omg!
"This voice, guys!"

"Great, Dan Garcia couldn't make it today, so I'm here to replace him."
I am
"[INAUDlBLE] here at Berkeley I go by Rabbit and I'm one of the TA's, and today's lecture is about concurrency. today's news of the day is friendship paradox."
"Two weeks ago, a research project came to us, that they surveyed Facebook users."
It's pretty cool.
"And they found one, along other things."
"One of the things they found is that on average, your friends are more popular than you."
"This is weird, but on average, the average Facebook user has 250 Facebook friends, while their friends on average have 350."
Pretty interesting.
"What happens is this is actually a paradox that happens in real life everywhere and they are like gatekeepers that are, know a lot of people, and a lot of people know them, and they are very common, and chances are that you're friends with them and that would bring up the average rather than knowing the other people that know random people. other than that, personally, I'd like to tell you to double-check your Facebook privacy settings."
Your Facebook privacy settings have been changed and they changed about once a month and they changed it for you.
"So, double-check it."
Awesome.
"So, this is going to be hard."
Okay.
"So, today, we're talking with parallelism and there are two main types of parallelism, intra-computer and inter-computer."
"Intra is inside one computer and this is the idea of having multiple course, multiple CU, CPUs inside one computer, and then, they work together to solve one common problem. this happens in most computers nowadays, anything you buy has [INAUDlBLE] of course. inter-computer is bigger."
"It's the warehouse scale computers where you have thousands, hundreds of thousands of computers working together to solve a common problem."
"This is called distributed computing and there are two main types, grid and cluster computing."
"Grid computer, grid computing is the idea that you just took lots of computing, of computers and put them together."
"And, now you use them as one big computer and very strong one."
"This is useful, but it's not as uniform."
For example:
Negative two fifths X equals ten.
In this lesson you will learn to solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.
Let's review.
The equation is similar to a scale.
Both sides of the scale have to be equal in order for the scale to balance.
The properties of equality say that
"I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide the same number  to each side of an equation and it will be true."
"So, to solve the equation X plus two is equal to five,"
I will subtract two from both sides of the equation.
This will still keep the equation equal.
This leaves me with X is equal to three.
"It looks like three is the solution for this equation, but we won't know if it's really a solution until we try it."
"So, let's replace three for X."
"So, in our equation we have X plus two equals five."
"When we replace three for X, we get three plus two equals five."
"Five is equal to five, so three is the solution."
A common mistake that is made when solving equations is not performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.
The multiplicative inverse of a number is the reciprocal of the number.
"So, if I have a number, seventeen-fifths, its inverse is the reciprocal, which would be five-seventeenths."
"When you multiply these two numbers together, you get one."
"So, the multiplicative inverse of the number, times the number, gives you one."
What is the solution of four-thirds X equals four?
"We're going to solve this equation by multiplying  both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of four thirds, which is three-fourths."
"Now, don't forget that three-fourths time four-thirds doesn't cancel out, but it multiplies out to be one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to twelve over four, or X is equal to three."
"Now, remember, in order for it to be a solution we have to make sure that we place it back in the original equation and it's true."
"So, to check my answer:"
I have four-thirds X equals four.
I'm going to substitute three in for X.
And I get four is equal to four.
"So, three is the solution for this equation."
"So if I had the buffer contents A, B, C, D, E, right, and if I could slam those into a vector, and then I would need one other little bit of information here, which is where is the cursor in any given point because the cursor is actually where the uncertain lead operations take place relative to the cursor."
"The buffer's also going to manage that, knowing where the insertion point is and then deleting it and inserting relative to that."
"So I say, okay."
I need some index.
The cursor actually is between two character positions.
"This is like slot zero, one, and two."
"And the cursor is between, actually, one and two."
"And there's just a minor detail to kind of have worked out before we start trying to write this code, which is do we want the cursor to hold the index on the character that's to the left of it or to the right of it."
"It's totally symmetric, right."
"If I have these five characters, it could be that my cursor then goes from zero to four, it could be that it goes from zero to five, or it could be it goes from negative one to four, depending on which way I'm doing it."
I'm going to happen to use the one that does zero to five where it's actually recorded as the character that's after it.
Okay.
So that's just kind of the staring point.
I'm going to write some code and make it happen.
So I'm going to remove this.
"Reference it, that's okay."
And then I'm going to add the things I want to replace it with.
So I put in the editor code and to put in the buffer code.
Was buffer already in here?
I think buffer's already here.
Okay.
Let's take a look.
I get my buffer.
"So right now, let's take a look what's in buffered."
I think I have the starting set information.
"So it has move cursor over, you know move the cursor around, it has the delete, and it has - let me make it have some variables that I want."
I've got my cursor.
I've got my vector of characters.
"Right now, it has a lot of copying, I think, just in anticipation of going places where copying is going to be required."
"Right now, because it's using vector and vector has deep copying behavior, I'm actually okay if I let windows copy and go through."
But I'm actually going to not do that right away.
All right.
"So, conversation mode will be available on Google Translate in a few months."
We just wanted to give you a sneak preview.
I have just one more demo to show you before I go.
This is actually launching this week.
"It's the new Street View Ul, which will launch as part of an update to Google Maps for Android."
"And to show you that demonstration,"
"I'd like to take a quick trip to Florence in Italy, so I'm going to click on the bookmark here on my desktop."
"So here we are in Florence, Firenze."
I'm going to zoom in a few times and move around.
"Now, to activate the Street View feature, I can click on the business so I can just hold in place anywhere on the map, so which is exactly what I'm going to do here."
Let me try a different--slightly a different place.
So here we are.
"So, I can click on this little guy here, we call him Pegman and he will just launch the UI for me."
"So what you see here is a beautiful, you know, three-dimensional panorama on Street"
"View and there's a little guy here which we just launched, and if I drag Pegman around, you'll see this little circle, we call it the pancake; and the pancake actually knows the three-dimensional structure of the scene pretty well, so you can see that it understands that there are building and facades; and I can just drag it where I want to go, just"
"like I do on the desktop, and it will just take me there."
"Pretty cool, right?"
So it looks
"like there's something interesting here down the street, so let's keep going a little bit."
Let me just try this again.
Sorry about that.
So let's take an even bigger leap here.
So
I just keep going down the street and there's a beautiful building down there which I would
love to take a closer look.
"Now, here, I just want to show off this again."
Look how amazingly well is the understanding of the 3D scene here that we have with Street View.
"So I can actually get very close to that building down there, that's the Santa Croce Cathedral here in Firenze or over in Firenze."
"Again, I can zoom at it more closely."
"So if I want to take a look at the very specific details of the facade, I can see them in high resolution."
"This is beautiful, almost as if I were right there."
So these are the demos that I wanted to share with you.
"Oh, no."""
I'll happily trade off some FDP upload time for manage dependencies.
- OK.
Two comments on that.
"Most embedding framework,"
I would encourage you to embed a jar version of the frameworks.
"If you look at since 5.2, I think."
"You can actually jar your framework, and they would work just the same."
"You can just dump them in your application in content extensions, and they're going to get loaded exactly like any other framework."
"It's very compact, it works really well."
You cannot [indecipherable] jar.
You can have flat jars which are the same.
"The other comment that I would say on the size of the app, is that gziped your app, before you upload them, you will save more time."
"It's incredible, I have seen so many people trying to upload a .woa not zipped."
It takes forever because the protocol are usually very inefficient on starting and stopping files.
"You are going to upload hundreds of small, tiny files, which is crazy."
- Yes
"- gzip's them, you'll be surprised you can save one, if not two order of magnitude in the upload."
"- If I can continue with that, once you have zipped it and put it up once, use RSync to sync it after that, because then you only move differences."
- Don't do that.
The reason you should not do that is because you will have a running app on the old version.
"If you have multiple instances, you really should upload it into a different folder and do a version swap so you have..."
"- To be clear, you should shut down the production site prior..."
"- No, no."
You don't want to shut down the production site.
You want to keep it running.
"- You just Rsynching the zip file, not the app."
- Then you have to unzip it on the server.
"- No, you're proposing unzipping the WOA, I think."
"- I was Rsynching the WOA, right?"
But I shut down the site.
- If you don't want to shut down your production site and you don't want to be replacing your WOA in line.
(Laughter)
"So, anyway, we started and  because I have the disability,"
"I asked a colleague to teach with me because there are days I just can't walk and there are days that  my voice is not so good, so I always worked with a colleague."
So we started off about 8 years ago.
We had no money and what we had to do  is we have to make sure that we have enough students  to be able to pay the teachers.
"So, that is one of the most important lessons for you to think about."
We keep waiting for money and  permission to do this work.
And you don't have to do that.
You just have to step into it and  you have to find a way to integrate it.
"So whether you do luncheon learns for the teachers, whether you do it after school program, whether you integrate it into the teachers' morning coffee, however you are going to do it."
There are so many different ways  to be able to start to integrate mindfulness  and mindfulness meditation.
"Jack is right; that  if you teach the teachers, it will be contagious and  it will go right through the classroom."
"So, now I teach at University of Toronto,  and I also teach APEC master."
"So, two universities  for the mindfulness program."
That's remarkable.
And why are they asking?
"Because they realize that in health care in particular, not in education that is our issue, my program is addressing the professionalism which includes education but largely is a lot  of health care professionals."
We are suffering.
"I would say that right across the board, the society is suffering."
I think the world is suffering.
And we have forgotten how it is  that we are to attend this suffering.
So this is my goal and I have 60 workshops at University of Toronto and  there are 40 faculties.
Many of them who are here today.
"Okay, go ahead, hit the gong."
(Laughter)
That is another thing  mindfulness can do for you.
It just allows you just a larger vision because you perceptual feel changes.
(Laughter)
So I want to say to you that this is easy.
You can't be stuck in your demoralization  and we are all feeling demoralized.
"When you start to think back  to the early work of Thay around the Vietnamese war or Martin Luther King we worked with, you can imagine their demoralization  around seeing so many people injured."
We have gone the longest  of any civilization without war.
And are you any more intelligent than a small little novice.
Why is it that these emotions they catch us.
And why is it?
"Because we don't see them coming, we encourage them too much."
"Every time we think negatively,"
"""oh, the ghost is going to come to us"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to lose my job"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to get that cancer."
I'm going to get it.
I know
I'm going to get it.
"Now I'm fine but I am."""
"When you think negatively like that you're building up the emotions, the emotions you get are built up by many many moments of unskillful attitudes and thoughts."
But now we have them.
So once you know where they come from you know they're actually created.
"At least if you know that you create them, you actually bring them together, even like grief.."
Why do you have to have grief when somebody dies?
Why can't we just celebrate that fact that we've known these people for such a long time.
What a wonderful time we had together.
Now we just let them go.
"You never cry for the person who's died, you always cry for yourself."
At your loss - nothing to do with them..
So when we understand that we can do something about these things it gives us a possibility to actually to transcend those negative emotions.
"Because when you think about it, reflect upon it, what good does grief do?"
It doesn't help the person who's dead.
It doesn't help yourself.
It's not what the dead person really wants from you - they don't want you to be unhappy and to cry all those hours and days.
"If someone really loved you and you loved them, they want you to be happy, to live your life in as much fullness and joy as you possibly can."
If you really revere their memory surely that's what you should do.
Not to grieve for them but to be happy for them.
"For you to be happy, for them."
"So when we can change our attitudes that way, when we can actually do something about our grief, or like our anger - what good does anger do?"
"Every time you get angry at your partner they don't do what you want them to do, they don't get better - they usually get worse!"
So why get angry and shout at them for?
"Off-topic but, if that quote rings a bell, it might be because Oliver Stone blatantly plagiarized"
"Genghis Khan in the movie, ""Conan The Barbarian."""
2.
Is an extension of 1.
The Mongols were seriously brutal conquerors.
"I mean, not uniquely brutal, but still ..."
"The Mongols often destroyed entire cities, and most historians estimate the number they killed to be in the millions."
3.
Their empire didn't last.
"Within 80 years they'd left China and been replaced by a new dynasty, the Ming."
"And, in Persia, they blended in so completely that, by the 15th century, they were totally unrecognizable."
"I mean, they'd even taken up agriculture!"
Agriculture!
The last refuge of scoundrels who want to devote their lives to working instead of [skoodillypooping]!
4.
They also weren't particularly interested in artistic patronage or architecture.
"I mean, your palace may last forever, but my yurt can go anywhere."
5.
The Mongols were probably responsible for the Black Death.
"By opening up trade, they also opened up vectors for disease to travel; in the case of the Plague, via fleas infected with Yersinia pestis."
"And, at least, according to one story, the Mongols intentionally spread the plague by catapulting their plague-ridden cadavers over the walls of Caffa in the Crimea."
"While this primitive act of biological warfare might have happened, it's unlikely to be what actually spread the plague."
More likely it was the fleas on the rats in the holds of Black Sea ships that were trading with Europe.
"But, that trade only existed because of the Mongols."
"All right, Stan, one last time - cue the Mongol-tage."
(wild galloping music)
"So the Mongols promoted trade, diversity, and tolerance, and they also promoted slaughter and senseless destruction."
"And, what you think about the Mongols ends up saying a lot about you."
Do you value artistic output over religious diversity?
Is imperialism that doesn't last better or worse than imperialism that does?
"And, are certain kinds of warfare inherently wrong?"
"If you think those are easy questions to answer, then I haven't been doing my job."
"Now, what I want to think about is how these characters will change their state due to their incentives."
Then we'll talk a little bit about Nash Equilibrium as well.
"On this axis, up here, lets' say this is one of the competitors."
"This is where they produce 25, and let's say on the ultimate cheating quantity of 75, and this is somewhat close to the market, or that is the equilibrium quantity if this was perfect competition, they produce half of that, so this is them producing 37.5 units."
"As we go from 25 to 37.5 units, they are cheating more."
"This is more cheating and over here, this was no cheating."
We can do the same thing for the blue player.
I'll write them as B. This is them producing 25.
This is them producing 37.5.
"As we go up and up and up, they are cheating more."
"This is a lot of cheating, or more cheating."
"To think of it in a Game theoretical way, this is the Pareto optimal state right over here."
It's optimal in many ways.
This is they've maximized the total economic profit here.
There's no other state that one person would benefit without making the other worse.
"Now, let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium."
Let's remind oursleves what Nash equilibrium was.
"This was a state where holding all the other players constant, so in this case there's only one other player, a player can't gain by changing strategy."
"In this case, changing strategy is changing your output."
Let's see if that is true of this state right over here.
"Well, let's hold A constant."
"If A is constant, we're in this column right over here."
"Is there something B can do, is there change or strategy B can do, that would allow B to gain?"
Sure.
B can increase production.
That's what we saw in the last video.
We would go from this bottom right state to one right above it.
"Now B's economic profit is 280, A's is 200."
"The pie has shrunk, but B has got a larger chunk of it."
That was not a Nash equilibrium.
"There is, holding all others constant, there is a player that can gain by changing their strategy."
"The Nash equilibrium definition, just to make sure, they say it's a state where holding others constant no player can gain by changing strategy."
So that was 2001 when I was fired.
[Question]
Yes.
The question was:
"""The open web is here today it's easy to see why it's important back then in those days before the open web, how did you know?"
"What makes you willing to risk your job?"""
"We'd been working on a browser for a while, so we could tell that the browser was important."
"It was clear at that time, when Microsoft had maybe 90-95% market share in the browser, in the operating system and in the productivity suites,"
"Office and Excel, which were the only things that people used in those days."
"And so it was clear that in those days,"
Microsoft controlled access to the Internet.
We didn't call it the open web then but it was the Internet and we knew it was great.
"It was very clear that by controlling the browser,"
Microsoft controlled how individual people experienced the Internet.
"That the server side of the Internet in those days was developing, growing and becoming richer and more capable."
"But the client side was deteriorating and through that client,"
Microsoft was able to ignore formats to make vast quantities of content unavailable to people.
And to determine the business model through which you could access content and to have an immense influence over the entire structure of the Internet.
So that much was clear.
It sounds melodramatic but the future of the Internet was already an issue at that point.
It was very clear the browser was the leverage point.
We were very clear about our jobs.
"One second, I'm gonna tell a couple of stories and then I'll get you Chris."
But we were very clear that our jobs were on the line.
It wasn't just me.
It was everyone I named and Marcia.
Is Marcia here?
I didn't see her hand go up.
But we would have meanings as the small group that was mozilla.org when the tensions got really high and we would get together and we would say things like
"""What happens if AOL pulls the plug?"
What happens if we're all fired tomorrow?
"How do we keep Mozilla operating?"""
Hypersensitives are born different from everyone else.
"They can have visions of the future, or see the dead... ...and sometimes be uniquely susceptible... ...to invasion by an entity that is alien to them."
Objection.
On what grounds?
"How about silliness, Your Honor?"
A young girl suffered terribly and died.
Do we have to subject her illness to this pseudoscientific analysis?
"Both counselors, please approach the bench."
"Your Honor, this testimony is beyond ridiculous."
Visions...
Supernatural belief systems are shared by millions of people.
We're in *The Twilight Zone* here.
Her expertise is relevant to the issues in this case.
Let's have a witch doctor sift through bones...
Stop.
We've heard a great deal of testimony... ...in support of a medical explanation for Emily's condition.
Now we have a witness who has spent her career... ...studying the defense's alternative explanation.
"An exorcism expert, if you will."
I think we'll hear what she has to say.
"Thank you, Your Honor."
"Dr. Adani, why do you think Emily's exorcism failed?"
The medical treatment.
"Specifically, the drug Gambutrol."
Please explain.
The exorcism ritual results in a specific brain activity... ...that cuts the person off from the possession experience.
But Emily's exorcism could not have achieved this... ...because the doctor gave her Gambutrol... ...which has an intoxicating effect on the brain.
The drug made her immune to the psycho-spiritual shock... ...that exorcism is intended to provide.
What do you believe was the result of treatment with this intoxicating drug?
Gambutrol locked Emily in the possessed state.
"This left her unable to respond to the exorcism... ...and therefore, it directly contributed to her death."
"Thank you, doctor."
No further questions.
You mean they couldn't go through a normal 45-minute class...
"Yes, because they easily got tired."
Did those health problems in children sometimes lead the families to leave the area?
"Yes, the educated class was the first to escape."
"The families that remained were either farmers, families with disabled members, or families with many children."
"In other words, families who couldn't sustain themselves in other places."
You've also been to Fukushima and measured radiation level there.
So you've seen both:
Chernobyl and Fukushima.
What do you think when you compare the two?
Radiation level in Fukushima is way too high.
It's crazy...
That's what everyone involved in Chernobyl is saying.
"So-called ""hot spots"" in Kanto region is like the radiation level in Belarus."
"In Chernobyl, people are not allowed to live in the area with more than 1 microsievert [per hour]."
"April 23, 1994 Belarus No-Entry Zone (30km from the plant) 0.232 microsievert"
"On the other hand, many people are allowed to live in such dangerous areas as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, Nihonmatsu City, and Date City in Fukushima Prefecture."
"June 11, 2011 Fukushima Municipal Moriai Elementary School (school yard) 1.383 microsievert"
I can't believe it.
I don't WANT to believe it.
I can't understand that people are treated in such an inhumane way in my own country.
"But sadly that's how it is, and the provisional radiation exposure limit of 20 millisievert/yr for school yards hasn't been retracted yet."
"Well, they say they'll make efforts to lower the actual exposure level to as close to 1 millisievert as possible, but the regulation itself hasn't been retracted."
"And children are still playing cheerfully in cities with very high radiation, such as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, and Nihonmatsu City."
"Based on your experience with the Chernobyl children, what do you think should be done now?"
Children must be evacuated immediately.
"Adults might not be able to get out due to financial reasons, but that has nothing to do with children."
"Evacuate them in units of classes, for example."
At least for a month.
"Or, considering the level of radiation there, they shouldn't return for a while."
Otherwise they would have to face really serious consequences.
The government of Belarus eventually took the responsibility to establish programs to separate children from radiation.
"What happened was not just people passed them on and surprising numbers viewed them, the tone of response we got back astonished us."
"People laughed, people cried, people were inspired, people tell their friends."
"This word again, passion."
"We saw the passion and that was a clue, that was something bigger here."
"So, we made a decision in 2007 that TED really officially was no longer a conference."
TED was going to be this.
[Slide reads:]
We engineered the web site to be built around spreading free talks to the world.
"And to our astonishment and delight, TED community far from being upset that we were giving away the crown jewels, shared this on, it was a thrilling to see."
"So, where is this going?"
"In 2009, we've seen the continuation of this process."
"Just letting TED go free to the world, we had this Open Translation Project, which has been thrilling seeing literally hundreds of translators take TED, bring those talks to their own communities."
"And, now, this TEDx program, spreading the live events to the world."
Where is it heading?
"Well, the truth is I don't know."
"I think it's an incredible fact, an incredible discovery really that millions of people around the world are wanting knowledge."
"You know, they want this re-discovery of wonder."
They want the sense of possibility.
And they actually want to be part of shaping the future.
That's a surprise and that's thrilling in its own right.
"But, even more thrilling is this."
"TED is part of much bigger revolution in, I'd say, global education that's made possible by the web."
"It's an amazing fact that people like this can become a new type of global icon, that the role of teacher in our world is about to become sexy, wonderful, you know, I mean,  and it should have always been, right?"
But that hasn't been for the last few years.
Teachers can reach people across the world.
That is amazing.
"And I... if you ask what my dream was, I think the way I would answer it, would be to look at this picture here."
These are kids photographed in the village in Pakistan not far from where I was born.
Their parents would have been born about the same time as me.
"Unlike me, I had an education and got to live an amazing life, they didn't have that chance."
They lived a life griding out a living in tough conditions.
"They're beautiful children,  may have a different chance."
"""Driven to the last necessity, and obliged to have recourse to arms in defense of our lives and"
"liberties."""
"So they're saying, 'We're not rebels who are out to rebel against the King."
"We're actually--We've been driven to this by what's going on in Massachusetts and we're protecting ourselves, but this is a defensive act and not an aggressive act.'"
"And then when you read a little further on in the statement, after all of this sort of noble, lofty sentiment, they then promise each other they're not going to get drunk or gamble or swear."
[laughs]
It's down to practicalities.
"Now that we've declared our purpose to the world, no heavy drinking."
Okay.
"The next day, April 22,1775, classes at Yale were suspended and a lot of students went home."
"Some, a few, actually, went off to fight."
So you can kind of see the way that the wind is blowing in New
Haven.
"You can imagine, given these sorts of events potentially how much fun it would have been to be a college student with Loyalist leanings at this particular moment."
It would not have been very fun--and sure enough in 1775 there was that student.
I discovered that student this morning.
"There was a--I don't know if he's the only one, but he's the guy who got in trouble."
There was one college student here at Yale who was a declared
"Loyalist, 1775."
He did not make other Yale students very happy.
He must have been loud about being a Loyalist.
"Otherwise don't know how it would have been so obvious to everyone that he was a Loyalist, but the--a large chunk of the"
Yale student body decided to have a meeting to debate what should be done about this student.
Okay.
"Obviously, things are not going to go well for the student."
'What should we do about this student?'
"They decide that they are going to formally denounce him as-- publicly, as, quote, ""an enemy to his country""-- and that no one will be allowed to socialize with this student ever again."
Okay.
They've just ostracized this--Can you imagine?
Sorry.
'You've just been entirely ostracized from every other person at Yale University [laughs] because we don't like your politics.'
"So when I first found this this morning, I was like: oh, poor guy, and I couldn't figure out what happened next and I just felt sorry for him."
Dr:
Yes.
S:
Fascinating.
"The people who are dying of heart disease, is it the cholesterol that's killing them or the inflammation?"
Dr:
I think it's a chicken-and-the-egg phenomenon where the inflammation allows the cholesterol to deposit; and they go together.
S:
"It's really the statins affect inflammation, which then reduces cancer by stopping the inflammation."
Dr:
Exactly.
One of the problems we have in Biology and Medicine is what you can measure.
"So, I can measure cholesterol."
I don't really know how to measure inflammation well.
"So while we can make these associations in big studies where we look back, if I had a metric, a blood test or something to look at for inflammation, I could optimize this."
S:
Can you not just measure the amount of cytokines or other inflammatory types of things?
Dr:
There are different types of inflammation.
"So, some inflammation can be good, some can be bad."
"Some can be really causal, some can be a little causal."
"So we're putting them all into one basket now, which is inflammation, the key is to start to tease them out, and be able to modulate them."
"You can develop a drug, but then you would have to optimize it for a particular purpose."
"So, these were optimized to lower cholesterol."
They do that very well.
"It also lowers inflammation, and they work beautifully in that regard."
But how do we optimize that going forward?
"It also means that when you look at your lifestyle and my lifestyle, we have to limit inflammation."
"So, what are the easy ways to do that?"
"One is, which I think should be mandatory, is things like the flu shot."
"So again, the flu shot will certainly delay you from having or prevent you from having a bad flu..."
S:
"For a while, we were real high alert."
We sat there in the airplanes with the...
With two of everything ready to go.
"And we put an extra 26,000 pounds of fuel onboard so we can carry like 90,000 pounds of fuel, so we can fly for a day and a half."
"Because if you found them, and you dropped the... you'd stay on station to... but it was all contingency and fortunately we never had to use it."
"They'd always come down, the Navy picked them up."
It was great.
"So, what you were doing - you'd, in the event they couldn't be picked up because of rough seas or something, you would - ?"
"No, we were there say they come down off the coast of Argentina"
"Okay someplace that they just circled the orbit or whatever and it might have happened, you know."
"So, all these orbits, you can see on the maps where they circle over Russia or over China."
"And like I said, our planes there, they didn't even hesitate, they just come right out... the capsule comes down in your territory, there'll be a C-130 within a couple hours right there and you don't touch it, you don't do anything, and you definitely don't touch the airplane coming in."
"And then if they can land, of course they would."
"Otherwise, the paramedics would jump out and do their thing."
Wouldn't need the flotation stuff but that was just a contingency because it was so primitive.
"You've seen the capsules, you know."
"If something malfunctioned, or functioned too good then they'd push those little jet streams on there and they either could go 2,000 miles one way or the other."
"So, like I said, it was a job."
And I don't know which ones I've met.
My flight orders don't show that.
"It just shows, you know..."
And it was partly to reassure them that you'd be there and the contingency that's why the astronauts flew with you
"Well, yeah, that, and just for their ideas."
Yes.
We were cargo haulers and we dropped thousands of parachute troopers.
"We dropped 80 at a time, 4 or 5 times a day."
You'd drop a couple 300 or 400 a day sometimes.
So we knew how to air drop and different ways of doing it.
"Low level, you know."
So that wasn't the deal.
The deal was you have to put these paramedics out at the capsule in the middle of the ocean and it didn't make any difference if - the army won't drop if it's over ten or twelve miles an hour wind.
We put these guys out in gale winds.
I'm sure there is something else she's into
"No, there is nothing else"
"Ohh, there's toothpaste on this shirt."
"Someone needs to invent invisible toothpaste, please."
I see your little tongue.
Why don't you show everyone?
Look at that little tongue.
Yes.
Today's video's gonna be a little bit angry.
Little bit.
It's gonna be sort of a rant.
"So if you don't have time for that, then there's plenty of other things on the Internet for you to consume yourself with, so just go ahead and click off."
"So I don't think I've ever done this on my channel before, where I address, like, one thing that someone's said or written,"
"But I'm gonna do that today, because it's relevant and also because I think I can help people."
"What I want to talk about has to do with this fucking, absolute dickhead who wrote maybe one of the dumbest things I've ever read."
And his name is [fumbling pronunciation]
"Yuksel Aytug — I don't know how to fucking say that — wrote an article about how the Olympic Games are, quote, ""killing womanhood."""
Let me just read to you some of this article.
And I'm gonna link it below so you can go look at it.
"He's Turkish, I think the original article is written in Turkish, so this is a translation, but you'll get the gist of it."
"Basically what he's saying is that their bodies don't look like women, and to ""take a look at female swimmers."""
"""Broad-shouldered, flat-chested women with small hips."""
"They're ""totally indistinguishable from men."""
"""Their breasts — the symbol of womanhood, motherhood — flattened into stubs as they were seen as mere hindrances to speed."""
"He said the Olympics force women to ""look more like men,"" and ""the manlier you look the more successful you are."""
"Then he said that you should get bonus points according to how ""feminine"" you looked."
"""Otherwise we will destroy the grace and naïveté of women through the Olympics."""
"First of all, since we're objectifying people as tits and ass,"
"I'm gonna show you a picture of Ayteg [mispronounced], fucking whatever his name is."
"We're gonna call you ""Ponytail"" from now on."
"Now, I don't think that most people would agree with Ponytail."
"And, in fact, a lot of the Internet was angry, so I'm not going to try and slam him, for obvious reasons."
It comes and goes.
"Like this many thing else, comes and goes."
"Like I was saying, just recently, you see the thoughts , they're random."
They're not sequential.
They're not really.. they're random.
"Like I was saying you were thinking, somehow meditating on just being self and then suddenly there is sort of like pizza or something come then after this sort of like 'aha, you know, go shopping in this place' and then 'ha, e-mail to somebody', you know, it's like just coming up like this."
But this kind of thought for you is more seasonal.
"It comes about, because there is something that is grown around this thought, that seems"
like it is intensely got some kind of nectar promise in it.
"But now, you're aware this now."
Because the fruit of this attachment or activity is that you're not happy about it.
You're not happy with it.
You're not happy with it.
Nobody is happy with it.
"Because you've the power to dream , but you don't have the power to make your dream come true."
Whatever we might think.
"If you've the power to decide what should appear in your life, Ok?"
"You're the architect and designer, everything that happens to you."
"Then, you , with that, all of you will be clear about who you're or something, if this is what you want."
Or you wouldn't include anything that is uncomfortable as an experience.
You will go all for chocolates flavored moments.
"So, something is, life takes that away from you."
You don't have this power.
"You may dream, but the purpose of life, is not to fulfill or to satisfy your projections."
"So, that is a wisdom in this and a maturity to learn to let go of that."
That these dreams they're depleting of your energy.
And brings in the state of confusion.
"So, what I'm pointing you to, is only the space of the awareness within which the story of , this kind of romance, and what this kind of images come and then another image come also, and it passes."
Something else comes.
Momentary attention passes.
"Innumerable thoughts , waves of , tsumani of thoughts come and they don't stick because you've no interest."
"But, some come and they stick."
Uh huh.
"And it doesn't look bad on the phone, we still, we still probably, we're still gonna add a um, MPS piece, and try to get involved, to be more responsive probably the next day."
"But uh, yeah the night that some of these people that were on our team that, that are really."
"You know the staff from the responsive design and the nine sixty, you know that Mh-hm And all those kinds of things, you know, we don't have a lot of information, I would think and a lot of information that is going to come and that kind of that and that would be really helpful What's the next, what's the direction of the website?"
"It'd be kind of nice if you guys had something about it, a little discussion could start, th e future of the web and things like that."
"Yeah, we are definitely focusing much more on that in the coming year."
"We want to do a lot more, we have a user experience fundamentals course coming out, content strategy."
"We're looking at doing usability testing, a lot more."
Fundamental information that will help as you approach your project.
"Whether it's a redesign or a new, a new site."
"And um, we've really focused on tools in the past."
How do I use Flash to do what I'm trying to do?
But I think that um.
"An area that we really want to look at is, now that you are in conjunction with tools, it's, it's just as important to understand why you are doing what you're doing."
"And to, to make the best decisions for your site and, and your membership, or your viewership."
"Right, mm-hm. , That is very interesting."
"And especially because the way, technology is being consumed, has so fundamentally changed, with mobile devices."
People are actually having these conversations now.
"You know, people are talking about responsive design, or they're talking about, uh, user experience."
"And it, it wasn't, much of a conversation a year ago."
"And, um, I think that people really, are."
"Are looking for this type of information, and it sounds like this would be beneficial for, for your project as well."
"Yea, particularly right now cuz I think that everybody I think is going to be redesigning their web right now."
Trying to get moving towards.
See the social media kind of stuff.
Right.
Yeah.
How do we integrate social media effectively.
How do we.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then we, and then we."
Telemachus basically undoes any doubt that we had about whether he's grown up.
"Remember at the very beginning of the, of the epic, Athena comes up to Telemachus and says basically, just come on, grow up."
"It's time for you to get going, take responsibility."
"On book eighteen he says, I used to think as a child, but not anymore."
"My heart takes note of everything, feels it too, both the good and the bad."
The boy you knew is gone.
So Telemachus is now stepping into a different stage of life.
"And he is ready to take on responsibility for, not just his own messes, but other people's messes."
"That's probably a pretty strong part of what it is to grow up, is taking on other people's messes."
"Who knows, maybe there should be a universal law built into this one."
To grow up means to take on other people's messes.
"But Telemachus is stepping up to do that and ready to, ready to do it."
Others seem to notice that this is going on.
"At the close of eighteen, he makes threats on page 389 that the suitors take seriously."
People are recognizing that he's talking more stringently.
"Page 419, we see another example of this."
"The suitors bite their lips, amazed at Telemachus stepping up and getting his, getting his more grown up person to take responsibility for what's happening around him."
Then we also see some close-up with what the suitors are all about.
We see this through Odysseus's eyes.
"We've heard from them, we've seen the misery and threats to Telemachus."
We've seen Penelope have some very small interactions with them.
But we really get to see them at work.
"See them, see the suitors being the suitors through Odysseus' eyes."
"And this starts opening up to us in this section of the, of the text through book seventeen and eighteen."
Odysseus makes his way in and makes contact and we get to see what they're
like.
"So these suitors, who are eating Odysseus out of house and home and helping themself to whatever they feel like that belongs to someone else."
"When a beggar comes in and ask them for their scraps, they turn him away similarly."
The suitor's not only abused the xenia that they expect is going to be offered them as sort of guests who horribly overstay their welcome in Odysseus' house.
"But, they've not only pervert that xenia but they also refuse to offer the xenia they should offer to the stranger that washes up into their, into their region in this courtyard of Odysseus' house."
They treated him with abuse.
They don't give him any food.
Ole:
It could of course be true
Martin:
But it is also different to compete in the artistic substance than just compete in who can jump highest; ... and run the fastest... is there a difference in these things?
Ole:
"Yes but unfortunately they did that too but they had competitions in oratory and theater and so on, as you mention but it is a competition where you will be honored by the community as well as there's competitions in the immediate self sacrifice for the community that isthe greatest honor that can happen to you"
"Whoever wins this contest winner on behalf of the community and it's not how competition works in our culture but it may well be that competition as a phenomenon has paid off just like the life struggle has done because if people had not been forced to work for a living, perhaps they had not created ​​the things they have"
Martin:
So it's a side effect we are talking about and not competition in general?
Ole:
"No, it's very complicated."
Martin:
But then you're now touching the whole basis of the free market
Ole:
What it has led to're highly problematic and where they have attempted to tie them through government controls have indeed created some absolutely terrible results
Martin:
So it could have been done otherwise?
Ole:
Then it really should be done otherwise!
You have to prevent a concentration of power and one can only imagine the slow transitions
Martin: but we havn't got the time..
Ole:
"No, we havn't got the time if we are to achieve it within your prediction horizon"
Martin:
What would you do first if you were to start a positive process now?
Ole:
"Then we should start tomorrow already by going out in town and tell every person you meet no matter if you know the them or not, something nice about them ...and then see what happens.."
It's actually not that easy..
Martin:
"It's probably not so easy, no... and if everyone did it at once.. it would be a great day for everyone.."
Ole:
"A fantastic day, right.."
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
I try to write the letters  hundreds of times
But at the end  I rip it apart
Why is love  so heavy for me
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
Give me love That's enough
...but it's actually Michigan where this is maybe the most stark and the most amazing.
"In Michigan, the new Republican governor is a man named Rick Snyder."
"Rick Snyder does not get a lot of national attention, but boy howdy he ought to."
"What Governor Snyder is doing, I think, tells you, in particular, how clueless the beltway press has been about what is actually happening in the states right now, in Republican politics."
"If you listen to the beltway press, even those who are willing to be critical of the Republicans, they say things like, ""Well real fiscal conservatives would consider raising taxes, as well as cutting spending, to address their state's budget shortfalls""."
That is actually happening in some of these places.
Look what they are trying to do in Michigan.
Rick Snyder has proposed an actual tax increase.
"Michigan has a budget problem, so he's gonna do the,[bell dings] responsible thing. right?"
He's going to raise taxes.
"He's gonna raise taxes on - seniors, and on poor people."
"1.7 billion dollars in tax hikes for Michigan seniors, and Michigan's poor people, and for people who want to make a tax deductible donation to public universities."
"Sorry, you know, Michigan has a budget problem."
We're gonna hafta raise a whole lotta money from you -
"- poor people, old people, people supporting public schooling - you have to take the hit because the state needs to save that money."
Is the state saving that money?
"No, the state is not."
"Governor Snyder is taking all of that money that the state will gain, and he is not using to close the budget gap."
He is giving it away - in the form of 1.8 billion dollars in corporate tax cuts.
"He's taking in 1.7 billion dollars in higher taxes from poor people and old people, and giving it away."
1.8 billion dollars to businesses.
"A load of pople, and suddenly a sofa flying over everybody."
A sofa appeared through the street and they carried it into the square.
JL:
(laughs) Yes!
There have been precious moments that I didn't experience but they've told me about them.
"Like the first morning they ate rice with prawns, because the neighbours' were so supportive, or people who came from far away, brought a pot, and although they couldn't stay, they left it there so others could eat."
"And I remember the first or second night, they brought nine pizzas that someone had ordered for us from Galicia."
Someone in Galicia called a pizzeria close to Sol and put 9 pizzas on their credit card and asked them to be delivered to the kids that were there.
"That doesn't happen in real life, or maybe it does and we don't see it, that there are people that generous."
ST:
"I remember, maybe on the 17th, the second or third day, people from a restaurant came with beans and rice pudding."
"And I was so happy, for a few moments..."
JL:
"That was the Asturian, he also took cider."
He also took some of his own cider.
"I don't know if it's the same asturian, but a co-worker of mine interviewed that gentleman."
And he took his lorry.
"He took a lorry full of soft drinks of a particular brand, maybe we'll find out if it was the brand or the bar that sent them."
But there were very beautiful moments of true solidarity and communal generosity.
But that's not what it's all about.
Although it allowed the atmosphere to be very pacific.
"And the atmosphere swallowed up the very few who maybe would have liked to cause problems, because that was their way of fighting the system."
But that's not the debate
I want to go into.
"What I mean is that soon those people who usually do that kind of thing, they didn't because they were swallowed up by the multitude which said: ""we don't do that kind of thing here, we've decided that's not how we want to protest for now""."
That's an important force.
"And then the third moment of emotion was during the confluence of the ""northwest march"" and the ""northeast march"" on the 19th of July which was the first authentically hetergeneous demostration."
They came from different neighbourhoods and cities.
The moment they joined together at a roundabout on the Castellana.
Patricia:

JL:
"They had a server tag which resembled their script tag, which caused stuff to run on the server, and they had a write function which would cause the insertion of whatever text you were writing into the HTML output stream."
So it had all of the vulnerabilities that PHP has.
"It had all the disadvantages of the other template system plus, at the time, a pretty slow JavaScript engine."
That product was eventually withdrawn and replaced with J2EE.
"What if we did it right, instead, this time?"
We have one of those opportunities in history where we can try it again and this time get it right.
What if we had server side JavaScript with an event loop?
Not a template system but an event loop.
"Well, it turns out we've got it."
We already have it.
"It's node.js, which runs on top of V8."
"It implements a web server in a JavaScript event loop, and it is brilliant."
It is a very high performance event pump.
"It can take events and move them really fast through its event queue, in and out and across the world."
"Not only that, it got READ right."
"Here's the final system read from node.js, and it has a callback function."
"The callback function receives the data that you ask to read, and that's right."
"I mean, we finally have a correctly implemented, correctly designed read function."
"Everything in the node.js API is non-blocking, or should have been."
There are a couple of exceptions.
"One is, it has some synchronous functions which do block."
That's really unfortunate.
I wish they weren't there.
"There are non-blocking versions for most of them, but there shouldn't be any."
It's just too big a hazard.
"The other is, there's a require function that blocks, which is used for loading script."
"That's really unfortunate, I'd like to see that fixed too."
"But otherwise, node.js is just really good stuff."
There are a lot of advantages that come from it.
One is that you can run the same stuff on both sides of the network.
We can take YUI -- the same YUI that you're running in the browser -- and run it in the server.
That means your applications can run on either side.
"So, watch out for that kind of thing, especially the multiple people have looked at the draft and edited the draft, references tend to get lost in the shuffle."
So here's an example of the first kind of thing I was talking about.
"So you, some authors give a reference to back up a statement."
You go to the original reference and it just doesn't back up the statement.
So here's an example.
"I'm going to pick on a particular example from something I was reading lately but again, These authors are by no means the only ones who do this."
"This is very, very common."
"So, I read the sentence."
These data are particularly disturbing as the UVC emission is even larger than ambient sunlight on a mountain.
"Now, I was writing about this for the lay public and so I thought, well great, here"
I've got a comparison that anybody can understand.
"The amount of UVC, if you're exposed to sunlight on a mountain."
"Well, that's a great way to put this in my piece."
So I wanted to get more information about this.
"I thought that was an interesting and cute fact, a good fact to use for a piece for the lay public."
"And I also had a question, because when they say it's larger than ambient sunlight on the mountain, they didn't give any time frame."
"So, is it larger than the amount that you'd get in one minute?"
Is it larger than the amount that you'd get in an hour?
So there was no reference right there.
So I needed to go back to the original references to get more information.
"And again, I, I'm doing this often for various reasons like, like we've been writing something for the lay public and I see an interesting statistic or fact that"
I wanna trace back.
Alright.
"So, to go to reference thirteen, Well, it's, it's you know, a URL."
"It's, it's a website link and it was broken."
"So, the, the link doesn't work."
"I get, you know, an error message."
It does bring me to a site.
So I search on that site and there's no relevant information about UVC emissions on a mountain on that site that I can find.
Maybe I didn't do a great search.
"So maybe, you know, the URL, link got broken, you know, between the time the authors wrotethe paper and, the time it was sent, it was published."
"Could have happened, But anyway, it's a problem because again,"
Listen to this:
It is known now that chocolate is the number one longevity food in the world.
That is known.
"It is the number one food for your heart  according to the research, for your heart."
It's also a great way to party and have a good time  without a hangover.
Chocolate grows across  the temp required that the -- what we call the tropical belt  of the world; from about 20 degrees north latitude  to 20 degrees south latitude.
In that belt.
And it's originally from the Americas:
"Central America,"
"Venezuela, Ecuador."
Most people now believe that chocolate  is originally from the Orinoco river basin of Venezuela.
"That's where the Spanish first rolled into and saw tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands  of wild cacao trees, but no people, 500 years ago."
I searched all over the planet.
I visited shamans asking them  what they thought about chocolate.
"This shaman in the Amazon told me  that you can take the cacao tree bark, peel it off, soak it in ice-cold water."
"It releases the gel in 24 hours, and when you rub that in your scalp, it cures male pattern baldness."
I'm an infopreneur.
"My eyes went into dollar signs,  when I heard that."
"You mean, there is a product that would sell more than chocolate itself, that comes from the chocolate tree?"
And we're researching this right now.
First and foremost I am a researcher.
"That's what I love to do, I love to study, research and look into the data."
"Chocolate is the number one food in magnesium of any food in the world, that is the number one mineral deficiency in the Western world."
"Also, chocolate is the highest  natural source of iron, the highest natural source of manganese and the highest natural source of chromium of any major food in the world."
These are very important minerals  for blood building.
"They're very important for stable blood sugar and, of course, magnesium de-stresses us."
Could we use that?
I think so.
"Chocolate is also extraordinarily rich in phosphorus, zinc and copper."
Zinc and copper for healthy nervous system  and phosphorus for bone.
"We always hear about calcium,  calcium, calcium."
"Phosphorus,  we need that for healthy bones."
I know the labor HHS subcommittee's due the 26th.
I think most have planned it on that day.
Brad:
"Let's talk for just a minute about what that involves, because we've just been engaging with our community, many of whom are on the webinar today."
What's the strategy for the member request?
Are you seeking to be going out with Senator Collins on a broad-based letter?
Hopefully we can get 34 Senators or more.
Elyse:
Yes.
That's the hope and plan.
We are currently working with Senator Collins on finalizing a letter which we hope to get done in the next couple of days so that we can start circulating.
"The process is compressed this year because we only just finished up the FY ""13 process a few weeks ago and passing that continuing resolution for the rest of the year."
So now we're in this turn around.
We thought we would have a bit more time on these letters.
Chairwoman Mikulski really wants to get the process started.
The House is moving on a much faster clip with their member request deadline.
We're in this period where we're going to try to get this letter out in the next couple of days and share it with you so you can share it with your membership.
"And hopefully we will have the same kind of broad-based push for this letter as we did for the FY ""13 letter."
"Those kinds of efforts among the state directors and the people on the field to go out and call members of Congress, in this case the Senate, to say, ""This is an important issue, and I really would like you to sign this letter""."
That helps us get the signatures.
"The more signatures we have, the more signatures we can show, the better off we are in terms of trying to get a better number on the Senate Appropriations bill."
Last year the number was higher and we want to see the same this year.
Brad:
Absolutely.
Thanks to Senator Reed's efforts and Senator Collins for working together to get that number up to $145 million last year.
"But, very well said on the importance of the stake holder direct communication with the members."
Arley and I are on the Hill virtually every day.
"They see us, they know us, but when they hear from their own states and districts it makes such a huge, huge difference."
Elyse:
It's that human's touch.
That on the ground level knowing a constituent is calling.
You need both.
Dylan:
"Well the founder, Salman Khan, started out by posting lessons for his cousin on YouTube and now the Khan Academy has over a million unique students per month and boasts more than 2,000 tutorials covering everything from basic addition and subtraction to advanced calculus, physics and chemistry and joining us now is Ben Goldhirsh, the CEO of GOOD, it's a company dedicated to moving the world forward through its website, magazine, videos and events."
He thought that Khan was one of the breakout stars at this year's
Technology and Entertainment and Design conference.
"Before we get to all this Khan Academy business Ben, do you like it better when we're on opposite coasts or would you be comfortable if I was to move out to California to spend more time with you?"
Ben:
"I would love to have you out here Dylan, I think we do better in person."
Dylan:
And do you feel that you speak on behalf of the entire southern California community when you welcome me into that universe?
Ben:
The thoughtful ones.
Dylan:
(laughs) Okay the thoughtful ones.
We won't get into how many thoughtful ones there are but we will get into this.
Why did you decide to feature this so prominently with GOOD?
Ben:
"For the past two years, GOOD and University of Phoenix have been focusing on solutions in this education space and we haven't seen anything like it and to contextualize the findings for you, look at Los Angeles."
"We have Teach for America, we have City Year, we have KlPP Academy."
The best of the best of social innovators but they're facing a serious problem.
"600,000 students in LAUSD with a 50 percent graduation rate."
"That's terrifying and the bottom line is the solutions that we have on the ground, in my opinion, aren't going to catch this problem."
"We need a disruptive technology, we need to really revolutionize how we're tackling this."
Khan Academy is the first thing I've seen that gives me confidence that we're going to tackle it.
"It's the most exciting thing I've seen that we're doing to do this so I'm pleased to bring it to your show,"
I think we're going to dig into a good conversation.
Dylan:
Alright let's have at it.
"The man behind the idea joins us, Salman Khan."
Founder of the Khan Academy.
High praise for what you've got going from our friend Ben down there in southern California.
"He's a thoughtful southern Californian, is how he likes to refer to himself."
What have you found is the biggest problem with this?
New paragraph
I will leave my contact information in the description of this video.
"Okay, but just that you don't think that I trained Simon specifically for that text, I'm gonna dictate something ... ... from the web as well"
"So, let's actually have a look at The Verge... ... and let's pick the middle one for whatever reason."
And try to dictate that
Let's go ahead
"Google's made good on a promise today, rolling out voice calling through it's hangouts messaging service."
"Basically, it works just like video calling - you can call one person or many with a click of a button in ... ..."
"Google+, Gmail or the Chrome extension, and the whacky Hangouts effects are even in play - except it allows you to call phone numbers."
"You can even mix and match video and voice calling, so your friends without hangouts won't be shut out of your chatting."
"For having desecrated holy territory, exemplary punishment"
Uh... chief?
"You, shut your mouth"
You choose death or tchetche?
Whats tchetche?
Tchetche is....tchetche.
"Then okay, I'll take tchetche."
TCHETCHE!!!
"And you stranger, death or tchetche?"
Uh death...... please.
"Okay, but before that, TCHETCHE!!"
Welcome to the archeology news!
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we'll travel in time to shed light on an interesting event of past human history."
We'll use a biological time machine: cattle DNA.
The DNA is the code of life.
It contains all the information needed for the correct functioning of living organisms.
"Geneticists represent it as an alphabet, with four letters."
"They are chemical basis, represented as letters."
"These letters and the associated code are transmitted from parents to progeny, across generations."
The DNA duplication machinery is not error free.
Letters may be mistyped and errors transmitted to progeny.
These mutations create the genetic variation that is at the row material shaped by evolution and speciation.
"But, I were working on a portrait, someone's face, then I'd probably would lower the Detail slider and increase the Masking slider because I don't want every little detail in a subject's skin to be exaggerated by sharpening."
Now I wanna mention that these sharpening controls affect the entire image but if you wanna apply more or less sharpening to a specific area you can do that using one of the two local tools which I'll cover in the next chapter; the adjustment brush and the graduated filter.
And I'll also mention that sometimes you can apply a sharpening preset and that will do all the work for you.
Lightroom does shift with the number of presets.
Those are located over here in the left column in the Presets Panel which I'll open by clicking this triangle.
The presets in Lightroom 4 are inside of
Subject Matter folders.
These are User Presets and in the User Presets there is a folder of Lightroom General Presets.
"And here, I have two Sharpening presets that come with the program."
A Sharpening preset for faces and another for scenes like this one and you can certainly try those out at least as the starting place and then you can tweak the sliders to taste.
Were you fooled?
It's not that tricky.
The answer is still the same.
"Energy is an amazing quantity, but before we can start making calculations using it, we're going to need to learn about something called potential energy."
"-What's happenin', forum?"
"So imagine that you're in your bedroom, getting undressed and you're butt-ass naked."
But then you look out your window and you see this pervert.
Buhh...
"Now, I don't know this perverted cat's name, so we'll just call him Quagmire."
"Now, Quagmire's video got, like, a half million views and I don't know why."
"I mean, look at him."
Just creepin'.
Waiting for you to leave the room so he can sneak in and sniff your underwear.
"And what's with cats, you know?"
"I mean, a dog might rape your leg, but he isn't gonna cut off your penis and wear it like a mask"
like this freakin' stalker.
Buhh...excuse me while I go take a shower.
"Okay, I actually didn't want to review the next video, but like literally billions of you sent it to me."
"Literally, billions... or hundreds, but you know, who's counting?"
So this awful video got like a million-and-a-half views in a day after it was promoted on FailBlog.
And you know what?
Just here...enjoy.

Here is seems to be a problem of not enough data and not a very good smoothing algorithm.
So we would be having the linear combinations of nine vectors in
"nine-dimensional space, and we would be trying to find the"
combination that hit the correct right-hand side b.
And we might also ask the question can we always do it?
Can we get every right-hand side b?
And certainly it will depend on
those nine columns.
Sometimes the answer will be yes --
"if I picked a random matrix, it would be yes, actually."
"If I used MatLab and just used the random command,"
"picked out a nine by nine matrix, I guarantee it would be good."
It
"would be non-singular, it would be invertible,"
all beautiful.
But if I choose those columns so
"that they're not independent, so that the ninth column is the same"
"as the eighth column, then it contributes nothing new and"
there would be right-hand sides b that I couldn't get.
Can you sort of think about nine vectors in nine-dimensional space an
take their combinations?
That's really the central thought --
that you get kind of used to in linear algebra.
"Even though you can't really visualize it, you sort of think you"
can after a while.
Those nine columns and all their
combinations may very well fill out the whole nine-dimensional space.
But if the ninth column happened to be the same as the eighth column and
"gave nothing new, then probably what it would fill out"
would be -- I hesitate even to say this --
it would be a sort of a plane -- an eight dimensional plane inside
nine-dimensional space.
And it's those eight dimensional
"Not turn the mindfulness  into another ought, because we can do that  if we are not careful."
"I guess I'll advice you to get support and to say that of course there is a great deal of it about, really."
There is a lot of mindfulness happening  in many ways and under many titles.
"So let's not get obsessed with any  particular approach, sect or language."
Let's reach out to people in social emotional learning.
"There are many mindfulness programs happening at the moment, very good curriculum being already developed."
"If you want to know what is around,  go on the Garrison website."
There are 37 programs to draw and  lots of fascinating stuffs around.
"I think we should really see science as an ally, not the enemy and I am sure I am preaching to the converted here."
But I think things like randomized control trials can be our friend not our enemy.
"I said that to someone  who is just being part of a group who published the randomised control trial or the .b program, and found very effective changes in terms of stress and anxiety and so on."
"Neuroscience is our friend, not our enemy."
We don't want too much 'do-wellism' here.
We don't want to start thinking  nice people teach mindfulness and nasty people teach physics and math.
(Laughter)
(Bell)
It is the same in classrooms.
"I am going to take 2 minutes  to say a couple of things, if I may."
"The final thing I'd like  to say really is to make sure that we bring mindfulness to people, not to expect people to come to it."
"And to be aware that for some people, the kind of stuff we do is very off-putting and very weird and very odd."
"We need to stop where they are, not where we'd like them to be."
"If we want to talk to teens,  for example, it may be 'singing songs about flowers' is not going down well with some tough teenagers."
(Laughter)
"Mad, dare I say."
Don't we get any more minutes  for laughter time?
No?
Okay.
(Laughter)
"Just to make sure that we express things in ways, in the language and imagery and use things like films and pop music and so on to really appeal to teens."
"Similarly, if we are talking to  administrators, let's talk where they are."
"Let's talk the language of stress  and number of days saved if people learn mindfulness, not to expect them to get into the spiritual side."
"They will get there, it is a path, we can start anywhere, as these people said."
We also made an initial experience for people they could relate to.
That's our Start page.
Before...
[Question]
Do you want to?
"You don't have mics, and there's no mic for that."
How about... you (...)
So I'm gonna step back.
How did Firefox come into being?
"Firefox had started in a few years before, in 2001 maybe, where it became clear that the old products had a bunch of problems."
"Not only was it really built for developers and much too powerful, not too powerful but not elegant and not beautiful on how it displayed its power."
"And it was a combined browser, email client, IRC client, app launcher environment."
"This was a cause of intense fighting and so a small group of engineers went off and had an idea for doing something more elegant, just a browser, that was focussed on a product a family would want to use."
So there were five or six of them.
[Question]
Yeah.
So Dan says a couple of those guys were at Netscape working on the suite as their day job and during their spare time some were community members and some were not engineers like Asa was involved
"So that had been bubbling a lot for a while, and so on."
It wasn't anywhere near done and it was both a source of a relief and some contention for the engineers working on it.
Was there more you wanted to say?
Ok.
"So it had been bubbling a lot and existed in a source code repository,"
I think when we formed the foundation it was 0.2 or maybe 0.3.
That's probably a good time to tell the story of the name of Firefox.
"So when it was first started, the engineers thought"
"""wow we're building a new browser out of the ashes of Mozilla 1.0"" and so it was named Phoenix."
[Question]
For a really non-product but Mozilla/Browser when it came to have a name it was Phoenix.
"Well, there is a company, Phoenix Technologies, it's a BlOS company, it's been around forever, they once had a browser kind of thing and so the World of Trademarks contacted us and said we couldn't use the name Phoenix and we looked at it and they were probably right, they had a product that was pretty close."
"So of course, from Phoenix, the next obvious name is Firebird."
"So our browser was Firebird for one or two releases and it turns out there was, and still is, an open source database project by the name of Firebird."
[Question]
"Nomads don't generally produce manufactured goods, which means they need to trade, so they almost always live near settled people."
And 3.
"Because they generally live close to nature and in harsh conditions, pastoralists tend to be tougher than diamond-plated differential calculus."
"Think of the Huns, or the Xiongnu, or the Mongols."
(wild galloping music) Okay.
"Stan, that's enough."
Back to me.
Come.
STAN!
"I AM THE STAR OF THE SHOW, NOT THE MONGOLS!"
Hi.
Sorry about that.
So one last thing.
"Pastoral people also tend to be more egalitarian, especially where women are concerned."
"Paradoxically, when there's less to go around, humans tend to share more, and when both men and women must work, for the social order to survive, there tends to be"
"less patriarchal domination of women, although Mongol women rarely went to war."
I can't tell your gender.
"I mean you've got the pants, but then you also have the [floopity] flop, so that's the technical term, by the way."
I'm [an] historian.
"If you had to choose a pastoral nomadic group to come out of central Asia and dominate the world, you probably wouldn't have chosen the Mongols, because, for most of the history we've been discussing, they just hung out in the foothills, bordering the Siberian forest, mixing herding and hunting, quietly getting really good at archery and riding horses."
"Also, the Mongols were much smaller than other pastoral groups,"
like the Tatars or the Uighurs.
"And, not to get all great man history on you or anything, but the reason the Mongols came to dominate the world really started with one guy, Genghis Khan."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"The story goes that Genghis, or Chinggis, Khan was born around 1162, with the name Temujin, to a lowly clan."
"His father was poisoned to death,"
"leaving Temujin under the control of his older brothers, one of whom he soon killed during an argument."
"By 19, he was married to his first, and most important, wife, Börte, who was later kidnapped."
This was pretty common among the Mongols;
Temujin's mom had also been kidnapped.
"In rescuing his wife, Temujin proved his military mettle and he soon became a leader of his tribe, but uniting the Mongol confederations required a civil war, which he won,"
largely thanks to two innovations.
"I'm saying that when you ask teachers, ""What do you mean when you tell your students to 'pay attention,' 'focus,' 'concentrate.'"""
"You know, just like a camera, hold that image still."
I go to the students.
"So when your teacher tells you, ""Pay attention, focus, concentrate."""
What is she telling you?
Hold that image still as if you were taking a picture?
"I ask people at work, old people, young -- everybody says the same thing."
"Well, in fact, the only way you can really pay attention, most of the time, is to vary the image."
"So, whey don't you sort of look at your finger."
Do -- look at your finger.
"Now, if you want to stay attentive to your finger, you have to notice new things."
You can't just see it as the same way it was yesterday.
"I say, my goodness, this finger is different from an hour ago."
I notice a little piece of dirt here; there's a wrinkle I wasn't aware of...
That noticing these things is what keeps you attentive.
Right.
"So, in fact, we have all these people who are trying to pay attention..."
So we assume it's just a finger.
"Well, when you assume it's just a finger; (it can't change) that there's nothing new that by not looking for newness (right), it fades from view."
It's a very hard thing to do.
"When you're noticing new things about it, which is the essence of mindfulness and mindful learning, is that it becomes interesting to you."
Even something that might seem so uninteresting as (a finger!) the tip of your finger.
"Now, but this has tremendous implications for things like"
Hey!
"For today's illustration, I'm going to be using some pieces of paper."
"Now, if I take these pieces of paper and try to juggle them..."
...it doesn't work very well!
I can't do it!
"But if I take the paper and mold it into the shape of a juggling ball, it becomes something I can work with and use."
We need to be kind of like these pieces of paper -- we need to allow God to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be.
"See, God wants to do all kinds of awesome things through us, but if we don't allow Him to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be, then how are we supposed to be of use?"
Isaiah 64:8 talks about God as our potter and us as the clay.
"Suppose you want to represent sets of strings, well you basically just generalize the hash function."
I think one of the classic ones for strings is called the
Rabin-Karp algorithm.
And it's simply the same idea that you have a mapping from your import into a set of integers.
"Wow, OK, maybe not so wow, but this is now constant."
This is constant time access.
So I can do searching in constant time which is great.
Where's the penalty?
What did I trade off here?
Well I'm going to suggest that what I did was I really traded space for time.
It makes me sound like an astro physicist somehow right?
What do I mean by that?
"I have constant time access which is great, but I paid a price, which is I had to use up some space."
In the case of integers it was easy.
"In the case of characters, so I have to give up a"
"list of 256, no big deal."
Imagine now you want to do faces.
"You've got a picture of somebody's face, it's a million pixels."
Each pixel has a range of values from zero to 256.
I want to hash a face with some function into an integer.
"I may not want to do the full range of this, but I may decide I have to use a lot of gigabytes of space in order to do a trade off."
"The reason I'm showing you this is it that this is a gain, a common trade off in computer science."
"That in many cases, I can gain efficiency if I'm willing to give up space."
"Having said that though, there may still be a problem, or there ought to be a problem that may be bugging you slightly, which is how do I guarantee that my hash function takes any input into exactly one spot in the storage space?"
She give any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
"Yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one."
"It was the conviction of her priest, she said, and she shared his beliefs."
Was it your impression that Emily had placed her care... ...entirely..?

Yes.

"(R. Brady) Thank you John, thank you all."
Thank you all.
We now have about 25 minutes  for questions and answers.
"Please, there are some microphones in the center aisle."
"Please make your question brief, the answers also may also be brief."
Please ask your question  of the whole group and whoever feels led to respond would do so.
"It maybe that no one feels ready to respond and your question needs just to sit with you, which is a wonderful form  of contemplation."
Rilke talks about it in a very famous  quotation about living the questions.
"We all have questions that will take years for us to get answers to, so we might not get them today."
Let's begin with the first question.
"(Man in the audience) Hello,"
I grew up and started practicing as a child in a discipline which is quite different  than anything you do.
And actually I became a teacher  of this tradition.
That tradition was alloted to and added to science.
"Science as a tradition, as a discipline, has become the dominant one  in our culture today."
"Now, one of the interesting things is that over the time that I was teaching,"
I was trying to teach the students one thing.
That is to understand reality.
"And I find that the Buddhist tradition is essentially trying to allow you  to do the same thing, to see reality clearly  and to understand it."
"I wonder whether you teach the students using the Four Noble Truths, etc, to do that."
"(M. Chaban) The new science is going to be something that doesn't divide subject and object, is not reductive and all the paradigms  that went with scientific materialism have been proven inaccurate."
"We have lived for 500 years with one world view and we are at the tipping point of what Michel Foucault, a French  philosopher would say is a new episteme."
If you look at and this is more... because I am sure you understand this if you are asking the question.
"But if you look at Dan Siegel's work,  he has done a breathless presentation  on what the new sciences will be."
It would include the subject 'the voice'.
"So, part of what we did today  is we talked about ourselves."
That wouldn't be allowed a few years ago in any kind of scientific presentation.
"Secondly of all,  we are polished scholarships."
"Some of us are Buddhists,  some of us are not."
"Yet, we deep into different traditions and use them because they counter and form each other in a positive way."
His Holiness said that Buddhism  is very scientific.
After the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games the UK government said it hoped to see Chinese people come to the 2012 Olympic Games
I wanted to go.
"People have travelled from China to London by motorcycle and car before but I thought going by rickshaw is more unique, and, of course, it's a traditional mode of transport in my country."
I really loved France.
"It had beautiful beaches, and really friendly people."
"After the Olympics is over I will go to the US by boat, travel around there, and then cycle to South America for the next Olympic games."
"Canon 6D, Nikon D600.."
We decided to make a battle between these two
"Hello, this is Digital TV and I'm Nadezhda Bakharova."
"These cameras appear to be in the same weight category, but if you like to count gramms and millimeters, you'll notice that Canon is slightly lighter and smaller."
The texture is quite similar on both of the cameras.
The bodies are made of magnesium alloy and polycarbonate.
"When you look at the basic features, Nikon makes a huge leap in front of Canon."
It's slightly faster with the burst rate of 5.5 frames per second compared to Canon's 4.5 fps ...more precise with the full-frame CMOS sensor of 24.3 MPS against Canon's 20.2 MPS... ...more accurate.
It has 39 focus points against Canon's 11... ...and Nikon's viewfinder coverage is 100% compared to Canon'ts 97%...
There's even more pros regarding Nikon - it has 2 SD card slots against 1 in the Canon 6D.
And one built-in flash against zero in the Canon 6D.
And it's a complete knockout.
"Still, Canon makes up with wider ISO range with a maximum at ISO 102400 against Nikon's ISO 25600"
"Also Canon's battery life is longer - it can take up to 1090 shots, while Nikon's battery allows it to take only 900 shots"
But the main advantages of Canon 6D are the built-in Wi-fi and GPS features
You can send photos to social networks and to print queue directly from the camera and also remotely manipulate it.
Travelers might find GPS coordinates quite useful in their journeys.
And that's how Canon can match Nikon's features.
"So, who's winning this battle - Canon or Nikon?"
You decide.
"Write your opinions below, in the comments."
See you soon!
"These cameras both come from the same family, but compared to his elder brother 6D is much more compact and weighs less."
All of the main buttons are placed on the right side of the back panel while 5D Mark ill has them near both sides of the display
There is certainly something strange happening.
"5 years ago, TED was something that was enjoyed by a 1,000 people once a year."
That's so funny!'
"Gideon said, 'Yah.'"
"Couldn't see any of them laughing, though"
But I'll need the votes of these common people
So there's some things these common people mustn't see
I'll hide my party from the common people
"'Cause if they see them, they'll never vote for me"
I can hug these hoodies and ride my bike
But there's some things the proles won't like
Gideon on a rich Russian's yacht
Backbenchers who still like shooting fox
"Homophobia, Ashcroft's lies"
"Boris talking, old-school ties"
"Then once I'm in, we're set for life"
Cut public spending overnight
"Sack off healthcare, cuts on jobs"
"Support the rich guys, and fuck the yobs"
I'll have the votes of the common people
Turn my back and do whatever I want to do
I'll turn my back on these common people
I'll turn my back on common people like you
"And then Gideon and I will go for drinky-poos because we're Tory, and that's what we do"
"Hi, I'm Bibiana."
I'm from Venezuela and I've been in Kiwi House for 4 years.
Kiwi House is one of the 24-hour care houses of the ministry Formando Vidas (Shaping Lives)
Here in Kiwi House we work with children of different ages and stages.
"Currently we work directly with 8 children; 4 full-time and 4 part-time in the ministry which come on weekends and some other times, because we're working with their moms."
Part of working in 24-hour care and Kiwi House is being a full-time mom
"We get up early, we cook, we clean, we help with homework"
All the general things of a family home
"That is very risky and tiring, but it also brings a lot of joy many times"
The background of the majority of the kids we work with in Casa Kiwi most of our kids have spent a lot of time on the streets
This institute is made for special needs people
They teach them Quran and the Deen.
we are now in chechnya in one of the ultimate Quran institute
This institute was built in 1904 - very old institute but it was renovated recently [in the past few years]
The strange thing about this institute is that there's 100 student- from them are normal students who memorize theQuran and from them [around 25 students] are special needs
"Those who are deaf, unable to speak and unable to see. and from one of the beautiful examples in this institute is a young man who's Russian"
"He converted to Islam, and he has this great keenness in wanting to learn the Quran, Keep in mind he's blind yet he wants to learn the Quran, ofcourse through braille and wants to memorize it as well."
MashaAllah i heard that he learned how to read braille in a small period of time and learned how to read the Quran very well.. how long did it take him to learn it?
"To be honest, to learn the correct way so that you can prefect the reading.. it takes a long period of time"
But i learned the basic of braille [connecting the letters and words together] in 2 days.
"This is due to that fact that I already knew how to read braille in Russian language and English, so I didnt find difficulty in learning the Arabic one."
Okay but why do care so much about leanring
Why does he want to learn this fast and is trying to seek nearness to Allah?
I have always had a desire to learn the Language of the Quran so that I can read it
This is why I left university of Moscow and came here.
I Ask Allah to ease my way in seeking this knowledge for his sake.
Does he enjoy it?
"- Ofcourse, with no doubt."
- This is concidered his Jannah on Earth
- He has found the Jannah of This dunyah by learning this language for the sake of learning the Speech of Allah.
"Allahu Akbar, this is beautiful!"
"- As you've heard, he left his studies and family to come and learn the Quran"
I asked him do you enjoy what you do? he said:
"Indeed I found the Heaven of This Dunyah by Learning the Quran. by Allah, this is a beautiful answer."
I heard that this young man is a soccer player in the National Team of Russia?
Yes I do play soccer with the National team of Russia that's made especially for blind people and we won the European cup just recently in Portugal
"So not only is he focusing on learning how to read braille in arabic, but he's also working on Quran memorization and he still active in other ways, the likes of his favorite sports and such"
He has many goals mashaAllah.
But our request is for him to Read to us
Surat An'baa:
"""About what are they asking one another?"
About the great news..That over which they are in disagreement
A multi pronged strategy will be most effective:
1.
BOYCOTT:
"All corporate products, beginning with Coke, McDonalds, ADM, and Monsanto."
Reduce to eliminate your consumption of gasoline.
You can start this now.
Lawsuits:
"The more of their resources are devoted to circular legal action, which is expensive, the more is taken out of their budget without producing anything."
"File lawsuits of every kind (class action, environmental damage, labor rights)."
2.
STRlKE:
The first week of July 2011.
"Take your vacation time, sick leave, organize your union to strike at this time."
Spend time with family at home!
The main thing is:
DON'T BUY ANYTHlNG FOR ONE WEEK.
"Continue as long as possible, buy the gasoline you will need for a week at least."
"Where legally possible if you rent, organize a rent strike in your building/community."
3.
PREPARE:
"Learn what wild foods are available to you, identify them, and eat them."
"Start a garden, organize within your community to become as food self sufficient as possible."
Store durable food a little at a time so you have a large supply by July.
Plan many crops that will begin to bear by the first week of July.
A permanent boycott will cause price disruption and stock deflation.
"A coordinated strike will cause specific timed disruption of currency movement (ie it's not coming out of your pocket, and you are not causing any more to be moved or produced), and preparedness to become independent permanently from key industries (industrial agriculture)."
"The only way to level the playing field with ""the powers that be"" is to take their money and make it valueless."
Complete abundance causes a market economy to crash!
"When you have everything you need, what do you need money for?"
THEY HAVE AS MUCH POWER AS WE BELlEVE IN THElR MONEY.
Together we can take one more step to bringing the machine to it's knees!
Grow your own food!
"Back 1 in x, we go down 3."
Just like that.
"So if we connect the dots here, it'll look something like this."
I'll do my best to draw a straight line.
"So the second graph, 2y plus 4 equals 6, we put it into slope-intercept form and we graphed it."
"Now, the whole point of this question was to identify the number of solutions that it has, the system."
A solution to a system of equations is an x and y value that satisfy both of these equations.
"Now, if there were such an x and y value that satisfied both of these equations, then that x and y value would have to lie on both of these graphs."
Because this blue line is all of the pairs of x and y's that satisfy the first equation.
The red line is all of the pairs of x's and y's that satisfy the second equation.
"So if something's going to satisfy both, it's got to be on both lines."
"When you look here, are there any points that are on both lines?"
"Well, no."
These two lines never intersect.
A point of intersection is a point that is common to both of these lines.
"No, they don't intersect."
No intersection.
So there is not a solution to this system of equations.
There is no solution.
We know that because these two lines don't intersect.
And you didn't even have to graph it.
The kind of giveaway was that these are two different lines.
"They have different y-intercepts, but their slopes are identical."
"So if you have two different y-intercepts and your slopes are identical, then you have two different lines that will never intersect."
"And if they represent a system, or if they're the graphs of a system of equations, that system has no solution."
We tried talking to him about the hot topic right now.
The legal battle for a home made video that Ohanie
Noa
Jennifer Lopez's ex husband is intending to publish but please observe Mark's reaction (the reporter says) But right now this is the question of the moment (he makes hand signals to proceed with the other question)
Next question
I want to know..
Next question at least tell what you think
"We used to have this beautiful, little bird: the mountain plover; also gone."
"This is sobering information, so what can we do?"
We can choose a better future.
"Let's apply the empathy that we have for our cats, dogs, and other pets to endangered species like this chimpanzee, but all endangered species."
Let's have fewer children; that's one of the most powerful-- (Applause)
- Thank you! - (Applause)
- I didn't expect that response. -
"That's one of the most powerful things that we can do in the United States; if we want to have kids, great; let's have two."
"If want to have more than two kids, let's adopt."
What else can we do?
"Well, we won't go there."
"So, what else can we do?"
We can help educate girls and provide economic opportunity to women in developing countries.
(Applause)
Amen!
"When we do that, those ladies choose to have to have smaller families, and we have more nutrition, more health care, more education for their kids, and the impact on the global population is huge."
"Finally, what we can do is we can give more to our planet."
"We can give half of our donations, let's say, to people and people-related causes, and half of our donations to the planet, to ocean conservation, to wildlife conservation."
"I want to mention, by the way, that today, we only give about 2 to 5% of all giving that goes to environment and wildlife as a category."
"You've been very patient with sometimes, a difficult topic;"
"I just want to say that the thing to think about is do we change, as a species, what do we do, so that our fellow living beings who happen not to be human can thrive alongside of us a 100, 500, and 1,000 years from now."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
"-- Hi, Jonathan!"
"Can you tell us who you are, please?"
"-- So I am the CTO at Normation, a company I founded in Paris, France, back in 2009."
I've basically a sysadmin background.
I've been using CFEngine since 2009 when the version 3 came out.
-- And can you tell us what is the role of Normation in CFEngine?
-- Normation is specialized in configuration management automation in general. we've actually been leading CFEngine training sessions across the world since 2011.
I think that to this state we've trained more than 150 people in CFEngine
I think the first session was in Paris for obvious reasons -- because we're based there.
And the soundtrack tells us the story.
It begins with a romantic score.
"But then, as he begins to doubt and explain his reasons, the track will change."
"And we'll slip closer into that mysterium score we had, which is associated with Finn and the ghost ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I expected a different response Will."
"I thought we were both waiting for this. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I had waited, I wanted this."
"Now this what I do and say, I'm afraid. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Afraid of me?"
"A very important scene, because it's our only exposition on his past."
"And it's our first insight into his mind, that he is questioning himself."
"[music] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; It was awful, Helen, I've never forgotten it."
We were run down in a fog of the coast of.
"Now, of course, the audience is meant to be paying attention to the performance and the actors and the characters and maybe not notice the sound directly."
But it's there and it's working on us.
And it's one of the ways that this film chips away at happy surfaces and shows us that underneath.
"There's despair, there is fear and death."
I mean this is a man who's already been consumed by his job who can no longer love. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; By this morning when the boy testified against me I could barely keep my seat.
[music]
"Give me a chance to get over this, this feeling that I don't know myself."
"And he's going to try to make ammends, and offer a happy future, but we know better."
"And so he can try to make a moment offer a happy future, but we know better."
"We know, I think by this point that he is beyond, beyond hope."
"Now Ghost Ship is actually more innovative by using sounds within the film world to comment on and undercut the surface story to show the dark side while the rest of the crew seems to think things are, are going well."
And I think this is mainly how Sir Lancelot works who plays Billy Radd.
He's the calypso singer.
"And watch how it works in, in this particular moment, we're going to hear that theme of blow the man down come back in."
"And its coming in, right as the radio man is talking about how he keeps his nose clean, and he is going to ignore [crosstalk] the danger's by putting on his headset."
"Life is easy for him, now we have this."
[music]
Way blow the man down.
Roll up your white canvas jib spanker and all.
Give me some time to blow the man down.
Then the breeze it blew gaily a terrible gale.
"It's actually a scene that's a simple ellipsis showing the ship traveling, right?"
Even in the presence of cycles in our relation.
"This is an important conversation for our children, for our communities, for Democrats, and Republicans .Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important:"
"Violence is a big problem, too many children are dying."
Too many children.
We must do something.
"It will be hard, but the time is now."
You must act.
"Be bold, be courageous,"
Americans are counting on you.
Thank you
"I'm going to start with a quote by the Dalai Lama,"
"""Today, more than ever before,"
"life must be characterized by a sense of universal responsibility not only nation to nation and human to human but human to other forms of life."""
That's what I'm here to talk about;
"I'm passionate about wildlife conservation, thus, other forms of life."
"In the last ten years, I've done everything I can to learn as much as I can about it."
"I've read books, I've talked to experts,"
"I've gone to conferences, and traveled the world."
I wanted to see for myself what's going on in these places.
"I visited chimpanzees in Uganda,"
I visited mountain gorilla families in Rwanda.
"Everywhere I go, the root cause of the dwindling numbers of these species is human population pressure."
"A recent visual example I saw of this is in Uganda, with farms going up the hillside right to the boundary of Bwindi National Park, part of the last remaining habitat for the mountain gorilla."
Let's talk about population.
"We're at 6.7 billion people in the world today, expected to rise to nine or ten billion just in the next 40 years."
The problem is we've already got a billion people who don't have enough to eat.
"What is it going to be like when we increase the pressure, the human population pressure, by another 50%?"
"So, I think, what we are going to have are more conflicts, more wars over scarcer resources,"
less drinking water per person.
"We're going to have less food per person, more disease, and suffering."
"It's difficult to comprehend, but that's suffering on a global scale when we are talking about billions of people."
I know this is sobering to think about.
But I'm going to look at the hook scene now because it's a fabulous example of how sound and image can create a monster where there's no monster there.
"Innocently enough, with a little hook, actually a big hook, swinging on a chain and the sailor noticing it."
Just a little sound.
"Right, and so our hero mimics exactly what his officer told him."
[inaudible]
Now we cut to the sinister scene on the bridge and this lighting is just mad.
"We got this low lighting that comes right on their faces, the sound of the bells which is a motif across the film and quiet talk."
"So, we're going in to a dark, dark world here and that setting up the attack of the monster watch."
"Still in gentle sling, but now it's a massive beast that's intruding into the frame, and in the first attack of the hook."
"Watch by Stone using passes, and in-communicative and stern, and also simply wrong."
[crosstalk]
"Now, the it's going to, to become the monster at night, attacking the night watchmen."
"We hear the crashing, off screen sound."
"We don't see it and he's going to use his flashlight to track it, there it goes."
It explodes across the foreground.
We can see its distance of the swing by how he moves the flashlight.
We don't actually see how much it's swinging.
And now the crashing becomes more complex.
We hear it swing and then crash into something.
"And then swing again, but we don't see it."
So sound is mapping the movement before we see it.
"Then we discover it, right?"
"We discover all the parts, too."
"We see it swing past the man out over the deck, and then come back to hit this ladder."
And any ladders that sound to crash[SOUND].
The climax that this is the boat and it illustrates the power of this things.
"Finally, we get it done to control that just variable."
"Disaster is averted, there really is too much potential energy to tie down this hook."
Which mean this is not really about the hook at all.
There's something on this ship that must explode.
"There is something troubling that will break through the surface, and harm men no matter how hard they try."
"And by using sound, I think what Lewton and Robson do is make it more than a hook."
"Of course, we need it for ATP, we need it to build the phosphate sugar backbone of DNA, and we need it for energy transmission and so forth; all life needs it for that."
But it is really pretty scarce in the crust.
So it is usually limiting.
"Now if you just go out there and you pour a bunch of phosphate into the landscape, this is what you get."
Okay?
"You get lakes filled with algal blooms, and that is showing you the dramatic response of-- the algal population and plant population in lakes is showing you that phosphorous really is the limiting factor."
"So phosphate fertilizer is very important in agro-ecosystems, and phosphate fertilizer gets washed into lakes and fish die."
Why do fish die in an eutrophic lake that has a lot of algae in it?
What's killing them?
Yes?
Student:
"Because when the algae becomes decomposed, those &amp;gt; will take a lot of it and change it into nitrogen. &amp;gt;"
Prof:
"Well you've got it right about anoxia, but you got the mechanism wrong."
"By the way, the bottom of a eutrophic lake is anoxic and the process you described is going on there."
But the algae don't have to die to do that.
Student: &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well the algae certainly are taking the sunlight out of the top of the water.
But when does the oxygen disappear from the lake?
"I remember the bad joke about the astronaut who was not so bright, who said, ""Ah, we are going to take our new spacecraft and we are going to"
"land on the sun."""
"And he was asked, ""How are you ever going to"
"land on the sun?"""
"And he said, ""Don't worry, we are going at night."""
It happens at night.
At night the algae are all there.
"They're not making oxygen because there's no photons coming in, but they still have to breathe themselves, and they just suck all the oxygen out of the water and the fish are asphyxiated."
They don't have to die to do it.
They're just naturally living their lives as normal healthy algae and they suck the oxygen out of the water at night.
"Okay, so some take-home points on ecosystems."
"Movement of matter and energy around the planet is really important, and there are some really interesting large-scale issues."

Captioned by SpongeSebastian
-And that will conclude Elmo's order.
Let's say I have an n-by-n matrix that looks like this.
So let me just see if I can do it in general terms.
"In the first row and first column, that entry has a 1, and then everything else, the rest of the n minus 1 rows in that first column are all going to be zeroes."
So it's going to be zeroes all the way down to the nth term.
"And then the second column, we have a 0 in the first component, but then a 1 in the second component."
And then it goes zeroes all the way down.
And you keep doing this.
"In the third row, or let me say third column, although it would've applied to the third row as well, the 1 shows up in the third component, and then it's zeroes all the way down."
"Essentially, you have the ones filling up the diagonal of this matrix right here."
"So if you go all the way to the nth column or the nth column vector, you have a bunch of zeroes until you get-- you have n minus 1 zeroes, and then the very last component, the nth component there will be a 1."
"So you have essentially, a matrix with ones down the diagonal."
"Now, this matrix has a bunch of neat properties and we'll explore it more in the future."
But I'm just exposing you to this because it has one very neat property relative to linear transformations.
"But I'm going to call this the identity matrix and I'll call this I sub n, and I called that sub n because it's an n-by-n identity matrix."
"I sub 2 would be equal to a 2-by-2 identity matrix, so it would look like that."
And I sub 3 would look like this:
"1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1."
I think you get the point.
"Now, the neat thing about this identity matrix becomes evident when you multiply it times any vector."
"We can multiply this guy times the n-component vector, a member of Rn."
So let's do that.
You might not know it at the time but I call them growing pains.

When somebody dies it tells you the value of life.
When you break up with someone you love it tells you how valuable relationships are.
When you get disappointed it tells you just how your expectations were far far too unreal.
"When somebody dies, it shows that your time here is not that long, so I must make better use of it."
"All of these so-called negative experiences they're all teachers, so we should never reject them."
Allow them to come intro our heart.
Make good kamma with the bad kamma you're experiencing now.
That way we grow and those positive emotions become stronger and stronger inside of us.
"We become beacons to the world, people who don't get afraid, don't get angry, who don't have grief."
"But have lots of kindness, lots of joy, huge amounts of peace."
Positive emotions grow at the expense of the negative ones.
They grow and grow and grow.
This is actually the path.
What a wonderful thing it is to cherish and nurture these beautiful positive emotions of life.
"Understand where they come from, nurture them, grow them, the negative ones become less and less a part of your repertoire."
"You don't get angry, you get very kind."
"You don't get depressed, you just get wonderfully inspired."
"You don't get so fault-finding, you'd be grateful in the smallest of things, even in..."
"I shouldn't say that, I was going to say a small John Howard."
The smallest of things.. [laughter].
"I shouldn't give him a hard time, he's not a bad guy."
And that way we can have a happier
"life and we can understand the role of emotions in life, how to deal with them, how embrace them, how to generate the positive ones and have a happy time."
"So may you all have a happy time by developing the positive emotions, understanding the negative ones, and understanding how this all works."
"So that's the talk for this evening, thank you very much for listening."

"A high school reunion brings some 50 former students to Riceville, Iowa."
"Eleven of them--some with their spouses and children--arrive early for a special reunion with their former third-grade teacher, Jane Elliott."
This presentation is delivered by the Stanford Center for Professional
Development.
Hey there!
"Oh, we're back."
We're back and now we're getting down and dirty.
"We'll do more pointers, and link"
"list, and implementations."
It's actually going to be like our life for the next week and half.
"There's just even more implementation, trying to think about how those things work on the backside."
So
I will do another alternate implementation of the stack today.
So we did one based on vector and we're going to do one based on a link list.
"And then I'm going to do a cube based on link list, as well, to kind of just mix and match a little bit."
"And then, we're still at the end of the case study, which the material is covered in Chapter 9."
I probably won't get thorough all of that today.
"What we don't finish today we'll be talking about on Friday, and then we'll go on to start talking about map implementation and look at binary search trees."
How many people started [inaudible]?
How many of you got somewhere feeling good?
Not just yet.
"One thing I will tell you is that there are two implementations you're working on and I listed them in the order of the one that the material we've seen the most, right."
We've talked about link list more than we have talked about things that are tree and heat based.
So I listed that one first.
"But, in fact, actually, in terms of difficulty of coding,"
"I think, the second one is little bit more attractable than the first."
So there's no reason you can't do them in either order if it feels good to you to start on the second one before you come back to the first one.
"Or just trade off between working on them if one of them is giving you fits just look at the other one to clear your head, so just a thought about how to approach it."
Okay.
So I am going to do some coding.
I'm going to come back to my slides in a little bit here.
"""You're doing so great!"
"Keep going!"" ... and a bad self on the other side saying, ""Aw, come on ... just one won't hurt."""
And sometimes ... in a moment of weakness ... the bad self wins.
Having a slip-up can make you feel guilty and disappointed in yourself ... but that's not helpful.
"In fact, those bad feelings could set you up for another lapse."
"The truth is, slip-ups happen ... and they happen to almost everyone who quits smoking."
So forget the guilt and disappointment.
What's important now is to
learn from your mistake so a lapse doesn't turn into a relapse.
"Chances are, you slipped because of one of three things: your environment ... your cravings ... or your social support system."
So let's take a good look at each one.
First ... your environment.
Think about the slip-up.
When did it happen?
What were you doing?
Who were you with?
Maybe you're used to smoking when you drink coffee or alcohol ... when you go to certain places ... or when you're around people who stress you out.
Keep track of the things that trigger you to smoke.
"It can help you see patterns, which can help you plan how to deal with your triggers ... or avoid them ... so you can stay strong."
"Next, if your cravings got you to light up again, think about nicotine replacement."
Using medicine can more than double your chances of quitting.
Never tried it?
"Consider an over-the-counter product like the patch, inhaler,"
"lozenges, or gum."
"If you're already using nicotine replacement, keep using it ... even if you slipped up ... and ask your doctor if there are other medicines that might help you."
"Finally, how's your support system?"
It's harder to quit if you're around people who aren't ready to quit with you.
"So when you're with people who aren't ready to quit, ask them not to smoke around you ... and spend more time with people who want you to succeed."
"If you could use more people on your side, join a support group ... find an online quit program ... or call a quitline."
"If you have a smart phone, quit-smoking applications are another way to get encouragement."
Some let you record video messages from loved ones that you can watch when you're tempted to smoke.
Other apps can connect you with friends on social networking sites so they can cheer you on.
Anyone interested?
Couple of you?
Yeah.
"So, Greywater, it's from sinks, showers and washing machines."
So its water that's a little bit dirty but it's not too dirty to other plants.
"It's never from toilets and it's not from washing diapers, so it doesn't have thicker matter in it."
"It's not like the toilets, which would be not safe to reuse."
"Kitchen sinks, it depends on what state you"
live in if it's considered Greywater or not.
"In California, kitchen sinks are not allowed to be--we're not allowed to reuse that water legally."
So I want to break Greywater into three ways.
The first one is for outdoor use.
"This is just taking the Greywater, sending it outside."
"You're taking a shower, it's going out just directly and irrigating your plants."
So that's the simplest way to use it.
It's low tech.
We try not to have pumps or filters or things that require maintenance and mechanical devices.
"The second way is also for outdoor use, but this is a little different."
"It's taking Greywater and sending it through a drip irrigation system, which is a lot more complicated because Greywater has hair in it, has lint, it has little, you know, chunks of things."
It's a little gunky.
"And so, if you want to send that to drip irrigation, you're going have to really filter it and get all the particles out."
"And so, then you just have a much more complex system."
So it's a really different way to use the water.
And then the third way is indoor use.
"And so that's for non-potable uses, such as toilet flushing, and possibly laundry washing."
And it's also a lot more complicated to get greywater back inside because it has to be filtered and disinfected and it's pumped and it's connected to the domestic water supply.
And it's really just a whole other level of system.
It's also not really allowed under the new code in any practical way and so it's definitely a good resource for bigger scale projects like commercial buildings.
"For residential, it's usually not very appropriate."
"And so, when you're thinking about any type of Greywater System, the soaps and the products you use really matter because now that water is going to your plants."
So there's a couple of things you want to avoid.
You want to avoid any salt compound.
"By one measure, the US stock of money is now $8.7 trillion--up 12% since last year."
And some people are still pocketing a huge share of that cash.
"Last year, despite the onset of the biggest financial crisis since the Depression, his hedge fund paid George Soros a cool $2.5 billion."
That's roughly 41 000 times more than the average American family earned.
"As they say on Wall Street,"
"""Way to go."""
"Now however, imagine a world with no money."
"500 years ago, the most powerful society in South America, the Inca Empire, had no real concept of money."
The Incas appreciated the aesthetic qualities of rare metals.
Gold was the sweat of the sun.
"Silver, the tears of the moon."
"Labour was the unit of value in the Inca Empire, just as it was later supposed to be in a Communist society."
"But in 1532, the Incas ran into a man whose hunger for money had led him across an ocean."
Francisco Pizarro and his fellow conquistadors had come from Spain to what the called
"Upper Peru, inspired by the legend of Eldorado-- the realm of the gold-covered king."
"After defeating the Inca army at the Battle of Cajamarca, their quest began in earnest."
"At Potosi, in what is now Bolivia, the Spaniards struck it rich."
They discovered the Cerro Rico--
"literally, the ""rich hill""."
"Towering nearly 16 000 feet above sea level, it was a money mountain."
"In that 250 years of Spanish rule, more than 2 billion ounces of silver were extracted from mines like this one-- 14 000 feet up in the Andes."
What the Incas couldn't grasp was why the Europeans had such an insatiable lust for gold and silver.
They couldn't understand that to
"Pizarro and the Conquistadors, silver was much more than just shiny metal."
"It could be made into money-- a store of value, a unit of account-- portable power."
"I must say, I find this place pretty harrowing."
"Spaniards had a system of forced labour, which meant that every able-bodied male in the native population had to do a stint down in these mines."
And you can see why 1 in 8 of them didn't survive the ordeal.
"Today, 500 years later, conditions for miners in the Cerro Rico haven't improved much."
But at least they get paid for the work they do.
"In those days, it was a way of making money but verged on genocide."
"The silver ore was ground up, refined with mercury, and then shipped to Europe as bars and coins. made the Spanish crown rich beyond the dreams of avarice."
"I thought to myself,  ""That is a good idea."""
"Mindfulness Without Borders not only develops programs  for health-care provider, professionals and the adults that surround youth, but let's do something for youth as well."
"And in time, with a group  of wonderful practitioners, and educators and lay people, and the younger generation thinkers, we developed curriculum called  The Mindfulness Ambassador Council."
"What separates us, I believe,  from the strictly mindfulness curriculum is that we wed social and emotional  competencies into the program."
It is 12 weeks.
"We teach and facilitate conversations in a council, where we value everybody's voice equally,  where there is no discrimination."
No discrimination.
(Laughs)
"And where we appreciate diversity, where we build self-esteem and, more than ever, where we hear people, we hear anyone who is in our council."
"We hear their voices, and we value them."
"So, our core values in the organization  are core concepts of mindfulness."
Our programs that we built  are core concepts of mindfulness.
"And we start off with breathing,"
We start off with using the breath  to bring us into the present moment.
We move into understanding and  talking about some of the challenges that prevent us from being our best self.
"We develop conversation around being compassionate, empathetic, understanding."
And all through the council process where  we just deeply listen to one another.
"It has been remarkable journey, and I think that if we all begin to take what we know best, model mindfulness to others, and advocate for that together as a community,"
I think we will be stronger.
I know we are in 23 states of Toronto  capital and district school board.
"And had it not for two lovely women who  are here, Rita Mamon and Diane Benasco, we would have never gone  as deep as we have there."
We plan to expand the roots  and we look to you as advocates.
"So, thank you and if you want  to learn more, we have a faculty here and we are in the bookstore there."
Thank you very very much.
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Theo."
Can we have one bell?
(Half bell) (Bell)
(R. Brady) Our next speaker  will be Jon Kristian Salunga.
Jon is a classroom teacher  in a high school in San Diego.
"He teaches English and like many of you, he teaches in public schools."
It is probably not so easy  to actually teach a practice so that may not be  the door you come in.
We will hear from Jon  about the door he has entered.
It just doesn't solve the problem and doesn't actually fulfill its promises.
"And just was it in January, when I was going off to Indonesia to give a series of talks I got to Perth airport and found that the Garuda flight was cancelled."
It was actually delayed by about 18 hours.
"And I was a monk so I just went up to the counter and said, ""Oh is it delayed?"
When is it going to leave?
18 hours.
"Okay, thank you very much,"" and I sort-of called the monastery and got a lift back to the monastery."
"But the people behind me they were thumping the counter - ""You can't do this to us!"
"I've got all of these arrangements and plans!"" I had arrangements and plans as well - thousands of people were waiting to listen to my talks."
But I couldn't do anything about it.
And you know all that anger and all that thumping and all that shouting.. it didn't make the plane leave earlier.
It didn't do anything good at all except making people upset.
"Themselves upset, and other people upset."
So really what is the use of anger?
You can intimidate somebody for a short time but they will always want revenge.
They won't respect you.
"And if you're a boss they'll only do what you want, they'll only do what you want for the time being, only because you're there."
They won't do what you've asked them out of respect.
Just out of fear.
And that's no way to have any sort of relationship or any sort of business.
Really anger doesn't make any sense to me.
So anger and fear and grief and depression these are negative emotions.
So first of all when these happen what should we do about them?
There's something in Buddhism called the second factor of the eightfold path.
The eightfold path is a way to happiness to enlightenment and the second factor is one of my favourite factors of that path.
It's called right intention or right attitude.
And I love that because it is an attitude which we have to everything we deal with in life.
Whether it's the physical world or the emotional world.
The path to enlightenment hinges on our attitude to things.
"So if you have depression or anger or grief, what should one's reaction be?"
"And the three parts of right attitude in Buddhism - second factor of the eightfold path - is letting go, kindness and gentleness."
The three factors.
- Have you seen it?
Just asking.
- Why did you ask?
- What?
Wait here.
I'll be back.
"- OK, just go."
How's the giant ghost bat?
Giant ghost bat my ass.
"Che, it's a pity you don't get to see a giant ghost bat."
I'm scared.
I'm scared?
Shit.
"Getting a sense for the way space time works in special relativity is very challenging and one of the ways that traditionally we Become accustomed to this and help wrap our minds around the weirdness, is to challenge ourselves with paradoxes."
"Almost invariably, they end up having to do with simultaneity because it's the relativity of what right now means that is really so current to everything that we are used to seeing."
"So, in this optional clip, I'm going to take advantage of my time and go through two of the most famous paradoxes in special relativity and discuss them in some detail and hopefully that will help clear things up and I suspect spur a lot of forum discussion because I'm not going to manage to clear everything up here."
"So let's start with a, a ladder paradox."
Ladder paradox is if you want urban parking problem.
The idea is you have a long
ladder of length L and the short garage of length G but G is less than L and you want to fit the long ladder into the short garage.
And the idea is very simple.
You come running with a ladder at the garage at a very high speed.
"Then, therefore the"
long ladder is going to be Lorentz contracted to the point if v is high enough where it is shorter than g.
"Notice that by making v close enough to c, I can make the Lorentz contracted ladder as short as I want."
"And voila, the ladder fix in the garage."
The ladder is fixed in the garage but note it only fixed in the garage while its moving very rapidly to the right.
"An obvious puzzle occurs because this may be true but relativity says I can look well, view the same situation from the point of view of somebody sitting on top of the ladder."
"And from the point of view of the ladder, the ladder is at rest, that's an inertial frame, the ladder is moving with a constant velocity to the right v. in the"
"ladder frame the ladder itself is stationary, while the garage is moving at exactly the same speed v but to the left approaching the ladder."
But from the
"ladder point of view, the ladder's length is L, its at rest."
Hand out of the frame!
What is this fractal snake doing here?
"Vi uses speed ramps and transitions, effects available in Adobe Premiere to produce a fluid switch between her hands and the intern's hands."
"My video includes snippets of Vi's video and  her video includes snippets of my video so our two videos are intertwined, like Escher's Drawing Hands"
"When I began watching Vi's videos, I wanted to know where Vi sets her camera and desk when shooting her doodling videos."
Alright!
So I got my tripod with my camera.
Looking at my notebook.
And I guess usually you don't know what else is on my desk.
In this case...Well there is always going to be sharpies everywhere on all sides... and possibly some snakes...
I have this pen holder for holding my sharpies...but  very quickly they end up screwing around.
My script is here for reference.
I have some lights clipped  to random things...That I may or may not use.
Sometimes I like to spin around in my chair when I am waiting
I do a lot of chair spinning...
Many of you may be wondering whether she storyboards her doodling?
No!
She just draws whatever fits her script.
"After shooting, she does a voiceover, typically at home  because it is quieter than her office."
She uses a Blue Microphone to capture the best possible sound.
"She records straight into Audacity, a free audio editor and recorder."
As you'll learn later on in this video the vlogbrothers appreciated vi's videos and as a present gave  her a mic and a higher resolution camera than the one she had been using before.
"If you look closely at my video, you can see  Vi is shooting on a Canon VlXIA HF M40."
Next Vi edits her video.
She uses Adobe Premiere on her Toshiba laptop.
She speeds up videos so you can see in just  a few minutes what takes hours to shoot.
Then she syncs it to her voiceover so that her  narration correlates to the images in the video.
Next she uploads her new creation to YouTube.
"Vi has a ""cool"" interface on YouTube because she is a partner."
"Following up on the theme of this video, recursion, Vi  and I point our cameras at each other."
"On the basis of viewers"" and fans"" comments and questions, Vi  and I decided to do a short interview."
"If you have questions about Vi's videos that aren't answered in my video, please let me know by writing a comment  below and I will answer them on a live chat, see the description below for the date and time."
"If you were to invoke the edit menu while you're on ""This Words"""
"There is an option in there that says ""replace."""
And replace essentially suggests misspellings.
But it does not do a document-wide check as you're used to with Microsoft Word or Word Perfect.
It does it on a word-by-word basis.
"Do you have a microphone or no? ...Zahir, oh, ok, good."
I want to make sure that people on the phone.. what Zahir was saying that
There is an edit mode that lets you go into a replace mode and it'll actually give you suggestions for a given misspelled word.
"But you can't do a document check for all of your errors like you can, with, you know, more sophisticated spell checkers."
I've never played with that.
"And when I get home, that's something I'm going to mess around with."
It sounds like it would be a good thing for me to know about.
[Apple software speaking voice reading letters of the alphabet]
"Alright, so now ... [Apple software speaking voice]"
Someone is saying I have two spaces.
"And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what's confusing."
"And this is something, it takes a little bit getting used to."
For those of you who are Windows screen reader users-- when you are move letter by letter or word by word you are always on the character that you are landing on.
"And if you type, you're always going to push that character to the right."
"So whether you're moving three words or ten letters, it doesn't matter."
Your cursor is always going to end up on the character that will be pushed to the right if you type.
"With the i devices, the difference is significant, in that, if you arrow to the left you're before the word or letter."
"If you arrow to the right, you're after the letter."
"And one of the things I keep doing now is I'm hitting the Option Right arrow-- um, and I'm thinking I'm before the word, but I'm actually ending up after the word."
"So, I'm actually finding that a little confusing myself because I've been working on a Windows PC all week and this is a little bit different for me, cuz I haven't taken notes with this maybe in a week, week and half."
"So, let me see if I can quickly get this word fixed here for you guys."
"[Apple software speaking voice reading letters of the alphabet, speaking some words]"
"And what I'm showing you guys, and this is very interesting, you can tell, all the notes I take"
I email to myself.
I don't edit them on this device.
I email them to my PC.
And I edit them using Windows.
"I've always wanted to be able to teach everybody, every single person and that's not been easy and I don't think I can teach everybody."
"But this experiment, hopefully which becomes an ongoing activity in my"
"life, I feel like this gives me the ability to reach out to you on a one to one basis and hopefully."
"Make you learn, and be excited."
Finally.
I love change and uncertainty.
Because life would be pretty boring if I knew exactly what was going to happen when.
I know sometimes in life you want certainty.
But I'm talking about most of life.
Uncertainty is what gives you value in life.
So remember we are experimenting here.
I want you to come with that attitude.
I'm going to learn
"Finance in a new way, and I'm going to go with it."
There'll be glitches.
There'll be errors made along the way from your side.
"Maybe from technology, maybe from some errors in the assignments or so and so forth."
I'm almost sure we'll try our best not for that to happen.
"But if something happens, remember, you are a pioneer, I am a pioneer, and we are working on it together."
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a week.
And may the force be with you.
See you soon.
Bye.
"Often times we think about the dangers of vehicles on the highways, but we rarely think about how dangerous they can be when we're parked in a driveway."
"You know, probably more children die every year than we'll ever imagine from being backed over, from a caring, loving, parent, or a visitor, who never intended to cause harm to that child."
"You know, with children playing, they're not paying attention to what the adults are doing, or the drivers are doing."
"And even from inside the vehicle, they could even check both mirrors,"
"left / right, rear-view mirror, and think that they really are clear, and that they can't see anybody."
"But you'd be surprised how a child can somehow maneuver their way into the back of a vehicle, into a blindspot, and you may never even know they're there, until it's too late."
"Then the driver puts the car into reverse, backs out, and that's all it takes."
"It's going to be important for a person to know where the children are at, at all times."
"Maybe even to say, everybody could you move into the yard, or could you move onto the porch until we back away, and are out of the driveway altogether."
I'll give you a couple of examples.
"Schools are still pretty much organized on factory lines - ringing bells, separate facilities, specialized into separate subjects."
We still educate children by batches.
"You know, we put them through the system by age group."
Why do we do that?
"You know, why is there this assumption that the most important thing kids have in common is how old they are?"
"You know, it's like the most important thing about them is their date of manufacture"
"Well, I know kids who are much better than other kids at the same age in different disciplines, you know, or at different times of the day, or better in smaller groups then in large groups, or sometimes they want to be on their own."
"If you're interested in the model of learning, you don't start from this production line mentality."
"These are, it's essentially about conformity."
And increasingly it's about that as you look at the growth  of standardized testing and standardized curricula.
And it's about standardization.
I believe we've got to go in the exact opposite direction.
That's what I mean about changing the paradigm.
"There was a great study done recently of divergent thinking, published a couple of years ago."
Divergent thinking isn't the same thing as creativity.
I define creativity as the process of having original ideas  that have value.
Divergent thinking isn't a synonym.
But it's an essential capacity for creativity.
"It's the ability to see lots of possible answers to a question,"
lots of possible ways of interpreting a question.
"To think, what Edward de Bono would probably call laterally."
"To think, not just in linear or convergent ways."
"To see multiple answers, not one."
"So, I mean, there are tests for this."
"I mean, one kind of cod example would be, people might be asked to say how many uses can you think of for a paper clip."
Those routine questions.
Most people might come with 10 or 15.
People who are good at this might come up with 200.
"And they do that by saying, well, could the paper clip be turned, and a foot tall, and be made out of foam rubber."
"You know, like, does it have to be a paper clip as we know it, Jim."
"Now, there are tests for this."
"We informed about what was happening in Malaga, Gijon..."
We have been in many cities.
"And I can tell you in Madrid, for example, the work was mainly developed thanks to"
"Jessica Romero, Lidia Molina, also my own work where other people like Leila Nachawati and Olga Roríguez collaborated..."
"The family of Periodismo Humano is large and more or less intensely, depending on each person, we have all collaborated a lot."
With the coordination of Javier and Patricia who made it possible for everything to fit in and make sense.
"But, a normal day of coverage during the 15M, during those first weeks,"
"I would get up late, because the night before"
"I had gone to bed very late, go to the Puerta del Sol, and start talking to people and ask them what they were doing there, who they were, if it was true that they were hippies or radicals or violent... or if it was true that they weren't going to vote, or if they had fleas."
"I don't know, ask them who they were."
And from there lots of interesting things came to light.
"And you spend your day talking to people, listening in on the assemblies to understand what it was all about."
I remember telling one of my co-workers:
"""Get a computer and write down everything we've heard, these are the 15M political proposals""."
"Because someone had decided to read a list of things that they had talked about in an assembly, areas of work."
Areas of work where they would form commissions.
"So at that moment, in my short-minded journalist's brain, I thought that was the headline."
And I asked my co-worker to write it down.
"From that moment until it was published everything calmed down a lot, and fortunately we weren't wrong and we didn't slip up."
But we could have.
Because at that moment you didn't know what we were looking at.
"But our job was to be there 12 or 15 hours with the people, uploading photos and video."
"Not just for the sake of uploading them, but looking for humane details that defined what was happening."
To escape from the freakshow idea.
To escape from the freakshow idea and the exception.
NOT to go up to the wierdest looking man in the square.
Because that didn't define what was going on.
NOT to find the biggest Mohawk haircut.
Because Mohawk haircuts are fine but they didn't define what was going on.
"NOT to go up to someone with a bottle of beer in his hand, that didn't define what was happening in the square."
Just talk to people.
12 hours.
A lapse can lead to a relapse ... but it doesn't have to.
Use what you learned from your slip-up to fine-tune your quit plan and commit again to being smoke-free.

WARREN:
"Hi, I'm Charles Warren."
I'm a User Experience Designer on mobile and welcome.
Thanks for coming.
"I want to introduce Laura Allen, who for many years has been a champion of Greywater out of Oakland."
She was the founder of Greywater Guerillas.
"You may be aware that it used to not be strictly legal to use Greywater for irrigations, so she led a lot of the work to cut those policy changes and things done."
We're very happy to have her.
And Greg Bullock is a contractor and installer who build these systems.
He's going to talk about some of the ways you can go about and thinking through whether a Greywater system makes sense for you.
And I think they've got us--they're going to lay down the gauntlet for us Googlers.
"So, without further ado, take it away Laura and Greg and thank you so much for being here. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Thanks for having me.
I'm Laura.
"I'm a co-founder of Greywater Guerilla's, now known as Greywater Action."
"Before we start talking about Greywater, I want to think about--first thing, think about water for a sec."
So I have a couple of cups of water over here and I want you to--so the first one represents a country.
It's totally full; it's got 156 gallons of water in it.
"Anyone want to guess what country what might use this amount per day, as per capita use? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The U.S.? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:"
"Yeah, the United States."
"This other cup, this represents a continent now and this is representing about 88 gallons per person per day."
"So it's just residential use: cooking, drinking, watering their landscape, not agriculture, not industry."
Anyone want to guess what continent might use this much? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Europe. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yep.
Europe.
"By adding all streets surrounding the square , the area becomes at most 130,000 square meters which will fit at most 516,000 persons i.e., about four protesters for each meter square based on the international standards"
Protesters against Morsi were gathered in additional square which is the perimiter of the presidential house (AL-ETEHADYA)
"Thousands were around the perimeter that was around 1.4 Km and width of 45 m which means total area about 63,000 meter square"
"And another protest at the north the presidential house with an area of 9000 meter square which means total protests area around the presidential house is 72,000 meter square that fits at most 288,000 protesters hence, the total number of protesters in the largest two squares is alittle more than 800,000 protesters i.e., less than a million protester over a total area of about 200,000 meter square"
which is 60% of the area of ALHARAM in Makkah (One of the largest gathering squares in the world)
"As the area of Alharam based on the Saudi government is 356,000 meter square fits about 1.25 million based on the official Saudi government release"
Investigators said some other cities had protests against President Morsi but the main protests were in Altahrir and Alethadya in Cairo
Cairo has one fifth of the total Egypt population
With another mathematical equation
less than a million from one fifth of Cairo population were out to protest against President Morsi
"And if the same density were there in the rest of the Egyptian cities we will reach to the same result, that about 4 millions at most participated in the 6-30 protests"

"And today, it's something enjoyed by about 300,000 people every day."
"Tela mentioned, more than 100 million TED talks have been viewed."
"When you think about that, it's strange, you know, 100 million lectures viewed on the Internet, who would've thought?"
How did it happen?
This event here today actually seems equally miraculous to me.
TED itself had really nothing to do with organizing it.
"And, trust me, organizing an event like this takes a huge amount of effort."
"And, yet, it's one of more than 100 would be held this year around the world as part of this TEDx program of independently organized TED events."
The program still in Beta hasn't really even started yet.
No one is making any money.
"This is being done for passion, curiosity."
How did that happen?
So I should warn you that the story I will tell it's not like a top-down plan of some determination to propagate TED to the world.
I think you'll discover TED has a life of its own.
"More mysterious than that, it's a story of a very strange, but I think beautiful, cultural phenomenon that has emerged out of a really remarkable community, which by the way includes you."
"So, TED past, present, and future."
TED started as an experiment in convergence.
"The brilliant Richard Wurman and Harry Marks figured it out 25 years ago that industries of technology, entertainment, and design were converging, that if you brought together the people from those 3 worlds, they would have interesting things to say to each other."
"So, it turned out the first TED held in 1984 showcased the brand-new Apple Macintosh and Sony showed off this strange, shiny, silver, round disks containing digital sounds which were the first CDs."
"And both objects, if you like, oozing technology, entertainment, and design."
People were wowed.
Event lost money and wasn't held again for another 6 years.
"But, after that -- (Laughter) after that it's been held annually,"
It really took off.
"And, strange things started to happen."
The content broadened.
"In addition to the T, E, and D, of TED, in came story tellers, adventurers, entrepreneurs, business leaders, just ordinary human beings with a surprising story to tell."
"Remarkably, instead of the audience going,"
"""oh, this is diluted."
"This is losing relevance to me."", they loved it."
Why?
Why?
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high They reach the sky
And like my dreams They fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
United!
United!
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.
(Laughter)
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.
"And you're on the outside, you're at home."
"You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water."
And -- (Laughter) -- you just play with your fingers all day.
And then you get invited.
"And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be."
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over.
And it's only taken five minutes.
And you want to go back and do it again.
But I really appreciate being here.
"And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible."
"So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism."
"And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about."
"You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z."
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
"But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us."
"Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?"
And our own opportunity to make something new there?
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
"I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation."
The main factor determining your success will be your marketing skills.
Will the Liftago service work from day one of the launch?
"Yes, indeed."
Our Liftago Team will take care of that.
What we expect from you - the marketers - is to help us spread our business across the globe.
No passenger can order a taxi without taxi drivers using our app.
"And likewise, no Liftago driver can receive an order without passengers."
That's why we share half of our taxi ride revenue with you.
"You are the only ones with enough power, resources, and motivation to share the apps with drivers and passengers."
What is the key to success?
"Support your community, talk to taxi drivers and passengers, and share your experience and knowledge."
Create a group of skilled taxi drivers who will join your community and attract many new Liftago passengers every day.
And now I'd like to ask Ondrej from our Liftago team to show you our app.
"Hello, let's have a look at what our apps will look like."
We've been developing two of them: the Liftago Taxi app for passengers and the Liftago Driver app for drivers.
Both of them are compatible with iPhone and Android devices.
All versions will be availabe in local languages upon launching.
Let's take a look at the ordering process from the passenger's point of view.
"Now imagine that I'm a potential passenger sitting in a café, finishing my coffee and waiting for the bill."
I'm launching the Liftago Taxi app and I immediately see there are 3 available taxis around.
I click on the taxi icon and the app gets me the best taxi according to my preset preferences.
"But since I know where I'm going, I'd rather insert my destination address."
I switch to the list of taxi drivers and I can see that there is one I have hired before and whom I was happy with.
I can see the fare and I take a look at the rough estimate for the total price of the ride.
"It's acceptable for me, so I place an order."
"Now I'm waiting for the driver to confirm the order, which he does quickly!"
I can see he's just around the corner.
Now I'm just waiting for him to tell me he's here.
"I can see him on the map, and in the meantime, I pay my bill."
He's arrived!
I'm leaving the restaurant and my taxi is waiting outside.
The driver greets me and has indicated I'm on board.
Factory farming is the biggest abuse of all.
Because in the United States alone there are 10 billion animals raised for food.
Its an extraordinary number and the average American eats 80 or 85 animals per year.
And we want to see that number reduced and we want to see the animals out of these terrible confinement systems.
And why do you think Al Gore didn't mention factory farming?
"You know I think that he probably thought that he was giving a lot of information already to people with An Inconvenient Truth, and maybe he thought that people would shut down if it affected them too personally."
"Because it gets very personal when you're talking about eating animals, and you're talking about something that is part of the American diet."
He thought all this is going too far.
But the public is slowly waking up.
I do not believe that we can have a good situation for animals or the environment if we continue to eat as much meat as we're eating.
"But even if you reduce your total consumption by half and instead of eating 80 animals eat 40, you cut in half the greenhouse gas emissions."
So we do think that our fork is a powerful tool.
"So, they're clear about this in the United States: the power lies with the consumer."
"As consumers, we can make a difference by changing our diets."
Matt Prescott says that meat is the number one cause of global warming.
And he gives a good example of this.
"If every American ate no chicken for just one day a week, then this would reduce just as much pollution as taking 500.000 cars off the road."
Chicken?
No thanks!
We'd rather have 500.000 cars!
It's funny.
"OK, I can hear you thinking:"
Meat and other animal products are bad for the environment.
I get it.
But don't we need meat and milk for our health?
"Where else do we get the calcium for our bones, the iron for our blood, and the vitamins and minerals we need to keep us healthy?"
"Advertisers and food producers have done so much to indoctrinate us, that you'd nearly end up believing it."
Go meat!
Sides of lamb are only 1.99 a kilo.
"The message is clear: milk is essential, meat is good for you, cheese is healthy for us all ..."
"But who benefits most from meat and dairy products, the consumer or the producer?"
Do we really need all that animal protein?
(Guitar music throughout)
Music is a language.
Both music and verbal languages serve the same purpose.
They are both forms of expression.
They can be used as a way to communicate with others.
They can be read and written.
"They can make you laugh or cry, think or question, and can speak to one or many."
And both can definitely make you move.
"In some instances, music works better than the spoken word, because it doesn't have to be understood to be effective."
"Although many musicians agree that music is a language, it is rarely treated as such."
"Many of us treat it as something that can only be learned by following a strict regimen, under the tutelage of a skilled teacher."
"This approach has been followed for hundreds of years with proven success, but it takes a long time."
Too long.
Think about the first language you learn as a child.
"More importantly, think about how you learned it."
"You were a baby when you first started speaking, and even though you spoke the language incorrectly you were allowed to make mistakes."
"And the more mistakes you made, the more your parents smiled."
Learning to speak was not something you were sent somewhere to do only a few times a week.
And the majority of the people you spoke to were not beginners.
They were already proficient speakers.
Imagine your parents forcing you to only speak to other babies until you were good enough to speak to them.
You would probably be an adult before you could carry on a proper conversation.
"To use a musical term, as a baby, you were allowed to jam with professionals."
"If we approach music in the same natural way we approached our first language, we will learn to speak it in the same short time it took to speak our first language."
Proof of this could be seen in almost any family where a child grows up with other musicians in the family.
Here are a few keys to follow in learning or teaching music.
"In the beginning, embrace mistakes, instead of correcting them."
"Like a child playing air guitar, there are no wrong notes."
Allow young musicians to play and perform with accomplished musicians on a daily basis.
Encourage young musicians to play more than they practice.
The more they play the more they will practice on their own.
"Music comes from the musician, not the instrument."
She has long proclaimed her innocence.
"On Thursday, FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford spoke at a press conference announcing Shakur's placement on the Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"He refers to Shakur as Joanne Chesimard, her original name:"
AARON FORD:
"Openly and freely in Cuba, she continues to maintain and promote her terrorist ideology."
She provides anti-U.S. government speeches espousing the Black Liberation Army message of revolution and terrorism.
"No person, no matter what his or her political or moral convictions are, is above the law."
"Joanne Chesimard is a domestic terrorist who murdered a law enforcement officer, execution-style."
AMY GOODMAN:
That's FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford.
"In a moment, we'll be joined by two guests: the scholar and activist Angela Davis, who faced her own murder trial decades ago, and Lennox Hinds, Assata Shakur's longtime attorney for some 40 years."
But first we turn to Assata Shakur in her own words.
"In 1998, Democracy Now! aired her reading an open letter to Pope John Paul II during his trip to Cuba."
She wrote the message after New Jersey state troopers sent the pope a letter asking him to call for her extradition.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
*My name is Assata Shakur and I was born and raised in the United States.*
*I am a descendant of Africans who were kidnapped and brought to the Americas as slaves. *
*I spent my early childhood in the racist segregated South. *
"*I later moved to the northern part of the country, *"
*where I realized that Black people were equally victimized by racism and oppression.*
"*I grew up and became a political activist, *"
"*participating in student struggles, the anti-war movement, *"
"*and, most of all, in the movement for the liberation of African Americans in the United States. *"
"*I later joined the Black Panther Party, an organization that was targeted by the COlNTELPRO program, *"
*a program that was set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBl) *
"*to eliminate all political opposition to the U.S. government's policies, *"
"*to destroy the Black Liberation Movement in the United States, *"
*to discredit activists and to eliminate potential leaders.*
"*Under the COlNTELPRO program, *"
"*many political activists were harassed, imprisoned, murdered or otherwise neutralized. *"
"*As a result of being targeted by COlNTELPRO, I like many other young people, *"
"*were faced with the threat of prison, underground, exile, or death. *"
It's beautiful from every standpoint if you're a health economist.
You keep healthcare cost down and you get revenue and wages up.
"Now, some."
"Nasty, bleeding heart liberals say, you're taxing people."
True but their wages are also going up so their take home pay guess what?
It's going up.
You don't collect taxes unless their wages are going up.
It's a beautiful thing to tax people more.
"It means that earning more, okay?"
"This is the law stand point, those of us who are being inclined to the economic way of thinking, this is a beautiful thing."
"So, you're right."
You take.
All three existing condition but there is still another problem which is age.
What do we know about age?
"You guys are healthy, I'm getting sick, right."
I'm getting older and the older you are the more likely you are to get sick.
Your body just runs down.
"Things begin to fall apart, you need replacement parts, right?"
"So, the [inaudible] was more likely to hit more people except there is protection, alright."
One protection is.
"In cases each year index with inflation, okay?"
"We have a higher threat of level for the entire individuals, 55 and older, high risk professions, [inaudible] objective, firefighter, excellent."
"Unions and high risks so, you know, this is democracy."
You cater to every special interest.
You decide this [inaudible] arrangements with all sorts of exceptions and [inaudible] because you want to keep the center.
Companies with higher health cost stood to age or gender or their work.
Get exceptions.
"So, we've tried to take into account many of these potential problems."
"And by the way, in the exchange, there's a limit to how much you can [inaudible] because of older people, three to one ratio."
"The, the funny raise a point here."
"Notice this, what's beautiful about that first doc?"
It's inflation adjusted but why is that such a beautiful [inaudible] health care economist like prices.
Royal Institute of British Architects
The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is a professional organisation for architects in the United Kingdom.
"It was originally named the Institute of British Architects in London and formed in 1834. The group was started by several important architects, including Philip Hardwick, Thomas Allom, William Donthorne, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, John Buonarotti Papworth and Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey. It was awarded a Royal Charter in 1837, becoming the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892."
"The RIBA is a member organisation, with 44,000 members. Chartered Members are allowed to call themselves chartered architects and to add the post-nominals RIBA after their name; Student Members are not permitted to do so. In the past, fellowships of the institute were given, but this has stopped; those who continue to hold this title instead add FRIBA."
"RIBA is based at 66 Portland Place, London—a 1930s Grade II* listed building designed by architect George Grey Wornum with sculptures by Edward Bainbridge Copnall and James Woodford. The Institute also maintains a dozen regional offices around the United Kingdom. Parts of the London building are open to the public, including the exhibition galleries and Library. It has a large architectural bookshop, a café, restaurant and lecture theatres. Rooms are hired out for events."
Institution of Structural Engineers
"The Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE) is an organisation for structural engineering based in the United Kingdom. It has 23,600 members in 105 countries. The Institution is a learned body and provider of professional accreditation for structural engineers. The Institution publishes a monthly journal, ""The Structural Engineer""."
Bahrain International Circuit
"The Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) is a motorsport track opened in 2004 and used for auto racing. The main race is the Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle East. In 2006, Australian V8 Supercar started racing at the BIC. 24 Hour endurance races also hosted at BIC."
History.
"Building the Bahrain circuit (track) was important for Bahrain, and was started by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation."
In the track became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished (important) FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award. The award was given for having and keeping high race safety and medical facilities.
Construction and design.
"The track was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke. Tilke also designed the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. The track cost approximately US $150 million to build. It can be set-up as six different tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip."
The track had a special problem. The track was located in the middle of a desert. There were concerns that sand would blow onto the track and disrupt the race. Organizers (the people who run the race) were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive (glue) on the sand around the track.
The surface of the track has a high level of grip. The same surface is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Series hosted.
"The Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of races, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the Australian V8 Supercar Championship Series, the GP2 Series, GP2 Asia, Chevrolet Lumina Series, Speedcar Series, Thunder Arabia and Radical."
"In the past the track has hosted the FIA GT Championship, and a one-time Bahrain Superprix involving Formula Three cars, following from the failure of the Korea Super Prix. The first Formula BMW World Final took place in Bahrain. Every year there is the 24 Hours of Bahrain race."
Bahrain Grand Prix.
"The first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on 4 April 2004, making history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East. Other countries, including Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates wanted to host the Formula One Grand Prix."
"The Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One schedule. In the 2006 season, Bahrain traded places with the usual first race, the Australian Grand Prix. The Australian Grand Prix date was changed to avoid interfering with the Commonwealth Games. In , Bahrain was moved to the fourth race on the schedule. In , Bahrain was the first race of the season. For 2010, the Formula One cars raced on the full ""Endurance Circuit""."
"Starting in 2011, Formula One will return to the original track layout. This is the layout that was used in 2004."
Phase 10
"Phase 10 is a card game for people to play, somewhat similar to Uno, or Skip-Bo."
Muharraq Governorate
The Muharraq Governorate is one of the five governorates of Bahrain. It is together with the municipality of Al Muharraq and with Muharraq Island and with outlying islets. It includes the former municipality of Al Hadd at the southern end of that island.

They currently play in the American Hockey League and are the farm team of the Columbus Blue Jackets of the NHL. They play their home games in Cleveland, Ohio at the Quicken Loans Arena."
Interquartile range
"In statistics, the interquartile range (IQR) is a number that indicates how spread out the data are, and tells us what the range is in the middle of a set of scores."
The interquartile range IQR is defined as:
"That is, it is calculated as the range of the middle half of the scores. The scores are divided into four equal parts, separated by the quartiles formula_2 and formula_3, after the scores have been arranged in ascending order (becoming bigger as one goes further). The second quartile formula_4 is also known as the median."
"The interquartile range is not sensitive to outliers (scores that are much higher or much lower than the other scores). In fact, it eliminates them."
Example.
Given the following 20 scores arranged from the smallest to the largest:
We can put them into four different groups of five numbers each:
The groups are thus separated by:
Hence the interquartile range is:
"If the observation 29 has accidentally been written down as 92 instead, then this number is an outlier. Notice that the interquartile range is not affected in that case."
Amami rabbit
"The Amami Rabbit (""Pentalagus furnessi""; Amami: ""ʔosagi"") also known as the Ryukyu Rabbit, is a primitive dark-furred rabbit which is only found in Amami Ōshima and Toku-no-Shima, two small islands in between southern Kyūshū and Okinawa in Kagoshima Prefecture in Japan. Often called a living fossil, the Amami Rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the two small islands where they survive today."

"The Abbotsford Heat were a Canadian professional ice hockey team that began playing in 2009. They played for 5 seasons in the American Hockey League and were the farm team of the Calgary Flames of the NHL. They played their home games in Abbotsford, British Columbia at the Abbotsford Entertainment &amp; Sports Centre."
"The team struggled with financial problems and had low attendance near the end. The city of Abbotsford terminated their contract with the Heat on April 15, 2014. On May 5, 2014, The AHL's Board of Governors said at their spring meeting in Chicago that they had approved the relocation of the team to Glens Falls, New York for the 2014-15 AHL season."
ECHL
"On the next day, Kongyamba announced to the people,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""It is evil for land if a poor man win the race. It might bring scarcity more than the people can bear. Let's say this among the people before the race begin.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"This words spread among the public. Khamba was stopped and told that his name was not in the list of the contestants. Khamba believed them. So, he sadly returned home. He told everything to Khamnu. The two siblings told Nongtholba about it. Nongtholba went to the king. The king told Khamba to participate if it was not still late to join."
"Khamba and Feiroijamba went to the starting place of the race. The race was about to be started. Khamba ran swiftly as fast as he could. Then, Kongyamba's men interrupted Khamba on his way. But Khamba stroke all of them aside. At last, he reached up Kongyamba. Kongyamba was running slowly as he got tired. Suddenly, fifteen horsemen of Kongyamba stopped Khamba. But Khamba kicked out all of them from his way."
"Finally, Khamba reached the final destination. He was the champion and Kongyamba was the second. Both saluted the King. The King was more pleased with Khamba."
The false oracle and the feral bull.
"Kongyamba was thinking about an evil plot against Khamba. But the Gods did not give him any evil hints in his dreams. So, he built a hut. Inside the hut, he tried to connect with a spirit. But he failed. One day, he met fisher women from the Khuman kingdom in the region of Moirang. Both the Khuman kingdom and the Moirang kingdom were in shores of the Loktak lake."
"The women came to Moirang besides having their own fishing area. So, Kongyamba asked them the reason for coming to Moirang."
"The women told him:&lt;poem&gt;""There is a great bull that lurks among the reeds of the shores of the lake, and it had claimed life of many. So, we dare not to fish there.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"Suddenly, an idea came to Kongyamba's mind. He went to the king. He acted as a person possessed by a divine spirit. Kongyamba told the King,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"The king called and asked Khamba about his promise. Khamba denied it. There resulted a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba. Later, Khamba told the king he would catch the bull if it was the God’s will."
"The king was pleased with Khamba. So, he promised him to give Princess Thoibi hand in marriage if he succeeded in the adventure. Minister Thonglen put seven marks on the lintel post of the capital city. It was the record of the King’s promise."
The king of Moirang sent an embassy to the king of Khuman. The embassy proposed the great sport to be organized. The Khuman king agreed. A grand Colosseum was built. The Colosseum could hold a capacity of the audiences from both the two kingdoms.
"Khamba captured the bull. He was bringing it to the two Kings' residing place. On the way back, Kongyamba came to him before anyone saw them. Kongyamba pretended to help Khamba to hold the bull. Kongyamba hold the rope. When everyone saw, Kongyamba claimed that he had captured the bull. He added that he even rescued Khamba who fell into the ditch. Once again, there was a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba over the claim. The two Kings could not find out who was right. So, Kongyamba was asked to fight the bull within an enclosure. But Kongyamba got frightened of the bull. So, he climbed up on the heights to save himself. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull."

Nongban Kongyamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the King. Khamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the Crown Prince (King’s younger brother). Chingkhu Akhuba, the Crown Prince asked his daughter Thoibi about his Coat Of Golden Embroidery. But Thoibi had already given the coat to Khamba. So, she told him a white lie."
"On the day of the competition, the target was set. The royal priests sang charms over the arrows and the bows of the contestants. The King shot his arrows. Kongyamba fetched the arrows and gave back to the king. For the Crown Prince, Khamba was to fetch the arrows. The Crown Prince shot his arrows so swiftly. Khamba ran swiftly to pick them up. At this, Khamba's outer cloth get loosened. The Crown Prince saw the inner cloth worn by Khamba. It was his golden embroidered coat. He got furious. When Khamba gave him the arrow, he did not take it. He turned away from Khamba. Kongyamba took the arrow from Khamba. He gave it to the Prince. The Prince was pleased with Kongyamba. He told Kongyamba that princess Thoibi would be given to him within five days. From this time onwards, Nongban Kongyamba gained favor from Thoibi's father, the Crown Prince."
Torture by Elephant: Collective evil planing of Nongban and Thoibi's father against Khamba.
"The Crown Prince and Nongban Kongyamba planned an evil plot to kill Khamba. They sent messengers to Khamba. The messengers told Khamba that he was called by the Crown Prince. On his way, Khamba was interrupted by Kongyamba and his men. Kongyamba asked Khamba to give up Thoibi. Khamba replied that he will not give up."
"As a result, they fought. Khamba threw Kongyamba's men upon the ground. Khamba knelt upon Kongyamba's belly. He pressed Kongyamba's throat. He was about to kill Kongyamba. But Kongyamba's men dragged Khamba off. They beat Khamba. His clothes were torn. They bound him so that he could not move. The Prince also came up on his elephant. He told the men to beat him. They fastened him to the elephant's leg with ropes. However, the elephant driver knew that Khamba was innocent. So, he bound him leaving him some spaces to breathe."
"Then they stimulated the elephant to harm Khamba. But God Thangjing let it not to move. Finally, Kongyamba hit the elephant with a spear to move in pain. But it did not harm Khamba."
"In that night, Goddess Panthoibi told Thoibi in her dream that her beloved man was bound by her father’s orders to the elephant and was nearly killed. Thoibi arose and took a sword. She immediately came to the spot for Khamba. The criminals feld from the spot. She saved Khamba from the criminals as well as the elephant."
"The news was informed to Khamnu, Feiroijamba, Nongtholba and Thonglen. Nongtholba, Feiroijamba and Thonglen went to the Royal Court with all their armies. Feiroijamba said to the Court three times about the harsh cruelty to Khamba. However, the Prince did not pay attention to the complaint."
"Nongtholba and Prince Chingkhu Akhuba had a conflict on the matter. The conflict could not be resolved without the King. Finally, both went to the King for the judgement."
"Before their arrival, Princess Thoibi had already informed the king all the crimes committed by her own father."
"The King proclaimed that all the criminals would be punished. So, Nongban Kongyamba, Prince Chingkhu Akhuba (Thoibi's father) and other men were sent in the prison. The King told the Prince to stay there untill Khamba was well again."
"The King sent his own men to take care of injured Khamba. He sent him gifts every day. Thoibi personally took care of Khamba. He got well again. So, Nongban Kongyamba and the Prince were set free."
Plot to kidnap Princess Thoibi.
"The Prince asked his daughter Thoibi to marry Kongyamba. But she rejected. So, in anger, he exiled her to Kabaw chiefdom. He did not want to see her anymore."
"During her exile, Thoibi always missed her beloved Khamba as well as her hometown. God Thangjing softened her father's heart. He sent men to bring her back. However, he asked Kongyamba to forcibly elope Thoibi from her return journey."
"Kongyamba and his men were waiting for Princess Thobi's return. When they saw the princess returning, his men shouted,"

Discourses on Livy
"The Discourses on Livy, also Discourses or Discorsi, was written around 1517 and published in 1531 by Niccolò Machiavelli."
It is a discussion about the history of early Ancient Rome. Although it strays very far from this and also uses modern political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured.
"While it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also has many similar themes from his other works. For example, Machiavelli said that to save a republic from corruption, it is needed to return it to a ""kingly state"" using violent means. He excuses Romulus for killing his brother Remus and co-ruler Titus Tatius to gain absolute power for himself in that he made a ""civil way of life"". Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, as Machiavelli often refers to leaders of republics as ""princes"". Machiavelli even sometimes acts as an advisor to tyrants. Other scholars have pointed out the power-hungry and imperialistic features of Machiavelli's republic. Nevertheless, it became one of the central texts of modern republicanism."
Product rule
"In differential calculus, the product rule is a rule that helps calculate derivates that have multiplication."
formula_1
formula_2.
Steps.
Say we have the function formula_3.
The two functions being multiplied are formula_4 and formula_5.
We can set
formula_6 and
formula_7.
The rule needs us to find the derivative of both formula_8 and formula_9.
"We can find formula_10 by first using the sum rule to split formula_8 into formula_12 and formula_13. After using the power rule, we have formula_14."
"To find formula_15, we need to find the derivative of formula_5, which is formula_17, meaning formula_18."
"Now we can substitute the values into the equation,"
formula_19.
Proof.
One definition of a derivative is
"formula_20, and we're trying to find the derivative of formula_21, so we can first set formula_22 to formula_21."
formula_24
We can't really do much with this so we need to manipulate the equation.
formula_25
"The formula_26 part is equal to formula_27, meaning it didn't change the value of the equation. Now we can factor,"
"formula_28, and because formula_29 approaches formula_27, formula_31 is equal to formula_32."
"formula_33, and formula_34 and formula_35 are just equal to formula_15and formula_37."

Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt, in total disregard for his personal safety, and accompanied by only four or five men, led a desperate and gallant charge up San Juan Hill, encouraging his troops to continue the assault through withering enemy fire over open countryside. Facing the enemy's heavy fire, he displayed extraordinary bravery throughout the charge, and was the first to reach the enemy trenches, where he quickly killed one of the enemy with his pistol, allowing his men to continue the assault. His leadership and valor turned the tide in the Battle for San Juan Hill.

Chinese Civil War
"The Chinese Civil War (Chinese ; 中国内战) (Russian ; Гражданская Война в Китае) was a civil war fought from 1927 to 1949 because of differences in thinking between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party). The war was a fight for legitimacy of the government of China. The war began in April 1927 because of the Northern Expedition (國民革命軍北伐) and mostly ended in 1950. Some people say the war has not ended, but no large battles have started since that year. Relations between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are still poor because both claim to be the legitimate sovereign government of all of China. The Chinese Civil War was the third-largest war of all time, after World War 1 and World War 2. It was part of the Interwar period in the aftermath of the Great War from 1918 to 1939 and was also part of the Cold War in the aftermath of World War 2 from 1945 to 1949 . The war is usually divided into two parts: 1927-1937 and 1946-1949 . It started and stopped several times before the Second Sino-Japanese War and there was less fighting after the Empire of Japan had invaded. The war between the CCP and the KMT started again in 1946 after Japan's defeat in World War II. The CCP took control of most of China, and the KMT had only islands left. About two million Chinese fled to Taiwan in late 1949. In 1950, no large battles were started. The loss of the KMT in Mainland China is said to be for several reasons:"
"No agreement was made between the two governments and so some say that the war has not ended. Both governments have many military weapons to be used against only against each other, both still say they are the legitimate government of China, and both seek diplomatic relations with other countries as the only legitimate government."
Background and Prelude 1894-1911.
"In 1894 Japan invaded the Qing Dynasty in Manchuria and Taiwan and as well as Korea . In 1899-1901 the Boxer Rebellion happened and Japan invaded China again but allied with Russia, Germany, Austria, France, Britain and America to support Yuan Shikai to stop Empress Dowager Cixi. This led to the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the country was thrown into turmoil. In the ensuing power vacuum, a large number of warlords seized control of different parts of the country. To defeat them and unify the country, Sun Yat-sen and his KMT sought help from foreign governments."
"He made pleas to several Western democratic nations, but none offered help cats. It was only after he turned to the Soviets in 1921 that Sun found aid. The communist Soviet Union agreed to help the KMT if the smaller Chinese Communist Party be allowed to join. In 1923 the Soviet Union, the KMT, and the CCP made an agreement, the Sun-Joffe Manifesto, which said the Soviets would help China have only one government. Mikhail Borodin traveled to China in 1923 to help change the KMT to make it similar to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CCP and KMT were joined in the First United Front."
"In 1923, Chiang Kai-shek travelled to the Soviet Union to study military and politics with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1924, he became the leader of the Whampoa Military Academy in China. Most of the help from the Soviet Union was for that school, which taught Soviet political and military ideas to the KMT and the CCP. The Soviets gave books and guns to use for teaching about war and military things. With Soviet help Sun made an ""army of the party"". Members of the CCP were also in the school and some were teachers. Zhou Enlai was a teacher in the school."
"The KMT then agreed to let some communists join the KMT, when the CCP was small compared to the KMT. The CCP had 300 members in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925. The KMT in 1923, however, had 50,000 members."
The First Chinese Civil War 1927-1936 and the Second Civil War 1945-1949.
In 1927 the civil war in the Republic of China began when the Kuomintang (KMT) became rivals with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and both parties led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong were fighting against each other. The Chinese Nationalists got support from the Weimar German Republic and Nazi Germany by buying German Weapons from Europe until the Nazi’s started to support the Japanese Empire in 1937 when the Second Sino-Japanese War began which is the start of World War 2 in Asia .

The team was officially inscribed in the Somalia first league championship in 1952 as ""Lavori Publici FC/Genio"", winning the tournament of that year."

He is reportedly the United Kingdom's richest living artist. In 2010 the ""Sunday Times"" estimated his wealth at £215 million. During the 1990s he worked together with famous art collector Charles Saatchi. Hirst and Saatchi had disagreements, and they ended their friendship in 2003."
"Death is a central theme in Hirst's works. He became famous for a series of artworks in which dead animals are preserved in formaldehyde. The animals included a sheep, a cow and a shark. The best-known of these was ""The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living"". This was a tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde in a transparent display case. He has also made ""spin paintings"". These were created on a rotating canvas. And ""spot paintings"", which are rows of randomly coloured circles created by his assistants."
"In September 2008, Hirst sold all the artworks of a show during one auction at Sotheby's. This had never been done before by a living artist. The auction made him £111 million ($198 million), breaking the record for an auction by a single artist. It also broke Hirst's own record with £10.3 million for ""The Golden Calf"", an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde."
"Since 1999 some of Hirst's works have been claimed to be plagiarised. It was discovered that his sculpture ""Hymn"" was closely based on a child's toy. Hirst was sued by the original creator of the toy, and the case was settled out-of-court."

1944 United States presidential election
"The 1944 United States presidential election happened on November 7, 1944. Incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) won over Republican Thomas E. Dewey in the general election. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt won 432 votes while Dewey won 99. Roosevelt, a Democrat, won an unprecedented fourth term as president."
"The election was held during the latter part of World War II. By this time the war was going well for the United States and its Allies. Roosevelt had already served longer than any other president, but remained popular. Unlike in 1940, there was little doubt that he would run for another term as the Democratic candidate, as his health was failing. Dewey, the Governor of New York, campaigned against the New Deal and for a smaller government. But he could not convince the country to change course. Roosevelt's aides covered up the fact the president was in poor health. Roosevelt would die in office three months after starting his fourth term. His Vice President, Harry S. Truman, would serve out the remainder of his term of office."
The campaign.
"The Republicans campaigned against the New Deal. They wanted a smaller government and less-regulated economy. Roosevelt's continuing popularity was the main theme of his campaign. To quiet rumors of his poor health, Roosevelt insisted on making a vigorous campaign trip in October and rode in an open car through city streets. A high point of the campaign occurred when Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio where he ridiculed Republican claims that his administration was corrupt and wasteful with tax money. He particularly ridiculed a Republican claim that he had sent a US Navy warship to pick up his Scottish Terrier Fala in Alaska. He added that ""Fala was furious"" at such rumors. The speech was met with loud laughter and applause. In response, Dewey gave a blistering partisan speech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, a few days later on national radio. He accused Roosevelt of being ""indispensable"" to corrupt big-city Democratic organizations and American Communists. Dewey also referred to members of Roosevelt's cabinet as a ""motley crew"". However, the allies had several battlefield successes in Europe and the Pacific during the campaign. These included the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the successful Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in October 1944. These were Roosevelt's greatest assets in his campaign."
Results.
The 1944 presidential election was a milestone in American politics for two reasons. It was the first time a candidate for president was born in the 20th century. It was the last time Democrats carried every state in the southern United States. The election had at least one other long-reaching effect. It led to the 1951 passing of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president of the United States.

Reuben
Reuben was the son of Jacob and Leah in the Book of Genesis.
Birth.
"Jacob was in love with Rachel, the daughter of Laban and asked to marry her. Laban said he would let Jacob marry her if he worked for him as a shepherd for seven years. Jacob worked for those years but they felt like they were only seven days because of how much he loved Rachel. But then, Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Rachel’s older sister Leah instead of marrying her and said he didn’t believe in the younger daughter marrying before her older sister married so Jacob had to work for Laban for another seven years so that Laban would let him marry Rachel. Jacob loved Rachel but he did not love Leah so Leah prayed to the Lord saying “give me children, for I am despised”. So the Lord had mercy on her and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. And Leah said “now my husband shall love me” and named her son Reuben."
Mandrakes.
"After Leah gave birth to Simeon, Levi and Judah (Biblical personage), Bilhah gave birth to Gad and Asher, Zilpah gave birth to Dan and Naphtali and Leah gave birth to Zebulun and Issachar, then Reuben found mandrakes and gave them to his mother Leah. When Rachel asked Leah for the mandrakes,Leah said “first you take from me my husband and now the mandrakes of my son” and agreed to give Rachel the mandrakes if Leah became Jacob’s main wife."
Bilhah.
It’s written in the Torah that Reuben lay down with Bilhah and that his father Jacob heard about it. (Genesis 35:22) Though the Talmud says that this was a metaphor and that Reuben actually took Bilhah’s bed from his father’s tent but that this was seen as being like the sin of incest (Shabbat 55) and says that this works because in the Book of Job wanting to commit incest is seen as committing incest.
The story of Joseph.
"In the story of Joseph, when the brothers are about to kill Joseph, Reuben tells them that instead of murdering him they should throw him into a big hole in the ground and leave him to die. But Reuben secretly planned to rescue Joseph and so when Reuben came back to save Joseph and found out that he had already been sold into slavery, Reuben tore his clothes in mourning for Joseph. And after Simeon was jailed, Reuben told his brothers that the Lord was punishing them all for what they did to Joseph."
Inheritance.
"According to Jewish tradition, Reuben didn’t get the inheritance that a firstborn son would usually get because he was being punished for the sin with Bilhah."
Talmud.
"Rabbi Shimon son of Eliezer teaches that after Leah died and Jacob moved his bed to the tent of Bilhah, Reuben took the bed from Bilhah’s tent and put in the tent of his mother Leah to honour his mother’s memory and the sin Reuben committed by doing that was compared to incest but Reuben did not actually have sex with Bilhah. Though there are also Rabbis in the Talmud who say that he did."
The Zohar.
"According to the Zohar, Reuben lying down with Bilhah cannot be wikt:literally true because then Reuben wouldn’t have become the father of a tribe of the Israelites. It says that Reuben knew from prophecy that there were supposed to be only twelve tribes of Israel so he moved his father’s bed from Bilhah’s tent even though the Shechina is there whenever married people do their religious duty to have sex with each other but by meddling Reuben made the Shechina leave that tent and that was Reuben’s sin."
Affenpinscher
"The Affenpinscher is a small breed of dog in the toy group. These dogs originally came from Germany. They are known to have existed since the 1600s. Their name comes from the German word ""Affe,"" which means ""monkey,"" because their faces remind people of monkeys. Originally, the dog was bred to be a ""ratter,"" a type of dog that kills rats and mice in homes, farms, and stables. Now that mice are not so commonly found in the home, Affenpinschers are usually just kept as pets."
Appearance.
"The Affenpinscher is a very small kind of dog. It weighs between . Its height is between at the shoulder. Their face is flat and ""monkey-like."" The most common and preferred colour of fur for this breed is black, but they can also come in grey, beige, and other colours. In the American Kennel Club, a good example of these dogs could be any colour. In the French and British Kennel Clubs they must only be black."
"Oda's main event was triple jump, but he also competed in long jump and high jump."
"He participated in all three events in the 1924 Summer Olympics, the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics."
"In 1928 games in Amsterdam, he won the gold medal in the triple jump event."
"Oda later also set the world record in the sport, when he jumped for 15.58 m while studying in Waseda University during 1931."
He became a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee.
"During the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the Olympic flag was raised to a height of exactly 15.21 meters, to pay respect to Oda's achievement 36 years earlier."

Freddy West Tjakamarra
"Freddy West Tjakamarra (previously Tjukurti Tjakamarra; born around 1932 – died 1994) was an Australian Aboriginal artist. He was a leader of the Pintupi people during their return to traditional lands in the 1980s. He was one of the founders of the Kiwirrkurra settlement in 1983. As a painter, West was part of the Western Desert movement, and was one of the very first painters of the Papunya Tula school."
Early life.
"Freddy West was born in the Great Sandy Desert sometime in the early 1930s. He was born in the Pollock Hills, north of where Kiwirrkura is today, and lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the first half of his life. He and his family were mostly based along the western shore of Lake Mackay. They often travelled with another group, led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. These families became some of the last nomadic groups left in the desert – most other families having been settled in government stations since the 1950s. In 1962, West decided that he would go and join his relatives, who were living at Papunya. This is traditionally Luritja land, but the Pintupi had become displaced here because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. He met some officers of the Territory's welfare department in the area of Dovers Hills, and arranged for them to take him and his family to Papunya in a year's time. In August 1963, West and his family began to walk to Papunya and met the welfare officers on the way. West had two wives: Parara and Payu, who were sisters of the Napaltjarri skin grouping."
"At Papunya, West started to paint with Geoffrey Bardon. He became one of the first members of the Papunya Tula school, and a shareholder in the company. In the late 1970s, West campaigned strongly within the Pintupi community for them to leave Papunya and return to their traditional country in the west. He moved back west with other Pintupi in 1981 and set up the community of Kintore. He was later an important person in the establishment of Kiwirrkurra, in 1983. He lived there for most of the rest of his life. He married a third wife in October 1984, Takariya Napaltjarri. She was the daughter of Waku Tjungurrayi, and had only come out of the desert a few days before they were married. They soon separated, and Takariya remarried. With his two other wives, West had 15 children. He died in 1994."
Painting.
"West did not paint much compared with many other early Papunya artists. His early works depicted abstract scenes of men's ceremonies, and were very decorated. His later works depicted stories from the Pintupi dreamtime (""Tingari""), using a motif of circles and lines. He has works in the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, and the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide."
Pinta Pinta Tjapanangka
"Pinta Pinta Tjapanangka (late 1920s – 1999) was an Australian Aboriginal artist. He was one of the very first members of the Papunya Tula art movement. He is a well-known painter of Western Desert art. He belonged to the Pintupi community, and painted stories from the Pintupi Dreaming (""Tingari""). He painted mythological events that happened around his homeland, including around Winparrku, Lake MacDonald and Lake Mackay."
"Pinta Pinta was from Western Australia. He was born at Yumari, a place in the Great Sandy Desert. He was probably born sometime in the late 1920s (around 1927 or 1928). Before contact with White society, he lived a nomadic way of life in the desert. In the 1950s, he walked with his family to stay at Haasts Bluff, a government rations outpost. This was his first contact with modern Australian civilisation. His was one of the last groups in the country to come out of the desert."
"Pinta Pinta began painting in the mid-1970s, at Papunya. He moved to Kintore after it was founded in 1981. In 1984, Pinta Pinta and his family set up an outstation at Winparrku (Mount Webb), between Kintore and Kiwirrkurra. The family moved here shortly after. In 1988, he had a small part in the move ""Evil Angels""."
"His paintings mostly stick to black, white and ochre in colour. The most obvious motif seen in them is the circles and lines, which depict dreaming tracks. Some of his works are in the Australian Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory."
"He had two sons, Matthew (born early 1960s) and Nyilyari (born about 1965). Nyilyari also became a famous artist."

Béarnaise sauce
"Béarnaise sauce () is a sauce made of clarified butter, egg yolks, and herbs. It is considered to be a 'child' of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine. The difference is only in their flavouring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorn, and tarragon, while Hollandaise uses lemon juice."
"In appearance it is light yellow and opaque, smooth and creamy."
Béarnaise is a traditional sauce for steak.
History.
"Although a similar recipe was published in 1818, Béarnaise sauce was likely first created by the chef Collinet, the inventor of puffed potatoes (), and served at the 1836 opening of ""Le Pavillon Henri IV"", a restaurant at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, not far from Paris. Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France, a gourmet himself, who was born in the former province of Béarn."
Preparation.
"A Béarnaise sauce is simply clarified butter, an egg yolk, a shallot, a little tarragon vinegar. It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect."
"Like Hollandaise sauce, there are several methods for the preparation of Béarnaise sauce. Please refer to the Preparation section of that article for basics. Here we highlight the differences."
"The most common preparation is a ""Bain-marie"" method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. Others are similar. Alternatively, the flavourings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (""sans"" lemon juice)."
"The station was opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton. It was changed by the successor company, the Great Eastern Railway, to include services to Ilford by way of the Fairlop Loop that was opened in 1903. After 1923 the station came under the control of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway until it was given to the London Passenger Transport Board (LT) on 14 December 1947 as part of the extension of the Central Line services of the London Underground. The station was a terminus for the Central Line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle towards Epping, until electric services began as far as Loughton (and around the 'loop' to Hainault) on 21 November 1948."

Joan Waste
Joan Waste (1534 - 1 August 1556) was a blind woman who was burned in Derby because she would not stop being a Protestant. She had bought a Bible so that friends could read to her.
Biography.
"Waste was blind when she was born in 1534. Her parents were William and Joan Waste. William's job was to cut people's hair and make rope. By the age of twelve, Joan had learned to make ropes and clothes."
"In 1553, Queen Mary came to the throne and it was made illegal to hold Protestant views. Mary condemned 277 people for not having the right sort of religion. This crime was called heresy."
"Joan Waste was taken to court for breaking the law. The judge was a man employed by the bishop. She had to defend her views and was told she would die. She had not liked the fact that the church services were being read in the language of Latin. She was to die for being a Protestant and for refusing to agree with the Catholic Church. She bought a Bible in English, but the Catholic Church wanted them to only be in Latin. She asked friends to read to her for a penny."
"Her trial took place at All Saints Church. This main building has been rebuilt, but the tower was built in 1530. This tower is now part of Derby's cathedral."
On the day of her death she walked arm-in-arm with her twin brother to be burned.
Her death took place at the Windmill Pit on the Burton Road in Derby. She was hanged over the fire with a rope. She fell into the fire when the rope burned through. The judge was Antony Draycot. He went home to his meal.
The place where Joan Waste was killed is now the site of a church. When Elizabeth I of England became queen in 1559 she removed Ralph Baines from the job of Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Baines was sent to be a prisoner of the Bishop of London. The judge was also sent to be a prisoner. He died after being released in 1571.

Induction heating
"Induction heating is a form of heating an electrically conductive material through the use of Eddy current. Eddy currents use a changing magnetic field. That way, heat can be transferred over short distances without the objects actually touching."
Lineal championship
"In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called ""the man who beat the man""."
"Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted."
ASMR
"Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR, sometimes auto sensory meridian response) is a tingling sensation. It often starts on the scalp, and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. It is an unusual feeling which has no obvious physical cause. (paresthesia) It has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia."
"People who experience ASMR have a ""low-grade euphoria"". which means they like it. It has ""a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin"". ASMR is often set off by some auditory or visual stimuli. There are videos which try to stimulate ASMR: over 13 million are on YouTube."

MAC address
"Computers that use a computer network or internet network need to be identified. For this reason, many network connection types, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi, use unique addresses to identify the network card, a part of a computer, to access the network. These addresses are usually called the Media Access Control address or MAC address."
"Each computer is given a MAC address by its computer maker. The way for giving MAC addresses to computers, created by Xerox, is used. MAC addresses have 48-bits (how many 1s or 0s it has in it). As each of the twelve entries can have 16 possible values (0 through 9 and A through F), there are 1612 or 248 (or 281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. MAC addresses identify many things, such as the type of device being used."
A MAC address is used by the network to send and receive data (computer information) to the right place almost like mail being sent and received from a home mail address. The MAC address is like door number or street number.

Anna Freud
Anna Freud (3 December 1895 – 9 October 1982) was the sixth and last child of Sigmund Freud and his wife Martha Bernays Freud.
She was born in Vienna. She followed the path of her father and contributed to the field of psychoanalysis.
"With Melanie Klein, she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology. As her father put it, child analysis had received a powerful impetus through ""the work of Frau Melanie Klein and of my daughter, Anna Freud"". Her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially."
Key moments in life.
"After a somewhat troubled childhood, Anna was psychoanalysed by her father. When her analysis was completed in 1922, she became a psychoanalyist herself. She taught at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Training Institute on the technique of child analysis. From 1925 until 1934, she was the Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association. She continued child analysis and seminars and conferences on the subject."
"After the Anschluss in 1938 the Freuds fled Vienna and came to London. Freud himself was dying of cancer, so Anna ran the household. Anna had a professional disagreement with Melanie Klein, who had come to London much earlier, and was already established as a child psychologist. A series of 'controversial discussions' were held by the British Psychoanalytical Society. The discussions were about the training and the ideas of both parties. Eventually agreement was reached that both 'schools' should co-exist inside the Society. The Society now has three training divisions: Kleinian, Freudian and Independent."
"During the war, Freud studied the effect of deprivation of parental care on children. She set up a centre for young war victims, called ""The Hampstead War Nursery"". Here the children got foster care, with mothers"
encouraged to visit as often as possible.
"In 1947, Freud and Kate Friedlaender established the Hampstead Child Therapy Courses. Five years later, a children's clinic was added. Freud started lecturing on child psychology."
"From the 1950s until the end of her life Freud travelled regularly to the United States to lecture, teach and visit friends. During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children. At Yale Law School, she taught seminars on crime and the family."
Freud died in London on 9 October 1982. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes placed in a marble shelf next to her parents' ancient Greek funeral urn. Her lifelong friend Dorothy Burlingham and several other members of the Freud family also rest there.
Personal life.
"Anna Freud lived with her close friend Dorothy Burlingham, daughter of Louis Comfort Tiffany, for years."

"Freud, Anna (1966–1980). ""The writings of Anna Freud"": 8 Volumes. New York: Indiana University of Pennsylvania"
"Experts say ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" was an example of the way Copland changed the kind of music he wrote during the 1940s. He began writing music that was more easily understood and more popular. Copland wrote about this in 1941 in his book, ""Our New Music""."
He wrote that the radio and record player was helping people who had never listened to music before to enjoy music. He said that there was no reason to continue writing music as if these things had not been invented. So he decided to write music in a simpler way.
His interest and activities beyond music.
"Copland spread his ideas about music in other ways. He taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City and at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One of the many awards he received was the Pulitzer Prize. He won it in 1945 for his famous music for a ballet called ""Appalachian Spring."" It is one of his most popular works. The last part of the ballet is based on a traditional song, ""A Gift to be Simple""."
"Copland also wrote music for several major movies. He won an Academy Award in 1950 for composing the music for the movie ""The Heiress"". Then he began experimenting with what is called the twelve-tone system. His music was no longer as easy to understand, nor as popular."
"Copland stopped composing at the end of the 1960s. Yet he continued to be active as a conductor and speaker. In 1982, Queens College of the City University of New York established the Aaron Copland School of Music."
"Copland was a strong supporter of liberal ideas. In the early 1950s, he and other famous writers, actors and intellectuals were accused of supporting communism. Public opinion changed, though. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is America's highest award to civilians. Aaron Copland died in 1990 at the age of 90. But his music lives on."

464 BC is a year in the pre-Julian Roman calendar. It was at the time known as year 290.
Diphthong
"A diphthong (pronounced ""DIF-thong"" or ""DIP-thong"") is a vowel where the speaker has to move their mouth into two different positions to make. It is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard. Examples are:"
"waist, die, noise, road, house, fierce, bear, sure. Each of these is a different vowel sound."
"A monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make, like the ""oo"" sound in ""book."" In a diphthong, the person combines two different monophthongs, as with the ""oi"" sound in the word ""oil"". The speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an ""o"" sound, then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard ""e"" sound. Another example is the ""ou"" sound in the word ""house"". The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft ""a"" sound in ""flat"", then moves to make the a hard ""oo"" sound like the one in ""caboose""."
"Just like with every other part of language, the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents."
"The word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language. Here, ""di"" means ""two"" or ""double"", while the part ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""speak"", ""creating sound by the voice""."
"A diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable, but rarely."
The Price is Right
"The Price is Right is a USA game show on CBS. The current version started in 1972, and was hosted by Bob Barker for a long time. However, in 2006, Bob Barker announced that he would leave the show. His last episode aired in June 2007. Comedian Drew Carey is now the host; his first episode aired in October 2007."
"In this game, a person uses his shopping skills to correctly guess the price of different products, like in a market. Some products are simple household items, like toothpaste and vitamins. Other items are more expensive products, like furniture and cars. After the third and sixth games, the ""Showcase Showdown"" is played. The three players who got on stage in both halves of the show spin a wheel. They get two spins of the wheel. They have to be closest to $1.00 without going over. The person with the highest total moves on to the Showcase at the end of the show. If a player gets $1.00, they win $1,000 and get another spin. If they hit the $1.00 space on that spin, they win another $25,000. If they hit the 5¢ or 15¢ space, they win another $10,000. In the Showcase, the winners of the two Showcase Showdown games are shown prize packages. They make a bid on them, and whoever comes closest to the price of their showcase without going over wins it. If they are $250 or less from the price of their showcase, they win both showcases. If someone's bid was higher than the price of the real price, that person went over, and was disqualified from winning in that round."
"From 1956 - 1963, the show aired on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen. From 1963 - 1965, the show aired on ABC and was also hosted by Bill Cullen."
"Three nighttime syndicated versions of the show aired. The first one aired from 1972 to 1980. Until 1977, it was hosted by Dennis James. For the rest of its run, it was hosted by Bob Barker. From 1985 - 1986, another nighttime version of the show, named ""The Nighttime Price Is Right"", was made and was hosted by Tom Kennedy. A third nighttime version, ""The New Price Is Right"", was made from 1994 - 1995 and was hosted by Doug Davidson. Also special million dollar prime-time episodes where people could play different versions of games for $1,000,000 were made due to CBS shows being canceled."
Monophthong
"A monophthong (pronounced ""Mono-F-thong"") is simply a vowel. The word monophthong comes from the old Greek language. ""Mono"" means ""one"" or ""single"", and the ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""to speak"", ""create sound with the voice"". The word monophthong shows that a vowel is spoken with exactly one tone and one mouth position. For example, when you say ""teeth"", then while you are creating the sound of the ""ee"", nothing changes for that sound."
A monophthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it can as well be a syllable. There is no shorter syllable than a single monophthong.
Kalua
"Kalua is a Hawaiian cooking method. The word ""kalua"" means ""to cook in an underground oven"" in Hawaiian. The oven is a hole in the ground called an imu. Kalua is most often used to cook pig. Kalua pig is a popular food at luaus."
Coast
The coast is where land meets the sea.
"The coast also means the land next to the sea, which can also be called the shore, or sea-shore. However, coast is not used to describe where rivers or lakes meet the land - it is only used to describe the sea meeting the land."
"If a house is near to the coast we say it is ""on the coast"". When we talk about a long part of the coast we call it ""the coast-line""."
"Sometimes, 'coast' can be part of a place name or the description of a large area. For instance, the East Coast of the United States describes the all of the Eastern side of the United States that is next to the Atlantic Ocean."
In some countries like England or Australia the people sometimes use the word sea-side for the coast.
Coasts often have many living things living there and provide habitat for many animals and plants.
An example of a coast in Great Britain is the Holderness Coast near Bridlington. This is one of Europe's fast eroding coasts.
George Harrison
"George Harold Harrison, MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. After the group broke up in 1970, he had a solo career. He made many albums and worked with other musicians including Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Ravi Shankar. He was also interested in Eastern mysticism and charitable causes."
Early life.
"Harrison was born in 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, He was youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison and Louise Harrison, He had one sister and two brothers."
Solo music.
"George's best-known album was ""All Things Must Pass,"" which he made just after the Beatles broke up. Harrison owned a mansion in England called Friar Park, where he lived from 1970 until he died. He built his own recording studio inside the mansion, which for a time was better than Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles had made their records. Having a private studio meant Harrison could work on songs and recordings anytime he wanted."
"Ravi Shankar came to Harrison during 1971 with news about a war in Bangladesh, where thousands of people had died and millions more were refugees and starving. Shankar asked for Harrison's help to give a benefit show to buy food for them. Harrison called on many of his musician friends, who put together a charity concert with famous people to help the refugees. The ""Concert for Bangla Desh"", a live recording, became a best-selling album, raised money for the refugees, and brought worldwide attention to the problems in their country. It also inspired later benefits, including Live Aid in the 1980s."
"Harrison found a new musical partner in the 1980s, when Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra began to write and record songs with him. The two men worked well together and became close friends. Harrison and Lynne formed another band, the Traveling Wilburys, with fellow musicians Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. The Traveling Wilburys recorded two albums, which became hits."
Personal life.
"In 1966, Harrison married a model, Pattie Boyd, but they were divorced in 1971, and had no children. Boyd left Harrison to be with his friend, guitarist Eric Clapton, but all three remained friends. Harrison married again in 1978, to American-born Olivia Trinidad Arias, who had worked for his record company. Arias became the mother of Harrison's son Dhani, whose name is comprised of the names of two notes in the Indian music scale. Dhani grew up to be a musician like his father, fronting the band thenewno2. He went to Brown University in the United States."
"In the late 1970s Harrison formed a movie production company, Handmade Films, which produced movies including Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" and Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits""."
"The grounds of Harrison's home, Friar Park, had been more or less open to the public, until the murder of his former bandmate John Lennon late in 1980. Harrison was very hurt and shocked by Lennon's death, and was afraid someone might try to harm him or his family. Afterwards, the gates were locked, and no-entry notices were posted. In December, 1999, an intruder broke into his home, stabbing him with a knife. Harrison and his wife Olivia stopped the intruder and called the police. Harrison recovered. The man who attacked him is schizophrenic and was acquitted of attempted murder by reason of insanity in November 2000 at Oxford Crown Court. He was sent to a mental hospital and released in 2002."
Death.
"In the 1990s, decades of smoking cigarettes caused Harrison to develop throat cancer. He later developed lung cancer, which caused his death in 2001. His family issued a last statement from him: ""Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another."" Even music was not as important to Harrison as his wanting people to learn to get along with each other, and to make the world a better place."
"A year after Harrison's death, Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison, the two remaining Beatles (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr), and other musicians held the ""Concert for George"", which remembered Harrison's music, his life, and his gifts to humanity. All the profits from the concert were given to charity."

Book of Esther
"Esther is the name of a book in the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) and the Old Testament, and also its title heroine. It is the basis for the Jewish celebration Purim."
Author and Date.
"Although it is never said who wrote the book of Esther, from inside evidence it is possible to make some guesses about the author and when it was written. The author was a Jew, because he emphasizes where the Jewish festival came from and from the Jewish nationalism inside the story. The author probably lived in a Persian city, because he knew Persian customs well, and does not say anything about the land of Judah or Jerusalem. The earliest date of the book would be a little while after the events were told, for instance, about 460 B.C. (before Ezra's return to Jerusalem). It is also thought that the festival of Purim had been celebrated some time before this book was written."
"Purpose, Themes, and Features."
Purpose.
The author's main purpose was to write about how the yearly festival of Purim started and to make people remember the saving of the Jewish people during King Ahaseurus' reign. The book shows both the start of the festival and why it should continue to be celebrated.
Themes.
"In the book, the author repeatedly talks about the conflict between Israel and the Amalekites, a conflict that began during the exodus and continued through Israel's history. The author of Esther views them as the symbol of all the powers of the world against God's people. Now that Israel has been released from captivity, Haman's dangerous edict is the final try in the Old Testament time to get rid of them. When Haman is defeated, Israel enjoys a time of rest."
"Feasting is another important theme in Esther, as seen in the picture on the left. Banquets are the setting for important parts of the story. There are ten banquets."
Style and Features.
Repetition is one of the main stylistic features of the book of Esther. The three groups of banquets come in pairs; there are two lists of the king's servants; two reports that Esther hid her identity; two gatherings of women; two houses for the women; two fasts; two talks by Haman with his wife and friends; two sudden visits to the king by Esther; two coverings of Haman's face; two royal commands; two cool-downs of the king's anger; two days for the Jews to protect themselves and take vengeance; and two letters about how Purim started.
"Another important feature of this book that has often been wondered about is that it never directly talks about God, worship, prayer, or sacrifice. This has made some people think the book is not as religious as other books. However, it is possible that the author purposefully did not say anything about God or anything religious to show more clearly that it is God who controls all the ""unimportant"" coincidences that are in the story and ends in saving the Jews."
Content.
"The Book of Esther is about a Jewish girl adopted by her cousin, Mordecai, after her parents died."
"The Persian King Ahaseurus kicked out his wife, Queen Vashti, after she refused his demand, and fell in love with Esther at a beauty contest. He took Esther as the new Persian queen, not knowing she was a Jew."
"Haman, Ahaseurus' prime minister, developed a grudge against Mordecai because he would not bow down to him, but only to the God of Israel. He despised Mordecai because he was a Jew, and tried to trick the king into making a law to kill all Jews. Haman was unaware that Queen Esther herself was a Jew."
"Kansas is the 15th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of 82,282 square miles (213,109 km2). Of this, about 462 square miles (1196.57 km2) are water. This makes up 0.60% of the total area of the state."
"Kansas shares borders with Nebraska to the north, Oklahoma to the south, Missouri to the east, and Colorado to the west. Kansas is just as far away from the Pacific Ocean as it is the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic center of the main 48 states is near Lebanon, Kansas. The geographic center of Kansas is in Barton County."
Geology.
"The underground of Kansas is made of dipping sedimentary rocks, and they are slightly slanted west. A series of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian rocks are found in the eastern and southern parts of the state. In the western part of Kansas, Cretaceous can be found sticking up from the ground. This happened because of the erosion from the geologically uplifted Rocky Mountains west of Kansas. Northeastern Kansas was affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene."
Topography.
"All of Kansas is in the Great Plains, where the land is mostly flat with prairies and grasslands. Eastern Kansas has hills and forests, like the Flint Hills and the Osage Plains in the southeastern part of the state."
"Kansas increases in elevation from east to west. The highest place in the state is Mount Sunflower near the Colorado border. Mount Sunflower is 4,039 ft (1,231 m) tall. The lowest point is the Verdigris River in Montgomery County, at 679 ft (207 m) above sea level. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state – in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek study famously said the state is ""flatter than a pancake"". Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of . This makes Kansas the 23rd flattest U.S. state."
Rivers.
About of the Kansas's northeastern border is the Missouri River. The Kansas River is created by the junction of the Smoky Hill River and Republican River. This happens at Junction City. The Kansas River then joins the Missouri River at Kansas City. It goes across the northeastern part of the state.
The Arkansas River (pronunciation varies) starts in Colorado. It goes for about across the western and southern parts of Kansas.
"Kansas's has other rivers. There is the Saline River and the Solomon River. They are tributaries of the Smoky Hill River. The Big Blue River, the Delaware River, and the Wakarusa River flow into the Kansas River. The Marais des Cygnes River is a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is between Riverton and Baxter Springs."
National parks and historic places.
Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include:
Plants and animals.
"In Kansas, there are currently 238 species of rare animals and 400 rare plants. Among those include: ""Boechera laevigata"", Virginia Rail, Cleft Ledge, Royal Fern, Turkey-tangle, Bobolink, Cave Salamander, Peregrine Falcon, and Black-footed ferret. Common animal species and grasses include: Crows, Deer, Lesser Prairie Chicken, Mice, Moles, Opossum, Prairie Dogs, Raccoon, ""Tripsacum dactyloides"", Prairie Dropseed, Indian Grass, Little Bluestem, Switch Grass, Northern Sea Oats, Tussock Sedge, Sideoats Grama, and Big Bluestem."
Weather.
"The Köppen climate classification says that Kansas's climate has three types depending on where in the state it is: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern 2/3 of the state (especially the northeastern part) has a humid continental climate. This means it has cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation happens during both the summer and the spring."
"The western 1/3 of the state – from about U.S. Route 83 to west of it – has a semiarid steppe climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters vary a lot. Winters can be anything between warm and very cold. The western region gets an average of about of precipitation per year. Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the range."
"The far south-central and southeastern parts of Kansas, including the Wichita area, have a humid subtropical climate. This means it has hot and humid summers, and it has milder winters. It also has more precipitation than other places in Kansas. Some things about three climates can be found in most of Kansas. Many parts can get droughts and varied weather. Places can be dry or humid. Places can get both warm or cold in the winter."
"Temperatures in many areas in the western half of Kansas reach or hotter on most days of June, July, and August. Because of the high humidity, the heat index can be deadly, especially in Wichita, Hutchinson, Salina, Russell, Hays, and Great Bend. Temperatures are often high in Dodge City, Garden City, and Liberal, but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature."
"Temperatures of or higher are not as common in the eastern half of Kansas. However, higher humidity and the urban heat island effect make most summer days reach between and in Topeka, Lawrence, and the Kansas City metropolitan area. During the summer, the low temperatures each night in the northeastern part of the state don't get colder than very often. Also, because of the humidity being between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat can be felt all day."
"Kansas has a varied climate with an average yearly temperature of 56°F (13°C). The highest temperature ever in Kansas is 121 °F (49.4 °C). This happened in Fredonia on July 18, 1936, and in Alton on July 24, 1936. The lowest temperature ever in Kansas is -40 °F (-40 °C). This occurred in Lebanon on February 13, 1905. Kansas is in a temperate area of the country. Like other states in this region, Kansas has four distinct seasons."
"Kansas can have extreme weather in all four seasons. For example, in spring and autumn, Kansas has many tornadoes. In fact, Kansas gets about 55 tornadoes per year. This is because Kansas is in the area known as Tornado Alley, where cold and warm air masses come together to make severe weather."
"In summer, Kansas has experienced severe droughts. For example, in 1934, 1936, and 1939, Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread dust storms as a part of the Dust Bowl."
"In winter, Kansas has snow in most parts of the state. The average snowfall in the northern half of the state is 16 inches, with the average snowfall in the southern half of the state being 8 inches. Blizzards and related snowstorms are rare in Kansas."
Cities and Counties.
Kansas is organized into 105 counties. Each county has a county seat. There are 627 incorporated cities in Kansas.
"Wichita is the biggest city in Kansas; it has almost 400,000 people. It is in Sedgwick County, which has about 520,000 people. Sedgwick County has the biggest city in Kansas, but it does not have the most people of any county in Kansas; Johnson County has more than 600,000 people. Johnson County has four of the biggest cities in Kansas: Overland Park, Olathe, Shawnee, and Lenexa. They are all suburbs of nearby Kansas City. Topeka is the capital of Kansas. Lawrence is a college town between Kansas City and Topeka."
People.
"Kansas had 627 cities in 2008. The largest city in Kansas is Wichita, which had a population of 382,368 in 2010. The other largest cities in Kansas are: Overland Park, 173,372; Kansas City, 145,786; Topeka, 127,473; and Olathe, 125,872. Between the years of 2000 and 2010, the Kansas population increased 6.1 percent."

The 2010 Census says that the people of Kansas were:
Producing output.
"Printers are programmed using a programming language. The printer interprets the program, and the outputs the result. There are two big classes of such languages: Page description languages, and Printer Control languages. A page description language describes what a page should look like. The program in a page description language is sent to the printer, which interprets them. Printer command languages are at a lower level than Page description languages, they contain information that is specific to the printer model."
Common programming languages for printers include:
Cost of printers.
"When comparing the cost of a printer, people often talk about how expensive it is to print one page. This cost usually has three components:"
"Printers that are more expensive to buy will usually be less expensive in the consumables (the ink, toner, or ribbon used by the printer). Therefore, laser printers are often more expensive to buy than inkjet printers, but are not as expensive to use over a long period of time. Inkjet printers on the other hand cost more to use because the ink tanks they use are more expensive than the toner for a laser printer."
"Laser printers that can print in color are usually more expensive than those that only print in black and white. Some expensive printers can do other things such as print on both sides of the paper, automatically sort the output, or staple the pages."
Chasing Vermeer
Chasing Vermeer is a children's novel. It is about two children noticing strange coincidences relating to art. The book was written by Blue Balliett and published (printed) by Scholastic in 2003. It says many things about the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.
"The sequel to the book is ""The Wright 3""."
Great Wall of China
"The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and dirt. It was finished in 1878 and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, wide and 15 metres high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals."
"Nineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC. The most famous wall was built between 226–200 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (Qin Pronounced as Chin) , during the Qin Dynasty. Not much of this wall remains as people have been stealing from it. It was much farther north than the current wall. The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty."
History.
Great Wall of Qi was started in 685 BC. The state of Qi made a fortified wall for protection against the Southern states Ju og Lu and later from the kingdom Chu.
The state of Yan built walls during the rule of King Zhao of Yan (311–279 BC).
"The state of Zhao built walls during 325–299 BC, during the rule of king Wuling of Zhao."
"Walls on the periphery of the Northern states Yan, Zhao, and Qin became linked together, because all those states came under the rule of emperor Qin Shi Hong, during his rule (221–206 BC)."
"The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang also called Shi Huangdi, started the Qin Dynasty. The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies. The land in some parts of China is easy to cross, so Qin Shi Huang started building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China."
"By 212 BC, the wall went from Gansu to the coast of South Manchuria."
"Other dynasties in China had worked more on the wall and made it longer. The Han, Sui, Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired, rebuilt or expanded the Great Wall. During the Ming Dynasty, major rebuilding work took place. Sections of the wall were built with bricks and stone instead of earth. It took more than 2000 years for building and completion of the Great wall."
"The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres high. It is made over the course of hundreds of years, the wall was built by over 6 different Chinese dynasties, and is over 2,300 years old."
"The wall was built to help keep out northern invaders like the Mongols. Smaller walls had been built over the years, but the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, decided that he wanted a single giant wall to protect his northern borders. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by Ming Dynasty. Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, was the only one who breached the Great Wall of China in its"
"2,700-year-history."
The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The Great Wall was declared as one of the Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.
Construction and rebuilding of the Great Wall.
"Builders used materials that were nearby. Some parts of the wall were made of mud, straw, and twigs. Thousands of workers died from giant falling stones, exhaustion, disease, animal attacks, and starvation. Workers dying and being buried in and under the Great Wall is a myth."
Visibility from space.
"Rumours about astronauts being able to see the Great Wall from the moon are scientifically not proven. The Great Wall has shown up in radar images taken from space, but scientists are sure it is not possible for astronauts to see the wall with a naked eye. One astronaut who spoke about the visibility of the Great Wall from space was Neil Armstrong. He said that on the moon, it was very clear that the wall was not visible. However, astronaut William Pogue was able to see the wall from a Low Earth Orbit distance (300-530 km height), but only with binoculars and with lots of practice."
"One important change in the Victorian era was the making of the sewage system in London. In 1829 photography was invented. Gas lighting was important too. Streetlights became common first, followed by lights in public buildings and home. In the 1880s people began making power stations and distribution systems to feed the new electric lightbulbs."
Economic changes.
"Britain began ruling its trading colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The British Empire now extended all over the world. It used new technologies like the railways and electric telegraph to communicate across these regions. Many British citizens moved to the colonies to make their fortune."
"Industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class. They were not aristocrats and landowners, but on the other hand they were not unskilled workers. They were the people who created, managed and ran the new industrial factories."
Social changes.
"In the Victorian era, the middle class people owned their own houses. The family home often included three generations. The concept of ""privacy"" became a mark of the middle class life. What went on in those homes was the themes of many mid-century novelists."
"The printing press became faster in the nineteenth century and paper was cheaper too. The ""taxes on knowledge"" on newspapers and printed advertisements were lifted. This made magazines and newspapers cheaper. The government tried to improve literacy rates by starting schools for the poor. More books were written for, and read by, the newly educated middle classes."
Entertainment.
"More theatres opened in London. Orchestras and symphonies played, and operas were widely attended. Gambling at cards and new casinos became popular during the period. In the middle of the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, and showed the greatest creations of the century."
De-Stalinization
De-Stalinization is the way that the Soviet Union tried to undo Joseph Stalin's politics and the heroic image he created of himself using propaganda.
"After Stalin died, a group led the Soviet Union for a while. Georgi Malenkov was the Premier of the Soviet Union; Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Ministry of the Interior; and Nikita Khrushchev was First Secretary of the Central Committee."
"Because Stalin had so prominent a control over the Soviet Union, he was placed on a pedestal both at home and among communists abroad. In the years 1953–1955, a period of ""silent de-Stalinization"" took place, as the revision of Stalin's policies was done in secret, and often with no explanation."
Revisionism.
"In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union. He attempted to reform the Soviet government and change how socialism in the country should be ran. In order to do this, he had to change the way the public thought of Stalin, this is called revisionism. He removed Stalin's corpse out of the mausoleum in Red Square and he changed the name of Stalingrad (which was named after Stalin) to Volgograd. Some people disliked Khrushchev’s reform and those who oppose revisionism are called anti-revisionist."

The Tsar's Bride
"The Tsar's Bride (""Tsarskaya nevesta"" in Russian) is an opera by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It was the tenth opera the composer wrote. The words (libretto) were written by Il’ya Tyumenev who based the story on a book called “The Tsar’s Bride"" by Lev Mei. The opera was composed in 1898. The first performance took place in 1899 at the Moscow theater of the Private Opera of S.I. Mamontov."
The story of the opera.
"The story is supposed to take place in the autumn of 1572 in Moscow. At this time Russia was ruled by a very cruel tsar called Ivan the Terrible. Tsar Ivan had a group of people who guarded him. They were called oprichniki. The oprichniki were like bodyguards, but they were told to kill anybody who was not loyal to the tsar, so they behaved like terrorists, killing, raping and stealing wherever they went. In the opera there are also “Boyars”. A Boyar was a nobleman."
Act 1: The Feast.
"Griaznoy is an oprichnik. Although he already has a lover, Lubasha, he now decides he loves Marfa, the daughter of the merchant Sobakin. Marfa is already engaged to be married to Lykov, a boyar. There is much merrymaking and singing at a feast. Then Griaznoy asks to be left alone with Bomelius, the tsar’s doctor. He asks him to get him a love potion. Lubasha, who is hiding, hears what he says and realizes that he does not love her any more. When the doctor goes, Griaznoy is horrible to Lubasha and tells her to go. She now wants to talk to Bomelius."
Act 2: The Love Potion.
"A lot of people are coming out of church. They talk about the autumn weather, but when the oprichniki appear they are very frightened and start talking about whom the tsar is going to choose for his bride . Marfa talks to her friend Duniasha about how she has loved Lykov ever since they were children. Tsar Ivan passes by. She does not recognize him, but she is very frightened at the way the Tsar is staring at her. Sobakin comes in with Lykov and the four of them sing about looking forward to the wedding."
Lyubasha now goes to Bomelius and asks for another magic potion which she wants to give to Griaznoi to stop him loving Marfa. Bomelius says he will give her the potion if she will make love to him. Lyubasha agrees and goes inside with him.
Act 3: At the wedding.
At the wedding celebrations Sobakin tells Lykov that he will have to wait before his marriage to Marfa can be confirmed. The Tsar himself is looking for a girl to marry and has asked to see Sobakin’s daughters. Griaznoy realizes he needs to use the love potion quickly so he asks to be invited to the wedding. At the celebration he puts the potion in Marfa’s drink. A messenger comes with the news that the Tsar has chosen Marfa to be his wife. Everyone is horrified and Sobakin collapses.
Act 4: The Bride.
"Sobakin is at the Tsar's palace. He is proud because his daughter is now the Tsarevna (the Tsar’s wife) and he himself has been made a Boyar. But he is also worried because Marfa has become very ill. Griaznoy comes in and greets Sobakin (who are now both boyars). He says that the person who poisoned Marfa has confessed. Marfa rushes in and tells Griaznoi to speak. He says that Lykov was tortured and then confessed to having poisoned Marfa. Lykov was then executed by Griaznoi himself. Marfa goes mad when she hears this. In her madness she thinks Griaznoy is Lykov. This eventually makes Griaznoy confess that he himself at put the potion into her drink. He did not realize it was poisonous. Lyubasha then confesses that she had put her potion in the place of Griaznoi’s potion. She blames Griaznoy and invites him to kill her. He kills her, then he is taken to prison to be executed. As he is taken away, Marfa, in her madness, once again mistakes Griaznoy for Lykov. She invites him to return the next day to visit her. Then she dies."
Bubble sort
"Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It is simple to understand, so it is usually taught to new students. It is not as efficient as some other sorting algorithms."
"Bubble sort's name comes from the fact that each item in the list “bubbles” up to where it should go, like bubbles in water."
Algorithm.
"The algorithm compares pairs of elements in a list. The elements the make up the pairs are next to each other. Starting at one end of the list, the two elements in each pair are compared to each other in order. That means for example, the first and second element are compared, then the second and third element, and then the third and fourth, and so on. If the elements in the current pair are out of order, then the two elements switch places. This process – of comparing two elements – is done over and over again, until the whole list is sorted. The list is sorted, when there are no more pairs that have to be swapped."
"In the best case scenario, where the list was already sorted before running the algorithm, the algorithm's complexity is O(n) (Big O notation). In the worst case, where the list starts off as being sorted in reverse, O(n²)."
Implementation.
"In an imperative programming language, bubble sort can be implemented by using a flag variable and looping through the array's elements:"
"Alternatively, since the greatest value ascends to the highest index within the first iteration and then has reached its final ""right"" position, two for-loops nested into one another sort the vector, too:"
for top ≔ high(vector)−1 downto low(vector) do
for current ≔ low(vector) to top do
if vector[current] &gt; vector[current+1] then
"exchange(vector, current, current+1)"
Maundy Thursday
"Maundy Thursday, also known as Holy Thursday, Covenant Thursday, Great &amp; Holy Thursday, and Thursday of Mysteries, is the Christian feast or holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter that commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Twelve Apostles as described in the Canonical gospels. It is the fifth day of Holy Week, and is preceded by Holy Wednesday and followed by Good Friday."
"Nowadays, there is little or no households with proper phunga lairu (traditional fire hearth). So, a modern fireplace is developed. Here, traditional rites and rituals are performed in honor of the goddess."
"There are a lot of changes in the way of worshipping Goddess Imoinu. However, the essence and the importance always remain the same as forever."
Festival.
"The ""Imoinu Iratpa"" (""Emoinu Eratpa"") is a religious festival dedicated to goddess Imoinu (Emoinu). It is celebrated on the 12th of Wakching month (December-January interface month) every year. Traditionally, worship and prayers are performed inside every households. Nowadays, Imoinu Iratpa festival is also celebrated in a larger way in public gathering clubs also."
"Wherever the festival is performed, seasonal fruits, vegetables and fish are offered to goddess Imoinu."

Leimarel Sidabi
"Leimarel Sidabi () or Leimalel Sitapi () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the highest female divinity in Meitei pantheon. She is the goddess of earth, nature and household. She is the mother of everyone in the universe."
Etymology.
"The Meitei word ""Leimarel"" (ꯂꯩꯃꯔꯦꯜ) or ""Leimaren"" (ꯂꯩꯃꯔꯦꯟ) is as ""queen"" or ""goddess"" in English. The word ""Leimarel"" (or ""Leimaren"") can be broken into pieces: ""Lei"" (ꯂꯩ), ""Ma"" (ꯃ) and ""-ren"" (-ꯔꯦꯟ) or ""-rel"" (-ꯔꯦꯜ). ""Lei"" means land or earth. ""Ma"" means mother. ""-ren"" (or ""-rel"") means excellent. Another Meitei word ""Sidabi"" can be broken into ""Si"" (ꯁꯤ), ""-da"" (ꯗ) and ""-bi"" (-ꯕꯤ). ""Si"" (""See"") means ""to die"". ""-da"" denotes negative meaning. ""-bi"" (""-bee"") denotes feminine gender."
Description.
"Leimarel is the mother goddess. In ancient times, the ruling royal couples sat in the ""Laplen Ka"" (the central room). They faced the sacred spot of goddess Leimarel. It was believed that men and women originated from Leimarel's womb. A house symbolises the Mother in traditional Meitei beliefs."
Mythology.
"The supreme creator Atingkok (alias Salailel) asked his two sons, Sanamahi and Pakhangba to run in a race around the world. The winner would become the ruler of the world. Sanamahi was stronger than his younger brother, Pakhangba. He started his journey. Pakhangba wept to his mother, Leimarel Sidabi. She told him the secret behind the throne of the universe. The secret is that going around the throne of the Supreme Being is shorter than going around the universe. So, Pakhangba went around the Supreme Being, his father. Thus, he won the race and became the ruler of the universe. When Sanamahi returned home, he found his younger brother sitting on the throne. He got angry. He attacked Pakhangba. Pakhangba ran away. He hid himself among seven lairembis. The Supreme Being intervened the situation. He brought peace of Sanamahi. He made Sanamahi as the king of the household of the mankind. At the same time, goddess Leimarel Sidabi became another Imung Lai (household deity), besides Sanamahi."
"According to some legends, goddess Ima Leimaren (lit. Mother Leimarel) takes care of the market. She brings peace and harmony by doing so. This tradition is still maintained by womenfolk. The women are considered as the descendents of the ""Ima""."
Texts.
"Several ancient texts (PuYas) write things about the goddess Leimarel. Some include the Leimaren Naoyom, the Leimaren Langon, the Leimaren Mingkhei, the Leimaren Shekning Lasat, the Leimaren Ungoiron, besides others."
Worship.
"Leimarel Sidabi and her son Sanamahi are worshipped in the first room of every Meitei household. Goddess Leimarel doesn't want the ""Korou Anganba"" (sunlight) in the morning. So, houses of Loi castes are mainly made facing southwards. She lives in water also. So, she is worshipped in an ""Isaiphu"" (an earthen pitcher or terracotta pot containing water). There are no images kept to represent the two deities inside their abode."

Crocodylomorph
The Crocodylomorphs are an important group of archosaurs. It includes the crocodilians and their extinct relatives. They were the only members of Pseudosuchia to survive the end-Triassic extinction.
During Mesozoic and early Tertiary times the Crocodylomorphs were much more diverse than they are now.
"They were originally small, lightly built, active land animals. These were replaced during the early Jurassic by various aquatic and marine forms. The later Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary saw a wide diversity of terrestrial and semi-aquatic lines."
Modern crocodilians do not appear until the Upper Cretaceous.
Evolutionary history.
"The crocodylian lineage (clade Crurotarsi) were a very diverse group of reptiles. Not only are they an ancient group of animals, at least as old as the dinosaurs, they also evolved into a great variety of forms."
"The earliest forms, the sphenosuchians, evolved during the Upper Triassic. They were slim land animals built like greyhounds. During the Jurassic and the Cretaceous, marine forms evolved forelimbs that were paddle-like and had a tail similar to modern fish."
"The group had a wider range of habitats and behaviours than it does at present. ""Dakosaurus andiniensis"", a species closely related to ""Metriorhynchus"", had a skull adapted for eating large marine reptiles. Several terrestrial species during the Cretaceous evolved herbivory. A number of lines during the Tertiary and Pleistocene became wholly land predators."
Lepidosauromorph
The Lepidosauromorphs are a large group of reptiles. It includes all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs.
"The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: lizards, snakes, and the tuatara."
"The most important fossil group, the Sauropterygia, includes the plesiosaurs."

Onon (river)
"The Onon gol (Mongolian: Онон гол, Russian: Онон) is a river in Mongolia and Russia. It is 818 km long. Its watershed is 94,010 km2. It starts at the Khentii Mountains, on the Eastern slopes. 298 km of the river is in Mongolia. It has a confluence (the place where two rivers join together) with the Ingoda River. When they meet, it makes the Shilka River. People believe that Genghis Khan was born near the upper Onon and he grew up there. The rivers Onon—Shilka—Amur makes one of the world's ten longest rivers (their lengths, in order: 818 km, 560 km, 2,874 km)."
Entscheidungsproblem
"The Entscheidungsproblem (German, ""decision problem"") is a famous problem of mathematics. David Hilbert formulated the problem in 1928: Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language, and a logical statement in that language, and that will output ""True"" or ""False"", depending on the truth value of the statement? The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer, nor prove it, as long as the answer is always correct."
"In 1936 and 1937, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently, that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem . This was proven by Alan Turings ""Turing Machine"" which was created in the 1930s."
Turing's Proof.
"Turing proposes a computer program that can determine for certain if any program fed into it will halt or not. He also proposes another program that halts if the input is loop, and loops if the input is halt. He says to make these two programs one new program. Then, he proposes to feed this new program's code into itself. This means the program thinks it will halt, so it will loop, but then it'll loop, so it'll halt, and so on and so forth. This is a paradox, which means for certain that you cannot write a program to determine if every program will halt or not."
Bessie Coleman
"Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Coleman (January 26, 1892 – April 30, 1926) was the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She fought discrimination to follow her dream of becoming a pilot. She became a skilled barnstormer and aviation educator."
Early Life.
"Coleman was born in Texas in 1892. Her mother was African American and her father was Native American. She had two brothers and a young sister. Her parents were sharecroppers. When Coleman was two, her family moved to Waxahachie, Texas where Bessie went to school. She loved reading and was very good at math. Her father hoped to get a job."
Coleman’s father was disturbed by the racial barriers in Texas. He believed that the family would be treated better if they moved to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
"Unable to convince his wife to accompany him, Coleman’s father left the family when she was nine. Around that time, her older brothers grew up and moved away. Coleman’s mother worked as a maid. Coleman helped take care of her younger sisters."
"During the cotton harvest, everyone in the family worked in the fields to earn extra money. It was hot, boring work, and during the harvest, African American children could not go to school. Still, Coleman managed to finish all eight grades in the local school. Coleman decided that she wanted to go to college, so she saved her money. In about four years, she had enough money to begin college. A year later, she ran out of money."
"At the age of 23, Coleman boarded a train and made the trip to Chicago. She moved in with her brothers and their wives. Coleman took class to learn to become a manicurist, and soon found a job at the White Sox Barber Shop on Chicago's Southside. But Coleman wanted to do something more with her life."
Flying.
"Her friend Robert Abbott told her that she could travel to France to fly. She studied the French language after work at night. She got a new job managing a restaurant and saved her money. Robert Abbot and her friends helped her pay for the trip. In 1920, Coleman went to France on a ship. She learned to be a pilot at the Caudron Brothers' School of Aviation. In 1921, Coleman became the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She earned it from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale."
"Coleman went back to the United States to work as a barnstormer, performing tricks and stunts in her airplane. Barnstormers like Coleman flew planes in loops and figure eights and other patterns while audiences watched. Coleman performed in the United States and Europe. In the 1920s, much of the United States still practiced racial segregation. Coleman refused to perform at places that did not let African Americans watch equally. For one show in Texas, Coleman refused to perform unless the showrunners let everyone in the audience enter through the same gate instead of making one gate for white people and one for black people. She also taught flying lessons and encouraged women to learn to be pilots."
Coleman wanted to open an aviation school in the United States where black students could learn to be pilots.
"In April 1926, Coleman and her mechanic, William Will, were practicing for a performance the next day. Will was piloting the plane, when it flipped over and started to dive. Coleman fell out of the plane and was killed. She is buried in Chicago's Lincoln Cemetery."
Legacy.
Coleman is in the Aviation Hall of Fame.
"In 1929, William Powell started the Bessie Coleman Aero Club in her honor. The Club promoted aviation among black Americans, and it allowed men and women to join."
"In 1995, the U.S. Post Office issued a stamp in her honor. A Chicago street was named after her."

Intelligence.
"There was not much information about the beaches. There were German gun positions on the cliffs, but these had not been spotted. The planners thought that Dieppe is not heavily defended and that the beaches in are suitable for landing infantry, and armored fighting vehicles."
German forces.
The German forces at Dieppe were ready for the attack. They were warned by French double agents that the British were planning some action in the area. They had also detected increased radio talk and landing craft being gathered together in the southern British coastal ports.

They were delayed by 20 minutes and the smoke that should have hidden their attack had lifted. The Germans were ready in their defensive positions for the landings. The well-fortified German forces fired guns at the Canadian forces that did land on the beach.
"As soon as they reached the shore, the Canadians found themselves unable to move forward. The Royal Regiment of Canada had many deaths. Of the 556 men in the regiment, 200 were killed and 264 captured."
Green beach.
"On Green beach at the same time that No. 4 Commando had landed, the South Saskatchewan Regiment went towards Pourville. They landed at 04:52 without being detected. The regiment managed to leave their landing craft before the Germans could start firing their guns."
"The regiment had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge. Before they managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had put machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped them. With dead and wounded Canadians lying on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt, the commanding officer, crossed the bridge several times. He wanted to show his soldiers that the bridge could be crossed. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross."

Brazing
Brazing is a metal-joining process. Two or more metal items are joined together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. The filler metal has a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.
Brazing differs from welding because it does not melt the work pieces. Brazing differs from soldering because it uses a higher temperature and more closely fitted parts than soldering.
"During the brazing process, the filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action."
"The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting temperature. while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal and joins the work pieces together. A big advantage of brazing is it can join the same or different metals with considerable strength."

John McDouall Stuart
"John McDouall Stuart (7 September 18155 June 1866) is regarded as one of Australia's greatest explorers. He went on seven major exploring trips into the centre and north of Australia. He was leader of six of these expeditions. He spent more time out in the Australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer. On each trip, he was able to go further north and found water sources that helped him with his final long journey. In 1862, he crossed Australia from Adelaide, South Australia, to Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory. He was the first European to cross the continent from north to south and then return again."
"Exploring Australia caused Stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi. He pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance. Each trip left him weaker and at the end of his last trip he was unable to walk or ride and had to be carried back. Stuart's discoveries opened up the country for the growth of farming sheep and cattle. His route was used to build the Australian Overland Telegraph Line from Adelaide to Darwin which joined an undersea line from Java. This meant that for the first time, Australians could communicate quickly with the rest of the world. But his personal rewards were small. He was given some land by the government and a small salary from his employers. Stuart died poor in England at the age of 50."
Early life.
"Stuart was born on 7 September 1815, at Dysart, Fife, Scotland. His father, William Stuart, had been a captain in the British Army. His mother was Mary McDouall. They had nine children, John McDouall was the sixth. His parents died when he was ten years old. The children were separated and sent to live with different relatives. Stuart was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh. He studied to be an engineer and surveyor."
Australia.
"In 1839, Stuart moved to Adelaide, South Australia, and began work as a surveyor. Adelaide had only been settled for two years and was mainly still a tent city. The government needed to have maps so that land could be sold or leased. Stuart worked for three years on the edges of the settled areas, measuring the land and dividing it into farm blocks. He learned skills to live and travel in the Australian bush. He was known as a heavy drinker, often spending days at a time drunk. When a recession hit the South Australian economy, Stuart found himself without a job."
Central Australian Expedition 1844.
"Stuart joined Charles Sturt's Central Australian Expedition to search for an inland sea in August 1844. Sturt was so sure that there was an inland sea in the centre of Australia, that he took a large boat as part of his equipment. Stuart joined the group as a draftsman, who would draw up the maps. He was paid one pound a week, and provided with food. Stuart and James Poole, the second in command, were sent out ahead of the main group to find water. The main group could only travel as fast as their flock of sheep could walk. Stuart and Poole found water at Depot Glen, near the current site of Milparinka."
"In the hot dry climate of summer, the group remained trapped at the waterhole for seven months. Stuart took a small group to find water to the north, west, and east, but found none. Stuart was left behind in charge of the main group at Depot Glen. It was very hot so they dug an underground room to keep cool. All the men became sick from scurvy because of the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. This caused their gums to become soft and their teeth to fall out. They had headaches, their noses bled, and their skin began to turn black. When Poole died, Stuart was made second in command. He also became the surveyor and did all the mapping as Sturt could not see properly. When it finally rained the group tried to keep going north but were blocked by the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert. They turned south and went back to the Darling River. Stuart took over as leader when Sturt became blind and too ill to lead the group. They arrived back in Adelaide after six weeks hard travelling. Sturt had to be carried in a cart, and Stuart, crippled with scurvy and beriberi, looked like a skeleton."
"It took Stuart nearly a year to recover from the expedition. He wrote in a letter: ""I lost the power of my limbs for ... six months, and was quite unable to do anything for myself for ... twelve months."" For the next few years he was unable to work. The money he had made was spent on doctors and living expenses. In 1849 he moved to near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and worked on a farm. He soon found work surveying in the area, and met William Finke and James Chambers. Finke and Chambers were rich men and they paid Stuart to explore for them. They wanted him to find them new farm lands and water, as well as minerals like gold and copper."
Flory won the Perkin Medal and the Priestley Medal.
The Flory convention.
"In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. A three-dimensional structure can be described using the Flory convention by applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates."
Later years.
"He became a professor at Stanford University in 1961. He became the Jackson-Wood Professor there in 1966. He retired from Stanford in 1975. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 ""for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules."" He remained active after his retirement, and consulted for IBM for some years. He and his wife Emily Catherine Tabor (now dead) had three children, Susan, Melinda and John. Susan has two children, Elizabeth and Mary. Elizabeth has three children, Katy Greer, Margaret Greer, and Sam Greer. Paul J Flory died of a heart attack in Big Sur, California in 1985."

"A tale from Gianfrancesco Straparola's ""Le piacevoli notti"" () (1550-55) and another from Giambattista Basile's ""Pentamerone"" (1634) are similar to ""Puss in Boots"". Straparola's story was published in France in 1560. It may have influenced Perrault. ""Pentamerone"" was not published in France during Perrault's lifetime. It is not likely he knew Basile's tale."

Bluebeard
"""Bluebeard"" () is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 titled ""Contes de ma mère l'oye"" (). The deluxe volume was intended for Mademoiselle, the 19-year-old niece of Louis XIV. It included four other tales by Perrault. ""Bluebeard"" was first published anonymously in January 1697 in Paris by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The tale is about a cruel man who murders his wives so that he will inherit their wealth. He puts their corpses in a secret room opened only by a magic key."
"Jacque Barchilon believes the tale is original with Perrault because there are no close antecedants. The taboo of the forbidden room is found in eastern literature, and Barchilon writes that the tale has an ""Oriental character"". He points out that the French associated beards with Turkish fashions, and early illustrations depict Bluebeard wearing a turban-like headdress."
"Medieval murderer of children Gilles de Rais may have been the inspiration for the character of Bluebeard. De Rais was a Marshal of France and Joan of Arc's military companion. His victims (mostly young boys) were said to number 140. The Breton king Comorre the Cursed (c.500 AD) is another candidate. Tales similar to ""Bluebeard"" include ""The Fitcher's Bird"" by the Brothers Grimm and the English tale ""Mr. Fox""."
Story.
"A rich man has a blue beard which frightens young women. He has been married several times but no one knows what has happened to his wives. He woos two young sisters in the neighborhood but neither are inclined to consider marriage. He treats them to a lavish time in his country house. The younger sister decides to marry him. Shortly after the wedding (and before he travels to a far land on business), Bluebeard gives his wife the keys to his house. One key opens a door to a distant room. He forbids her to enter this room. He leaves and his wife opens the door to the forbidden room. Here she finds Bluebeard's former wives, all dead and lying on a floor covered with blood. She drops the key. It is magic and becomes stained with blood that cannot be washed away. Bluebeard returns. He discovers the blood-stained key and knows his wife has disobeyed his order. He tells her she will take her place among the dead. He grants her a few minutes to pray. She calls her sister Anne and asks her to go to the top of the tower to see if her brothers are on the road. After several tense moments, Anne reports seeing the men approaching. Bluebeard raises a cutlass to decapitate his wife. Her brothers burst into the room. They kill Bluebeard. Their sister is safe."

She finds the courage to defy social norms and commits to loving Ron."
Criticism.
Motion of no confidence
"A motion of no confidence, is a vote on whether a group of people still has confidence in a government or leader. This is mainly a statement or vote which states that a person in a superior position, be it government, managerial, etc., is no longer deemed fit to hold that position."
"The first motion of no confidence occurred in March 1782 when, following news of the British defeat at Yorktown in the American Revolutionary War the previous October, the Parliament of Great Britain voted that they ""can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers"". In modern times, passage of a motion of no confidence is relatively rare in two-party democracies. Party discipline is usually enough to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence."
"There are variations of this in different countries. For example, in Germany, Spain, and Israel, a vote of no confidence requires that the opposition, on the same ballot, propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the respective head of state. A motion of no confidence in some countries can be proposed in the government collectively or by any individual member, including the Prime Minister. In Spain it is presented by the Prime Minister after consultation."
Sometimes a party proposes a confidence vote even though it is not likely to pass. The no confidence vote may pressure the government. Or when the government proposes the vote it can embarrass critics who do not vote against the government.

They might be acquired through spontaneous mutations (vertical gene transfer) or through other bacteria passing their genes (horizontal gene transfer). Self-medications or improper medication use can result in the emergence of resistant bacteria. It is difficult to obtain new antibiotics, that is why researchers seek to improve existing ones, as well as working to discover new drugs."

Randy Rhoads
"Randall William ""Randy"" Rhoads (December 6, 1956 – March 19, 1982) was an American heavy metal guitarist. He was best known for performing with Ozzy Osbourne and the band Quiet Riot."
Career.
Rhoads first formed a band with Kelly Garni called Little Women. Kevin DuBrow was recruited into the band and they changed their name to Quiet Riot. The band became popular by playing in clubs in Los Angeles. By late 1976 they were signed to CBS/Sony Records.
"Dana Strum contacted Rhoads to see if he was wanted to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's new band. He asked his mother if he should join Osbourne's band since he was still in Quiet Riot. She asked him if he would accept ""an offer like this one"" and Rhodes replied ""Of course!"""
"He went to audition in Osbourne's hotel room in Los Angeles with his guitar and a practice amplifier. As he started getting ready he was given the job. Osbourne was very drunk, and had fallen asleep during the audition. Rhoads remembered later, ""I just tuned up and did some riffs, and he said, 'You've got the gig'; I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, 'You didn't even hear me yet'""."
"Rhoads flew to England on the November 27, 1979. He stayed with Osbourne, his wife at the time Thelma, and their two children. After a short while, Lee Kerslake joined the band, which was at the time called The Blizzard of Ozz. The band recorded their debut album ""Blizzard of Ozz"" which was released on September 20, 1980 and became a success. ""Diary of a Madman"", their second studio album, was recorded between February and March 1981. It was released on November 7, 1981."
Death.
"Rhoads died on March 19, 1982. He was touring with his band at the time. While driving in their tour bus, the band stopped in Leesburg, Florida, to fix the bus' air conditioner. Osbourne stayed asleep because he had been drinking heavily earlier in the evening. While stopped, their driver Andrew Aycock noticed an airstrip with small helicopters and planes. Aycock had previously worked as a commercial pilot. He decided to take a small Beechcraft F35 plane registered to a man named Mike Partin. He took it without Partin's permission. He took keyboardist Don Airey and tour manager Jake Duncan for a flight. He took Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel Youngblood on for the second flight. Aycock tried to fly the plane very low over their tour bus, where the other band members were sleeping. He made two close passes but caused an accident on the third one. One of the plane's wings had clipped the top of the tour bus. This broke the wing into two parts and sent the plane spiraling out of control. Both Rhoads and Youngblood were thrown out of the plane's windshield by the initial impact. While traveling at about , the plane crashed into a nearby garage. All three passengers were killed instantly. They were burned beyond recognition from the fire of the plane. The only person to witness the accident was keyboardist Don Airey."

"The Iran-Contra affair was a scandal that happened from August 1985 to March 1987. The scandal involved the United States Government selling weapons to Iran in exchange for hostages and to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. It happened under President Ronald Reagan's government. When 1,500 missiles were shipped three hostages were released but those three hostages were soon replaced with three more hostages. Secretary of State George Shultz called it “a hostage Bazaar”"
Oliver North was tried in court for the affair because he took the blame instead of Reagan. The court found North to be not guilty.
"On March 4, 1987, Reagan himself apologized to the American people and said it was all his fault. George H. W. Bush later pardoned anyone who was involved in the affair."
"While President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause, the evidence is unclear as to whether he knew about the scandal."
LaWanda Page
"LaWanda Page (October 19, 1920September 14, 2002), born Alberta Peal, was an American actress and comedienne best known for her role as Aunt Esther in the 1970s TV sitcom ""Sanford and Son"". She later reprised the role in ""Sanford Arms"" and ""Sanford""."
Early life and career.
"She was born on October 19, 1920 in Cleveland, Ohio. Page was raised in St. Louis, Missouri. LaWanda Page and Redd Foxx were very close friends from the time they were pre-teens. They attended school and grew up together in St. Louis. Later on, they both entered the field of comedy separately and performed stage acts. Page later recorded several live comedy albums for the Laff Records label in the late 1960s and early 1970s under the LaWanda stage name. One release, a gold-selling album called ""Watch It, Sucker!"", was titled after one of her Aunt Esther character's catchphrases to capitalize on her newfound TV fame. During her tenure as a stand-up comic, which lasted all the way to the 1990s, she was often called ""The Queen of Comedy"", or ""The Black Queen of Comedy"". Other than the expletive-free ""Sane Advice"" album, released two years after the run of ""Sanford and Son"", most of Page's albums and stand-up material were raunchy in nature."

Atmosphere of Mars
"The atmosphere of Mars is the layer of gases surrounding Mars. It is mainly made up of carbon dioxide. The average atmospheric pressure of the Martian surface (6.0 mbar) is much lower than that of the Earth (1,013 mbar). The pressure is well below the Armstrong limit, meaning that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body: 98.6 °F (36.6 °C)."
"The Martian atmosphere contains 96% carbon dioxide, 1.9% argon, 1.9% nitrogen, and traces of oxygen, carbon monoxide, water and methane, and so on. Ever since the discovery of methane in 2003, scientists say that this might indicate life. It has also been suggested that is may be caused by geochemical processes, volcanic or hydrothermal activity."
"The atmosphere of Mars is quite dusty, giving the Martian sky a light brown or orange-red color when seen from the surface. Data from NASA pointed out that the dust particles are 1.5 micrometres diameter."
"On 18 March 2015, NASA found an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of Mars."
"Liquid water on Mars was once commonplace, which means the atmosphere was thicker. Many studies have found that the atmosphere of Mars has been weakened over time due to solar winds. On Earth, the magnetic field protects us from most of the wind. Mars used to have a magnetic field, but cooling of the core has resulted in the magnetic field being lost."
Solar Wind Composition Experiment
"The Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWC) was an experiment that took place on the Moon during the Apollo program (Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16). It was done to measure the solar wind outside of Earth's magnetosphere. It was the first notable measurement of isotopic solar material."
The experiment was suggested by by a Swiss team headed by Johannes Geiss of the University of Bern and Peter Eberhardt of the Swiss Institute of Technology. It was partially funded by the Swiss Government.
"The SWC experiment was done by getting a aluminum sheet and facing it towards the sun. The foil was to collect the ion types and energies of the solar wind on the lunar surface. After the experiment, the sheet was placed into a Teflon bag, and sent back to Earth to be studied. The experiment was successful and found Helium, Neon and Argon isotopic compositions coming from the sun."
Caesar's Comet
"Caesar's Comet (C/-43 K1) is also known as 'Comet Caesar' and the 'Great Comet of 44 BC'. It was one of the most famous comets of ancient times. Many Romans thought the comet's seven-day appearance was a sign of the deification of recently assassinated dictator, Julius Caesar (100–44 BC)."
"Caesar's Comet was one of only five comets known to have had a negative absolute magnitude and may have been the brightest daylight comet in history. It was not periodic, and it had a parabolic orbit. The comet might now be more than 800 AU from the Sun."
Do You Know the Way to San Jose
"""Do You Know the Way to San Jose"" is a 1968 popular song. It is about a person from San Jose, California who wants to go back to her hometown. Dionne Warwick performed it."

The head of Government in the British Virgin Islands is called the Premier, and he is in charge of a group of ministers of government which is called the Cabinet. Laws are passed by a group of elected politicians in the House of Assembly. Most of the international relations are still dealt with by the British Government in London on behalf of the people of the British Virgin Islands."

The term seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) are several groups of extinct seed plants (spermatophytes).
The oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from Upper Devonian strata. They flourished during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.
Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous. Some fossil pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times in Tasmania.
History of the term.
The concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century. Palaeobotanists saw that many Carboniferous fossils which looked like ferns had anatomical features like cycads.
"British palaeobotanists made the discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds, and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants."
"Initially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads. In the English-speaking world they were referred to as ""seed ferns"" or ""pteridosperms"". Today, most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading. The names have nevertheless stuck."
"Later during the 20th century, the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds. Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as ""Glossopteris"" and its relatives, which was clearly stretching the concept."
"The seed ferns were by far the earliest seed plants, and must have included the ancestors of the later plants. They are spread across a number of clades, so many palaeobotanists today regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic 'grade-group'."
"Does the concept of pteridosperms have any value today? Many palaeobotanists still use the term in an informal sense for the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites)."
"This is useful for extinct seed plant groups, whose relationships are unknown. We can call them"" pteridosperms"" with no suggestion of their being a clade. Also, for curators or collectors, the term 'pteridosperm' is a useful shorthand for describing fern-like fronds probably produced by seed plants, which are often found in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras."
John Riggins
"Robert John Riggins (born August 4, 1949 in Seneca, Kansas) is a retired American football running back who used to play for the New York Jets and Washington Redskins of the NFL.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992."
Glossopteris
Glossopteris is the largest and best-known genus of the extinct seed ferns. They were typical plants of the coal forests or coal swamps which lasted from the Pennsylvanian (later Carboniferous) to the end of the Permian.

Bermuda's two informal villages:
"Despite their names, Jones Village (in Warwick), Cashew City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke) and Tucker's Town (St. George's) are merely neighborhoods. Dandy Town and North Village are sports clubs and Harbour View Village is a small public housing development."
Economy.
"Bermuda has a wealthy economy, with finance as its largest sector, followed by tourism. In 2005, Bermuda was even claimed to have the world's highest GDP per capita, yet these statistics are hard to verify as Bermuda is not classified as a country but rather as a territory of the U.K."
Main sights.
"Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, cerulean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists. Many of Bermuda's hotels are along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a World Heritage Site. Scuba divers can explore many wrecks and coral reefs in shallow water (typically in depth) with nearly unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are easy to access from shore by snorkellers, especially at Church Bay."
"Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is the Royal Naval Dockyard. It includes the Bermuda Maritime Museum. Other attractions include the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo, Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with its impressive stalactites and underground saltwater pools."
"It is not possible to rent a car on the island. However, visitors can hire motor scooters for use as private transport, or use public transport."
Arts and culture.
"Bermuda has produced, or been home to, actors such as Oona O'Neill, Earl Cameron, Diana Dill, Lena Headey, Will Kempe, and most famously, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Other movie and television personalities who were born, or have lived, in Bermuda include producer Arthur Rankin, Jr., and cartoonist and Muppet man Michael Frith."
"Music and dance are important in Bermuda. Noted musicians have included local icons The Talbot Brothers, who performed for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and were on Ed Sullivan's televised variety show. Other musicians are jazz pianist Lance Hayward, singer-songwriter Heather Nova and her brother, Mishka, tenor Gary Burgess, classical musician and conductor Kenneth Amis, and more recently, dancehall artist Collie Buddz."
"In 1979, Gina Swainson was crowned ""Miss World""."
Sports.
"Bermuda's national cricket team was in the Cricket World Cup 2007 in the West Indies. Their most famous player is Dwayne Leverock. Also very well known is David Hemp. The yearly ""Cup Match"" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the time for a popular national holiday."
In 2007 Bermuda hosted the 25th PGA Grand Slam of Golf. The event returned to Bermuda again in 2008 and 2009. Bermudian Quinn Talbot was once the World one-armed golf champion.
"The Government said in 2006 that it will provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and football teams. Bermuda's most famous footballers include Clyde Best, Shaun Goater, Reggie Lambe, Sam Nusum and Ralph Bean. In 2006, the Bermuda Hogges were formed as the nation's first professional football team. The team plays in the United Soccer Leagues Second Division."
"Sailing, fishing, and equestrian sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The Newport–Bermuda Yacht Race is a more than 100-year-old tradition. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy. International One Design racing also started in Bermuda."
"At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, Clarence Hill. Hill won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also was in Men's Skeleton at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Jillian Teceira was in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Bermuda also competes in the biennial Island Games. It will host in 2013."
Bermuda has a proud Rugby Union community. The Bermuda Rugby Union team won the 2011 Caribbean championships – defeating Guyana in the final.

A royal family may be called ""House of"" something, as in ""House of Habsburg"". Some royal families such as the British Royal Family participate in various ceremonies and royal duties."
General election
"A general election is an election in which all or most members of a given political body are chosen. The term is usually used to mean the elections held for a nation's primary legislative body. This is different from primary elections, by-elections or local elections. In the United Kingdom when Parliament is dissolved every seat in the House of Commons becomes vacant and a general election is held."
2005 United Kingdom general election
"The 2005 United Kingdom General Election was an election held on May 5, 2005 to elect 646 members to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The three main candidates to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom are shown to the right."
The election resulted in the Labour Party and it's leader Tony Blair winning a majority in the House of Commons for the third time in a row. The Labour Party did lose 47 of their seats in parliament and the amount of votes they got dropped by 5.5% from the 2001 General Election. Many people believe the Labour Party lost support because of Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's unpopular decision to send troops to Iraq in 2003.
Results.
"The constituencies of Blaenau Gwent and Wyre Forest elected Independent candidates. The seat of Glasgow East was won by the Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin, who is not considered to be of any political party."

The service offered thousands of pages ranging from consumer information to financial data but with limited graphics."
Trichodesmium
"Trichodesmium, or ""sea sawdust"", is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria. They are found in nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical ocean waters."
"They are most common around Australia and in the Red Sea, where they were first described by Captain Cook."
"""Trichodesmium"" is a diazotroph; that is, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, a nutrient used by other organisms. ""Trichodesmium"" is thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally."
Dizzee Rascal
"Dylan Mills (born 18 September 1984, better known as Dizzee Rascal) is a musician who grew out of the UK Garage music scene, although he has been known to distance himself from this genre. He is also known for being present on pirate radio stations. His music is a combination of both garage and hip-hop beats, also with his own original style of rapping."
History.
"Dizzee Rascal's first song to be released was ""I Luv U"" - a tale of accidental teenage pregnancy. His first album ""Boy In The Corner"" was released in 2003 with good reviews."
The same year (2003) Dizzee Rascal was stabbed in Ayia Napa. Some newspapers tried to link this to a conflict between Dizzee and a UK-based hip-hop group So Solid Crew.
"Dizzee has been described as ""the vital unvarnished voice of modern-day inner-city UK"", and a social element is usually present in most of his songs. However, Dizzee proves that social commentary does not have to be boring. There is often a funny element to his singing, and some might find this (very British) humour similar to that of Mike Skinner of The Streets."
"Altogether Southwest Alaska is 442,194 km² (170,732 mi²), slightly larger than California."
Demographics.
"Southwest Alaska had a population of about 53,000 people. This is less than 10% of all the people in Alaska. More than half of those people are Alaska Natives. About 121 towns and villages are in Southwest Alaska. A lot of them are very small and far away from other towns."
"Natives in Southwest Alaska are descended from different tribes, the Yupik, the Alutiiq, the Aleut and the Dena'ina Athabaskans."
"In modern times Alaska Natives are organized into corporations. The corporations have the job of speaking for the members. Four of the corporations are in Southwest Alaska, the Calista Corporation, the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, Koniag Incorporated, and the Aleut Corporation. Each one represents a different part of Southwest Alaska."
Economy.
"Most of the land in Southwest Alaska is owned by the Federal government, the State of Alaska, and the native corporations. There is not much of it that belongs to private persons."
"The economy in Southwest Alaska is based on three main things. Resource extraction, meaning the removal of natural things like wood, coal, or fish. Subsistence, meaning people who get their own food is another. The third is government spending."
"Fishing is important here. There are big boats that catch lots and lots of fish that end up in stores or in food made from fish. There are also lots of small boats where people fish for their own food or just for fun. A lot of the big boats are owned by people who don't live on Southwest Alaska. Kodiak and Unalaska are two of the most important fishing ports in the United States. They make a lot of money from catching salmon, trout, king crab, and halibut. Because so many of the big boats are owned by companies or people from outside Southwest Alaska most of the fish and the money they make from it does not stay in the area."
"Hunting and other tourism are some of the other important businesses in Southwest, but only for part of the year."
"There is also mining in Southwest Alaska. Most of the time they are looking for gold, platinum, or mercury. There is not a lot of mining but there are a lot of people who do not agree about it. One thing they don't agree on is the Pebble Mine, which would put a large open pit gold and copper mine near where a lot of the fish that are caught in Bristol Bay come from. Right now it is not allowed to drill for oil in Bristol Bay either, but some people in the government want to change that."
Wildlife.
"Southwest Alaska is one of the best places in the world to catch salmon. There are also lots of brown bears. They come to eat the salmon, as well as berries and other plants. Bear watching is a popular tourist attraction at Katmai National Park and Preserve. This area is also home to a number of caribou herds. More western Aleutian Islands have no mammals larger than a fox. In the summer, lots of birds fly up and make their nests on the tundra here. A lot of the Aleutian Islands have lots and lots of seabirds on them."
Transportation.
"There is no way to get to Southwest Alaska in a car. There are roads in the towns and some of them have roads going to another town, but there is not a road going into the area from anywhere else. Because of that people travel by boat or airplane in Southwest if they need to go a long way. The town of Bethel is a place where big boats will come from the ocean. When they get to Bethel their cargo is moved onto smaller boats that go up the rivers. There are many airports as well. Some of them are big enough that big jets can land there, but a lot of them are small. Snowmachines, also called Snowmobiles are used here a lot in the winter. When the rivers are frozen people use them like a road to drive to another town."
Deanna Durbin
"Edna Mae Durbin, known as Deanna Durbin (December 4, 1921 – April 17, 2013), was a Canadian actress and singer. She was in a number of musical movies in the 1930s and 1940s, singing standards and operatic arias. Her first movie was in 1936 with Judy Garland in ""Every Sunday"". She was born in Manitoba, Canada, 4 December 1921 but has lived near Paris since she married Charles David in 1950. Durbin's death was announced on April 30, 2013 in Paris, France from unknown causes, aged 91. According to her social security numbers, Durbin died on April 17."
Colony collapse disorder
"Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is an occurrence where worker bees from a beehive abruptly disappear. The exact cause of colony collapse disorder is unknown. However, chemicals, parasites, and ""Varroa"" mites have been proposed as factors contributing to colony collapse disorder."
"Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority issued a declaration that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honeybees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led one of the key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling said that the decision ""begs the question of what was going on when these chemicals were first approved."" The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was ""ready to work with"" the EC and member states."
Jaime Pressly
"Jaime Pressly is an American model and actress. She played Joy Turner in NBC's sitcom ""My Name is Earl"". She has also starred in numerous motion pictures. The actress was born July 30, 1977, Kinston, North Carolina."

"Boris Karloff along with Bela Lugosi and silent movie actor Lon Chaney, where the firsts actor to play evil roles in movie, undoubtedly his most memorable role is that of the monster in ""Frankenstein"" (1931), a masterpiece of horror movie that was directed by James Whale."
"In 1932 he starred his second horror movie ""Behind the Mask"" (1932), as Jim Henderson. That same year he obtained a role in ""Scarface"", with Paul Muni."
Blasphemy
"Blasphemy is a word that means ""speaking badly about a religion"", or ""insulting a god"". Some religions see blasphemy as a religious crime. Many countries witha state religion have laws that make blasphemy a crime. For example, blasphemy can be punished with the death penalty in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. In other countries, the punishment for the crime is a fine, or imprisonment."
"Some countries do not have laws against blasphemy. For example, after the French Revolution, France made blasphemy legal to make sure people would have freedom of religion and the freedom of the press."
"The United States, Canada, and many European countries, have laws to protect people who speak badly about religion. Sometimes people do this in a satirical way, like with a movie that makes fun of a religion. In these countries, profanity is often protected by freedom of speech as well."
Brie
"Brie is a type of soft cheese with a yellowish interior and a white layer (the ""rind"") on the outside of the cheese. The rind is eaten as well as the inside of this cheese. Like other cheeses, Brie is a dairy product made from cows' milk. Brie cheese may be served with fruit as a dessert at the end of a meal, or with a relish."
"The cheese is sometimes served slightly melted or baked, in a round, lidded ceramic dish, and topped with nuts or fruit, or both."
How it is made.
"Brie is a French cheese, and protected by AOC (""Appellation d'origine contrôlée""). This means only this cheese from this region (near Paris) can properly call itself ""brie"". This is ignored by some countries outside Europe, but the system of AOC is used in the wine business, so many parts of the world do honour it, and have similar arrangements."
"The milk of soft cheeses (""à pate molle"" in French) is not heated during the production of the cheese. Talleyrand said about this kind of cheese that it was the ""king of cheeses"". He said that in the 19th century. This kind of cheese has been made for at least 1000 years."
"In Europe this cheese is usually not treated chemically, so it might change in consistency or color. It will go bad if it is not kept cool. If that means it is kept in a refrigerator, note that it should not be eaten that cold. It is best eaten when it is somewhat below normal room temperature. In most countries, brie-style cheeses are made with Pasteurized milk."
"Brie can be aged, that is, carefully treated for up to a year. Then it has a darker colour and a stronger taste. This is rarely seen outside of France."
Types of Brie.
The following kinds of Brie exist:
"Other French ""Bries"" are:"
Bries from outside France:
Brie de Meaux.
"Cheeses are made into round loaves, of about 36 cm in diameter. The cheeses then weight about 2.5 kilograms. It is best tasted from April to October, after a ripening period of 8 to 10 weeks. About 2% of the production occurs on farms."
Brie de Melun.
"The Brie de Melun is smaller than the Brie de Meaux, but more salt is added to it. The ripening period is 10 weeks. It is best consumed April to September, but it can be found March to November, in some locations. About 5% of production occurs on farms."
What Brie should look like.
"When people buy Brie, they should make sure that it has the following traits:"
Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord
"Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (February 2, 1754 - May 17, 1838) was a French diplomat."
"He was a bishop and worked successfully for Louis XVI. He changed sides and served the French Revolution and Napoleon I. When Napoleon started losing his wars, Talleyrand changed sides again and served Louis XVIII. He represented France at the Congress of Vienna. He changed sides once more and served Louis Philippe I. Since the beginning of the 19th century he was known simply as ""Talleyrand"". He is widely seen as one of the most pragmatic and influential diplomats in European history. He was known to accept bribes from other European powers, especially while he served under Napoleon."
Pasteurization
Pasteurization (or pasteurisation) is a process of heat processing a liquid or a food to kill pathogenic bacteria to make the food safe to eat and to preserve longer. It involves heating the food to kill most harmful microorganisms. Producers pasteurize dairy and other foods to make them safe to eat. The process is named after Louis Pasteur. He was the first person to learn how to do it successfully. The first pasteurization was done by Louis Pasteur and Claude Bernard on 20 April 1862.
"Unlike sterilization, pasteurization is not intended to kill all microorganisms in the food. Instead, pasteurization gets a ""log reduction"" in the number of microorganisms. It brings their number down so they are unlikely to cause disease if the product is kept in the refrigerator and consumed before its sell-by date. Commercial sterilization of food is not common, because it tends to destroy the flavour of the food."
"The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (or ACTA) is an international treaty that wants to make it easier to fight product piracy to protect intellectual property. This includes fighting counterfeits and copyright infringement, and imposing stricter regulations on generic drugs. ACTA is based on an earlier agreement called TRIPS."
Japan is the only country that has ratified this. European Union also has signed it but many people in Europe is against the Agreement because it can violate human rights especially the freedom of expression and privacy.
Earnest Byner
"Earnest Alexander Byner (born September 15, 1962) is an American football coach and former running back. He is famous for one well known mistake while playing with the Cleveland Browns. While playing against the Denver Broncos in a 1986 playoff game, Byner fumbled at the Denver one yard line, which led to a Broncos victory. The play was called ""The Fumble."" Byner immediately became an assistant coach after his playing days were over."
Generic drug
"A generic drug is a drug that uses the same active ingredients than another drug, which is already on the market. This second drug often uses a brand name. The German company Bayer developed an analgesic based on acetylsalicylic acid in the late 19th century. It marketed the drug as ""Aspirin"". The drug is no longer under copyright, and anyone can produce a drug with the same active substances, but they may not call that drug Aspirin, because that is a trade name. Very often, such drugs are marketed with the name of the main active substance, and the name of the company producing the drug. In most cases generic drugs are cheaper to buy than the branded alternatives."
Super Bowl XXV
Super Bowl XXV was the 25th Super Bowl played. It was between the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. New York beat Buffalo 20-19. Scott Norwood's last second field goal to win for the Bills went wide right. This started a four-game super Bowl-losing streak for the Bills. The game was played at Tampa Stadium.
Electrical conduit
"Conduit is a tube that electrical wires are run through. Conduit protects the wire from damage. The most common type of conduit is called electrical metallic tubing (EMT). Conduit is common in commercial and industrial installations, and in garages and unfinished basements in homes. General wiring in homes is usually done with NM cable (commonly referred to by the trade name Romex), not conduit. Conduit is usually made of metal, but it can also be made of plastic."
Víctor Casadesús
"Víctor Manuel Casadesús Castaño, usually just called Víctor (born 28 February 1985 in Palma, Majorca, Balearic Islands), is a Spanish footballer. He plays for RCD Mallorca as a forward."
International career.
Víctor played for Spain at the 2004 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. He scored for Spain in the 2–2 semifinal draw (which they won in a penalty shootout) over Ukraine. He eventually got into the U-21s.
GPGPU
GPGPU refers to using a Graphics Processing Unit to perform tasks normally done by a central processing unit.
"GPUs are stronger than CPUs of the same price, but are normally restricted to tasks involving graphics, like playing videos and rendering graphics in video games."
Lee Unkrich

History.
Early history (1502–1658).
"The island was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese admiral João da Nova, and he named it ""Santa Helena"" after Helena of Constantinople. The traditional date of this discovery was long thought to be 21 May, but the results of an investigation into the discovery published in 2015 concluded this date is probably wrong, the 3 May seeming to be historically more valid. Another theory holds that the island found by De Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships under the command of Estêvão da Gama on 30 July 1503."
"The Portuguese found the island uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock, fruit trees and vegetables, and built a chapel and one or two houses. Though they formed no permanent settlement, the island was, for ships travelling from Asia to Europe, an important place to stop to get food and water, and frequently sick sailors were left on the island to recover. After 1588, the island was visited also by Dutch and English ships."
"The Dutch Republic formally made claim to St Helena in 1633, although there is no evidence that they ever occupied, colonised or fortified it. By 1651, the Dutch had mainly abandoned the island in favour of their colony at the Cape of Good Hope."
East India Company (1658–1815).
"In 1657, the English East India Company was given a permit to govern St Helena by Oliver Cromwell, and the following year the Company decided to colonise the island with farmers. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, got there in 1659, and made St Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. A fort was completed and a number of houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a Royal permit to start a colony in the island. The fort was named ""James Fort"" and the town ""Jamestown"", in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II of England."
"The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792 and Chinese workers were brought to work in the farms. Many were allowed to stay, and their descendents became integrated into the population."
British rule (1815–1821) and Napoleon's exile.
"In 1815, the British government decided to use the island of St. Helena as a place of detention for Napoleon Bonaparte. To prevent any attempt to escape from the nearby islands, they formally annexed the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. In 1821, Napoleon died on the island of St Helena."
"In 1858, the French emperor Napoleon III got the possession, in the name of the French government, of Longwood House and the lands around it, last residence of Napoleon I (who died there in 1821). It is still French property."

Münchausen syndrome
"Münchausen Syndrome (pronounced ""MUNCH-house-in"") is a mental illness in which a person repeatedly fakes disease, illness, or psychological trauma to get attention or sympathy from others. It is sometimes called hospital addiction syndrome, thick chart syndrome, or hospital hopper syndrome."
"A related mental illness is Münchausen Syndrome by proxy. People with this condition abuse another person, usually a child, in order to get sympathy or attention for themselves. For example, a parent might make their own child sick in order to get attention and sympathy from friends and medical professionals."
Symptoms.
"People with Münchausen Syndrome exaggerate or create symptoms of mental or physical illness. Some people with Münchausen make up detailed stories about medical problems they have had, or they may fake symptoms. However, others may harm themselves in many different ways in order to make it seem like they are sick. For example, they might take laxatives to make it seem like they have diarrhea, or take blood-thinning medications to cause bleeding. They might inject themselves with bacteria so that they get an infection. They might cut or burn themselves in order to create wounds. Sometimes, after getting medical treatment, people with Münchausen also do things to slow down or prevent their recovery - for example, by ripping out stitches."
"The goal of this behavior is to get treatment, attention, sympathy, and comfort from medical professionals. For a person with Münchausen, being a patient feels familiar and comfortable. This meets a deep psychological need that the person has."

After the breakup he always said she was weeping there for creating the term of ""Weeping Woman"". Pablo Picasso used his skill for geometric shapes and design in the painting. You can see multiple dimensions in this picture. Made in 1937 it shows how old Pablo Picasso would be now, though also how experienced he was then, being born in 1881. The level of experience it would take to be capable of such a level of geometric art work is surprisingly high considering there have been so many artists over the eras who have mastered it."

"He was soon sent to North America to fight in the Revolutionary War. He fought in the Brooklyn in August 1776, as well as at Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth Court House before finally being taken prisoner at the final Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Between 1790 and 1798, he represented Ballynakill in the Irish House of Commons. Then he sat for Maryborough until 1800."
"He served in England and Ireland when they were threatened by French invasion and against the French on the Continent. He went on to serve in Holland, Egypt and eventually became Governor-General of Jamaica (1806–1808) where he possibly sired an ancestor of Colin Powell."
Scandal and death.
"Sir Eyre was removed from the service on the 21 May 1816 because of the scandal he caused in the Christ's Hospital school for boys. On 25 November 1815 he entered the school and offered some boys money for an opportunity to flog them. After that he asked them to flog him and gave them money. He was caught by the school nurse, and charged with indecent conduct before the Lord Mayor of London. He was acquitted after giving £1000 to the school: after that there was a military inquiry in April 1816 which stripped him of his rank and honours.

Tree frog
Tree frogs are frogs that spend most of their life in trees.
"There are several lines of Neobatrachia which have evolved into tree frogs. These groups are only distantly related, but they have evolved for a long time in similar conditions. The result is that now there are species from different groups which look very much like each other. This is convergent evolution. It goes so far that in almost all cases, where one group occurs, another does not. Their current distribution shows that the last common ancestor of the groups lived before the dinosaurs disappeared."
"The frogs do not normally come down to the ground, except to mate and spawn. Some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees as adults. In some species the eggs develop directly into adults; in others the tadpole stage is spent in the water pool of a large tropical tree leaf."
"Many tree frogs can change their colour for better camouflage. Others are poisonous (poison dart frog), and display warning colouration."

This thriller got negative reviews from the critics."
Crop (anatomy)
"A crop (sometimes called a croup or craw) is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary canal used for storing food before digestion. It is found in many animals. It occurs in birds, some dinosaurs, and invertebrate animals such as gastropods (snails and slugs), earthworms, leeches, and insects."
Birds.
"In a bird's digestive system, the crop is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. It is a part of the digestive tract, essentially an enlarged part of the oesophagus. As with most other organisms that have a crop, the crop is used to temporarily store food. Not all birds have a crop. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds."
"Scavenging birds, such as vultures, will gorge themselves when prey is abundant, causing their crop to bulge. They subsequently sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food."
"Most raptors, including hawks, eagles and vultures (as stated above), have a crop; however, owls do not."
Bees.
"Cropping is used by bees to temporarily store nectar of flowers. When bees ""suck"" nectar, it is stored in their crops."
Difference to gizzard.
"In a gizzard, the food is ground down before digestion, usually by stones. Gizzards have a tougher lining, and muscles. The gizzard is lower down the digestive tract, and more like a part of the stomach."
"The crop is just a storage device. Often, it pays a bird to feed while the going is good, and do the digestion later. In many birds and in bees, the food is eventually brought back to the nest and given to family members."
"In other species, food brought back to the nest is pre-digested. That would mean it is regurgitated (brought up) from the stomach."
Dassault Rafale
The Dassault Rafale is a fighter aircraft made by French airplane company Dassault Aviation. The prototype first flew in 1986 but was introduced in 2001 by the Marine Nationale. Rafale was introduced in Armée de l'Air in 2006.
"Disgust is an emotion. People feel it when they see, touch, hear, or taste something that they think is nasty or repulsive. It is also caused by scorn. For example, when one finds something dirty or not fit to eat. Levels of disgust vary based on cultural, religious, and personal backgrounds/experiences. Disgust can be deliberate as someone can do something on purpose to create this emotion."
Oven
"Ovens are closed, heated containers which are used for heating, baking, and drying. It is used the most often in cooking and pottery. They provide even, dry heat to all surfaces of food inside them. An indoor oven can have an electric heating element, or be fired by natural gas or coal. Outdoor ovens are often made of brick or clay and are buried in hot coals. An oven which is used for making pottery is called a kiln. An oven used for heating or industrial processes is called a furnace. They are hot inside, and often things come out of them hot."
History.
The people in the settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization were the first to have an oven inside of their mud-brick houses by 3200 B.C.
People who study the history of food give credit to the Greeks for making the baking of bread into an art. A type of oven called Front-loaded bread ovens were created in ancient Greece.
Pot
"A cooking pot is a vessel to cook in. It is often larger than a pan, and will be taller than it is wide."
"Pots are used for boiling liquids, like soups or stew."
Liquid
"A liquid is a form of matter. It is settled between solid and gas. Liquid has an almost-fixed volume, but no set shape."
"Every small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing. Because of that, gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container. The molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves."
Fluids that flow slowly have a high viscosity. Some fluids like tar have such a high viscosity that they may seem solid.
"It is difficult to compress a liquid. If a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature, it will become a solid. This temperature is called the melting point or freezing point and is different for every different type of liquid. If a liquid is heated up it becomes a gas. The temperature this happens at is called the boiling point."
"Examples of liquid are water, oils and blood."
"In a liquid, the liquid on the top presses down on the liquid underneath, so at the bottom the pressure, ""p"", is bigger than at the top. The equation for working this out is:"
"where ""z"" is the depth of the point below the surface and ""g"" is how strong gravity is pulling on the liquid. ""ρ"" is a number that tells us how heavy a set amount of the liquid is. We call this the density and it is different for all liquids."

White
"White is the brightest color. White light can be made by putting all the other colors of light on the spectrum together. These other colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet."
Meaning of white.
"White is linked with light, goodness, innocence, purity, cleanliness and virginity. It is sometimes thought to be the color of perfection. The opposite of black, white usually has a positive connotation. White can stand for a successful beginning. In heraldry, white depicts faith and purity."
"In advertising, white is linked with coolness and cleanliness because it is the color of snow. You can use white to show simplicity in high-tech products. White is an appropriate color for charitable organizations; angels are usually imagined wearing white clothes. White is associated with hospitals, doctors, and cleanliness, so you can use white to show safety when promoting medical products. White is often linked with low weight, low-fat food, and dairy products."

1500
Year 1500 (MD) was a leap year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. The year 1500 wasn't a leap year in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.
"The year was seen as being especially important by many Christians in Europe, who thought it would bring the beginning of the end of the world. Their belief was based on the phrase ""half-time after the time"", when the apocalypse was due to occur, which appears in the Book of Revelation and was seen as referring to 1500. This time was also just after the Old World's discovery of the Americas in 1492, and therefore was influenced greatly by the New World.[1]"
"Historically, the year 1500 is also often identified, somewhat arbitrarily, as marking the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Early Modern Era."
"The end of this year marked the halfway point of the 2nd millennium, as there were 500 years before it and 500 years after it."

Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park
"Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a national park in the U.S. state and island of Hawaii. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park was created in 1916. It includes The Mauna Loa, which is the Earth's biggest volcano, and Kilauea, the Earth's most active volcano."
"The park shows the results of millions of years of volcanism, and evolution. These processes produce bare land from the sea, and with complex and unique ecosystems, a distinct Ancient Hawaiian culture. Kīlauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa is the biggest, it offers scientists with insights on the birth of the Hawaiian Islands, and can give visitors views of the dramatic volcanic landscapes."
"In recognition of its outstanding natural values, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has been designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987."
Recent events.
"On March 19, 2008, there was a small explosion in Halemaumau crater, the first explosive event since 1924 and the first eruption in the Kīlauea caldera since September 1982."
"Debris from the explosion was scattered over an area of . A small amount of ash was also reported at a nearby community. The explosion covered part of Crater Rim Drive and damaged Halemaumau overlook. The explosion did not release any lava, which suggests to scientists that it was driven by hydrothermal or gas sources."
"This explosion event followed the opening of a major sulfur dioxide gas vent, greatly increasing levels emitted from the Halemaumau crater."
"In 2008, Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park and Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes became sister parks."

"According to Vic Fuentes, ""the theme to the album artwork is 'jumping off of the ground that is breaking beneath you'. The idea is to inspire hope amongst the chaos that may be happening around you. If the ground was breaking beneath your feet, your first reaction may be to run and jump to safety, and it's that moment where you are suspended in the air that I am focusing on. A still frame where you're not sure if the person is falling or flying. It's about freeing yourself from the things that are breaking or falling apart in your life, and inspiring a sense of hope from the desperation""."

Cosmopolitan distribution
In biology an organism is said to be cosmopolitan (or cosmopolite) if it can be found almost anywhere on the Earth.
Examples include:
Bengalis
"The Bengali people are the main ethnic group in the region of Bengal (now divided between Bangladesh and the Republic of India) in South Asia. They speak Bengali (বাংলা Bangla), a language of the eastern branch of the Indo-Aryan languages."
"They are natively concentrated in the nation of Bangladesh and in the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura. Some of the most well established Bengali communities are in the Middle East, Japan, Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States."
"Remnants of civilisation in the greater Bengal region date back 4,000 years, when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic peoples. The origin of the word ""Bangla ~ Bengal"" is unknown, but it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe ""Bang"" that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC."
"After the arrival of Indo-Aryans, the kingdoms around Bengal were first described in the ""Atharvaveda"" about 1000 BC. From the 6th century BC, Magadha expanded to include most of the Bihar and Bengal regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of Buddha. Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of Persia and Afghanistan, reaching its greatest extent under the Buddhist emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named Gangaridai by the Greeks around 100 BC. The word is speculated to have come from ""Gangahrd"" (Land with the Ganges in its heart) in reference to an area in Bengal. Later from the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire."
Baloch people
"The Baloch (بلوچ) are an Iranian ethnic group who live in the region of Balochistan which includes parts of southeastern Iran, southern Afghanistan, and southwestern Pakistan."
"The Baloch speak the Balochi language, an Iranian language. They mainly live in mountainous places of the Iranian plateau in Iran, Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan. Balochistan is a mountainous region inhabited by the Baloch people."
Iranian plateau
"The Iranian plateau, also known as the Persian plateau is a geological formation in Southwest Asia, Southern Asia and the Caucasus region. As a historical region, it includes Parthia, Media and eastern Persia, the heartlands of Greater Persia (mainly Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan west of the River Indus)."
Punjabis
"The Punjabi people (, ਪੰਜਾਬੀ Panjābī people) are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group native to the Punjab region in northwestern South Asia (Pakistan and India). They come from the Punjab region, which has been home to some of the oldest civilizations in the world including one of the world's first and oldest civilizations, the Indus Valley Civilization. The Punjabi identity is usually cultural and linguistic, with Punjabis being those whose first language is Punjabi, an Indo-European language."
Treeshrew
A treeshrew is a small mammal in the order Scandentia.
They live in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. They make up the families Tupaiidae and Ptilocercidae. There are 20 species in five genera.
"Although called treeshrews, they are not true shrews, and are not all arboreal. Among other things, they eat ""Rafflesia"" fruit. They used to be classified in the Insectivora."

IPod
"The iPod is a range of portable music players designed by the company Apple Inc. in California. The iPod comes with computer cables so that the user can put music from their computer onto the iPod, and play music from it using headphones. Newer iPods allow a user to play games, view pictures, watch videos and use the internet, too."
"The first iPod was named the iPod Classic. This iPod was released on October 23, 2001. Apple Inc. made the iPod like this until September 9, 2014."
"Apple made a smaller iPod called the iPod mini. It was much smaller than the iPod Classic, but did not hold as many songs. It used flash memory, a special kind of memory for very small electronics, instead of a hard drive. It was replaced by a version of the iPod called the iPod nano."
"Another type of iPod, called the iPod shuffle, was very small, and it used flash memory, like the iPod mini but it had no screen. It was the least expensive iPod."
"The most expensive iPod is called the iPod touch. It has a touch screen, like the iPhone. It's very similar to the IPhone, but it's not a smartphone. The first generation of iPod touch was released on September 5, 2007 and was discontinued on May 10, 2022."
"iPods often contain songs downloaded from an online music store, using a program called iTunes. (The name of Apple's music and video store is the iTunes Store.) Songs are sold in AAC file format, not MP3 or WMA. These are popular formats for compressing (making smaller) music until it does not take up much space and can easily be put on a media player such as the iPod."
"The App Store is an online shop that is run by Apple Inc. where people can buy software for their iPhone or iPod Touch. It opened on July 11, 2008. Over 2 million applications (or apps for short) are available for people to buy. Some apps are available for free."

"5,094,118 people live in Costa Rica. The capital city is San José. The current President is Carlos Alvarado Quesada. He was elected in 2018"
History.
Pre-Columbian period.
The indigenous people of Costa Rica belong to the Intermediate Area. This Intermediate Area is where the Mesoamerican and Andean indigenous cultures mixed together. The country was influenced by various Chibcha speaking indigenous people.
The impact of indigenous peoples' culture on modern Costa Rica has been small. The country did not have a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the indigenous population was absorbed into the Spanish colony. There are still some small indigenous groups. The largest is the Bribri and Boruca tribes in south Costa Rica.
Spanish colonization.
Christopher Columbus sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his last trip in 1502. He reported large amounts of gold jewelry among the indigenous people.
"During the colonial period, Costa Rica was the most southern province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. But it mostly ruled itself as a part of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition to trade with the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and the lack of gold and silver made Costa Rica into a poor, little populated region of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica was called ""the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America"" by a Spanish governor in 1719."
"Costa Rica's poverty was also because there were not enough indigenous people available for slavery. Most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land. There were no large ""haciendas"" (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was unappreciated and forgotten by the Spanish Crown. It had to develop on its own."
"Costa Rica became a ""rural democracy"" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a better climate."
Independence.
"Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On September 15, 1821, after the last Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence (1810–21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica."
"Costa Rica joined the First Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide. After its collapse in 1823, Costa Rica became a province of the new Federal Republic of Central America. it existed from 1823 to 1839. It had a very loose authority over its provinces, especially the poor and remote Costa Rica."
"In 1824, the Costa Rican capital was moved to San José. This led to a brief battle with the old capital, Cartago."
"While civil wars were common in the Federal Republic of Central America, Costa Rica was largely peaceful."
"In 1838, Costa Rica formally proclaimed itself an independent country. The local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become politically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration."
Wheezing is caused by the airways being too narrow. This can happen because of diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
"If the airways are too narrow, the oxygen the body needs cannot get through. This can become a medical emergency."
There are a few different treatments that can be used for wheezing:
Stridor.
"Stridor is a high-pitched sound that usually happens when a person breathes in. It may sound a lot like wheezing. Medical professionals can tell the difference by listening to the throat with a stethoscope. If the sound they hear is louder in the throat, it is stridor, not wheezing."
Stridor is usually caused by something blocking the larynx (voice box). This can happen because:
"Like wheezing, stridor can signal a medical emergency if not enough oxygen is able to get through the airways."
Treatment for stridor depends on the cause:
Children are more likely to have stridor because of choking. They are more likely to choke because their airways are smaller. They are also more likely to get childhood infections like croup or epiglottitis that can cause stridor.
Rales (fine crackles).
"Rales are also called fine crackles, because they often sound like a fine crackling noise. They are heard when a person breathes in, on both sides (in both lungs). Rales may also sound like bubbling, rattling, or small clicking sounds."
"Rales are heard when a person has fluid in their lungs. This is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema may happen for many reasons, like:"
"Rales signals pulmonary edema, no matter what is causing that pulmonary edema. When a medical professional listens to the lungs, rales usually start at the bottom of the lungs. As the pulmonary edema gets worse and fluid fills the lungs more, rales can be heard closer and closer to the top of the lungs."
Rhonchi (coarse crackles).
"Rhonchi are also called coarse crackles, because they sound like coarse, rattling, crackling sounds. Rhonchi and rales can sound a lot alike. The main differences are:"
"Rhonchi are usually caused by mucus in the bronchi, the tubes that lead to the lungs. For example, if a person has pneumonia, mucus can build up in their bronchi and the bronchi's airways, and cause rhonchi."
Unequal breath sounds.
"In a healthy person, breath sounds should always sound the same on both sides. This signals that both lungs are working well. If breath sounds cannot be heard in one lung, this can signal a serious problem. It means that air is not getting in and out of that lung."
One of the most common causes of unequal breath sounds is a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). A lung can collapse for many different reasons:
A pneumothorax is often a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital.
Conversation Peace
"Conversation Peace is the 22nd album released by American musician Stevie Wonder. It was released on the Motown label in 1995. The album was Wonder's first studio album since 1987's ""Characters"". The album was going to be released in 1993, which was the last year new jack swing was popular, but Wonder continued to work on the album through to 1995 and the album wasn't contemporary enough to get radio airplay. It had three singles, ""For Your Love"", ""Tomorrow Robins Will Sing"" and ""Treat Myself""."

Ridley led an attack on Samus's home planet of K-2L which destroyed the world and killed her parents. Ridley appears in his metal form in ""Metroid Prime"" and """"."
Reception.
"Ridley has received a positive critical response from fans and video game publications. Nintendo Power ranked Ridley at #6 on their list of favorite Nintendo villains. Jesse Schedeen of IGN called Ridley the real villain of the ""Metroid"" series, saying that they would have to include him in a ""Metroid"" movie because he would be too important to leave out."
"On January 18, 2017, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at Houston Methodist Hospital, where he was sedated for a procedure to treat an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia."
"On April 22, 2018, after the burial of Bush's wife Barbara, he was hospitalized for sepsis and was placed under intensive care."
Death.
"Bush died on November 30, 2018 at his home in Houston from Parkinson's-related complications, aged 94. A state funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral."
"Tributes and condolences were offered by former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, and then-current President Donald Trump. He lied in state in the United States Capitol and was buried next to his wife at the George Bush Presidential Library."
Other names.

"In 1990, President of the United States, George H. W. Bush, made a casual remark about broccoli (a vegetable), and said he would never eat it."
"The President made this comment in 1990, shortly after a journalist from the U.S. News &amp; World Report broke the story that Bush banned the vegetable from Air Force One. George S. Dunlop, President of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, gave First Lady Barbara Bush a bouquet of the vegetable an additional 10 tons in trucks."
"A few days afterwards, Bush hosted a state dinner to honor Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Prime Minister of Poland, and journalists noted there was no broccoli on the menu, as most of the 10 tons of broccoli given to the President's family by the farmers had been donated to the Capital Area Food Bank."

Economy.
"For many years, industry and manufacturing was the biggest part of Ohio's economy. Youngstown was a big steel producer, as was Cleveland. Other manufacturing - including the car industry - was a major factor across the state. Since the 1970s, industry has shrank in Ohio, but it is still a big part of the local economy. Today, other businesses are more prominent. Cleveland is one of the biggest hubs for Healthcare, and its main hospital, the famous Cleveland Clinic, is the largest employer in the region. Banking is also a major business, and foods and retail are too. Cincinnati plays host to the headquarters of Fifth Third Bank, Cintas, Kroger, Luxottica, Procter &amp; Gamble and Macy's, whereas, Columbus hosts the headquarters of LBrands, JPMorgan Chase, Huntington Bank, Rogue Fitness, Wendy's, Big Lots, Cardinal Health and Nationwide Insurance.

Transsexual
Transsexual people are people who change their appearance to more closely resemble that of the opposite sex. Transsexuals may be male or female. They typically take hormones and often undergo surgeries to support this process. They usually adopt a new name and may legally have their name changed.
People who go from male to female (MTF) are referred to as transsexual women. People who go from female to male (FTM) are referred to as transsexual men.
Ways to go from male to female.
"Transsexual women take female hormones. They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called androgens. Taking estrogen pills makes breasts grow. It does not make beards go away. It does not make voices higher. Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back. This takes a long time and hurts. Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices. Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery. Some transsexual women also get surgery on their genitals. This is called a vaginoplasty. This is done by making a vagina from the skin of their penis, which is turned inside out. Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine. Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger."
Ways to go from female to male.
Transsexual men take male hormones. This will make their voices lower. It will make a beard grow. It can also stop their menstruation. Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones.
"Some transsexual men have surgery. One surgery is removal of breasts (mastectomy). Some transsexual men also get surgery on their genitals. One surgery is removal of the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy). Some may also get surgery on their outside genitals. One way takes their skin and tissue and makes it into a penis (phalloplasty). Another way takes the clitoris (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is (metoidioplasty). The place where urine comes out (urethra) can be run through the new penis. The phalloplasty looks more like a penis. A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long. Some ways also make a scrotum from the labia. They may also have the vagina taken out or closed."
Detransitioning.
"Very rarely, some people (called ""detransitioners"") who have changed sex decide this was a mistake and return to living as members of the sex in which they were born."

Results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries
"This article will show the current results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The Democratic Party presidential primary is a process of choosing delegates, or people that represent someone, to go to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. People in each state will vote on who they think will be good for the presidency, and each candidate gets a certain amount of delegates based on the number of votes they receive."
The primaries began on 1 February 2016 in Iowa. The remaining candidates are former first lady and secretary of state and senator Hillary Clinton and senator Bernie Sanders.
"On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press reported that senator Hillary Clinton has gotten enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. However, their count includes some superdelegates. Since superdelegates can vote however they want at the Democratic convention, their votes could change at any time before then, so it is possible (but only remotely possible) that Clinton will not get the nomination. Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton on 12 July 2016."
Results.

Simple Network Management Protocol
"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a part of the Internet Protocol Suite. SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems. It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an Application Layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects."
"SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications. It is a standard for managing devices such as routers,switches,servers etc."
Overview and basic concepts.
"In common SNMP usage, there are a number of systems to be managed, and one or more systems managing them. A software component called an ""agent"" (see below) runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems."
"SNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables (such as ""free memory"", ""system name"", ""number of running processes"", ""default route""). But the protocol also allows active management tasks, such as modifying and applying a new configuration."
"The managing system can retrieve the information through the GET, GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations. Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system. Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network. The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly."

Carolina parakeet
The Carolina parakeet is an extinct species of parrot.
"It was the last parrot type to have lived before the European conquest in the eastern United States. It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in old woods along rivers."
"The last wild Carolina parakeet was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1904, and the last bird kept by people died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. This was the male bird called ""Incas"", who died within a year of his mate ""Lady Jane"". It was not until 1939, however, that it was agreed that all the Carolina parakeets had died."
"At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets looking like this sort of bird were seen and recorded on videotape in the Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia. However, the American Ornithologists Union thought that they had probably recorded escaped pets. Additional sightings were recorded in Okeechobee County in Florida until the end of the 1920s."
Reasons for extinction.
"The Carolina parakeet died out for a number of reasons. To make space for more farms, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its living space. The colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats, and the birds were kept as pets. Even though the birds were bred easily in captivity, little was done to make sure enough birds were bred to avoid their dying out. Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers thought they were pests."
"Another reason that led to their extinction was that, unfortunately, they liked to return in large flocks to places where some of them had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock."

Then the contestant and the six celebrities would write their answer to the question on a piece of paper. Then after the contestant and the celebrities got done with their answer, Gene would ask for the contestant's answer. They would tell it to him. Then he would ask the celebrities for their answers. If the contestant's and a celebrity's answer are the same the contestant would get a point, and a green triangle would light up."
"Then the defending contestant would take the remaining question. Then the process was the same as above, except red circles lit up."
Whoever had the most points at after two rounds of the above procedures would win $100 and go on to the Big Money Super Match.
Big Money Super Match.
Audience Match.
"Before the game show, the audience would be surveyed. Their top 3 answers to the question (e.g. Road ___) would be worth (3rd most popular) $100, (2nd most popular) $250, and (most popular) $500. The contestant would pick 3 celebrities to give them answers they thought would be under the $500 slot. Then the contestant would choose one of those answers or make up their own. The answers were revealed one at a time."
Head-to-Head Match.
"If the contestant won the Audience Match, they would get a chance to win 10 times that money. They had to match a celebrity's answer exactly to questions like ____ Bee. At first, the contestant chose the celebrity they wanted to play with. In 1978, the Star Wheel was introduced. The contestant spun a wheel to determine which celebrity they would be playing with. If the wheel stopped on a gold star section, the money the contestant would be playing for was doubled."
Other versions.
"The first ""Match Game"" had different rules from this one and was shown on the NBC network starting in 1962 and ending in 1969. Then, this ""Match Game"" was introduced on the CBS network in 1973.

A second syndicated version with the same gameplay as ""Match Game PM"" started in 1979, and ended in 1982. In 1983, it was combined with another game show, ""Hollywood Squares"", to form the ""Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour"", which was on television for one year. Six years later, in 1990, it was brought back for the ABC network with a new host, Ross Shafer. In this version, contestants played for cash. It also featured a new round called the ""Match Up"" round. It was played at the end of both rounds. To start, a contestant chose one of the celebrities. The contestant had 30 seconds (45 in the second round) to match the celebrity in Super Match-style questions. Each question had two choices. Matches were worth $50 in the first round and $100 in the second. This version ended in 1991, but in 1998 it returned with Michael Burger as host. It featured five celebrities instead of six. This version was not very famous, however, and ended in 1999."

Backpacking (wilderness)
"Backpacking is hiking in the outdoors with a backpack full of all your food, clothing, water, and shelter. Usually, backpackers hike in groups to stay safer. They must think to bring first aid supplies, sleeping bags, tents, rain gear, stoves, food and other camping supplies."
"Backpacking may be done on short or long trips. Sometimes, backpacking groups begin at a trail head with a parking lot and hike over a weekend until they work their way back to the vehicle. On longer trips, groups may settle in at a base camp and hike for weeks or even months if they are more experienced and prepared."
"When following certain rules, backpackers have the chance to leave the outdoors better than they found them. There are certain practices such as Leave No Trace that teach backpackers and hikers to pack out all waste and help conserve nature in every way possible such as not building fires in dry areas, saving water, and protecting the environment. When backpackers use these skills, they help preserve nature while getting to explore themselves while outside the influence of the rest of the world."

"Shenton Way is a major road in Singapore. It is part of the Central Business District (CBD) area that is found at the south of Singapore. Together with Raffles Place, it forms part of Singapore's first CBD area. This road is a one way street that starts at the junction of Cross Street, Central Boulevard and Raffles Quay and ends at Keppel Road. The road was named after Sir Shenton Thomas, the Governor of Singapore in 1934–1946, to commemorate his decision to stay in the city during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore."
This road was officially opened in 1951 and became Singapore's version of Wall Street in the 1970s when many business started building their offices there.
Sylvia Likens
"Sylvia Likens (January 3, 1949 - October 26, 1965) was a 16-year-old murder victim from Indiana. She was tortured for three months by Gertrude Baniszewski (née Van Fossan), Gertrude's children, and other young people from their neighborhood, and eventually murdered on October 26, 1965. Her parents, carnival workers, had left Likens and her sister Jenny in the care of the Baniszewski family three months before her death in exchange for $20 a week. Baniszewski, two of her children, Paula and John, and two neighborhood youths, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs, were charged and convicted of the crime.

"The first period of Japan's history is its prehistory, before the written history of Japan. Archeologists have found pottery from that time. Japan’s Paleolithic era covers a period from around 100,000 BC to around 12,000 BC. Archeologists have found some polished tools made of stones. Some of them are kept in Tokyo National Museum. These tools are more than 32,000 years old."
Jomon Period.
"The Jomon period lasted for about 10,000 years, from 10,000 BC to around 300 BC. This was the Mesolithic era for Japan. Some scholars say that during this period, Neolithic culture also developed in Japan."
Archeologists have found several pieces of pottery of that time. Some are clay figures and some are vessels and potteries of different shapes.
Yayoi Period.
"The Yayoi period covered about 550 years, from around 300 BC till around 250. The period's name came from a location in Tokyo."
"By that time, Japanese people had learnt the cultivation of rice, and agriculture became the main part of the Japanese society. Because of this, differences in social status started to occur."
"Different clans controlled different areas and they also fought among themselves. Some Chinese texts tell about this time. These texts describe Japan as Wa. Later, the Yamatai came into being when about 30 smaller parts of Japan of that time united under a queen named Himiko."
Ancient and Classical Japan.
"The Ancient and Classical period covers about 900 years, beginning from the mid-3rd century till the end of the 12th century. Japanese history during this period may further be divided into several smaller periods. These are described below."
Kofun period.
"In the history of Japan, the period from the mid-3rd century until the mid-6th century is known as the Kofun period."
"Kofun is a large tomb made at this era, and people who had social power were buried. Buddhism had not reached Japan by this time. Many kofuns were made in many places. This fact lets us to know that many social groups all around the country made up an authority, and this leads to the Yamato dynasty."
"The Yamato dynasty started to have take more action against Korea and China. In the 4th century, they started to advance to Korea to get iron. By this, cultures and technologies of Korea and China started to be introduced to Japan. They also fought with Goguryeo and Silla, which are countries in Korea. In the 5th century, the five kings of Wa made effort to have relationship with China."
Asuka period.
The second period is called the Asuka period (mid-6th century till around 710). Asuka is the place where the base of Yamato dynasty took place. By this time Buddhism had reached Japan.
"From the end of the 6th century to the early 7th century, Empress Suiko and her nephew Prince Shotoku innovated the political system so that the emperor gets power. They also sent missions to the Sui dynasty."
"The trend of centralization still continues. In 645, the Taika Reforms takes place, and the political system changes a lot."
"In 663, the nation fights with the Tang dynasty and Silla (Battle of Baekgang), but loses."
"In 672, the Jinshin war occurs and Prince Ōama becomes the emperor (Emperor:Tenno天皇). In his era, Japan starts to make a Chinese style law system (Ritsuryo). Also, the word , which means ""Japan"" in Japanese, was started to be used in the era of Tenmu."
Nara Period.
"During this period, from the year 707, steps were taken to shift the capital to Heijō-kyō, a place near present-day Nara. This was completed in 710. A new city was built. The city was built to look like the Chinese capital city of that time. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was ruling China, and the capital was at Chang'an (now Xi'an)."
"During the Nara period, development was slow. The Emperor’s family members were always fighting for power with the Buddhists and other groups. At that time, Japan had friendly relations with Korea and China’s Tang Dynasty. The capital was shifted twice. In 784, the capital was moved to Nagaoka and in 794 to Kyoto."
Heian Period.
"The years from 794 to 1185 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Heian-kyō, which is the early name of present-day Kyoto. The Heian period produced many cultural achievements, such as the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu."
"The power of the Japanese imperial court (that is, the Emperor, his ministers and other important persons) rose. This period is also famous for its art, poetry and literature. Japanese culture also became Japanese way.The language used in this period was called Late Old Japanese. The writing systems known as Kana emerged at this time. By the end of this period (that is, by the end of the 12th century), a number of groups came into being. These groups were highly armed and they fought among themselves. The situation was like a civil war, that is, war among different sections of society. Finally, groups of people called Samurai led society under the political rule of a Shogun. The Heian Period ended due to the Genpei War."
Feudal Japan.
"The period from around the 12th century through the 19th century is called feudal period in the history of Japan. The Japanese Emperor was the head of the government, but he had no real power. Many powerful families (called daimyo and military groups called shogun) ruled Japan during this period. The feudal period of Japan is generally sub-divided into different periods named after the shogunate which ruled during that period."
Kamakura Period.
"The years 1185 to 1333 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Kamakura which was the center of power of the Kamakura shogunate. Minamoto no Yoritomo was the founder and first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate. The period is named after the government of Kamakura Shogunate. In this period, Mongols tried to invade Japan between the years 1272 and 1281. Japanese were successful at driving away the Mongols. But, this badly affected Japan. Shogunate also became weak and its rule ended in 1333. For a short time, Go Daigo became the emperor of Japan."
Muromachi Period.
The Muromachi Period began in 1336 and ended in 1573. Emperor Go-Daigo lost his throne. The government of the Ashikaga shogunate took control of most parts of Japan. This period ended in 1573. In that year the 15th and the last shogun named Ashikaga Yoshiaki was forced to leave the capital Kyōto.
"In general, the values for 5, 50, and 500 are not subtracted. Here is the same number using the subtraction rule:"
Special values.
Zero.
"The number zero does not have its own Roman numeral. At about 725, Bede or one of his colleagues used the letter N, the abbreviation (short form) of ""nihil"" (the Latin word for ""nothing"")."
Fractions.
"The Romans also used fractions. The most common base for fractions was 1/12, which in Latin is called ""uncia"" (ounce)."
Large numbers.
"A number of numeral systems are developed for large numbers that cannot be shown with , , , , , and ."
Apostrophus.
"One of the systems is the ""apostrophus"", in which D is written as IƆ (500) and M is written as CIƆ (1,000). In this system, an extra Ɔ means 500, and multiple extra Ɔs are used to mean 5,000, 50,000 etc."
Vinculum.
"Another system is the ""vinculum"", in which V, X, L, C, D and M are multiplied by 1,000 by adding an overline."
Map
"A map is an image of an area, usually of the Earth or part of the Earth. A map is different from an aerial photograph because it includes interpretation. Many maps are called ""charts"" such as star charts and nautical charts. Some maps are of distant worlds. Before the late 20th century almost all maps were on paper. Today, many maps are digital, and can be seen on smartphones and computers. However, paper maps are still used."
"The word ""map"" can also be used to talk about a chart or drawing that shows relationships between ideas, people, events, or anything else you can think about. This is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map."
People who make maps are cartographers.
Many maps today are made using GIS computer systems. These are database systems that are organized by location instead of named records.
"If a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen, it has to be projected. This is because the Earth is round and paper and screens are flat. There are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make map projections. The only kind of map of the Earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere. This is called a globe."
Globe
"A globe is a scale model with the shape of a sphere. Globes can be scale models of the Earth (""terrestrial globes"") or of other planets. Globes can also be models of the celestial sphere (""celestial globes""). The English word ""globe"" comes from the , meaning round mass or sphere."
Most globes are maps of the Earth. They have the advantage of avoiding the distortions of flat map projections. The most common types are political and physical. Political globes show countries. Physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers. Some globes are star charts and some are maps of distant worlds.
"Global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place on the Earth. It is also used in fields like computers to mean dealing with a whole larger system, rather than its individual little parts."
History.
"That the Earth is a sphere was established by Hellenistic astronomy in the 3rd century BC. The terrestrial globe appeared in that period. Now, there are no terrestrial globes from Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages in existence. The first example of terrestrial globe known was the one the ancient Greek Crates of Mallus made in the middle of the 2nd century BC. The Greek geographer Strabo wrote about Crates's terrestrial globe during the early years of the Roman Empire."
"A celestial globe from Classical Antiquity is in the Naples National Archaeological Museum, Italy. The globe is part of a sculpture – the globe is held up by a statue of Atlas, a Titan from Greek mythology. The ancient Romans made the globe and statue in the 2nd century AD. They may have copied the sculpture from Hellenistic art (art of the ancient Greek type) from the Hellenistic period (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries BC). The sculpture's name is the ""Farnese Atlas""."
"Early globes of the Earth that show all of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic Golden Age. One such example was made in the 9th century AD by Muslim geographers and cartographers working under the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun. Another example was the globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad-Din, in 1267."
"Martin Behaim designed a globe in 1492, in Nuremberg, Bavaria (Germany). Georg Glockendon was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim's specifications. This globe is the oldest terrestrial globe still in existence. A copy of the globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507. Another early globe, the Hunt-Lenox Globe, ca. 1507, is thought to be the source of the phrase ""Here be dragons"". Another ""remarkably modern-looking"" globe of the Earth was made in Constantinople (Istanbul) by Taqi al-Din at his Constantinople Observatory during the 1570s."
Manufacture.
"Mass-produced globes are typically covered by a printed paper map. The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper. These strips narrow to a point at the North Pole and the South Pole. Then a small disk is used to paper over the irregularities at the poles. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is needed to make the paper map fit the sphere."
"From a geometric point of view, all points on a sphere are the same. One could select any point on the planet, and create a paper map that covers the globe with strips that come together at that point and the opposite point."
"It also has been known as both a classic and a masterpiece, and has received a Special Edition 60th Anniversary Disney DVD on October 23, 2001, exatly 60 years after its first release. That release featured a sneak peek of a direct-to-video sequel called Dumbo II. The preview showed a lot of sketches and storyboard ideas. The main story has to do with Dumbo and his new friends getting separated from the rest of the circus as they wonder into the big city. Dumbo's new friends are Claude and Lolly the twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go, Dot the curious zebra, Godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself, and Penny the adventurous ostrich. Timothy returns as well. The story was supposed to be as if the first Dumbo ended and this one started the next day. The project seems to have been canceled,as no further announcements have been made since, plus the fact that The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, Tinker Bell, and its sequels, were to be the last projests for DisneyToon Studios."
The crow characters in the movie are often seen as African-American stereotypes.
"The leader crow voiced by Cliff Edwards was originally named ""Jim Crow"" for script purposes. The other crows are all voiced by African-American actors and singers, all members of the Hall Johnson Choir: Nick Stewart, James Baskett, Jim Carmichael and Hall Johnson. The late famous duo of African-American dancers Freddie and Eugene Jackson were invited and hired by Disney to work as live-action reference and models for the animators of the characters, like the chief-animator and Disney Legend Ward Kimball, improvising dances and movements then used in the iconic musical sequence ""When I See An Elephant Fly"". Despite suggestions of racism by writers like Richard Schickel, many historians, critics, writers, pundits and personalities such as John Grant, Leonard Maltin, John Canemaker, Floyd Norman, Eric Goldberg, Alex Wainer, Michael Wilmington, Whoopi Goldberg and Neal Gabler reject these claims. For instance, the crows are noted as forming the majority of the characters in the movie who are empathetic and sympathetic to Dumbo's plight (the others are Timothy Q. Mouse and Mrs Jumbo), they are free spirits who serve nobody, and intelligent characters aware of the power of self-confidence and of what means being ostracized and marginalized, unlike the Stepin Fetchit stereotype common at that time and in the previous decade. Furthermore, their song ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is more orientated to mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbo's large ears."
Media and marketing.
Dumbo's Circus.
"""Dumbo's Circus"" was a live-action puppet television programme for preschool audiences that aired on The Disney Channel in the 1980s. Unlike in the movie, Dumbo spoke on the show. Each character would perform a special act, which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes."
Theme parks.
"Dumbo the Flying Elephant is a popular ride that appears in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park (Paris), and Hong Kong Disneyland."
Video games.
"Dumbo appears as a hero in the game Kingdom Hearts. Sora, the main character, flies on him and Dumbo splashes enemies with water from his trunk."
Bertolt Brecht
(born ;* 10. February 1898 in Augsburg; † 14. August 1956 in Berlin) was a German poet and dramatist.
Life.
"Brecht went to school in Augsburg, where his father was the director of a paper factory."
He completed his degree in 1917.
"Afterwards he studied sciences, medicine and literature at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. He had to take a break in his studies because he had to join the army."
"In the 1920s, Brecht went to Berlin and became a part of the cultural scene. He met his second wife Helene Weigel in Berlin and married her, after divorcing his first wife. It was with his second wife that Brecht had another son."
In Berlin he met a lot of artists and intellectuals of the Weimar Republic.
"His works became very critical about the capitalistic society (e.g. ""Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny"" (1930)). Many of his friends were communists, but he never joined the KPD."
"His most famous work was from that time, the ""Dreigroschenoper""."
In 1933 the Nazis prohibited playing some of his works and arrested some of his friends.
"After the Reichstag fire, he travelled from Germany to Prague, Vienna, Switzerland and Denmark."
"For the next five years he lived in Denmark. In 1938 he wrote ""Das Leben des Galilei"" (The Life of Galilei) about Galileo Galilei, who was hunted by the Holy Inquisition because he wanted to tell the scientific truth."
When Germany occupied Denmark he had to flee once again.
"He went to Sweden, then to Finland and finally to Moscow in the Soviet Union."
Even under Stalin he was not safe. He therefore flew through China to the United States.
He lived and worked in California and translated a lot of text.
"In 1947, in the McCarthy era, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated him, because they suspected him of being a communist."
He gave a statement and said that he had never been a member of the communist party.
He then flew back to Switzerland - the only place he could go to at the time.
"In 1948 he was allowed to return to Berlin, East Berlin."
"The arrondissement of Belley is an arrondissement of France, in the Ain department, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. Its capital is the city of Belley."
History.
"When the Ain department was created on 1800, the ""arrondissement"" of Belley was part of that original department."
Geography.
"It is the southernmost of the ""arrondissements"" of the department with an area of . It has 98,110 inhabitants and a density of inhabitants/km²."
"The ""arrondissement"" of Belley is in the southeastern part of department and is bordered to the north by the ""arrondissement"" of Nantua, to the northeast by the Haute-Savoie department, to the east by the Savoie department, to the south by the Isère department and to the west by the ""arrondissement"" of Bourg-en-Bresse."
Composition.
Cantons.
"After the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the ""arrondissements"" so they could have ""communes"" that belong to different ""arrondissements""."
"In the ""arrondissement"" of Belley, there are 3 cantons whose ""communes"" are in the ""arrondissement"": Ambérieu-en-Bugey, Belley and Lagnieu. The canton of Bellegarde-sur-Valserine has 1 ""commune"" in Belley, 2 in the ""arrondissement"" of Gex and 11 in the ""arrondissement"" of Nantua, the canton of Hauteville-Lompnes has 29 ""communes"" in Belley and 12 in Nantua, and the canton of Lagnieu has 22 ""communes"" in Belley and 4 in the ""arrondissement"" of Bourg-en-Bresse."
Communes.
"The ""arrondissement"" of Belley has 115 ""communes""; they are (with their INSEE codes)ː"
"The ""communes"" with more inhabitants in the ""arrondissement"" are:"
Book of Enoch
"The Book of Enoch is a book claiming to be written by Enoch. He was the great-grandfather of Noah and son of Jared in the Bible. However, scholars consider it to be Pseudepigrapha. It is not part of the Bible canon and only the Ethiopian Orthodox Church says it is part of the Bible. The Book is an old Hebrew text, likely written in the 2nd century BC, and contains material on the origins of demons and giants, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why Noah's Flood was morally necessary, and a description of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. It is interesting to many Christians because the ninth verse of the first chapter is quoted in the Epistle of Jude 1:14-15."
Anton LaVey
"Anton Szandor LaVey (April 11, 1930 – October 29, 1997), born Howard Stanton Levey, was the founder of the Church of Satan. He created a religion called LaVeyan Satanism. He wrote several books describing his beliefs. His first book was called ""The Satanic Bible"". He reported a dramatic life story, although some say he lied about his past."
Early life.
"LaVey was born Howard Stanton Levey in Chicago, Illinois to a Jewish family of Ukrainian descent. His family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area of California soon after he was born. He was talented with musical instruments, particularly the pipe organ and calliope. He read a lot. His biography says that he stopped going to high school to join the circus. When the carnival was not active, he played organ in burlesque houses. He then worked as a police photographer in San Francisco, though this has been questioned."

"In the 1960s, LaVey began giving lectures at his house to a group of people he called his ""Magic Circle."" A member of this Circle told him that his ideas could become a religion. He agreed, and founded the Church of Satan in 1966. In 1969, he published ""The Satanic Bible"". ""The Satanic Bible"" was a collection of writings he had published in the past years that outlined his philosophies and the basics of the religion. It was influenced by Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, and other authors and philosophers. In 1971, LaVey published ""The Compleat Witch"" (later released as ""The Satanic Witch""). ""The Satanic Witch"" was a manual of magic. In 1972, LaVey published ""The Satanic Rituals"". This contained instructions for performing rituals. In the 1990s, LaVey published two books of essays, ""The Devil's Notebook"" and ""Satan Speaks""."
Death.
"LaVey died on October 29, 1997. His death was caused by pulmonary edema (fluid in his lungs). This was brought on by his heart disease."
Hurricane Ike
"Hurricane Ike was one of the most damaging tropical cyclones in United States history, having caused about $38 billion dollars in damage. It was the sixth-costliest Atlantic hurricane in U.S. history. Hurricane Ike was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane and the most-intense hurricane of 2008 in terms of pressure. Ike may have caused up to 195 deaths. Most deaths happened in Haiti and the U.S. together. Haiti was still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Hanna."
Storm history.
"The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ike started near the west coast of Africa on August 28. The storm grew quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the storm formed into Tropical Depression Nine when the storm was over the central Atlantic Ocean. Later that day Tropical Depression Nine became Tropical Storm Ike."
After the storm.
"In spring 2009, the name ""Ike"" was retired due to severe damage it caused, particularly in Texas. It was replaced by ""Isaias"" for the 2014 season."
Chromolithography and the poster.
"Chromolithography (color lithography) was invented by Engelmann &amp; Son, who were granted a patent in 1837. After that, it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development."
"Because of its low production costs, over the 50 years after the American Civil War, millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under $10. Louis Prang, a Bostonian, produced fine-art subjects, such as still lifes, landscapes, and classical subjects. Nevertheless, it was only after 1847 that the Jules Chéret posters showed their real potential."
Posters in the first half of the 20th century.
"Posters were used for war propaganda, to encourage young people to enlist in the army, and to sell government war bonds. From a strictly artistic view, the posters were unimaginative and far from the masterpieces of the late 19th century posters. The posters almost all came with a caption to bang the message home."
Gretchen Wilson

In 2004 she had her first number one album on Billboard's Hot Country Songs music chart. As late as 2013 she had a song on Billboard's Country Airplay music chart.
Career.
Wilson got a contract with Epic Records in 2003.
Blue Balliett
"Elizabeth ""Blue"" Balliett Klein (born in 1955) is an American writer. Her first book is ""Chasing Vermeer"". ""Chasing Vermeer"" made the Children's bestseller list in 2004. In the story, two sixth graders help solve a mystery involving a Vermeer painting. The story has to do with pentominoes, patterns, and coincidences. The sequel to ""Chasing Vermeer"" is ""The Wright 3,"" a mystery centered around the Robie House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and his talisman- a superstitious good luck object- that is a jade Japanese fish. This time, the two main characters, Petra and Calder, are joined by Calder's old friend, Tommy Segovia. The sequel, called The Wright 3, was published in April 2006."

Prague
Prague (Praha in Czech) is the capital and the largest city of the Czech Republic. 1.4 million people live there.
"Prague has been known as one of the most beautiful European cities since the Middle Ages. It is often called the ""City of 100 Towers"", the ""Rooftop of Europe"" or the ""Heart of Europe."" Prague was a place where many merchants, artists and inventors met."
"Prague is full of historical monuments in all major artistic styles. The historic center of Prague is on both banks of the Vltava river. This historical center has six districts, which were once independent cities that joined together in the 18th century. These districts are Staré Město (Old Town), Pražský hrad (Prague castle), Josefov (Old Jewish Town), Nové Město (New Town), Malá Strana (Lesser Town), Hradčany (Prague Castle Quarter) and Vyšehrad. It was Prince Bořivoj who established Prague Castle. There are also lots of museums, galleries, theaters, concert halls, and other historic buildings."
History.
"The earliest inhabitants of the area lived in the valley of the Vltava river around 500 BC. Slavonic tribes came to Bohemia in about 500 AD. There is a legend about how the town of Prague started. Princess Libuše, the leader of a Slavonic tribe, chose a simple peasant Přemysl to be her husband. She told him to go and find a village on the banks of the Vltava and to start a town there. The town became Prague, ruled by the Přemyslid family.In the second half of the 9th century the castle’s original fortifications were built. During the reign of Wenceslas I (Václav in Czech) in the 10th century the church of St Vitus was built at Prague castle. Wenceslas was murdered by his brother when he was going to church. He was later made a saint. In the early 11th century the Přemyslid family got power in Moravia, too. Vratislav II was the first monarch to be called King of Bohemia."
"Another ruler, also called Wenceslas I, ruled as King of Bohemia from 1230. He encouraged the arts. Many Germans came to live in Prague. In 1257 King Otakar II founded the area of Prague called the Lesser Quarter for the Germans to live in. The last of the Přemyslid kings was King Wenceslas III. He was murdered in Moravia."
"During the Middle Ages Prague became very important as the capital of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by Charles IV (1316-1378) who was the most powerful ruler in Europe at the time. Charles made Prague a great city, building St Vitus Cathedral, a university, and a famous bridge called Charles Bridge which still exists."
"After Charles IV there were many arguments and fights in Prague. A priest called Jan Hus said that the Catholic Church had become too powerful. He was arrested and burned at the stake in 1415. A lot of people agreed with what Hus had been saying. These people were called Hussites. They threw a lot of important Catholic people out of the window (called ""defenestration""). A lot more fighting followed, and for many years Bohemia was ruled by kings who lived in other countries."
"From 1526 the Habsburg family ruled Bohemia. They were Catholics and ruled the Holy Roman Empire. In 1576 the Emperor Rudolph II moved the capital from Vienna to Prague. Prague became a rich town again, and people were free to worship as Catholics or Protestants. After Rudolph II there were a lot of religious fighting and more people were thrown out of windows. Eventually the fighting became part of the Thirty Years’ War. When Ferdinand II won the fighting a lot of Protestants left the country. New buildings in Prague were built in the Baroque style. The German language, not Czech, was spoken at court. Maria Theresa was the only queen to reign over Prague. One of her 16 children was Marie Antoinette who became queen of France. When her son Joseph II ruled, people stopped fighting about religion. The people were free to speak what they thought, and there was no more serfdom. Prague now had three parts: the Old Town, the Lesser Quarter and the New Town. Famous people such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart visited the town often."
"In the 19th century industry came to Prague. Factories were built, a railway was built between Prague and Vienna. The Czech nationalist movement became very strong after 1848. They wanted to use their own language instead of German. The composers Smetana and Dvořák wrote music about their country, often using Czech folksongs. The National Theatre was opened in 1881."
"In June 1914 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne, was murdered. This led to World War I. After the war an independent republic called Czechoslovakia was formed with Prague as its capital. Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia were part of it. In 1938 Hitler invaded the country. It was liberated by Soviet troops in May 1945. However, the communists soon seized power and the country was ruled by communists who had to obey the Soviet Union. The prime minister Alexander Dubček gradually tried to make reforms. This period of time is called the ""Prague Spring"". In 1968 the Soviet Union sent tanks into Prague to Wenceslas Square to restore their power."
Democracy gradually came to Prague in 1989 when the Velvet Revolution happened. In 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia split into two countries. Today both these countries are part of the European Union.

Currency
Currency is the unit of money used by the people of a country or Union for buying and selling goods and services.
"Certain currencies are said to be ""pegged"" or ""fixed"" to something, usually another currency. A fixed or pegged currency is one that has a constant value compared to what it is pegged to. For example, the Cape Verdian escudo is pegged to the Euro. If the value of the Euro goes up 1% compared to another form of currency, the value of the escudo also goes up 1% compared to that same currency."
"Many countries have used systems where their currency was pegged to a commodity rather than to another currency. Most used either gold or silver. When they did this, as the value of gold increased, so did the value of their money. This was called the ""gold standard"" or ""silver standard"". Most countries stopped using silver and gold standards in the 20th century."
Some well-known currencies are:

Radio telescope
"A radio telescope is a type of antenna used for radio astronomy. The majority look like a huge satellite television dish. Stars shine, and the light can be seen with an ordinary telescope, but they also give off radio waves. Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars. Other things like black holes also give off radio waves, and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too."
"The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes. It can receive very faint signals, and see more details. The biggest telescope is a virtual radio telescope almost as big as the Earth, called the Event Horizon Telescope."
"The radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory, Parkes, New South Wales was used by NASA to receive messages from the Apollo 11 moon landings."
Light year
"A light year (symbol: ly) is the distance that light travels in empty space in one year. Since the speed of light is about 300,000 km per second (about 186,000 miles per second), then a light year is 9.46 trillion kilometers (about 5.87 trillion miles), for AU, one light year is 63,241 AU. A light year is not a length of time."
"The light year is used in astronomy because the universe is huge. Space objects such as stars and galaxies may be hundreds, thousands or millions of light years away."
Example.
"Think of a star at a distance of 100 light years from us on Earth. Light leaves the star and takes 100 years to get to us. When we see the star's light, we are seeing that star as it was 100 years ago."
Korea
"Korea is a peninsula in northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula. Korea became a country (or state) in 918."
"In 1948, it split into two countries: North Korea and South Korea. North and South Korea and their allies fought against each other in the Korean War."
"People have lived in Korea for about 15,000 years. In the past, some of modern Manchuria and Siberia was governed by Korea. Korea is known for its fine silk. In the 7th century, the people of China sought after gold-workers from Korea. Europeans had little knowledge about Korea until the modern era."
"South Korea has over 50 million people, and North Korea has more than 23 million. South Korea's biggest city is Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The city has more than 10 million people and the region of Seoul has more than 15 million people. North Korea's biggest city is Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It has fewer than 4 million people."
Korean people speak the Korean language. Many people in South Korea study English and other languages such as Chinese and Japanese at school.
"South Korea is an advanced country with large cities, high-speed rail trains, high-speed internet, and many television and radio networks. Many Korean television dramas are popular around the world. But there are still poor areas, even in South Korea. The Korean farmers are not rich and struggle to compete with cheap food from other countries."
History.
"Gojoseon is the first state in Korean history. It was established in 2333 BCE. Its real name is Joseon, but it is called Gojoseon to make it different from other Joseon in Korean history. Go is a Korean prefix meaning 'old'. The founder of Gojoseon is said to be Dangun. The Korean people believe that Dangun established the country on October 3rd, and still celebrate that day. In Korea, October 3rd is a national holiday, which is named Gaecheonjeol (The day heaven opened). It is said to be the day that Dangun's father whose name is Hwan-ung came from the sky on October 3rd 2457 BCE. Gochosun was destroyed by the Chinese Han Dynasty in 108 BCE."
"After Gojoseon had been destroyed, there were many confederations in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria: Mahan, Byeonhan, Jinhan, Buyeo, Dongye, Okjeo, Goguryeo, and so on. The ancient confederation countries later merged into three more powerful kingdoms and an advanced confederation country."
Uzel
Uzel is a commune. It is found in the region Bretagne in the Côtes-d'Armor department in the west of France.
Hugh Downs
"Hugh Malcolm Downs (February 14, 1921 – July 1, 2020) was an American radio and television broadcaster, announcer, television host, news anchor, TV producer, author, game show host, and music composer."
"For many years, he held the Guinness World Record for the most hours on commercial network television, before Regis Philbin broke his record."
"Downs was announcer/sidekick for ""Tonight Starring Jack Paar"" from 1957 to 1962, co-host of the NBC News program ""Today"" from 1962 to 1971, host of the ""Concentration"" game show from 1958 to 1969, and anchor of the ABC News magazine ""20/20"" from 1978 to 1999."
"Downs was born in Akron, Ohio on February 14, 1921. His career would start in 1945 and since then he had appeared in over 100 television programs and guest star appearances, he retired in 1999. He was married to Ruth Shaheen from 1944 until her death in 2017. They had two children together."
"Downs died on July 1, 2020, in Scottsdale, Arizona from heart failure. He was 99."
Dodder
"The Dodder, Cuscuta, is a genus of about 100–170 species of parasitic flowering plants."
"Recent genetic research has shown that it is correctly placed in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae."
"The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. Most species live in subtropical and tropical regions. The genus is rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe."
Appearance.
"Dodder can be identified by its thin stems. They look leafless, with the leaves reduced to minute scales."
"From mid-summer to early autumn, the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine, and are about the size of a common pea. It has very low levels of chlorophyll; some species, such as ""Cuscuta reflexa"", can photosynthesize slightly. Others such as ""C. europaea"" are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition."
"Dodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream. Some flower in the early summer, others later, depending on the species. The seeds are tiny, and produced in large amounts. They have a hard coating, and can survive in the soil for 5–10 years or more."
Life habit.
"Dodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil. Germination occurs without a host, but the seedling must reach a green plant quickly. Dodder grows toward the smell of nearby plants."
"If a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination, the dodder seedling will die. Before a host plant is reached, the dodder, as other plants, relies on food reserves in the embryo; the cotyledons are very small."
Parasitism.
"After a dodder attaches itself to a plant, it wraps itself around it. If the host contains food useful to dodder, the dodder produces 'haustoria' that insert themselves into the host. The original root of the dodder in the soil then dies."
"The dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants. In tropical areas it can grow continuously, and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees. In temperate climates it is an annual plant, restricted to low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring."
"Dodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants, including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species, such as alfalfa, flax, clover, potatoes, chrysanthemum, dahlia, trumpet vine, ivy and petunias, among others."
Kangaroo Island
Kangaroo Island is Australia's third-largest island after Tasmania and Melville Island.
It is southwest of Adelaide in the state of South Australia.
"At its closest point to the mainland, it is offshore from Cape Jervis."
"The island is long and between and wide, its area covering . Its coastline is long and highest altitude is ."
Wildlife and its protection.
Outstation (Aboriginal community)
"In Australia, the outstation movement is the movement of Australian Aboriginal people from large towns to much smaller communities, called outstations. It is mostly seen in the Northern Territory and amongst the people of the Western Desert."
"Before the 20th century, most Aboriginal families lived by themselves or in groups of 20–30 people. They were nomadic (moving from place to place), hunting and foraging across the deserts. As Euro-Australians started to build roads, towns and farms on Aboriginal lands, the native people were forced out. They had to move off their lands into towns or missions. There, the government would give them food, water and clothes."
"This way of life did not suit them. In the towns, there were many conflicts between different ethnic groups, people became addicted to alcohol, and many of them died from foreign diseases. Many groups were also far away from their traditional homelands, which were important to them and their spirituality. From the 1970s, many families started to move away from the towns. They returned to the places they grew up, and set up smaller communities."
"One of the main reasons behind the movement is for Aboriginal people to get back autonomy and self-sufficiency. The communities manage themselves, as nomadic groups (or ""tribe"") did many years before. Hunting and foraging – getting their own food, and food for everybody – is still important."
Santa Catalina rattlesnake
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake (""Crotalus catalinensis""), also known as the """"Santa Catalina Island Rattlesnake"", is a species of venomous Pit viper found only on Santa Catalina Island in the Gulf of California. There are currently no subspecies recognized."
Description.
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is a small and slender species of rattlesnake. It can grow up to the length of 73.1 centimeters (28.8 in), and is known for being one of the few rattlesnakes which don't have a rattle on the end of their tail. Some Santa Catalina Rattlesnakes are light cream in color with reddish-brown blotches down their back, while some are ash gray with dark gray blotches on them."
Behavior.
"While other rattlesnakes of the genus ""Crotalus"""" are mainly terrestrial (live on land), the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's small size makes it very good climber. In July, the hottest month on Santa Catalina Island, the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is found on branches of bushes and trees so they can escape the heat on the ground."
Feeding.
"Since the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake lives mainly in trees, scientist first thought this rattlesnake eats birds, but scientist have now found out that around 70% of the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's diet is made up of small mammals like the Santa Catalina Deer Mouse, and around 30% is made up of lizards like the Santa Catalina Desert Iguana and the Santa Catalina Side-blotched lizard."

Youth Riding a Rooster (Epiktetos)
Youth Riding a Rooster is a red-figure plate painted by Epiktetos about 520–510 BC. Its diameter measures 7 3/8 in. (18.7 cm). The plate is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It shows a boy riding a rooster. It was a rare subject among ancient artists. It probably references homosexual relations between older men and youths. It also references the practice among Greek males of giving a rooster as a love gift.
"The vase scholar Sir John Beazley wrote in 1918 in ""Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums"" (p. 18): ""The best of [Epiktetos] is in his plates. You cannot draw better, you can only draw differently. Epiktetos' people are all lightness and fairy grace, as if they belonged to a world where passion and pain were unknown, to those 'woods of Athens' where Oberon reigned in the days before 'the middle summer's spring'""."
"The plate was discovered in Vulci in 1828. Twenty years later it became the possession of the second marquess of Northampton. On July 2, 1980, his great-great-grandson, the seventh marquess, sold it with other pottery at Christie's in London."

"The story has been published and revised in many versions, most notably Madame Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's 1740 retelling and its revision in 1756 by Madame Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont."
"It was the inspiration for many other stories, as well as a 1980s TV series starring Linda Hamilton and Ron Pearlman. Several movies have been based on it, most famously Jean Cocteau's 1946 version and the 1991 animated version by Disney, which was nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award and inspired a long-running Broadway musical."

"Stevenson, while recovering from bladder cancer, died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, aged 68. Ironically, Roger Bowen, who played Henry Blake in the 1970 movie version of ""M*A*S*H"", died the day after Stevenson did."
Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve
"Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (15 April 1793 – 23 November 1864 (Julian calendar: 11 November)) was a German-born Russian astronomer. He was born in Altona (now an area of Hamburg), Germany, but later lived in Russia. He was an expert on double stars and one of the first astronomers to measure stellar parallax (closely related to the work by Friedrich Bessel)."
"While director of Dorpat Observatory (1817–39) he wrote ""Stellarum Duplicum et Multiplicum"" (1837), which proved that double stars are not exceptional and that star systems are governed by the laws of gravity. Struve added a lot to the study of galactic structure and also engaged in notable geodetic operations such as the triangulation of Livonia and the measurement of an arc of the meridian. In 1839 he became director of the new Pulkovo Observatory and was one of the first three astronomers who almost simultaneously obtained an approximate stellar parallax. (One of the others being Bessel)"
"In 1822 he published the first of many double-star catalogues, the identifying numbers of which are still used today. Struve's stars, however, are now often named in his honor (for example, Struve 2398), whereas the original catalogue prefix was the Greek letter sigma. In 1833 he moved to Russia to set up the Pulkovo Observatory near St. Petersburg, of which he was director until his retirement in 1862, when his son took over in the post. In total, Friedrich Struve produced 272 astronomical works and 18 children; his great-grandson Otto, by contrast, produced 907 works but zero children."

Beyti (meat dish)
Beyti is a type of Turkish meat dish.
"During a visit to Switzerland in 1961, Beyti Güler was inspired by the renowned butcher Möller's way of preparing meat.

"In 1945 Beyti and his father opened a small roadside meat restaurant of 30 m² with four tables in the suburbs of Istanbul. The restaurant only had 20 seats, but became popular soon after opening. Many came for the döner kebap that was rarely available elsewhere."
"An article published in 1965 in the ""New York Herald Tribune"" led to international fame. From 1966 to 1974, the restaurant catered daily to four Pan Am airliners. The restaurant served U.S. President Richard Nixon aboard Air Force One during his first official trip to Europe, an opportunity that helped the Turkish kebap (grill) dishes become renowned."

Leimaren asked Taoroinai to bring the image of God Atiya in the shape of Nonglum (cloud egg). The Goddess Leimaren received the heavenly egg containing another God. After this, Leimaren was also called Yaibirok ()."

The forms are (1) fish, (2) snake, (3) tortoise, (4) boar, (5) cow, (6) elephant and (7) man and finally Taoroinai. Taoroinai is shown as the ultimate form of life."
"According to the Kangla Houba (alias the Kanglalon) written by Ashangbam Laiba in the 5th century, Meitei King Naophangba attempted to construct a new palace in the Kangla. The king's plan was rejected by 13 year old Maichou Ashangbam Laiba. During that time, blood gushed out of the holes of the erecting pillars. It was believed that the erecting pillars struck the body of God Taoroinai. So, the King requested Ashangbam Laiba to rectify the pillar position. Laiba did as requested. Later, without any chaos, a seven storied palace building was able to be constructed in the Kangla."

The curse was removed by the ancestors."
"Seven maidens namely Tankha, Phuitingwak, Khuyon, Phuitingloubi, Toura, Nongdang and Lengbi and nine gods learned how to dance from Dragon Father Taoroinai. The rhythmic and smooth dancing of the maidens surprised all the creatures of the world. All the creatures came out and started to dance. The movements of Lady Tankha Chanu resembled that of the snake. Her steps destroyed all the plants and the flowers on her way. It is believed that the place of her enactment of the dance is the Mahou Phaibok hill."
"Seeing the daughter-father dance, a male squirrel imitated their dance. Seeing him dancing, a female squirrel also danced. The son squirrel laughed at his mother squirrel. At this, the female squirrel was embarrassed. The dancing squirrels were later joined by other creatures. And so, the dance never ended."

On 30 November 2013 riot police attacked protestors, violently putting a stop to the protests. The protesters then demanded the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych. Many people were killed in the riots."
"Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the western part of the country, wanted to be part of the European Union. But President Yanukovych wanted to maintain close relationships with Russia. This angered pro-EU civilians. They started Euromaidan. On 30 November, the police intervened, sometimes violently. As a result, more people came out to protest. Many people blocked the streets with their cars in a protest called ""Automaidan""."
The President fled in February 2014 but protests continued. In March 2014 the Russian Federation captured Crimea which angered many other nations. Some people feared this might lead to a global war.

"Carbapenems are a class of antibiotics which act against a wide range of bacteria. Their structure is difficult for bacterial enzymes to break down. They were originally developed from a product of ""Streptomyces cattleya""."
"Carbapenems are one of the ""antibiotics of last resort"" for many bacterial infections, such as ""Escherichia coli"" (""E. coli"") and ""Klebsiella pneumoniae""."
"Recently, alarm has been raised about an ""Indian superbug"". This is a strain resistant to Carapenems, which was discovered in Delhi. This strain produces an enzyme which chops up the antibiotic molecule."
"At present there are no new antibiotics in development to replace carbapenems. However, some older antibiotics may treat bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems."
French Wars of Religion
"The French Wars of Religion were a total of eight wars that were fought in France in the 16th century. between Catholics and Protestants (also known as ""Huguenots""). In all of the wars until 1585, the Catholics were supported by the French kings."
First war.
"The first war started in 1562, when the Protestant Prince of Condé, Louis de Bourbon, fled Paris with his supporters and captured the city of Orléans. His army was defeated by the Catholics at the Battle of Dreux in December, and the Catholics placed Orléans under siege. During the siege, a Huguenot killed the Catholic leader, Duke Francis of Guise. A peace treaty was signed in March, ending the first war."
Second war.
"The second war began in 1567, when the Prince of Condé tried to kidnap King Charles IX in an incident known as the ""Surprise at Meaux."" Condé put Paris under siege, but the Catholics attacked his army and defeated him. The Protestants and the Catholics raised large armies, but there were no more major battles. In March 1568, another peace treaty was signed."
Third war.
"The third war began in 1568, when Condé and his ally, Gaspard de Coligny, suspected that the Catholics would try to murder them. They went south and raised an army. A Catholic army, led by the king's brother, Henry of Valois, who would later become Henry III of France, attacked them and won a victory at Jarnac. At the Battle of Jarnac, Condé was captured and executed. Coligny, now the leader of the main Protestant army, fought another battle against the Catholics at Moncontour. This battle, one of the deadliest of the era, was another Protestant defeat. Many of the Protestants withdrew into the fortress town of Saint Jean d'Angély, and the Catholics besieged them there. While the Catholics besieged Saint Jean d'Angély and lost thousands of troops, Coligny joined forces with the Protestant Count of Montgomery and his army. The Protestants marched across France and, in June 1570, defeated the Catholics at the Battle of Arnay-le-Duc. The Catholics, running out of money, made a peace treaty with the Protestants."
Fourth war.
"In 1572, the fourth war broke out when the Catholics, led by Henry of Valois and Henry of Guise, the son of Duke Francis, who was killed during the first war, killed Coligny and thousands of other Protestants during the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Many Protestant survivors fled to La Rochelle, one of the main centres of Protestantism in France. The Catholic army put La Rochelle under siege but could not conquer the city. After losing thousands of soldiers, the Catholics agreed to a peace treaty. Between the fourth and the fifth wars, King Charles IX died, and his younger brother, Henry, became King Henry III."
"""Funeral Oration"" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his ""History of the Peloponnesian War"". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his ""History"" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech."
"The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as ""a eulogy (description) of Athens itself..."". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people."
Gettysburg Address and Pericles' funeral oration.
American Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration.
Gorgoneion
"In Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion () was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon's head. (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism)."
"The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on shields and capes. These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo."
Evolution.
"Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that ""Medusa is a head and nothing more...a mask."" The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her tongue sticking out, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her."
"The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. In some cases a beard, (probably representing streaks of blood) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like Dionysus."
"Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman."
Usage.
"Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaeological dig at Parium. Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns. There is a similar image from the Knossos palace, dating from the 15th century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that ""the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates""."
"In the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of ""lion mask"" were found all over Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles (antefix) of smaller buildings throughout the next century."
"As well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On Attic kilns, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents."
"The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus (now the Ukraine). The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists. In the 20th century, the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company."
Origin.
"Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the Mother Goddess cult linked to ""dynamic life energy"". She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him."

"A co-factor (or cofactor) is a chemical compound which is not a protein, but is attached to a protein. The compound is needed for the protein's biological activity. In most cases, the protein will be an enzyme, and the cofactor will help the enzyme work. If so, the cofactors are also called coenzymes."
"Cofactors which are complex organic molecules are often called coenzymes. If connected by a covalent bond they are a ""prosthetic group"". But if they are just temporarily connected then the cofactor is a ""cosubstrate""."
"Some enzymes need several cofactors. Organic cofactors are often vitamins, or made from vitamins. Metallic ions are often cofactors, but many cofactors have both inorganic and organic parts."
Connective tissue
"Connective tissue is a fibrous tissue. It is one of the four traditional classes of tissues (the others being epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue)."
"Connective tissue (CT) is found throughout the body. It has 3 main components; cells, fibres, and extracellular matrix."
"Connective tissue makes up a variety of physical structures including, tendons, blood, cartilage, bone, adipose tissue, and lymphatic tissue. CT is classified into three subtypes: embryonic CT, proper CT, and special CT."
"Collagen is the main protein of connective tissue in animals and the most abundant protein in mammals, making up about 25% of the total protein content."
Collagen
"Collagen is a group of naturally occurring proteins. In nature, it is found exclusively in animals, especially in the flesh and connective tissues of mammals."
"It is the main component of connective tissue, and is the most abundant protein in mammals. It makes up about 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content."
"Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin, and is also abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral discs."
"Collagen makes up 1% to 2% of muscle tissue, and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous muscles."
"Gelatin, which is used in the food industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed."
Hurricane Ginger
"Hurricane Ginger is the second longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane on record. It started September 6, 1971 and lasted until October 5. The storm struck eastern North Carolina on September 30, causing $10 million in damage. Peak winds were 110 miles per hour during Ginger's life."

"Shelley, Suffolk"
"The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) is an African-American civil rights group. The SCLC was very important in the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King, Jr. was its first president."
"Today, the SCLC says it is ""a nonprofit, non-sectarian, inter-faith, advocacy organization that is committed to nonviolent action to achieve social, economic, and political justice."" This means the group is open to people of all faiths and religions, not just Christians."
Creation.
"The SCLC was created in 1957, after the Civil Rights Movement's successful Montgomery Bus Boycott. On January 10, 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. invited about 60 black pastors and leaders to Atlanta, Georgia. Their goal, at the time, was to end segregation on buses in the Southern United States. However, they agreed that they would only use non-violent ways of protesting and trying to make change. Their motto was: ""Not one hair on one head of one white person shall be harmed."""
"About a month later, the group met again in New Orleans, Louisiana. They decided that their goal would be to end segregation everywhere not just on buses. They also chose Dr. King as their president, and chose the name ""Southern Christian Leadership Conference."""
"The SCLC also chose a group of leaders called the Board of Directors to be in charge of making final decisions and planning strategies. At first, some churches and civil rights organizations joined the SCLC. However, it was difficult to get churches to join. Groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens' Council used violence and terrorism to attack civil rights activists. So did the police in many states. Some churches which joined the SCLC, or did civil rights work, were bombed or set on fire."
Activities.
Citizenship Schools.
"In 1954, civil rights activists started ""Citizenship Schools."" These schools taught African-American adults to read so they could get driver's licenses; fill out forms; open bank accounts; and pass literacy tests that only black people had to pass to sign up to vote. The program spread across the South. They called themselves the ""Highlander Folk School."""
"In 1961, the state of Tennessee took the Highlander Folk School's land and property away. In that year, the SCLC rescued the Citizenship School program. The Schools' teachers pretended to be teaching adults to read. Secretly, they were teaching about democracy, civil rights, leadership, getting people together to protest, politics, and protest strategies. All of these things would be very important in the Civil Rights Movement."
"Eventually, close to 69,000 teachers taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South. Most of these teachers were volunteers who were not paid. Many of the Civil Rights Movement's adult leaders went to or taught Citizenship Schools."
Work in the Civil Rights Movement.
The SCLC's work in the Civil Rights Movement included:
1968-1997.
"Ralph Abernathy became the President of the SCLC after Dr. King's murder. Under his leadership, the SCLC:"
"Abernathy was President until 1977. Joseph Lowery replaced him, and was President until 1997."
1997 today.
"Since 1997, some of the issues the SCLC has worked on include:"
Chivalric romance
"Chivalric romances are stories, poems or songs. They were written about marvel-filled adventures. Knights having heroic qualities went on quests. It is the emphasis on love and courtly manners which distinguishes it from other kinds of epic. Other types of epic are about masculine military heroism."
Romances were written in European languages of the Middle Ages.
"The best known romance was King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is another example."
Comet Swift–Tuttle
Comet Swift–Tuttle (109P/Swift–Tuttle) is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 133 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with a period between 20 and 200 years. It was independently discovered by Lewis Swift and Horace Parnell Tuttle in July 1862. It has a well-known orbit and has a comet nucleus 26 km in diameter.
"Chinese records show that in 188 AD the comet reached apparent magnitude 0.1. In 1862, the comet was as bright as Polaris. The comet made a return appearance in 1992, and became visible with binoculars. In 2126 it will be a bright naked-eye comet reaching about apparent magnitude 0.7."
"It is the parent body of the Perseid meteor shower, perhaps the best known shower and among the most reliable in performance."
Near-Earth orbit.
"A close encounter with Earth is predicted for the comet's return to the inner Solar System in the year 4479, around Sept. 15; the closest approach is estimated to be 0.03–0.05 AU, with a probability of impact of 1, or 0.0001%."
"Comet Swift–Tuttle has been described as ""the single most dangerous object known to humanity"". However, the probability of Earth impact per orbit is about a million to one against. It is estimated as 2 (0.000002%). It is the largest Solar System object that makes repeated close approaches to Earth with a relative velocity of 60 km/s."
An unusual aspect of its orbit is that it is captured into a 1:11 orbital resonance with Jupiter; it completes one orbit for every 11 of Jupiter.
"Many of George Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theaters in New York City. These comedies, with plenty of songs, were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s."
"One of Gershwin's musical plays, ""Girl Crazy,"" introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman. She became one of the most celebrated performers in America. In the play, Merman sang a song George Gershwin wrote just for her. It was called ""I Got Rhythm""."
"Many songs that George Gershwin wrote for musical plays and movies have remained as popular as ever. Over the years, they have been sung and played in every possible way—from jazz to country."
"One example is the song, ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" It was written for the 1926 musical ""Oh, Kay!"""
Jazz and his music.
"In the nineteen twenties, there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music?"
"In 1924, jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized how little time he had to do it. The concert was just a few weeks away. Gershwin got busy, and, in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra. He called it ""Rhapsody in Blue."""
"Gershwin himself played the piano part of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" at the concert. The audience included some of the greatest classical musicians of the time. When they heard his music, they were electrified. It seemed to capture, for the first time, the true voice of modern American culture. Today, we can still hear Gershwin playing ""Rhapsody in Blue."" An old mechanical piano recording Gershwin created has been reproduced exactly. There are also very early versions of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" which feature Gershwin playing the piano with Whiteman's orchestra. Those recordings, because they are early, do not sound like modern recordings. But they are recordings of Gershwin at the piano. This makes those recordings important."
"""Rhapsody in Blue"" made George Gershwin famous all over the world. Several hundred thousand copies of the printed music sold immediately. Gershwin was satisfied that he had shown that jazz music could be both serious and popular."
Musical works and opera.
"Gershwin also wrote an opera, ""Porgy and Bess. "" It was based on a book by DuBose Heyward. It is a tragic love story about black Americans along the coast of South Carolina."
"""Porgy And Bess"" opened in Boston, Massachusetts in 1935. Audiences loved it. But most critics did not know what to think of it. It was not like any other opera or musical play they had ever seen."
"Gershwin did not care about the critics' opinions. He believed some of his greatest music had gone into the opera. He said he had created a new musical form—an opera based on popular culture. Today ""Porgy And Bess"" is considered a masterpiece."
"Another well-known Gershwin piece is ""An American in Paris. "" It is a long tone poem for orchestra. Its first public performance was by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1928."
"Once again, opinion was mixed. Most people loved ""An American in Paris,"" as they loved all of Gershwin's music. Some critics liked it, too. They called it happy and full of life. Others hated it. They called it silly and long-winded."
Last days.
"George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He died while having surgery to remove the brain tumor. He was only thirty-eight years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. Everyone mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have written. Gershwin is still considered one of America's greatest composers. His works still are performed by many singers and groups. They are probably performed more often than any other serious American composer."
"Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg was one of the people who praised George Gershwin. Schoenberg said Gershwin was a man who lived in music and expressed everything through music, because music was his native language."
Aaron Copland
"Aaron Copland (, ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer who wrote modern music."
"Aaron Copland wrote many kinds of music. He wrote music for the orchestra, piano, and voice. He wrote music for plays, movies, and dance. Copland also was a conductor, pianist, speaker, teacher, and writer."
Music critics say Copland taught Americans about themselves through his music. He used parts of many old American folksongs in his work. He wanted to do this after studying music in France. He said that composers there had a very French way of writing music. He said Americans had nothing like that in this country. So he decided to compose music that was truly American.
Early days of Copland.
"Aaron Copland was born November 14, 1900 in Brooklyn, New York. He died at the age of 90 on December 2, 1990. He was the youngest of five children. His parents had come to the United States from eastern Europe. They owned a store in Brooklyn. Aaron began playing the piano when he was a young child. He wrote his first song for his mother when he was eight years old. His dreams of becoming a composer began when he was young. When he was sixteen, he asked his parents to let him study composing with Rubin Goldmark. Goldmark had taught the composer George Gershwin."
"When he was in his early twenties, Copland went to Paris, France, where he studied music with Nadia Boulanger. She was one of the most important music teachers of the time. He returned to New York in 1924."
Known classical works.
"The famous conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, learned about Copland's music. Koussevitzky led the orchestra for the first performance of Copland's early work, ""Music for the Theater"", in 1925. Koussevitzky also conducted Copland's ""Concerto for Piano and Orchestra"" in 1927. This work was unusual because Copland used ideas from jazz music in his concerto."
"Copland later wrote the music for two ballets about the American West. One was about the life of a famous gunfighter called Billy the Kid. Copland used music from American cowboy songs in this work. This piece from ""Billy the Kid: Ballet Suite"" is called ""Street in a Frontier Town""."
"In 1942, the conductor Andre Kostelanitz asked Copland to write music about a great American, Abraham Lincoln. Copland wrote ""Lincoln Portrait"" to honor America's 16th president. Copland's music included parts of American folk songs and songs popular during the American Civil War. He added words from President Lincoln's speeches and letters."
"""Lincoln Portrait"" has been performed many times in America. Many famous people have done the speaking part.Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was one of them. Here, actor James Earl Jones performs in Copland's ""Lincoln Portrait."""
"In 1942 the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra asked 18 composers to write music expressing love for America. For the competition, Copland composed ""Fanfare for the Common Man. "" This music is played in America during many national events, including some presidential inaugurations (when they become presidents)."
"Ayden is located at (35.470973, -77.420740)."
"According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land."
History.
"In 1891, William Henry Harris asked the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to build a railroad depot on a portion of his farm in order to create a village. A parcel of land was divided into residential lots surrounding the depot in ""Harristown"". Harris owned every other lot in Harristown. Within the next several years, lots were sold and homes were built. Businesses began to open up to support the new residents, and on February 3, 1891, people in the town created a local government as ""Ayden."" Within a few years, the Carolina Christian College and the Free Will Baptist Seminary were established. By 1919, Ayden had full-time electricity supplied by the Ayden municipal light plant. In 1922, the Mutual Building and Loan Association of Ayden was organized to help families obtain mortgages (or loan) to build homes in Ayden."
"After experiencing tough times during the Great Depression, and after the Second World War, the town began to grow. As the town got bigger, they made commercial, cultural, religious, and other establishments within and around Ayden. The community is still growing today, thanks to the continued development of Greenville. Because Greenville is an industrial and economic center for eastern North Carolina."
The Ayden Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.
Population data.
"As of the census of 2000, there were 4,622 people, 1,936 households, and 1,217 families living in the town. The population density was 1,994.5 people per square mile (769.2/km²).

Government structure.
"Ayden has used the council-manager form of government since 1957. Under this form of government, the Town Board of Commissioners is the final authority of most matters related to managing the government. The Town Board employs a Town Manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the Town. The Mayor and Town Board of Commissioners are the governing body of the Town. The Mayor acts as the official head of the government and spokesperson of the Board. The Mayor presides at all meeting of the Board and signs all documents authorized by the Board."
"The Mayor Pro-Tem is selected by each new Board, and assumes all duties and responsibilities of the Mayor in his absence. The Mayor and Town Board, together, are responsible for establishing the policies for the general operation of the Town. The Town Board adopts ordinances, resolutions, budgets, authorizes contracts, and approves the financing of all Town operations. The Board also appoints the Town Manager and Town Attorney, along with members of various boards and commissions."

Punishment
"Punishment is when something is done to a person (or animal) that they do not like. It may be because they broke a rule. There are many kinds of punishment, from a death penalty for very bad crimes, to things that parents may do to punish children, like spanking them or taking away their toys. People are often sent to prison as punishment for a crime."
Punishment can be seen as good in society to prevent people from doing bad things. It can also be seen as cruel and unnecessary. It can also be seen to do more harm than good.

The two letters OM can mean
Blue whale
"The blue whale (""Balaenoptera musculus"") is a marine mammal of the suborder of baleen whales (called Mysticeti). They grow to be about 30 meters long. The biggest blue whale found was 190 tons and measured 98 feet long. Larger specimens have been measured at 110 feet, but never weighed. This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth, even bigger than the largest dinosaurs."
"The blue whale eats mostly very tiny creatures, like krill. These inch-long, shrimp-like crustacean swim in swarms. In the Antarctic summer, there are so many of these krill that they turn the waters orange. A blue whale can eat eight to ten tons of krill every day."
"The blue whale's body is long and slender. It can be various shades of bluish-grey above and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at least three distinct subspecies: ""B. m. musculus"" of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, ""B. m. intermedia"" of the Southern Ocean and ""B. m. brevicauda"" (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. ""B. m. indica"", found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small krill."
"Blue whales were once abundant around the world. In the nineteenth century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers. They were finally protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, located in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic group of Blue Whales can be seen in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park near Tadoussac QC, Canada."
Cetacea
"The order Cetacea are marine mammals that live in oceans, seas and even a few rivers around the world. Whales, dolphins and porpoises are part of this group. These common names refer to size: whales are the largest, porpoises the smallest. How and what they eat is a better guide to their relationships. The study of cetaceans is called cetology."
"Cetaceans are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates."
Scottish Gaelic language
"Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig, pronounced ""Gah-lick"") is a Celtic language. It is commonly called just Scots Gaelic in Scottish English. It is a sister language of Irish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic; all three are Goidelic languages. These are related to the Welsh language, Cornish language and the Breton language (these three are Brittonic or Brythonic languages)."
History.
"In past times, the Scottish Gaelic was spoken across all of Scotland except for the Northern Islands (Orkney and Shetland). In the later part of the Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland began to speak Scottish English and looked down on the Scottish Gaelic. After the union of England and Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic was snubbed and looked down on even more, and Scottish English took over."
Today.
"Scottish Gaelic today is basically spoken in the Outer Hebrides and on Skye. Generally speaking, the Scottish Gaelic spoken across the Western Isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group, but there is some regional variation."
"A census in the United Kingdom in 2001 showed that a total of 58,652 (1.2% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) in Scotland could then speak some amount of Scottish Gaelic. Only the Western Isles have more people who can speak the Scottish Gaelic than not (61% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic). The place in Scotland with the largest percentage of speakers is a village called Barvas on the Isle of Lewis, where, 74.7% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic."
"Children in Scotland do not have to learn Scottish Gaelic in schools, but it is becoming a more popular subject as Scottish Gaelic is an important part of their Scottish culture."
"Scottish Gaelic is also used overseas. It is estimated that 1,000–2,000 in Nova Scotia, Canada, can speak some Scottish Gaelic."
Scottish language
Scottish language can mean:
West Germanic languages
"The West Germanic Languages are a branch of Germanic languages first spoken in Central Europe and the British Isles. The branch has three parts: the North Sea Germanic languages, the Weser-Rhine Germanic languages, and the Elbe Germanic languages. The most spoken languages in the branch are English, German, and Dutch."
Legends.
The Moirang Shayon legends from the backbone of the Moirang Kangleirol.
"""Moirang Shayon"" (lit. ""Moirang incarnations"") is a genre of the seven incarnations of a God and a Goddess, induced under the direction of Lord Thangjing, in the ancient Moirang kingdom."
The list of the seven pairs of incarnations are:
Habutae
"Habutae is a type of silk. There are different kinds of ""habutae"" silk such as plain or striped ""habutae"". ""Habutae"" is traditionally used for kimono and undershirts. Recently, it is also used for general goods, works of art, and clothing. ""Habutae"" is smooth to touch, glossy, and soft. It has been said ""The quality of silk fabric begins with habutae and ends with it."" ""Fukui"" is a suitable region to produce ""habutae"" as the dryness and wetness of the air are well-balanced throughout the whole year."
History.
"In 1871, Kimimasa Yuri, who was a lord of ""Fukui"" Domain (region), brought some silk goods from Europe to Fukui when he joined a study tour in Europe. He showed the goods to people who studied silks in ""Fukui"" and they started doing technical research on weaving ""habutae"". In 1887, basic technology for weaving ""habutae"" silk was completed in ""Fukui"" city. The economic boom of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and World War I boosted progress and production of ""habutae"" in ""Fukui"". In the early 1900s, production of ""habutae"" in Fukui earned 1.7 million dollars, up to 60% of the total exports of ""habutae"" in Japan. The demand for ""habutae"" made in ""Fukui"" has kept increasing in Japan, and it is still used in many kinds of daily goods such as clothing."
Weaving Process.
"Most of the process of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk is the same as the process of making ""habutae"" in other areas, but the weaving process of Fukui ""habutae"" silk is different from the weaving process of ""habutae"" in other areas. Also, the weaving process is the most important part of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk. Fukui ""habutae"" silk is made in a process called ""nureyoko(濡れ横)"". ""Nureyoko"" is a weaving method of weaving warps and wefts which is the two basic components of weaving thread into fabric after wetting wefts with water. Threads are made from raw silks that are imported from other countries such as China and Brazil. This process makes the cloth tight, elastic, and strong. It takes one day to weave 20 meters of ""habutae""."

National Diet Building
"The National Diet Building (国会議事堂, Kokkai-gijidō) is the building where both houses of the Japan's government, the Diet, meet. It is located at Nagatachō 1-chome 7–1, Chiyoda, Tokyo."
Sessions of the House of Representatives take place in the left wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the right wing.
"The Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is made of only Japanese materials, except for the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system."
History.
"Plans for a Diet building began in 1881. The planners hoped to finish it by 1890, when the Diet would meet for the first time. They realized they could not build a very impressive building in time, so they decided to make temporary buildings at first. The first Diet building was a Western-style building made of wood. It burned down in 1891. Another wooden building was made and finished in 1891. It burned down in 1925. A third building was made. The Diet used it until 1936, when the current Diet building was finished."
Current Diet building.
"In 1910, the Finance Ministry started a planning group to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tarō chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building should be made in the Italian Renaissance architectural style. Many other people did not like this idea."
"The ministry had a public design competition in 1918. 118 architect teams sent designs. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and Böckmann's."
"The Diet Building was built between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they mixed European and East Asian architecture. The actual source for the ""Pyramid"" roof remains unclear, but Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it might have come from from Shinshichi. Historian of Africa studies Zoe Strother says Shinshichi's design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 1900s, such as John Russell Pope's 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928."

Panthoibi Khongul
"Panthoibi Khongul ()(literally, ""in quest of Panthoibi"" or ""Panthoibi's footprint""), also spelt as Panthoipi Khongkul, is an ancient Meitei literary work (puya), narrating about the quest of goddess Panthoibi. The text highlights the love saga of Panthoibi and her ultimate lover Nongpok Ningthou, after leaving her husband's house. Many scholars believe the work to be written during the 12th century AD."
The text also talks about how the festival Lai Haraoba was begun after the union of the two lovers.

"Linacre College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1962, and was the third graduate-only college at the University. It was the first graduate college founded at Oxford to admit both male and female students."
Botanical name
"A botanical name is a formal scientific name which follows the ""International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants"" (ICN). If it concerns a plant cultigen, the additional cultivar term must follow the ""International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants""."
"The code of nomenclature covers ""all organisms traditionally treated as plants, whether fossil or non-fossil, e.g. blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria); fungi, including chytrids, oomycetes, and slime moulds; photosynthetic protists and taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups""."
"The purpose of a formal name is to have a single name which is accepted and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. For example, the botanical name ""Bellis perennis"" was given to a plant species which is native to most of the countries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has various names in many languages. Later it has been introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages."
"Some English names for this plant species are: daisy, English daisy, lawndaisy. In other languages, some examples are: , , , ."
"The cultivar ""Bellis perennis"" 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-variegated horticultural selection of this species."
Parts in a name.
"Depending on rank, botanical names may be in one part (genus and above), two parts (species and above, but below the rank of genus) or three parts (below the rank of species):"
"A name in three parts, i.e., an infraspecific name (a name for a taxon below the rank of species), needs a ""connecting term"" to indicate rank. In the ""Calystegia"" example above, this is ""subsp."" (for subspecies). In botany there are many ranks below that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so that this ""connecting term"" is unnecessary there). A name of a ""subdivision of a genus"" also needs a connecting term (in the ""Acacia"" example above, this is ""subg."", subgenus). The connecting term is not part of the name itself."
Binary name.
"For botanical nomenclature, the ""ICBN"" prescribes a two-part name or binary name for any taxon below the rank of genus down to, and including the rank of species. Taxa below the rank of species get a three part name."
A binary name consists of the name of a genus and an epithet.
Jean Kent
"Jean Kent (Joan Mildred Summerfield; 29 June 1921 – 30 November 2013) was a British movie and television actress. She was also known as Jean Carr. She was born in Brixton, London. Kent was known for her role as Mille Harris in ""The Browning Version""."
"Kent died in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk on 30 November 2013, aged 92. She died following a fall a few days earlier at her home in Westhorpe, Suffolk."
House of Orléans
"The House of Orléans was a French noble and royal family. It descends from Louis XIV of France and his only brother Philippe, Duke of Orléans. The families main traditional home was the Palais Royal in Paris. The family later became very powerful during the reign of Louis Philippe I. He ruled France under the title ""King of the French"". The king successfully married his children into other royal families of Europe."
"The present head of the house is Prince Henri of Orléans. He is known as the Count of Paris. He also claims the title King of the French, but is known simply as ""His Royal Highness The Count of Paris"" and sometimes the ""Duke of France"". However, the titles are not officially recognised because France is no longer a monarchy. Henri has been a claimant to the throne since 1999. The Count was married to Duchess Marie Thérèse of Württemberg. She is herself a daughter of a one-time claimant to the throne of Württemberg."
Vicente Aleixandre
"Vicente Pío Marcelino Cirilo Aleixandre y Merlo (April 26, 1898 – December 14, 1984) was a Spanish poet. He was born in Seville. Aleixandre won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1977. He was part of the Generation of '27. He died in Madrid from tuberculosis in 1984."
Airline alliance
"An airline alliance is when two or more airlines make an agreement to work with each other. The three largest airline alliances are Star Alliance, SkyTeam, and Oneworld. Airline alliances make it easier for passengers to travel around the world, reducing their stops or connections.

The Five Satins
Most Black-tailed rattlesnakes grow to the length of . They can be as long as . Females are said to be larger than males.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake is olive green, yellow, brown, or black in color. They are called the ""Black-tailed rattlesnake"" because of their tail which is the color of black. Like other rattlesnakes the Black-tailed rattlesnake has a rattle on the end of its tail, but its rattle is weak and can be broken. They can shed their skin several times a year."
Common Names.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake is also called the ""Green rattler"", the ""Dog-faced rattlesnake"", and the ""Mountain Diamondback""."
Where they live.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake is found in southwestern United States of America and Mexico. In the U.S.A it is found in Arizona, New Mexico, and west and central Texas, in Mexico it is found in Oaxaca. It is also found on islands of the Gulf of California, like San Estèban Island and Tiburòn Island."
Behavior.
"In the spring and fall the Black-tailed rattlesnake are diurnal, in the summer they are nocturnal so they can avoid the heat, and in the winter they hibernate in other animals dens. Even though they are okay climbers and good swimmers they are terrestrial. They live in grasslands, deserts, mountain areas, and forests."
Feeding.
"Like all rattlesnakes they are carnivores and eat rodents, other small mammals, birds, and small reptiles."
Reproduction.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnakes mate in the spring, once they have mated the male stays with the female to stop other males from mating with her. It is in the summer that the female gives birth to her young, the young stay with their mother for around a day or two before leaving by their selves. A female usually mates every year and has 10-12 young at a time. They live for around 15–20 years."
YMCA
"Young Men's Christian Association (or the YMCA or the Y) is an organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It was originally meant to put Christian principles into practice. It was founded in 1844 in London, England, United Kingdom. At first, the organization provided beds and shelter to young men leaving the countryside for work in the cities. It promotes Muscular Christianity."
Basketball was invented in an American YMCA.
The similar Young Women's Christian Association or YWCA was founded in 1870.
Antisocial personality disorder
Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a personality disorder. A person with ASPD fails to conform with socially accepted behavior. People with this disorder often disregard social norms or the rights of other people. People with extreme Antisocial Personality Disorder are sometimes nicknamed sociopaths or psychopaths but those words aren’t really scientific nomenclature.
"The ASPD pattern begin in childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood. People with ASPD have no conscience or sense of morality, although the large majority know right from wrong. Those with ASPD often commit crimes. They can also be impulsive, aggressive, reckless, and destructive. About three percent of men and one percent of women have ASPD."
DSM-V criteria.
"According to the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-V), a person has ASPD if they fit the following requirements:"
Causinae
"The Causinae, commonly known as the ""night adders"", are a subfamily of venomous vipers found in sub-Saharan Africa. The family is monotypic, since it only has the genus ""Causus"". There are six species."
"The night adders can grow to around 60 to 90 centimeters (24 to 36 in) long. They are usually dark gray, light gray, light brown, or black in color with gray or black blotches."
"Even though they are called the night adders, they are usually active at day, but some are active at night. When they are attacked or disturbed, they usually coil up and start hissing at their enemy to scare it off. Some may raise their head and neck off the ground, and with their tongue sticking out, move froward like a the Cobra does."
"They eat mainly toads and frogs, but there are reports of some night adders eating almost everything they can find until they are completely unable to swallow any more food."
Reproduction.
"All night adders are oviparous, which means they lay eggs. This is unusual for most vipers, because most vipers are viviparous, they give live birth. They lay around two dozen eggs at a time. These eggs take around four months to hatch, when they hatch the hatchlings are 4-5 inches (10-12.5 cm) long."
Venom.
Chibbley.
"Chibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship ""Picton Castle"". She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because ""Picton Castle""’ was a training ship, Chibbley had many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea."
Convoy.
"Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS ""Hermione"". He was named ""Convoy"" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when ""Hermione"" was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205."
Emmy.
"Emmy was the ship's cat on RMS ""Empress of Ireland"". She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and ""Empress of Ireland"" left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, ""Empress of Ireland"" ran into SS ""Storstad"" while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. ""Empress of Ireland"" sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people."
Felix.
"Felix was the ship's cat aboard ""Mayflower II"" when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in ""National Geographic"" magazine, ""Life"" magazine, and ""Yankee"" magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called ""Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures"". The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation."
Mrs. Chippy.
"Mrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard ""Endurance"", the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that ""Mrs. Chippy"" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name ""Mrs. Chippy,"" and kept using it."
"The ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive."
Simon.
"Simon was the ship's cat of HMS ""Amethyst"" during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS ""Amethyst"" was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of ""Amethyst""’s crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits."
"After the ""Amethyst"" finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in ""The Times"" (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors."
Trim.
"Trim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim."
U-boat.
"U-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck."
Unsinkable Sam (Oscar).
"Oscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship ""Bismarck"". When ""Bismarck"" was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS ""Cossack"". ""Cossack"" herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS ""Ark Royal"". Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed ""Unsinkable Sam."" He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich."
Ship's cats today.
"Starting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness)."
"Cats still ride on many private ships today. For example, ""Toolbox"" is a ship's cat who rides on the second ""Kalmar Nyckel""."
"American sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships ""Dove"" and ""Return of Dove"", while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965)."
Calendula officinalis
"Calendula officinalis (pot marigold, ruddles, common marigold, garden marigold), is a plant in the genus ""Calendula"" of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to India. It was the state flower of Junagadh and Bantva-Manavadar State, now part of Gujarat."
Uses.
Pot marigold florets are edible. They are often used to add colour to salads or added to dishes as a garnish instead of saffron.
The leaves are edible but are often not palatable. They have been used as a herb and in salads.
"The flowers were used in Ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb and a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. They are also used to make oil that protects the skin."
David Krumholtz
"David Krumholtz (born May 15, 1978) is an American actor and comedian. He played Mr. Universe in ""Serenity"", Charlie Eppes in the CBS series ""Numb3rs"", and starred in the ""Harold &amp; Kumar"" and ""The Santa Clause"" franchises."
Strokkur
"Strokkur is a geyser in Iceland. It is located in the geothermal region near the Hvítá River, east of the capital Reykjavík."
History.
"Strokkur's activity began in 1789 following an earthquake. Strokkur continued to :wikt:erupt until 1896, when another earthquake blocked the geyser's water pipeline."
Tourism.
Strokkur is famous throughout Iceland and regularly attracts many tourists. People go there to see the geyser erupt.
Sequence of the eruption.
"The water present at a depth of 23 meters has a temperature of about 120 ° C, but cannot transform into a gaseous state due to the high pressure, due to the overlying mass of water. When this water reaches 16 meters deep, a certain amount can reach the boiling point and this induces the chain reaction that we see."
Miquelot de Prades
"Miquel de Prades ( Balaguer ) ? 1462? - Belvedere Marittimo coast 1505), known by the name of Miquelot de Prades, was a Catalan soldier famous for his skill with the sword and various military deeds. There is no certain evidence that confirms whether three documented facts (about a fencer, about a murderer and about a soldier who died at sea) can be attributed to the same person."
Documented facts.
Assassination of Joan Borja in Rome.
"The historian Jerónimo Zurita explains the assassination of Juan de Borja, son of Alexander VI in Rome, in the year 1497. The death was attributed to Michalot de Prats, who was at the service of the victim."
Famous fencer in Italy and Montserrat.
"Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, in his work ""Las Quinquagenas de la nobility de España"", spoke of a Catalan soldier (Michalot de Pradas) who roamed Italy, winning all the duels with a sure thrust to the opponent's neck. Repentant of his life, that soldier went to take refuge in the monastery of Montserrat. One bad day an Italian soldier with two swords showed up and challenged Miquelot (saying that he wanted to see the secret thrust, claiming that he would know how to counter it). Miquelot flatly refused to fight but the other's insistence forced him to do so. The Italian ended up dead, with a thrust to the neck. There was probably no better way to teach it. Repentant of the new death, he went to Rome to ask for forgiveness. The pope incorporated him into his troops."
Soldier at the service of the Pontiff.
"There is a Michalot de Prats who with an armed caravel in Naples chased and made some corsairs flee near Belvedere Marittimo (a priori, without any relationship, with the previous events). Michalot's ship, some ships that accompanied him and the captured privateers suffered a sudden storm and sank (year 1505). All the crew were drowned."

Reptiliomorpha
Reptiliomorpha is a clade of the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians).
"Unfortunately, different experts have used the term in several different ways. It has even been used for fossils of early amphibians. It is best used for animals which lay cleidoic eggs, but are not synapsids. Otherwise precursors of reptiles (sauropsids) get lumped together with precursors of mammals (synapsids)."
"Its only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from. But gradually, as with ""Seymouria"", it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups."
Youth Riding a Hippalektryon (Epiktetos)
"Youth Riding a Hippalektryon is a circular painting (tondo) in the bottom of the bowl of an ancient Greek terracotta drinking cup. It was painted by Epiktetos. It is dated to the Archaic period of Greek art (ca. 530–520 BC). The cup stands about 5 1/8 in. (13 cm) tall. A hippalektryon is a mythical creature, part horse and part rooster. The cup is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The museum writes, ""Late sixth-century vases connected with drinking occasionally have subjects that go beyond the familiar gorgons, griffins, or sphinxes. The hippalektryon belongs to this category. It is interesting to compare this piece to the fine early red-figure plate by Epiktetos showing a youth riding a rooster."""
Spy-fi
"The genre known as Spy-fi is a cross-over between the genres of spy fiction and science fiction. The story usually involves a spy with advanced technological weapons or gadgets, and sometimes the villain is a mad scientist or evil genius with robots or advanced technological weapons and gadgets. The film and novel series ""James Bond"" was a popularizer of the genre, as well as such TV shows as The Man from UNCLE, , and I Spy."
Amanda Marshall
"Amanda Marshall (born August 29, 1972) is a Canadian pop-rock singer. Her self-titled first record was in 1995. It was a major success in Canada. Her most successful single was ""Birmingham"". Marshall has released many singles. She has not had a studio album since around 2001."
Singing Reveler (Epiktetos)
Singing Reveler is the tondo (circular painting) in a terracotta drinking cup said to have been painted by Epiktetos. It is dated about 520510 BC. The cup measures 3 1/16 x 9 15/16 x 7 1/16 to 7 3/16 in. The cup is in the collections of The J. Paul Getty Museum.
"The tondo depicts an older, balding man reclining on a couch and singing. The setting is probably a drinking party (""symposium""). These cups were meant to be used at such parties and were often decorated with party scenes."
"The tondo presented problems to painters. It was difficult to present upright figures in a circle. Epiktetos solved this problem by using the couch as a line. The man's mantle slipping from the couch creates depth and space. The museum writes, ""Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it."""
Pentathletes (Carpenter Painter)
"Pentathletes is a painting on an ancient Greek terracotta drinking cup from Athens. It is said to be the work of the Carpenter Painter. It is dated about 510500 BC. The cup measures 4 5/16 x 15 x 13 3/16 in. In the circular painting (tondo) at the bottom of the bowl of the cup, a youth pulls an older man to him for a kiss. The outside of the cup depicts bearded men and youths exercising with discus and javelin. A youth in a long robe plays music. The pictures reflect the interests of the aristocrats who would have used such a cup at a drinking party."
Salt pan
"A salt plain (also known as a salt pan or salt flat) is a flat area of ground covered with salt and other minerals. They are usually purely white. They are found in desert areas. In areas where salt plains form, the rate of evaporation (how quickly water dries up) is faster than the rate of precipitation (how often rain falls). A salt plain is formed where a lake or pond would otherwise be found. When the water dries up, the minerals stay left behind on the suface of the ground. Over thousands of years, the minerals (usually salts) build up on the surface."
"Large salt plains are common in the Sahara Desert, the Kalahari Desert, the Rann of Kutch, the western United States and the central deserts of Australia. The Altiplano in Bolivia has the world's largest salt plan, the Salar de Uyuni."
Witchetty grub
"A witchetty grub (also spelled witchety grub or witjuti grub) is the large, white larva of a moth. It is a name used in Australia. Normally, it refers to the larvae of the cossid moth ""Endoxyla leucomochla"", found in central Australia. These moths eat the roots of the witchetty bush (a plant named after the grubs). It is also sometimes used to refer to the larvae of other cossid moths, as well as those of ghost moths (Hepialidae). It is used mainly when the larvae are being thought of as food. Because it contains a lot of protein, the grub is the most important insect food of the desert. It was a staple in the diets of nomadic Aboriginal people living in the outback."
"The name ""witchetty"" (or ""witjuti"") comes from the Adnyamathanha language. The name comes from the words ""wityu"" (meaning ""hooked stick"") and ""vartu"" (meaning ""grub"")."
Carpenter Painter
Description.
"Both the largest viper, and the smallest viper in the world belong in this group. The largest viper, the Gaboon Viper, grows up to the length of 2 meters, while the smallest viper, the Namaqua Dwarf Adder, grows up to the length of only 28 cm. All African Adders have wide, triangular heads, a large, rounded snout, and small eyes."
Where they live.
"The African Adders are found in Africa, and the southern Arabian Peninsula."
Behavior.
"African Adders are terrestrial (meaning they live and are found on the ground), and ambush their prey. They are slow, and sluggish, but they can bite their prey or enemy with amazing speed. African Adders are known for when being disturbed inflating their body, and hissing loudly. All African Adders are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. They eat small rodents like mice and rats, birds, amphibians like frogs and toads, other snakes"
Computer-generated imagery
"Computer-generated imagery (CGI) is using computer graphics, especially in movies. These images are used for special effects, simulation, and commercials, amongst others. Sometimes the technology is used to produce a static background, which is then merged into the image; at other times it is used to produce animations in 2D or 3D. In its broadest sense, a computer- generated image (CGI) can be defined as any image that is created with the use of a computer- based processor or program. Because computers are widely used, both in image generating and in image processing, these images are pervasive- from billboard advertisements to film productions and photography."
Benjamin Morrell
"Benjamin Morrell, (July 5, 1795 – 1839) was an American sea captain, navigator and explorer."
"Between 1821 and 1823, he made four important trips, especially in the Southern Ocean, the Pacific Islands and the eastern shores of the Americas."
"He wrote a memoir about his travels titled ""A Narrative of Four Voyages"" and, following the information provided, earned a bad reputation as a liar, because it contained inaccuracies and also contained a somewhat fanciful way of exposing their experiences."
Donna Lewis
"Donna Lewis (born August 6th 1973) is a Welsh singer who is best known for her hit single ""I Love You Always Forever"". She released her first two albums under Atlantic Records although she now has an independent label. Lewis was born in Wales."
Brain Stew/Jaded

Eristicophis
"Eristicophis is a monotypic genus made for the venomous viper species """"E. macmahonii"". It is found in the desert areas near the borders of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. There are currently no subspecies recognized. The E. macmahonii is also known as the ""McMahon's Viper"", the ""Asian Sand Viper"", the ""Leaf-nosed Viper"", and the ""Whiskered Viper""""."
Description.
"The McMahon's Viper is a small species of snake, growing up to less than one meter. Males are smaller than females; males can grow up to the length of 22-40 cm, and females can grow up to the length of 28-72 cm. They are reddish-brown or yellowish brown in color."
Where they live.
"The McMahon's Viper is found in the desert regions of Balochistan, near the borders of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan."
Behavior.
"The McMahon's Viper is said to be nocturnal, but some say it is crepuscular, meaning it is active during the early morning or late evening. It is able to sidewind on loose sand, and sometimes climbs into bushes. It is a aggressive snake, hissing very loudly when disturbed or annoyed, and sometimes it raising its head of the ground and starts striking aggressively. It is able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. When it sinks into the sand it leaves its eyes and snout sticking out of the sand."
"The long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Many of its animals came from Africa, because the island is closer to Africa than to India. Many of these endemic Malagasy animals have died out since the arrival of humans, particularly the megafauna."
"Despite this, and massive deforestation, Madagascar is still home to an incredible array of wildlife. Most of this is unique."
Environment.
"Madagascar is home to many species that were not known about until around 1679 when Dutch explorers went there. They do not even exist elsewhere in Africa. They only exist in Madagascar. In fact, most of the mammals living in Madagascar do not live anywhere else in the world."
"Many species in Madagascar are in danger because much of the forest has been cut down. Forests are cut down so the land can grow crops such as coffee, which is an important export crop for Madagascar."
Economy.
"Agriculture is a big part of the economy in Madagascar, including the growing of coffee and vanilla. Madagascar sells more vanilla than any other country in the world. Madagascar also makes money from tourism."
Provinces.
In 2004 Madagascar was divided into 22 regions. It used to be divided into 6 provinces.
Human history.
People have probably lived in Madagascar for at least 2000 years.
"France took over the city of Antananarivo in 1895, and added Madagascar as a colony two years later. Madagascar became independent from France, which meant it became its own country, on 26 June, 1960. Philibert Tsiranana became the first president of Madagascar (1960-72)."
Board game
"A board game is a game usually played with pieces on a board, or some area with marked spaces."
"Most board games use pieces that may be moved, placed, or traded depending on the rules of the game. These pieces may be money, chips, pawns, or other objects. Board games may often involve some random chance with dice or cards. There are many board games with a long history in some cultures. Examples of these games are chess, checkers, backgammon, parqués, and go. There are also a great number of popular board games that have been created more recently, in the past hundred years. Among these games are Scrabble and Monopoly."
"Chess, and most versions of checkers, are played on a 8x8 square board with 32 white squares and 32 black squares. International checkers is played on a 10x10 square board."
"Older than chess, but not by much, is tafl (pronounced 'tabl'), later called ""hneftafl"". This is an old Norse board game with just two types of pieces. Its pieces, when found in Britain, have often been wrongly ascribed to chess. In chess, of course, the board is different, and there are six kinds of pieces."
Aerosmith
"Aerosmith is an American rock band, formed in 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts. They have released many popular songs, including ""Walk This Way"" and ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"". They have their own Guitar Hero video game called . Their lead singer is Steven Tyler."
Brighton
"Brighton is a city on the south coast of England. It was called ""Brighthelmstone"". It is in the county of East Sussex. In 2000, it joined Hove to become the city of Brighton &amp; Hove. Historically, Brighton forms the main part of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation, with 474,485 inhabitants (2011 census). This is England's 12th largest conurbation, and the mostly densely populated area outside London."
History.
"From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of development—one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The fad for bathing in seawater as a cure for illnesses was encouraged. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France. Road transport to London was improved when the main road via Crawley was turnpiked in 1770. Spas and indoor baths were opened by physicians."
"From 1780, development of Georgian terraced houses started. The fishing village developed to the fashionable resort of Brighton. Growth of the town was encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) after his first visit in 1783. He spent much of his leisure time in the town, and had the Royal Pavilion built during the early part of his Regency."
"The arrival of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London. Some major attractions such as the West Pier and the Brighton Palace Pier were built for the growing number of tourists. The population grew from around 7,000 in 1801 to more than 120,000 by 1901."
"In 1984, a Provisional Irish Republican Army bombing killed five people."
"Modern-day Brighton is a centre for education, sports, and recreation. It has two universities: University of Sussex and the University of Brighton. It also has 54 other schools."
"In 2003, the universities of Sussex and Brighton formed a medical school, known as Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Brighton has a thriving LGBT community and every year in the first weekend in August Pride festivities are held."
Ferret
"Ferrets (""Mustela putorius furo"") are domestic animals. They are the domestic form of the European polecat. They are in the weasel genus of the family Mustelidae."
"Ferrets have an average length of 20 inches (51 cm) including a 5-inch (13 cm) tail, weigh about . They live for about 7–10 years. Males are larger than females. They are sociable animals, and are usually kept in groups of two or more."
"With their long thin body, ferrets look like a large weasel. They may have different colours and markings on their fur. A lot of ferrets in one place will sometimes have a strange smell. This is caused by natural oils produced by the ferrets."
Behavior.
"As naturally crepuscular animals, ferrets tend to sleep during the day. This deters many people from getting them although most ferret owners say their ferrets change their sleeping schedules to that of their owners."
Ferrets and humans.
"Domesticated ferrets are used for hunting, or can be kept as pets. Hunting with ferrets is called ferreting. Because of their thin body, they can go down into holes and hunt rodents and rabbits. Ferrets have been kept as pets since the Middle Ages."
Health.
"Ferrets suffer from several health problems. Some of the most common health problems are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system. Viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza. Health problems can happen in unspayed females when not being used for breeding. Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems"
Ferrets as pets.
Ferrets are legal to have as a pet in most places. They are not legal in a few places in the United States. Ferrets should be vaccinated. A breeder or pet store will get it spayed or neutered and also de-scented. Ferrets can spray the natural oils from their anal glands similar to that of a skunk if not de-scented.
Ferrets are very flexible and can fit into small holes to flush out rabbits or rodents. Ferrets can get through open vents or small holes in walls. Ferrets are good climbers so if curtains are touching the floor they can easily climb the curtains.
"Ferrets should be kept in a group, unless you can provide them with multiple hours of activity, they get quite bored when alone. Ferrets tend to sleep curled up together in a ball usually making them indistinguishable from one another."
Diet.
Ferrets are carnivores and cannot tolerate grains or vegetable matter well. Their diet should consist of around 20% fat and 80% meat. Ferrets need a high calorie diet: commercial dog and cat foods do not contain enough fats and protein to suit them. Feeding them such a diet while convenient will ultimately shorten the ferrets life.
"Ferrets are subject to insulinoma and as such they should not be given fruits except on rare occasions as a treat. Raisins are a favorite of most ferret but should be given extremely sparingly. Fresh chicken, turkey or even duck is a good choice for your ferret. Commercial ferret foods are available but many contain grains and also fruits and as such are not suitable for them. Research brand ingredients or find a recipe to make your own."

1960 New York mid-air collision
"United Airlines Flight 826 was a flight that collided with TWA Flight 266 on December 16, 1960. No one survived. It was the deadliest at the time. The accident became known as the Park Slope plane crash or the Miller Field crash, named after the two crash sites. The accident was also the first hull loss and the first fatal accident involving a Douglas DC-8."
Aircrafts and crews.
"United Airlines Flight 826, ""Mainliner Will Rogers"", registration N8013U, was a DC-8-11 carrying 77 passengers and seven crew members. It was travelling from O'Hare International Airport to Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport) in Queens.

Baltz died of pneumonia the next day."
Legacy.
"The total number of fatalities of the accident would not be surpassed until a Lockheed C-130B Hercules was shot down in May 1968, killing 155 people. In terms of commercial aviation, the death toll would not be surpassed until Viasa Flight 742 on March 1969. The aircraft crashed on takeoff and killed all 84 people on board, as well as 71 people on the ground."

Hades
"Hades (, ""Háidēs"") is the god of the dead and the king of the underworld in ancient Greek religion and myth. He is the eldest son of the Titans Kronos and Rhea and brother to Zeus, Poseidon, Hestia, Hera, Demeter and Chiron."
"As the lord of the dead, Hades was greatly feared by the Greeks, and he had few temples or shrines dedicated to him. He was married to the goddess Persephone, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Hades’ symbols were the cornucopia, a sceptre, the cypress, narcissus, poplar and his Helm of Darkness; the screech owl was his sacred animal. His sacred fruit was the pomegranate, the fruit that Persephone ate one- third of when she was kidnapped and in the underworld."
"Hades’ Roman equivalent was Pluto, whose name is merely a Latinization of the Greek ""Plouton""."
Superlative
"A superlative, in grammar, is an adjective describing a noun that is the best example of a given quality. In other words, a superlative describes a noun that has more of some quality than any other."
Some examples:
"In English, most superlatives can be formed by adding -EST to an existing adjective, like the examples above. (For adjectives that end in ""-y"", like ""crazy"", you often change the ""y"" to an ""i"" before you add the -EST on the end.)"
"Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms, which do not follow the rules, such as far (""farthest"") and bad (""worst"")."
"Other adjectives have no superlative form at all, and the superlative is made simply by adding the adverb ""most"" before the adjective. For instance, you do not say ""funnest,"" or ""interestingest"". Instead, you say ""most fun,"" and ""most interesting."""
"This way of making the superlative is used for almost all adjectives ending in ""ing"" (like ""interesting"", ""fascinating"", ""disgusting"" or ""appealing"".)"
Learning disability
"Learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are conditions that make it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do. Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society that are not easy to learn."
"Learning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading) and dysgraphia (a difficulty with writing). They can also be big things that mean a person needs more help (like autism). People with learning disabilities may have average intelligence. Learning disabilities are not the same as mental illnesses. They can often deal with their difficulties by doing things in different ways."
"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not a learning disability, but it may affect how a person learns."
Wheelbarrow
A wheelbarrow is a kind of vehicle that is built to be pushed around with a load inside it. It is usually used in gardens.
"Most wheelbarrows have one wheel, but some have two."
Wheelbarrows are used to carry heavy stuff which some people cannot carry.
Cold
"Cold is a relative term used in comparison with the adjective warm (opposite of cold). Because it is relative, there is no range in coldness. The temperatures in the winter season are often categorized as being cold. Cold is the opposite of hot."
"The coldest possible temperature is −273.15 °C, which can be expressed as -459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale. This is called absolute zero. Absolute zero is also 0 K on the Kelvin scale and 0 °R on the Rankine scale"

Megaron
"The megaron (, , plural ""megara"") is the rectangular great hall in Mycenaean and ancient Greek palace architecture. The hall was: 1) surrounded by four columns, 2) had an open portico with two columns in the front, and 3) had a central, open hearth venting through an oculus, or opening, in the roof."
"The megaron also had the throne-room of the ""wanax"", or Mycenaean Greek ruler, whose throne was in the main room with the central hearth. Similar architecture is found in the Near East but the open portico supported by columns is particular to the Aegean region. Megara are sometimes called ""long-rooms"" because of their rectangular shape and the position of their entrances. There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, shrines, corridors, armories, and rooms storing wine, oil and wheat."
"The megaron was used for sacrifices, royal events, and court meetings."
Structure.
"Halls in the shape of rectangles were a defining theme of Greek architecture. The Mycenaean megaron originated from the ""megaroid"", or large hall-centered rectangular building, of Greece dating back to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Also, it was the architectural forerunner to ancient Greek temples. The megaron's structural layout included a columned entrance, a ""pronaos"", a central ""naos"" (or ""cella""), and one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). The roof was supported by wooden beams. The floor was made of patterned concrete and covered in carpet. The walls were built with bricks of mud, and were decorated with frescoes. There were metal doors often having two-leaved wood decorations. Footbaths were also used in the megaron as mentioned in Homer's ""Odyssey"" where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia. The dimensions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to the early temples of the Dorian Greeks."
Examples.
"A famous megaron is in the king's large reception hall in the Bronze Age palace of Tiryns where the main room had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns supporting the roof. The Cretan elements in the megaron of Tiryns were adopted by the Mycenaean Greeks from Minoan palace architecture. Frescoes from Pylos show people eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Artistic images of bulls, a common animal motif in Mycenaean vase painting, appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is shown at the center of a Mycenaean procession. Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of Thebes and Mycenae. Different Greek cultures had their own megara where, for example, the Greeks of the mainland separated their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Greeks of Crete did not do this."

A Child of Our Time
A Child of Our Time is an oratorio by Michael Tippett. It was composed between 1939 and 1941.
Why Tippett wrote this oratorio.
"Tippett composed this oratorio at the beginning of World War II. He had already lived through World War I and he was very upset about all the evil in this world. He wanted to write a musical work about it. He did it by taking the story of the beginning of World War II as a basis of the oratorio, but he also made the work speak in general about the evil of this world."
"In 1938 a 17 year old Jewish boy Hershel Grynspan, who lived in Paris, desperately wanted to attack the Nazis because of the cruel way his parents in Germany had been treated. He therefore murdered a Nazi diplomat in France. The Nazi’s in Germany were so furious that they attacked and murdered lots of Jews in Germany. This terrible attack became known as the ""Kristallnacht"". This series of events can be found in the words of Tippett’s oratorio. Tippett wrote the words himself."
"The title comes from Ödön von Horváth’s novel, ""Ein Kind unserer Zeit"" (A Child of Our Time), written in 1938 and published in English in 1939. Tippett began composing it on 5 September 1939, two days after Britain declared war against Germany."
"In 1958 Tippett arranged the five negro spirituals so that they could be sung by unaccompanied chorus. They are often performed like that, separately from the oratorio."
"Tippett uses a similar structure to the Passions of Bach. This meant that he used a narrator (like the evangelist in Bach’s Passions) who tells the story. Instead of Bach’s Lutheran chorales he adds five negro spirituals which add an emotional comment to the events. The music of these spirituals blend very cleverly into the style of Tippett’s music. The whole oratorio, which lasts a little over one hour, has three parts. This idea is based on the three parts of Handel's ""Messiah"". Tippett calls the three parts: 1) Prophecy; 2) Narrative; 3) Meditation."
The story in the oratorio.
Part One.
"Part one opens with a picture of the world in darkness. The alto solo shows what the person’s soul is feeling. The bass (narrator) tells of the purges in Russia, the lynching in the USA, the terrible poverty in Britain. The chorus tell of their despair."
"Ashford Black Marble is a kind of limestone which contains some carbon, and its particles are very small. Its dark color is from bitumen, and once cut and polished, the surface shines."
"At first the rock was mined from Arrock Mine, and later in 1832 from nearby Rookery Plantation, near Ashford-in-the-Water."
Manufacturing techniques.
"Ashford Black Marble can be manufactured into pots, candlesticks and other similar objects, or sawn to make smooth, flat items such as obelisks and paper weights. Derby Museum and Art Gallery has collections of worked and part-worked items of Ashford Black Marble, acquired from an inlaying workshop owned by the Tomlinson family. This collection also includes pieces of stones which were cut and ready to put into the black marble background. Forget-me-not and lily of the valley were typically designed. Various stones were used with Ashford Black Marble: Greys, blues and purples stones are from Monyash. ""Rosewood"" from Nettler Dale in Sheldon is a kind of barytes and has red and white layers. Castleton Blue John from Crich is a kind of flourspar and has purple and yellow colors. ""Birds-Eye"" rock has a design made from the fossils in it. ""Duke's Red"" is so valuable that it was stored at Chatsworth House. The tabletop design illustrated shows some of the combinations described here."
"In the late 1780s, Derbyshire geologist White Watson made geological picture boards using Ashford Black Marble into which other local rocks were inlaid. These boards show layers of rock in different parts of the county. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals."
"William Martin was once a partner with Watson, and wrote the first scientific study of fossils. His ""Petrifacta Derbiensia"" says that White Watson's uncle and workers at the Black Marble mine called some of the fossils ""crocodile tails"", because they thought they were the remains of crocodiles."
"In 2006, Buxton Museum bought the Black Marble collection that had been left by John Michael Tomlinson. He had spent over 50 years to collect them after finding that his ancestors had been involved in Ashford Black Marble manufacturing."
Tasmanian Wilderness
"The Tasmanian Wilderness is a term that is used for a range of areas in Tasmania, Australia."
"The World Heritage Areas in South West Tasmania, Western Tasmania and Central Highlands are the most well known."
"However, there are also other wilderness areas in Tasmania, Tarkine and the Cradle mountain wilderness. There is also an organisation known as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society."
"The World Heritage Area is one of the largest conservation areas in Australia, covering 13,800 km², or almost 20% of Tasmania. The area constitutes one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, including the renowned South West Wilderness. The area became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, and it was extended in 1989. It is important for both its natural value but also its cultural values as well."
"Remains found in limestone caves show that humans have lived in the area for well over 20,000 years."
"The Tasmanian Tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae. The last known specimen died in captivity in 1936.p77 The world's largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian Devil; it is the size of a small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger.p46 It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania.p69"

Yes
I have
"and, uh, I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're, you're more likely to get,"
"Yeah,"
and I think he has legitimate argument.
"I mean you can, uh,"
"I, I, I grew up in Alabama"
"and so I, I have some prejudices."
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station."
Uh-huh.

it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into.
Where'd you move from?
Houston.
"So we had a, a favorite,"
"But,"
"What, what about the domestic effects"
"like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it, uh, possible and even popular to, uh, criticize the government."
"And they,"
"that pendulum started to swing, uh, maybe even too far. To the point where, uh, uh, supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And that tradition is still,"
"I mean it's dying now,"
"but it's still alive as opposed to,"

"that, you know, the, uh, the domestic unrest,"
Are you in the middle of anything?
No.
I'm not in the middle of anything.
"I've just,"
about the last thing I did
"about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house."

The whole thing?
Yeah.
"That, that was fairly large undertaking."
"A, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house."
Did the framing and all?
"Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking."
Huh.
"That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that"
"we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that"
and.
and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
uh-huh.
and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole.
Uh-huh.
"But I think this, they way the whole economy is going right now, it's just not good to be in debt."
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"that, I would, that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was, you know, juggling payments to different people I guess because I never experienced it."
Uh-huh.
"And it's not, because you know, I'm rich or anything,"
"it's just, a mental concept that I have. Yeah,"
Yeah.
that I just.
"Well, when you, when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle, and if you really get into the mind set, I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul,"

uh-huh.
"And I thought, this is not right."
"I mean, this has got to stop, because eventually it'd end up catching up at, catching up with me"
and it hit me in the face.
"Right,"
right.
Um.
"But it sounds like, you know, you, you learned from it"
and you're coming out of it all right.
"I, yeah,"
"I have,"
I've learned a lot from it.
Uh-huh.
"I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand and my husband's too, because he's, he's the same way I am."
"Uh-huh,"
I do miss that.
Around here in Plano there are very few trees
"and it's pretty flat and, and kind of barren"
"and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas, is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall"
"and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is, you know, in the north. Um, or even where you are."
"Uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here."
"A lot of leaves to rake up too, I bet."
Yes
but fortunately the home owner's association does all that.
"Does that,"
"well, see, that's another plus."
"Yes,"
I don't have to worry about that
"and this is the time of year we're starting to lose,"
they're all falling now.
"That's right,"
"that's right,"
they are.
I'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done.
"We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but, not, not much. Just, just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks"
"and if you didn't do anything about it, then they'd probably the leaves just blow away"
Right.
It's not too bad.
"Okay,"
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time?
"No,"
I don't think so.
Okay.
Okay.
It was really nice speaking to you.
It was good to speak with you too.
"Okay,"
Bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
so do you all keep a budget?
"No,"
we don't.
You don't?
"No,"
"I, I make so much money here at T I that, that we just spend it."
And we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck.
"It's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semi-conductor firm,"
you can just spend it well.
"Are you being smart,"
or are you serious?
I'm being facetious.
I'm being very comical.
"Uh, we have a budget, um that works well."
Uh-huh.
"I kind of look at it for more of a,"
"we have a financial, uh, analyst, a finance administrator, I guess, that, that, uh,"
"I guess the financial planners, the training now."
We've had it for about four years here.
Uh-huh.
"Got our businesses and, and, and our life in line, how to manage credit cards, how to put away, say for, you know, money markets and this kind of thing."
Yeah.
"And, there's some freebies out there are"
you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home in some sort of savings account.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"That being money market, uh, bonds, , savings, uh, or just a liquid account which, which we do."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that."
The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
Right.
"And it's a real big crunch, uh"
Uh-huh.
"of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course,"
"but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them."
"So,"
"Well, that's right."
"Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste"
Uh-huh.
but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
Sure.
"I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles."
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
"And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being,"
I mean it gave people jobs
Yeah.
"but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use."
"I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time"
"but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"So, a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things."
So I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Right.
"Okay,"
"well, it was good talking to you"
and have a good evening.
Okay
All right.
Yeah.
"Now, I sort of take pride in, uh, in the yard, and, you know, how the place looks,"
"and, uh, so I don't mind doing it so much anymore."
"Yeah,"
"so do you have a, do you have a garden,"
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn?
"Well, it's, yeah, it's, it's primarily just, uh, like landscaping a little bit."
"You know, I've got some, uh, bushes around the you know, foundation planning, things like that,"
"and then there's some, just some little flower beds,"
"and my mom grows,"
"she's an avid gardener,"
"and she starts her own stuff from seed now,"
and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them.
"Uh, she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden."
"They have a huge yard and a huge house,"
and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras.
"Well, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"My, my sister is very over zealous, too."
She's got some really nice flower beds.
She puts a lot of time into them.
"This is my first year in a, in a house where I'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff."
"Oh, we, I've always had crude ones at my father's,"
but this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house.
Yeah.
His house is more like a farm house.
It's not on a main road.
Uh-huh.
"My house is on a main road,"
and it has nothing
Yeah.
"I mean, nothing."
"So, it's, it's like everybody is into it,"
it's just greed. Human greed.
Yeah.
"Interestingly in Honduras, It's very pro-American."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And we have I,"
"my girlfriend used to, uh, be in the Navy"
"and she was based, uh, based in Panama."
Uh-huh.
"In Honduras, very, uh, uh, pro-American."
Uh-huh.
"And there's a lot of men, I don't know how many American, uh,"
"soldiers are there,"
but there's a lot.
"I mean, they, uh,"
"I had wondered sometimes,"
"I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort"
"and a lot of work went into a lot of that,"
"and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know,"
"like, uh,"
Uh-huh
"Yeah,"
"I've, you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, um, the language teaching, you know,"
"I mean, why should we push English,"
Uh-huh
and a lot of people were down there teaching English
"and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, you know, to me that's a little bit marginal."
"I did teach economics at the university one night a week,"
"and the textbook was in English,"
"but basically I taught it in Spanish, because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test."
Oh.
Yeah.
"So now they're like marking, uh,"
"they're,"
"I don't know,"
"there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics"
"and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is."
Yeah.
So I guess that makes it easy to recycle
"and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic"
so that that makes it easier I guess.
Uh-huh.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I'm, you know,"
"unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't,"
"they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that"
"or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection"
Right.
"and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that"
Where does your friend go to to recycle?
She lives in Garland
"and I'm not sure where, what she does."
"But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that"
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
Uh-huh.
"Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house."
Yeah.
"Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing."
And she does make a lot of sense.
Yeah.
Just her whole house is like wow.
"I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear  from another person"
Yeah.
and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find.
Exactly.
It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S
"I was reading,"
"Right,"
"I was reading something in, uh, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact."
"They were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out. And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever."
Yeah.
"Uh, like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger"
"and, and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi."
Huh.
"You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?"
"Yeah,"
really.
"But, uh, that's the way it is."
"I don't know,"
"I, I personally feel that, uh, uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes"
"and, you know, people, more than manufacturers should get a clue"
"and, you know, they should start making quality products."
"Yeah,"
I think they're beginning to.
"The, the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away"
"and,"
"That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, they've got all the American, well, all the, all the cars rated, you know,"
"and, uh, essentially, I I don't see much of a trend."
"I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there."
"There's nothing wrong with them. Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars."
But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy
"but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers."
Sure.
"So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go, you know, tax things that they don't, you know, to a degree, well, like booze, you know,"
"example, they keep raising the taxes on booze,"
"it gets to the point, you know, it makes drunks sober, you know"
They quit buying it.
"Well, what, what about the taxes on cigarettes?"
"Well, tell me about your home."
Okay.
"Uh, right now we're living in,"
"well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys."
"And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it."
Uh-huh.
"So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,"
"but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us."
So it was enough.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half."
"Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom."
Yeah.
"So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house"
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
Huh.
"And, uh, it's about a five year old house now."
It sounds nice.
"It's, uh, pretty nice."
"Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already"
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"It was a,"
Landmark is the one who built it.
Yeah.
It's a great idea.
"Hell, I'd love to cut ours in half,"
"but, uh"
Uh-huh.
man.
"And if you figure, get with a financial person."
Yeah.
"And you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan, if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment it'll make, uh,"
Uh-huh.
it has a magic with numbers.
"It, I, it'll shave almost, you know, X number of dollars off,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
we we've become aware of that.
"We have a, there's a loan officer through our church, too, that I think could help us better."
"You know, he does that full time with the bank, you know."
Uh-huh.
"And so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know, that, you know, we know are people of integrity."
So.
Sure.
"You know, that is another thing that, you know,"
we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time
"we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving, you know,"
"we're going to go to somebody that we know,"
"we're going to take someone with us older,"
and we didn't do any of those things.
Somebody you trust.
"You know, there are so many rip-off artists here in this town."
"It's, it's, uh, it's really a sin,"
it really is.
Yeah.
I got taken on some on firewood.
"so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?"
"I think they have, uh, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves."
Yeah.
"And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan."
Uh-huh.
"It's certainly a, a supplemental way, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suppose if, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan."
Right.
But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.
Uh-huh.
"So it's not, uh,"
"all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation."
"It's not going to build up, quite enough,"
yeah.
"So, I have to find a way to supplement that."
Yeah.
"Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save."
"You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world,"
"but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check."
"And it's probably not a great investment,"
"but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know."
"I kind of have to trade off, you know."
"If you never see it you don't spend it,"
"so And it's,"
"I understand though,"
"it,"
Yeah.
"Uh, believe me, I do that myself."
Do you?
Yeah?
And I disagree with you.
"this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out,"
Yeah.
"it's just, it's just ridiculous."
"Yeah,"
"I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair."
"Uh-huh,"
"it really could,"
"and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead,"
"and they keep dragging it on,"
and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"so, uh,"
"Yeah,"
the press has a lot of power.
They really do.
"I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more."
"Yeah,"
"oh, but, boy you try get into that,"
you'd really open a can of worms.
"Oh, yes,"
"or they, I agree with the freedom of the press, you know, and all the amendments,"
but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.
"Yeah,"
"seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit,"
and I don't think they ever care to.
"No,"
they don't.
"Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about."
"Well, I enjoyed talking to you."
"Well, it was good talking to you."
All right.
oh I can't even think of the name of it.
I was halfway listening while I was painting
Uh-huh.
"Um, it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children"
Uh-huh.
"and they've now moved it to Washington, D C"
"and the, the doctor that was on there, the pediatrician said, you know, I can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care   and leaving them there."
Yeah.
Oh that would be hard.
"You know, so, um,"
"Well, they give a lot more leave."
"I work at N C N B now,"
"and our benefits for maternal and, and parental care and even for elderly people are, are really expanding."
Uh-huh.
"We have more options now then we did when I, my kids were born,"
"with being able to take off full-time longer of, you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for   up to six months."
Uh-huh.
"Oh boy, that's great."
It's really neat.
"I've, I've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week"
"or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
We try to work it with their hours.
"And that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say  okay, I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again."
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals.
"I've,"
"of course it's too late for me so  I've, I've not tried them to see how effective they are"
Yeah
"Yes,"
it's a very good book.
It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do with the money that you save.
Legally?
"Legally, cut money on your taxes."
"Yes,"
"yes,"
Huh.
"legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance,"
"and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to, uh, you know, be wealthier. Uh,"
"he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet. Um,"
"FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it. Uh,"
"the man, uh, has a lot of good ideas,"
"some of them I already knew about,"
some of them I had already practiced.
"But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because, uh,"
And that includes everyone at T I.
"Yes,"
I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one.
Yes.
"Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet."
Yet.
But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.
"You know, survival is a funny state."
"Yeah,"
I know what you mean.
"I, uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor,"
"and I had four non exempts, um, under me."
Yeah.
"And, uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them."
I just couldn't believe it.
"Did, well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now."
"Uh, what, uh, possessed you to get the dog?"
"Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, you know, complications come with it."
Yeah.
"And then with our children, uh,"
"at the time they were, oh, grade five and, and grade eight,"
"so it was an age where it was, uh, we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with, with having a pet."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"Uh,"
"Sure learn a bit, learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
That's good.
That kind of builds some character a little bit.
"So ,"
"Well, that's the idea."
"I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps,"
"uh, it depends on the, on everyone's discipline."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, uh, enforce that the kids look after the dog"
"and, uh, we've had him about four years now."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but I think it does, it, it, you know,"
"it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly, uh,"
"Yeah,"
that's something that's important for sure.
Yeah.
"I think, uh, do you live in a, in a, in a fairly rural part of the, uh"
"Uh,"
"or,"
"Actually no,"
"we live in a, in an area that's, oh, probably about two and a half miles from the university."
Uh-huh.
I want to move up quick.
I want to make money quick.
I want to retire quick.
Yeah.
"And so anything,"
"when the age creeps up, where I'm twenty-three and twenty-four,  I'm thinking my time is running out. You know,"
Uh-huh.
"but I'm actually very, very young."
"Yeah,"
"you are, because what I was going to say is, what you will find is, my background is in journalism and corporate communications,"
Uh-huh.
"and what you'll find is,"
"I mean, I'm just now finally to a point where,"
"I mean I don't know why I didn't, didn't do it sooner,"
Uh-huh.
"but this is probably typical of the women's movement too,  is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want to go back to school."
Uh-huh.
"I'm seriously considering going back to school for law.  Um, which is a complete, I wouldn't say career change, it's, it's a subway ,"
Um.
Uh-huh.
but it's still is a different application.
"And I mean, if you think about it, you know, I I still can have another career."
I mean I've worked for over fifteen years in what I've done.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And I mean, so when you're saying quick, um, I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine,  is thinking that, um, they have to do you know, sort of,  I call kind of, I call it a chewing syndrome."
Uh-huh.
Right.
They have to eat real fast
"they have,  they have to, rapidity of speech,"
"Uh-huh,"
"I mean they, they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"they said, she said that this was almost believable"
that could really happen.
"You know, you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things,"
and you never know.
"Almost,"
"yeah,"
"I, I, it's a little far fetched to, find a bunch of medical students doing it,"
"but but, it was, um, it was, it was odd enough, you know,"
Yeah.
and they didn't just sort of make it silly.
"It was, you know, it was done fairly well, I think."
"So. Actually, I actually enjoyed that as well."
Yeah.
I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.
"I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like,"
so then they get crazy
"and, and it doesn't end like the story has been going."
The story sort of keeps going and going.
Well I guess that covers our topic.
"Yeah,"
great.
"Well, it was, nice talking to you."
Nice talking to you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
That sounded like one.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system, as far as, uh, people dropping out of school, uh, grades on test scores being low, uh, more and more people taking G E D trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school."
Uh-huh.
"I'm, I'm a free-lance writer right now."
Oh.
"And then, um, what I'm doing is working at, um, a an electronics company,  for their company newspaper,  right now on the side,"
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"and then I'm also,"
"actually, I'm excited, tomorrow I have a, uh, luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do,  uh, marketing communications for them."
Huh.
"Huh, okay,"
"I'm a, I'm a news reporter, now,"
Oh you are?
"and what I'm looking for is something in, I really don't want to stay in news,"
"but I would like to stay in journalism,"
and I've been looking for something exactly like that
Here's what you
"this is off the topic,"
"Yeah,"
"well, you know,"
"That's, that's the part that,"
"t-, whether my dentist or"
"That's the part that scares me, you know."
"I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,"
"well no,"
"it's for homosexuals and gays,"
"well no,"
"actually, it's,"
"I mean, you know."
Did they know that all along?
"and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes."
"And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not."
Can't get it from mosquitoes.
"And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,"
No.
"Actually I'm a spectator,"
"and I'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's, or my late husband's, interest in golf."
Uh-huh.
"My husband likes golf also,"
"he's, uh, I guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it"
"But he, he limits it pretty good."
"I, um, have tried to go out and play golf."
"He would love it if I would go out and play with him,"
"but I stand there and swing and swing,"
Uh-huh.
and I can't even hit the ball
I can't even play miniature golf well.
"Yeah,"
I don't either
"Well, there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not,"
but I am very good at watching it on television.
Right.
"And he was really, uh, enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments."
"He could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held, and what the nature of the hole was and,"
"Oh, so he's really into it."
"Oh, yeah,"
he was a good golfer.
Wow.
"And as, and did some, you know, instructions at the country club for a while."
Oh.
"But, uh, golf tended to be"
"I am not really deeply involved in any, following any of the sports."
Yeah.
"But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,"
and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.
"Right,"
"So, I mean all kinds of resources and, you know, just there,"
Yeah.
"and I'd give anything to have that right now in my, in my regular"
"I mean you, you have everything given to you."
I don't see why people wouldn't want that.
"I don't know,"
"I,"
"but then, if I was young, I wouldn't see it."
"Uh-huh,"
"well that's, that's it"
"you, you don't have, uh,  you don't have the view."
"But you know, now that it's gone, I,"
Right.
"I graduated from Texas Tech, more than two years ago, I guarantee,"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, I kind of look back at it sometimes,"
"well that was a lot of fun,"
"but, you know, I'm not sure that, that I took the greatest advantage of, you know, what, I went through there."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
I did a lot
and I experienced a lot
"and I, I feel like I got a good college education"
"but just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library,"
"I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"the informal classes that you don't get credit for, you know ..."
"All right,"
"I guess our, we're in the process of a home repair right at this point"
"because we're, we're painting the outside of our house."
"I don't know,"
Uh-uh.
I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot.
Very few I would imagine.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I get,"
I just couldn't
"I mean it's more money that I make in a year,"
so
"You know, it, you know,"
"me being one person with a above the median income, for New York state, you know,"
Yeah.
"I'm a I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now,"
"and, uh, I,"
Uh-huh.
"even as a somebody making twice what I was making, how could you put half of that into, to your child's education"
Uh-huh.
"and then just when they make, made, make it to the college years it's,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"My God, I can't imagine."
"Well, my, my real feeling about, about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time,"
"yes,"
"you do get an education, you do learn some things,"
but you eventually forget most of it.
Yes.
But what you don't forget is the growing up.
It's really the period when people become adults.
I mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways.
"But, really,"
"it's the entry into adulthood, I think."
"And I think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become, you know, as you gain new social skills, as you become, you know, more of a functioning member of society."
"And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect,"
"In a big city like that most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a you know, basic tract house."
"Well, in the, uh, newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,"
Yeah.
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.
That's exactly right.
That's the way we are.
"We have, uh, one thing we have that we really enjoy here, is we have a hot tub in the back."
"So we have, we have quite a few parties,"
"and uh, seems like everyone that lives around us, ends up, you know, hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone."
"So, uh, that's true"
"that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it, is the houses are too close together."
"But, uh, you know, it's fine for now,"
"hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home."
The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small.
"You know, it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that,"
so.
Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?
"Because it seems like then, that they built the homes much larger"
is that true?
Yeah.
And they've got better closet space.
Yeah.
new houses that I've seen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really it.
That's a plus.
At least we do have like three walk-in closets here.
"So that's, that's maybe not so typical,"
"but, uh,"
It helps a bunch.
Yeah.
"Wizkid was born on 16 July 1990, in Surulere, Lagos. He grew up in an interfaith household with twelve female siblings. His mother is a Pentecostal Christian and his father practices Islam. Wizkid attended Ijebu Ode Grammar School and grew up listening to King Sunny Ade, Fela Kuti and Bob Marley. In a radio interview with Tim Westwood in 2012, he said his father has three wives. In another interview with Adesope of Factory 78 TV, Wizkid said he formed a group called the Glorious Five with a couple of his church friends. The group managed to release an album prior to disbanding. Wizkid went by the stage name Lil Prinz until 2006. He later met OJB Jezreel, a record producer who prevented him from recording for a year. While visiting OJB's Point Beat Studios frequently, he watched 2 Face Idibia record songs for his ""Grass 2 Grace"" album. He was also present during the recording sessions for Sound Sultan's debut album ""Jagbajantis"". He cited Naeto C as one of the people who mentored and coached him when he was 15 years old.

"Tyrolit is an Austrian company that develops, manufactures and markets abrasive products as well as concrete sawing and drilling equipment. With 26 production locations on 5 continents, the TYROLIT group belongs to the world’s largest producers of bonded abrasives. The company is based in Schwaz, Tyrol, Austria. TYROLIT, a registered trademark, was named after the mineral Tyrolite, first described in 1845 in Tyrol."
"Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to manufacture grinding wheels for the production of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born."
"In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced cut-off and grinding wheel SECUR in 1952. The glass fibre reinforcement greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage."
In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for concrete drilling and sawing systems.
"Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company Radiac and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques."
The Tyrolit Group is organized in four divisions:
The Tyrolit Group operates under the following brands:

"His ESPN debut was a second-round knockout of Sergio Rios on Wednesday Night Fights. Williams made his HBO debut against then-undefeated Walter Matthysse, winning by a tenth-round technical knockout. That was followed by a victory over former junior welterweight world champion Sharmba Mitchell. He knocked Mitchell down three times en route to a fourth-round TKO."
"Williams became the mandatory challenger for WBO Welterweight Champion Antonio Margarito. The match took place July 14, 2007, in Carson, California, at the Home Depot Center with Williams winning a unanimous decision in which turned out to be a close fight where Williams' seemingly stronger finish seemed to seal him the decision victory in the eyes of boxing experts and fans alike."
"Williams fought Carlos Quintana on February 9, 2008 in his first defense of his title. Williams lost to Quintana by decision in what many considered a minor upset."
"Williams and Quintana had a rematch at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut on June 7, 2008 for the WBO Welterweight title, at Williams' request. Williams got off to a quick start when a left hand sent Quintana into a daze as several follow-up barrages put Quintana down. He got up, but Williams opened up with dozens of unanswered punches as the referee jumped in to stop the fight while Quintana was going down again."
Williams was rumored to be moving up two weight classes to fight Kelly Pavlik for the WBC Middleweight title but instead Pavlik himself decided to move up two weight classes himself to fight Bernard Hopkins. Williams fought Andy Kolle on September 25. Williams dominated the fight from the start and recorded a first-round knockout in 1:37 seconds.
"After failing to secure another meaningful contest at welterweight, Williams vacated his WBO welterweight title in order to fight Verno Phillips for the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title."
"On November 29, 2008, Williams defeated Phillips by way of TKO after 8 rounds after the Doctor stopped the fight. In doing so he secured the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title."
"Williams fought Winky Wright on April 11, 2009, in a 12-round middleweight bout featured on HBO. Williams defeated Wright in a unanimous decision which was not close on the scorecards – two of the three judges gave Williams all but one round while the third scored all 12 rounds for Williams."
"Williams was then preparing to fight Middleweight Champion Kelly Pavlik in a bout scheduled to take place on October 3, 2009 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The bout was postponed when it was discovered Pavlik had a staph infection in his knuckle and had been rescheduled for December 5. However, the bout was called off for a second time six weeks prior to the fight because Pavlik's infection had not completely healed."
"On December 5, 2009 Paul Williams fought Sergio Martínez in a war of a twelve-round main event. In the first round Martinez was knocked down due to bad balance and a grazing left hand that landed just below the ear. In the final seconds of the 1st round though Martinez scored a knockdown of his own over Williams. The next two rounds were heavily in Martinez's favor as he hit Williams with barrages of counter punches. After Martinez was seemingly won the first 3 rounds, rounds 4-7 showed Williams coming back effectively landing hard lefts to the head of Martinez. In rounds 8-10 Martinez again confused Williams with using different varieties of punches, including straight lead lefts to the body followed by right hooks to the head and straight lefts to the face. The final 2 rounds showed much fatigue in Martinez and Williams but both warriors fought through to the end, although Williams seemed to win both of the last 2 rounds by being the far more active boxer (while the punching exchanges were very closely contested during those final 2 rounds as well), which would ultimately prove to be the difference and as a result of having far superior activity during those final 2 rounds, Williams won a close majority decision over Martinez. The judges scored the fight 114-114, 115-113 for Williams and 119-110 for Williams, thus making Williams emerge as the majority decision winner."
"After his close win over Sergio Martínez, Paul Williams moved on to face Puerto Rican prospect Kermit Cintrón. The two met on May 8, 2010 Live on Saturday Night HBO Boxing. In the fourth round, Kermit Cintron fell out of the ring unintentionally and was not allowed to continue fighting due to hitting the arena floor. Williams was ahead on two of the three judges' scorecards at the time of the stoppage and was declared the winner by split technical decision. Cintron, who believed he should have been ahead on the scorecards, filed a complaint to have the ruling changed to a no-contest, claiming he was not given the five-minute recovery time allowed under California rules."
"A highly anticipated rematch with Sergio Martinez eventually materialized at Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey on November 20, 2010. Upon the Williams camp's insistence, the fight was contested at the catchweight limit of 158 pounds instead of the middleweight limit of 160, with Martinez's WBC Middleweight title on the line. The fight was billed as a potential ""fight-of-the-year,"" however the fight ended abruptly and dramatically when Sergio Martinez delivered a knockout blow with 2:02 left in the 2nd round. The punch was a short left cross that caught Williams right on the chin as he attempted to deliver a left-hand of his own. Williams' right hand was at his waist when the punch landed, rendering Paul Williams unconscious upon contact."
"On July 9, 2011, Paul Williams fought in a light middleweight contest in Atlantic City against former Cuban amateur sensation Erislandy Lara. Throughout the fight, Lara repeatedly hit Williams with hard left hands and appeared to have won the fight convincingly in the eyes of the HBO crew and those sitting at ringside. However, the judges awarded Williams with a narrow majority decision, a highly controversial verdict that ultimately led to the suspension of the three judges by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board."
"On May 27, 2012, Williams was severely injured when he crashed his motorcycle in Georgia. He swerved to avoid hitting a car while traveling at about 75 mph on the motorcycle and was launched sixty feet. Witnesses say he landed on his head and his body ""folded like a suitcase."" The accident left him with a part of his spinal cord severely bruised, paralyzing him from the waist down. Since it was bruised and not severed, it gives him a chance to regain sensation. The doctors told Williams the swelling could go down in a year or two, potentially giving him a chance of walking again. The accident came as Williams was preparing for his PPV main event against Canelo Alvarez on September 15. ""I'm just chilling in a wheelchair because I got tired of walking,"" Williams said in an interview with Jim Gray on ""Showtime Championship Boxing"" on the day he was supposed to fight. ""Whether I am walking or not walking, my game ain't over until the Lord takes my life."""

It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on April 16, 1985 and to the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1986."
"A member of the Dandridge family, cousins of America's first First Lady (Martha Washington), is believed to have built Bride's Hill. Its deep cellar, lighted by oblong ground-level windows, houses a basement kitchen-dining room. On the main floor a broad central hall, with a graceful reverse-flight stairway rising to the low half-story above, separates two large rooms. Allegedly a separate brick kitchen structure once stood to the rear. When absorbed into the vast Joseph Wheeler estate in 1907, the house and surrounding farm became known as Sunnybrook. Located in rural Lawrence County, the house has been unoccupied since the 1980s and is in a state of disrepair."

"The bridge is situated in front of a chapel, connecting Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. The Ponte Maior was the only access across the Minho River until another bridge was constructed in 1816, while Ponte Milenio, a modern bridge, was built later in the millennium."
"The original bridge across the Minho River was built during the first century rule of Emperor Augustus though other sources state that it was built during the Trajan period. A mention is made of this bridge in the will of Doña Urraca, where it is said that it was repaired with funds provided by Ferdinand III. From the Middle Ages, it has provided access to the city of Ourense for trade and pilgrimage.

"The English College Johore Bahru, also known as Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar, abbreviated as English College, EC, MSAB, The College, and sometimes dubbed ""The Pride Of Johore"", is an old premier school in Malaysia. It is an all-boys school in Johor Bahru, Johor. The school is under the royal patronage of the Sultanate of Johor, and it has been awarded the status of Cluster School of Excellence by the Ministry of Education (Malaysia). English College Johore Bahru (EC) is one of the ten oldest English institutions in Malaysia and the oldest school in Johore."
"English College was established on 21 March 1914, with 21 students selected from Bukit Zaharah School. The school was initially located close to the Sungai Chat Palace facing the Lido Beach in Johor Bahru. Remains of the former school site can still be seen but on the site is now the M Suite Hotel, while the campus of vocational studies has been replaced by the old Royal Malaysian Customs of Johore. The 21 students were placed under the tutelage of two teachers brought over from England, Morrison and Holman. These 21 students can be regarded as the pioneers, and from this beginning EC became an educational institution in Johor Bahru."
"The education system of the EC was based on that of the English public school and it adopted the British syllabus, and EC later became a model for other English medium schools in Johor. The teachers of the school were initially recruited from Europe, although later locally trained teachers were used to teach Malay subjects."
"After end of World War I in 1918, the EC held for the first time its "" Junior Cambridge"" examinations, later followed by"" Senior Cambridge"" examinations. However, the results for both examinations were poor, and as a consequence the school was closed temporarily in 1928 for reassessment. It reopened in May of the same year, and after remedial actions had been taken by the school administration, the school met its target at the end of 1928. 143 students were selected to study Mathematics, Science and English. Also in 1928, T. Drury, who had been in the Education Service of Malaya since 1921, was appointed the principal of EC."
"At the end of 1930, the school moved to its present location at Jalan Sungei Chat. Of the original school, only stone blocks and steps are left, which can still be seen at its old site. The new EC was officially opened in early 1931, and the school has since produced many outstanding students. Two of its most famous students are Tun Hussein Onn, who later became the Prime Minister and Tun Musa Hitam, the Deputy Prime Minister."
"Some of the notable teachers there were Pendeta Za'Ba, T. Drury, T. Grundy, Mr Bion Dury, Hj. Zulkipli Bin Hj. Mahmod, Victor Joshua Jeyaretnam (father of J. B. Jeyaretnam) and Mohamad Bin Iskandar (father of Tun Mahathir Mohamad)."
"During the Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1941 to 1945, the EC was used as a military base, a factory, a military hospital, as well as a prison camp by the Japanese. The school reopened in early 1946 after the end of Japanese occupation. H. L. Hill was appointed the Headmaster of EC, and under his leadership, the EC returned to its status of a prestigious school. In 1949, the first group of girls was admitted to the EC."
"In 1960, following the end of the British rule in Malaya, the name was changed to"" 'Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar""' (MSAB) after Sultan Sir Abu Bakar of Johor who was the Father of Modern Johore. More local teachers were employed to teach at the school. In 1961, the school badge and uniforms were introduced for the first time. This was followed by creation of the school song with lyrics written by Yusof bin Karto set to music by Lim Teck Siang."
"In 1974, EC celebrated its Diamond Jubilee, and the then Deputy Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn as well as all the former students were invited to the celebration. Also in 1974, the first batch of students of Sekolah Menengah Sains Johor was placed temporarily in the English College until the completion of the school's building in the month of April 1974."
"During the 1980s and 1990s, the school was further enlarged and facilities were added for student's use in accordance with the requirements of Ministry of Education and the introduction of Integrated Secondary School Curriculum (ICSS)."
"In 2005 EC recorded the best PMR performance for Johor Bahru when three EC students were selected as national top PMR candidates, namely Joshua Soo Iyn Zhou, Mukeshakumar and Wong Guo Wai and Yong Jenn. EC was confirmed by the Ministry of Education as a Premier school. In 2007, the company won the award for Excellent Crew EC Best Company and Best Service in Young Entrepreneurs Convention 11th. PMR 2007 once again recorded excellent results when an EC students selected as outstanding PMR Johor."
"On 5 May 2009, the English College was officially selected by the Ministry of Education as a Cluster School of Excellence. EC was selected based on its excellence in various aspects such as the achievement of excellence in the Paralympic Games, excellence in mathematics in the PMR and SPM, excellence in Orchestra and Rugby team as well as the various programs organised by EC, for example the creation of the Tun Hussein Onn Museum and Visual Arts Gallery EC."
"The college celebrated its centenary on 21 March, an event attended by dignitaries, old boys, and townspeople. Among the attendees were the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Al-Marhum Sultan Iskandar, along with Minister of Johor, Tan Sri Khaled Nordin as well as notable alumni and other old boys and former students of the English College. On this day, a handwritten letter Royal Professor Ungku Aziz Ungku Abd Hamid was read by his daughter Zeti Akhtar Aziz. Centenary Celebration Dinner took place at the school field and was attended by all the old boys and old staff, with performances from Datuk Sheikh Abdullah Ahmad, Ajai, Ayai Illusi and Rahmat Mega, who are also old boys of the college."
"The first building was at Bukit Zaharah Palace in 1914. The Western architectural features can be seen in the use of classical Ionic columns, decorative plasters for the outer walls and interiors of the building and decorative glass above the windows and doors of keystone shape. Similar to other Western architectural features, the windows of this building are of segmental shape. The second school building was initially located close to the Sungai Chat Palace facing the Lido Beach in Johor Bahru. Remains of the former school site can still be seen but on the site is now the M Suite Hotel. The most recognisable feature of the school is The New School (built in 1930), a building with pseudo English Classic Victorian architecture once be a Malay Teacher Training College at Johore Bahru and later on change into the famous English College Johore Bahru in 1931. The school is built to accommodate 300 students initially. Thus, the planning for the construction of the East Wing was considered. The block was completed by 1931 when it took in its first nucleus student. The school compound was enlarged, and a sports complex and a library was constructed. On 2001, an engineering block and a mini auditorium were completed. Furthermore, Seri Budiman Hall was completed and set to be a most advance hall in Malaysia on the year of 1950. On 2008, the Tunku Mahkota of Johor, Tunku Ibrahim Ismail, son of HRH Sultan Iskandar consented to the launching ceremony for the construction of the hall that was named as Sultan Iskandar Hall."
"On every Wednesday, co-curricular activities are usually held. There are two types of co-curricular activities, and these are club & societies and uniformed bodies. Every student has to wear their uniformed body uniforms whatever the activities may be on the day."
"The uniformed bodies that are present in the school are English College Marching Band, Persatuan Kadet Bersatu Malaysia Darat (Army), Malaysian Red Crescent Society (BSMM), 1st Johore BahruScout, 5th Johore Bahru SeaScout, Malaysian Fire Brigade Cadet, Kadet Remaja Sekolah Malaysia, Persatuan Kadet Bersatu Malaysia Laut (Navy), Persatuan Seni Silat Olahraga, Malaysian Police Bridgade Cadet, and St.John Ambulance Bridgade Cadet (Div 1)"
"The school has three sport fields. One is in front of the Johor Darul Takzim F.C exercise field, reserved for rugby. The second field is in front of the New School reserved for soccer. The third open space is in front of the Sultan Iskandar Hall reserved for cricket, baseball, hockey practice and it is used for various purposes and competitions. In 2012, The Pavilion suitable for various purposes was completed along with the seatings at the school field. On 2013, The College set to be a first school that has a paintball field in Malaysia."
"The school excels in sports and Olympiad events. It became a powerhouse in rugby during the 1950s and still has one of the best rugby school teams in the Johore. Nicknamed ""Stingboks"" after the South Africa national rugby union team for its all yellow and green strip, they perform the haka before matches. It has held a match series against Singapore elite schools since 1960. In odd-numbered years, the match is held in Seri Gelam Field( Home of English College Rugby Team). In addition to this, EC competes with rival Royal Military College, Malay College Kuala Kangsar, Sultan Abdul Hamid College, Sultan Ismail College and Tanjung Puteri Vocational College every year in a multi-games carnival."
"Other than rugby, EC has excelled in sports such as Soccer, Hockey, Athletics, Chess, Cricket, Basketball,and Bowling. English College Football Club (ECFC) was a powerhouse in Johore during the 1950s and 1960s, meanwhile English College Bowling Team has produced two of the best national players in Malaysia, one of whom was entered in Sukma Games. English College has produced some of the best and most talented national players of any sport in the country."
"The Annual College Sports Day always held at ruggers field. In 1990, The Annual English College Sports Day start held at Larkin Stadium. On 2013, English College decided that The Annual Sports Day held at school field for the first time since 1981."
"The shield is a symbol of determination, the colour green symbolises ""purity"", and yellow symbolises ""loyalty to king and country"". (Yellow is considered a royal colour in Malaysia, and it usually represents the sovereignty of the reigning monarchs)"
"On the left and right sides of the shield are laurel wreaths symbolising the close co-operation and understanding among the citizens of EC to keep its glorious hope. The school motto is ""Labore Et Honore"", which is Latin for ""Labour And Honour""."
leads to the perturbation of both the linear dispersion relation of photons and constant dispersion of charge waves by the avoided crossing between the two dispersion lines of polaritons.
Similarly to the acoustic and the optical phonons and far from the resonance one branch is photon-like while the other charge wave-like.
Mathematically the Hopfield dielectric for the one mode of excitation is equivalent to the Trojan wave packet in the harmonic
approximation. The Hopfield model of the dielectric predicts the existence of eternal trapped frozen photons similar to
the Hawking radiation inside the matter with
the density proportional to the strength of the matter-field coupling.
The Hamiltonian of the quantized Lorentz dielectric consisting of formula_1 harmonic oscillators interacting with the
quantum electromagnetic field can be written in the dipole approximation as:
and defining projections of oscillator charge waves onto the electromagnetic field
polarization directions
after dropping the longitudinal contributions not interacting with the electromagnetic field one may obtain the Hopfield Hamiltonian
Because the interaction is not
mixing polarizations this can be transformed to the normal form with the eigen-frequencies of two polaritonic branches:

"The Lanyang Museum (LYM; ) is a museum about the local area in Toucheng Township, Yilan County, Taiwan."
"In 1989, local Yilan personnel proposed the establishment of Kailan Museum. In December 1992, Yilan County Government established the Museum Preparatory and Planning Committee and the official name of the museum was chosen to be Lanyang Museum. The museum location was chosen to be near Wushi Harbor area in Toucheng Township. In September 1994, the Yilan County Government appointed National Museum of Natural Science and Building and Planning Research Foundation of National Taiwan University to form the planning team to implement Lanyang Museum Overall Development and Planning Research which was completed in 1995. In March 1999, the Lanyang Museum Preparatory Office was established. Artech architecture was awarded the design and construction for the museum in April 2000."
"In October 2001, the Museum section of Cultural Affairs Bureau of Yilan County Government handed over 1,924 artifacts to the museum, followed by Wangye Boat, Bozai Boat and tri-wheeler in a ceremony held at the lobby of Cultural Affairs Bureau building of the county government in January 2003."
The museum groundbreaking ceremony was held on 31 July 2014 at Wushi Harbor and construction began on 2 August 2004 and it began its first stage of opening on 18 May 2010 where only group visits made by advance reservations were accepted. The museum was finally opened officially to public on 16 October 2010.
The museum building was designed by a team led by Kris Yao those design was inspired by the cuestas commonly seen along Beiguan Coast. The museum adopts the geometric shapes of the cuestas where the roof protrudes from the ground at an angle of 20 degrees meeting a wall which rises from the ground at an angle of 70 degrees. Thus the building emerges from the ground in a similar fashion to those cuestas.
"The museum features exhibits showcasing the topography of Yilan, including the mountains, the plains, and the sea."
The museum is accessible within walking distance northeast from Toucheng Station of Taiwan Railways.

"Since Gilbert and Sullivan used the phrase in ""The Mikado"", ""short, sharp shock"" has been used in political discourse in the UK. The phrase met renewed popularity with respect to government policy on young offenders pursued by the Conservative government of 1979–1990 under Margaret Thatcher, having appeared in the 1979 Conservative Policy manifesto, which promised that the party would ""experiment with a tougher regime as a short, sharp shock for young criminals"". These policies led to the enactment of the Criminal Justice Acts of 1982 and 1988 which, among other reforms, replaced borstals with the youth detention centres in place today."

= = = Strict father model = = =
"The strict father model of parenting is one which values strict discipline, particularly by the father, in parenting."
Ideas involved in this model include:
"This model of child-rearing would involve, for example, allowing children to cry themselves to sleep on the grounds that picking up a child when it should be sleeping on its own improperly fosters dependence on the parents. In his book ""Dare to Discipline"", James Dobson advocates the strict father model. However, some researchers have linked authoritarian childrearing with children who withdraw, lack spontaneity, and have lesser evidence of conscience."
"The strict father model is discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including ""Moral Politics,"" ""Don't Think of an Elephant,"" ""The Political Mind,"" and ""Whose Freedom?"". In these books, the strict father model is contrasted with the nurturant parent model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then conservative politics correspond to the strict father model. For example, conservatives think that adults should refrain from looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent."

When he returned to Kentucky, the band reformed and recruited Bob Herdman, who brought them two songs to record. After they did, they changed their name to Audio Adrenaline and signed a deal with Forefront Records. After more than twenty years of success with the band and eight studio albums, Stuart and the band decided to retire on January 2006.

= = = Word superiority effect = = =
"In cognitive psychology, the word superiority effect (WSE) refers to the phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings. Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords (e.g. ""WOSK"") and pseudohomophones (e.g. ""WERK"")."
"The effect was first described by Cattell (1886), and important contributions came from Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970). Cattell first wrote, ""I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no connexion as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters""."
"G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word ""card"", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as ""cqrd"". Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word."
The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during reading. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using connectionist networks.
"The WSE has traditionally been tested using a tachistoscope, as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope."
"A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if ""WOSK"" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether ""K"" or ""H"" had been in ""WOSK"". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. ""WKRG"") or single letters."
"The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have semantic value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind)."
"Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word, or the duration of the masks."
"A third ""Yorga"" film, which would have featured a broken Count Yorga living in Los Angeles's sewers and creating an army of undead street people, never materialised."
"Though Count Yorga is referred to as ""the Deathmaster"" in publicity for this film, a later film called ""The Deathmaster"", also starring Robert Quarry as a vampire, has no relation to the Count Yorga series."
The film was released theatrically in the US by American International Pictures in 1971.
"The film was released on VHS home video (full screen format) in 1993 by Orion Home Video, which once held home video distribution rights to many titles in the American International Pictures catalog."
"The film was given a second VHS release by MGM Home Entertainment in September 2000. It later was released on DVD by MGM in 2005 as part of its Midnite Movies series. The disc was a double-feature release, pairing the film with ""Count Yorga, Vampire""."
"When CBS ran the movie in the 1970s on its ""Friday Night Late Movie"", the on-screen title was ""Yorga Returns""."
"Howard Thompson of ""The New York Times"" panned the film as ""a dull, amateurish vampire brew."" ""Variety"" called it ""a solid follow-up"" to the original and ""a handsome-looking film which rings the bell on both the shocker and satirical level."" Gene Siskel of the ""Chicago Tribune"" gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it ""extremely frightening"" and adding, ""Persons familiar with the original will find the sequel better photographed, better acted and containing more mayhem a minute."" Kevin Thomas of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote, ""Those who saw 'Count Yorga' will be disappointed. Those who only see 'The Return' will wonder what all the fuss was about in regard to the original. In the first film comedy gave way to terror; in this self-conscious sequel the two elements tend to cancel each other out. The result is a pretty silly show."" David Pirie of ""The Monthly Film Bulletin"" wrote that Count Yorga had been resurrected ""with considerably more enterprise and panache than before."" He praised the acting as being ""of a generally high standard"" and the castle set as ""skilfully utilised to give the impression of a labyrinth of Borgesian proportions,"" though he criticized ""a totally unnecessary and feeble attempt to make the Count into a sympathetic figure through such lines as, 'The most fragile emotion ever known has entered my breast.'"""

"The Nuoli class motor gunboats () was a series of thirteen fast attack craft (gun) of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1961 by Oy Laivateollisuus Ab in Turku, and modernized in 1979. The Nuoli motor gunboats played a very important role in naval training and were in service to early 90s."
"There are two distinctive versions, 1-10 and 11-13. The former could be distinguished by having a higher superstructure. All were equipped with three Soviet-made V-12 diesel engines. There was no separate cruise engine, except from a small auxiliary engine that produced electricity. The vessels were first equipped with large screws, but later changed to smaller, albeit equally effective screws, manufactured by Finnscrew."
"The Nuoli-class was planned to be armed with electrically controlled Bofors 40/70-system, but limitations of the auxiliary engine prevented this. For a brief time, Madsen 20/60 were replaced with Breda 12.7 mm heavy machine-gun which came from WW II-period Fiat G50-fighters; the change back to Madsen was done in 1981."
"Finland was forbidden to have torpedo boats after World War II, but the Nuoli class could quickly be converted into such, if need arose. in 1982 Nuoli-6 was transferred and ferried to Obbnäs torpedo test station to be used as test vessel for a new Finnish-origin torpedo system, which failed. The trip to Obbnäs was made in heavy weather - the waves were so hard that they damaged the wooden support structure of the bow. Nuoli-6 was driven aground in Obbnäs 1983 (summer/autumn) and was stricken."
"As service vessel these boats gave one a true feeling of being a sailor. Constructed of wood, they leaked ""a bit"" an so the atmosphere was rather moist. Living quarters were limited - even those of the commanding officer. There was no privacy at all - on Nuoli one was true member of the crew."
"The vessels are today spread all over Finland, and one is in Germany (Nuoli 12). Nuoli 8 is preserved at the Turku marine museum ""Forum Marinum""."

The 1991 Football League Cup Final was a football match played on 21 April 1991 between Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday. It was the first of two years that the competition was sponsored by Rumbelows.
"Despite the previous season's FA Cup winners, Manchester United, being favourites to lift the trophy, Second Division side Sheffield Wednesday won the match 1–0, the winning goal scored by John Sheridan, giving the Owls their first League Cup title in a season when they also won promotion back to the top flight. The match is regarded as one of the most memorable League Cup finals of all time."
The trophy was presented to Wednesday skipper Nigel Pearson by Rumbelows employee of the year Tracy Bateman. Pearson was also named man of the match.
"The Football League Cup is a cup competition open to clubs in the Premier League and The Football League. It is played on a knockout basis, with the exception of the semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. As clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League, both teams entered the competition in the second round."
"Manchester United's second-round tie saw them drawn against Fourth Division Halifax Town; they won the first leg at The Shay 3–1, with goals from Clayton Blackmore, Brian McClair and Neil Webb, before Viv Anderson and Steve Bruce gave them a 2–1 win at Old Trafford and a 5–2 aggregate victory. Anderson, who was by now rarely used in the United first team, went on to be sold to Sheffield Wednesday three months later, his appearance for United in the early stages of the competition making him ineligible for Wednesday's matches and denying him the chance to add to the two League Cup medals he had won with Nottingham Forest and a later medal in the competition won with Arsenal."
"They were then drawn against rivals and reigning First Division champions Liverpool in the third round, where Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe joined Bruce on the score sheet in a 3–1 home win. In the fourth round, a 19-year-old Sharpe scored a hat-trick in addition to goals from Blackmore, Hughes and Danny Wallace to give United a 6–2 away win over Arsenal, who would go on to win the First Division title that season, just over a month after the two teams had been involved in a mass brawl during a 1–0 Arsenal win at Old Trafford that saw both teams deducted points."
"In the fifth round, United were held to a 1–1 draw away to Southampton, Hughes scoring their only goal; Hughes was again the only United player on the score sheet in the replay a week later, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 win that put them into the semi-finals. Southampton striker Alan Shearer, who within months was reported to be transfer target for Manchester United, scoring all of Southampton's goals during the two cup clashes with United."
"Goals from McClair and Sharpe gave United a 2–1 win in the first leg of the semi-final at home to Leeds United, and Sharpe scored again in the second leg – his sixth League Cup goal of the season – as United won 1–0, and 3–1 on aggregate, to put them into their second League Cup final."
"Sheffield Wednesday, whose last major honour had been the FA Cup in 1935, were fresh from relegation to the Second Division when they were drawn against Third Division Brentford in the second round, winning 2–1 in each of the two legs to put them into the third round. There they met fellow Second Division side Swindon Town, who held them to a goalless draw at Hillsborough, before succumbing to a 1–0 defeat at the County Ground in the replay a week later. Wednesday required another replay in the fourth round, after they played out another draw at home to Derby County, but beat them 2–1 at the Baseball Ground two weeks later."
"The quarter-final saw Wednesday drawn away to Coventry City, where a 1-0 victory for Wednesday ended any hopes that Coventry's new player-manager Terry Butcher might have had of beginning his managerial career with silverware. Their semi-final opponents were drawn against Chelsea. The first leg of the semi-final was played at Stamford Bridge, where goals from Peter Shirtliff and David Hirst gave them a 2–0 win, before Nigel Pearson, Danny Wilson and Paul Williams gave them a 3–1 win in the second leg at Hillsborough to put them into the final, 5–1 on aggregate. It was Wednesday's first Wembley cup final in 25 years."
"The broadcast of this League Cup final caused controversy in Yorkshire, where instead of showing the post-match celebrations (as London Weekend Television did), Yorkshire Television decided to cut the broadcast short to show a programme titled ""War of the Monster Trucks"". People from Sheffield often cite this event as a demonstration of the station's bias towards West Yorkshire, Leeds and above all Leeds United. The incident inspired the name of the Sheffield Wednesday fanzine ""War of the Monster Trucks""."

"Operation Christmas Drop is a tradition that started in 1952 that serves as a training mission for the U.S. Air Force. It has since become the longest-running U.S. Department of Defense mission in full operation, and the longest-running humanitarian airlift in the world. Supported by the local communities of Guam, it is primarily conducted from Andersen Air Force Base and Yokota Air Base, and targets Micronesia."
"The operation was first conducted in 1951. Then, the aircrew of a WB-29 aircraft assigned to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, formerly assigned to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, was flying a mission to the south of Guam over the Micronesian atoll of Kapingamarangi. When they saw the islanders waving to them, the crew quickly gathered some items they had on the plane, placed them in a container with a parachute attached and dropped the cargo as they circled again."
"A witness to the first drop on the island of Agrigan said ""We saw these things come out of the back of the airplane and I was yelling: 'There are toys coming down'"". At the time the island had no electricity or running water, and the islands were periodically hit by typhoons. Some of the first containers failed to arrive where intended, and islanders swam out to retrieve some, while others were discovered months later some miles away."
"Today this unique Christmas tradition is continued with the donations from the residents and businesses of Guam. Each box dropped from a C-130 aircraft weighs nearly and contains items such as fishing nets, construction materials, powdered milk, canned goods, rice, coolers, clothing, shoes, toys and school supplies."
"It is the oldest ongoing Department of Defense mission which remains in full operation, and the longest running humanitarian airlift in the world. By 2006, more than of supplies were delivered. The operation gives troops the chance to practice humanitarian aid drops, as the troops will later be expected to conduct drops over Iraq or Afghanistan after deployment."
"Volunteers from Andersen Air Force Base, including 734th Air Mobility Squadron, and both crew and aircraft from the 36th Airlift Squadron at Yokota Air Base, Japan, participate in the operation. Members of the Guam community also help the operation. Money is raised for the operation by sponsored activities such as golf tournaments and sponsored runs, as well as local businesses sponsoring individual boxes."
The 2006 operation saw 140 boxes dropped to 59 islands. The 2011 operation included dropping twenty five boxes of IV fluids to Fais Island in order to combat a local outbreak of dengue fever. The containers are dropped in water just off the beaches in order to avoid them hitting any of the locals.
"In 2014, The Pacific Air Forces delivered 50,000 pounds of supplies to 56 Micronesian Islands."
"In 2015, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and the Royal Australian Air Force participated in the operation along with the United States Air Force. Japan and Australia each provided one C-130 Hercules to join the three C-130's provided by the United States. The JASDF and RAAF also participated in the 2016 and 2017 operations."
"December of 2017 marked the inaugural training event for the new C-130J from Yokota AB as well as the first quad-lateral event with the JASDF, RAAF and Philippine Air Force."
= = = John McCabe (composer) = = =
"John McCabe, (21 April 1939 – 13 February 2015) was a British composer and pianist. He created works in many different forms, including symphonies, ballets, and solo works for the piano. He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990. Guy Rickards described him as ""one of Britain's finest composers in the past half-century"" and ""a pianist of formidable gifts and wide-ranging sympathies"" ."
"McCabe was born in Huyton, Liverpool on 21 April 1939 (; ; ; ; ). His father was a physicist . McCabe was badly burned in an accident when he was a child and was home schooled for eight years . During this time, McCabe said that there was ""a lot of music in the house"", which inspired his future career . He explained ""My mother was a very good amateur violinist and there were records and printed music everywhere. I thought that if all these guys – Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert – can do it, then so can I!"" . By the age of 11 McCabe had composed 13 symphonies, but he later suppressed them, believing they were not good enough (; ). He subsequently attended Liverpool Institute ."
"After studies at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern) and in Munich, with composers Humphrey Proctor-Gregg, Thomas Pitfield, Harald Genzmer and others (; ; ), he embarked upon a career as both a composer and a virtuoso pianist (; ). Guy Rickards considers McCabe's early works to have been overlooked because he was perceived as a pianist rather than a composer . One of his early successes was the orchestral song cycle ""Notturni ed Alba"" (1970), based on a set of poems in medieval Latin about the theme of night (; ), which was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""an intoxicating creation, full of tingling atmosphere and slumbering passion"" (quoted in }}). His Concerto for Orchestra (1982) brought him international recognition , but it was not until the 1990s that he came to be viewed primarily as a composer, with the successes of the piano work ""Tenebrae"" (1992–93), which marked the deaths in 1992 of musicians Sir Charles Groves, William Mathias and Stephen Oliver, and was written for Barry Douglas; his Fourth Symphony, ""Of Time and the River"" (1993–94); and his third ballet ""Edward II"" (1995) , which won the 1998 Barclays Theatre Award ."
"He worked in almost every genre, though large-scale forms lie at the heart of his catalogue with seven symphonies, two dozen concertante works and eight ballet scores to his name . His numerous concerti include four for his own instrument, the piano (1966–76), three for one or two violins (1959, 1980, 2003) as well as for viola (1962), harpsichord (1968), oboe d'amore (1972), clarinet (1977), orchestra (1982), trumpet (1987) and flute (1990), and double concertos for viola and cello (1965) and clarinet and oboe (1988). His chamber works include seven string quartets, the third of which (1979) was inspired by the landscape of the Lake District . His solo instrumental music was mainly written for the piano; he composed 13 studies for the instrument, including ""Gaudí"" (1970), inspired by the architect; ""Mosaic"" (1980), inspired by Islamic art; and a series of seven (2000–9) each explicitly drawing inspiration from a different composer (; }. Other significant piano works include the ""Haydn Variations"" (1983), written to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth (; ; )."
"McCabe's style evolved gradually from an initial lyrical constructivism through a serialist phase, with a fascination with repetitive patterns leading to a more complex combination of processes to achieve more subtle forms of continuity . Rickards states that his influences included Vaughan Williams, Britten, Tippett and Karl Amadeus Hartmann , and he was also influenced by non-classical music including rock and jazz ."
He had a long-lasting association with the Presteigne Festival .
"McCabe first became known as a pianist. His repertoire was wide, from pre-classical to modern composers . He specialised in twentieth-century music, particularly by English composers. He gave the UK premiere of John Corigliano's Piano Concerto . Another specialism was the music of Haydn; McCabe's ""definitive"" mid-1970s recording of Haydn's complete piano sonatas was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""one of the great recorded monuments of the keyboard repertoire"" (quoted in ). He recorded several CDs with the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber ."
"From 1965 to 1968 McCabe was pianist‐in‐residence at University College, Cardiff . He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990, where his efforts to enhance the college's profile resulted in its merging with Thames Valley University (; . He also held visiting professorships at the universities of Melbourne, Australia and Cincinnati, USA during the 1990s . Among his notable pupils is Canadian composer Gary Kulesha ."
"McCabe wrote guides to the music of Haydn, Bartók and Rachmaninoff, and a book on contemporary English composer Alan Rawsthorne ."
McCabe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1985 for his services to music (; ; ) He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool .
"In 2014, McCabe won the Classical Music Award at the 59th Ivor Novello Awards ."
"He married Monica Smith, a former head of the Sittingbourne Music Society, in 1974 (; ). In December 2012 McCabe was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He continued to compose music during his treatment (; )."
John McCabe died after a long illness on 13 February 2015 .

"Lavender was still in private practice when Governor Henry Bellmon appointed him to fill a vacancy on the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 1965, representing District No. 1. The vacancy was caused by the impeachment of Justice N. B. Johnson. The next year, he was elected to hold that same seat for a full six-year term, ending in 1972, and he was subsequently reelected in 1972, 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, and 2002. While on the Supreme Court, Lavender authored an opinion abrogating state sovereign immunity (""Vanderpool v. State"", 1983)."
"He retired from the Oklahoma Supreme Court, effective August 1, 2007. A retirement ceremony was held in his office on July 23, 2007, where his family, friends and present and former Supreme Court colleagues honored him for his 42 years of service on the court, longer than any other justice in the history of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Then-Governor Brad Henry read a quote that Lavender had made when he first took office. ""My sole ambition as a member of this court is to study the cases, work hard, and so conduct my personal life as to inspire confidence and earn the trust of the people in this court as an institution. It is my opinion that a strong and independent judiciary composed of men of unimpeachable integrity is an absolute essential to the continuation of our society.”"
"Later, Governor Henry appointed John F. Reif to succeed Justice Lavender."

= = = Kirana gharana = = =
"Kirana gharana is one of the most prolific Indian classical khyal gharanas, and is concerned foremost with perfect intonation of notes (swara)."
"The central concern of the Kirana style is swara, or individual notes, in particular precise tuning and expression of notes. In the Kirana Gayaki (singing style), the individual notes (swaras) of the raga are considered not just random points in the scale but independent realms of music capable of horizontal expansion. Highly emotional ""pukars"" in the higher octaves form a part of the musical experience. Another unique feature of this gharana is the highly intricate and ornate use of the ""sargam taan"" (weaving patterns with the notations themselves) introduced by Abdul Karim Khan under influence from the Carnatic classical style."
In the late nineteenth century Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan revolutionized the khayal gayaki by introducing the vilambit (a slow tempo section) to delineate the structure of the raga note by note.
"Frequently performed ragas by musicians of the gharana include Todi, Lalit, Multani, Patdeep, Puriya, Marwa, Shuddha Kalyan, Darbari Kanhara, and Komal-Rishabh Asavari. Noted Marathi thespian PuLa Deshpande has pointed out that performers from the Kirana gharana are particularly fond of the Komal Re/Rishabh (or minor second in the western system) note of the classical music scale, a frequent feature of these commonly performed ragas."
"In the 19th-century the Kirana gharana coalesced around Miyan Bande Ali Khan, a player of the rudra veena. The gharana's style was further developed, and established as one of the prominent styles in modern Indian classical music in the late 19th / early 20th centuries by the musicians Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was an extremely popular musician, and was thus highly influential in popularizing the gharana. Some trace the gharana's roots back farther to the 13th-century musician Gopal Nayak, a Hindu musician (of the dhrupad style) who later converted to Islamic Sufism and in the process assimilated the predominantly Muslim khyal musical style."
"The name of this school of music derives from Kirana or Kairana, a town and tehsil of Shamli District in Uttar Pradesh. It is the birthplace of Abdul Karim Khan (1872–1937), who was one of the most important musicians of this gharana and of Hindustani music in general in the twentieth century. A frequent visitor to the Court of Mysore, Abdul Karim Khan was also influenced by Carnatic music, and roots of the tradition can also be traced back to his great-grandfather Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula, the brother of Ghulam Ali."
"Owing to the popularity of Abdul Karim Khan, most contemporary Hindustani musicians from Karnataka are exponents of Kirana gharana, and Kirana gharana in turn has absorbed many of the features of the Carnatic tradition. The culturally rich border region between Karnataka and Maharashtra is particularly well known for its association with the gharana."
"The other primary master of the gharana, in the early 20th century, was Abdul Karim Khan's cousin Abdul Wahid Khan who chose to settle at Lahore, Pakistan after the 1947 Partition of British India."
= = = James Robinson Graves = = =
"James Robinson Graves (April 10, 1820 – June 26, 1893) was an American Baptist preacher, publisher, evangelist, debater, author, and editor. He is most noted as the original founder of what is now the Southwestern family of companies. Graves was born in Chester, Vermont, the son of Z. C. Graves, and died in Memphis, Tennessee. His remains are interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis."
"In 1855, Graves established Southwestern Publishing House in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's name was chosen because, at that time, Nashville was in the southwestern part of the United States. Southwestern originally published ""The Tennessee Baptist"", a Southern Baptist newspaper, and religious booklets which were sold by mail for 20¢ and 30¢ each."
"Prior to the Civil War, most Bibles were printed in the North, rather than the Confederacy. Graves acquired stereotype plates from the North and began printing Bibles for sale in August 1861. He also produced and sold educational books. After the 1864 Battle of Nashville resulted in a Union victory, Graves relocated to Memphis, as he felt vulnerable because of articles he had published against the North. The company resumed publishing in 1867."
"In 1868, Graves discontinued the company’s mail order business, and began training young men as independent dealers to sell Bibles and educational books door-to-door as a way to earn money for college. Graves retired in 1871."
"Though raised in a Congregationalist family, Graves joined a Baptist church at age 15. Contemporary fellow ministers in the Southern Baptist Convention praised his preaching abilities. Thomas Treadwell Eaton wrote, ""We have seen him hold a congregation packed uncomfortably, for three hours and a half without any sign of weariness on their part. This was not done once or twice, but scores of times."" Denominational leader James Bruton Gambrell described one of Graves' sermons at a small church in Mississippi as ""The Greatest Sermon I Ever Heard."" Scholars have recognized Graves as an early and chief promulgator of the Landmark movement. The subject's Nashville publishing house, Graves, Marks, & Co, which later became South-Western Publishing, published all of fellow 'Landmarker' Amos Cooper Dayton's books. Both were expelled as 'schismatics' between 1858 and 1859 from the Nashville First Baptist Church due to their theological perspectives on their apostolic connection."

"The half-pass is a lateral movement seen in dressage, in which the horse moves forward and sideways at the same time. Unlike the easier leg-yield, the horse is bent in the direction of travel, slightly around the rider's inside leg. The outside hind and forelegs should cross over the inside legs, with the horse's body parallel to the arena wall and his forehand leading. The horse should remain forward, balanced, and bent, moving with cadence. The inside hind leg remains engaged throughout the half-pass, and the horse should not lose its rhythm."
"The half-pass is a variation of haunches-in (travers), executed on a diagonal line instead of along the wall. At higher levels it is used to perform a counter-change of hand, combining more than two half-passes with changes of direction in a zig-zag pattern."
= = = Clustered web hosting = = =
"Clustered hosting is a type of web hosting that spreads the load of hosting across multiple physical machines, or node, increasing availability and decreasing the chances of one service (e.g., FTP or email) affecting another (e.g., MySQL). Many large websites run on clustered hosting solutions, for example, large discussion forums will tend to run using multiple front-end webservers with multiple back-end database servers."
"Typically, most hosting infrastructures are based on the paradigm of using a single physical machine to host multiple hosted services, including web, database, email, FTP and others. A single physical machine is not only a single point of failure, but also has finite capacity for traffic, that in practice can be troublesome for a busy website or for a website that is experiencing transient bursts in traffic."
"By clustering services across multiple hardware machines and using load balancing, single points of failure can be eliminated, increasing availability of a website and other web services beyond that of ordinary single server hosting. A single server can require periodic reboots for software upgrades and the like, whereas in a clustered platform you can stagger the restarts such that the service is still available whilst still upgrading all necessary machines in the cluster."
"Clustered hosting is similar to cloud hosting, in that the resources of many machines are available for a website to utilize on demand, making scalability a large advantage to a clustered hosting solution."

The main venue for the conference was the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) in downtown Toronto."
"The conference theme was ""Time to Deliver"". The conference was focused on the promises and progress made to scale-up treatment, care and prevention."
In particular:
"Activities included cultural, youth and outreach programmes as well as a Global Village, which served as an international gathering place with displays of culture, food, community, and a marketplace."
"Events open to delegates and the public included The International AIDS Vigil, a public memorial to all those who have died of HIV/AIDS. The Vigil took place on at 9 pm on 17 August at Yonge-Dundas Square, Toronto."
"Well-known attendees and speakers included Governor General Michaëlle Jean, Stephen Lewis (the United Nations special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa), Bill and Melinda Gates (for the Gates Foundation), Richard Gere, Alicia Keys, and Bill Clinton."
"Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who decided not to attend the conference, was criticized by Conference co-chairman Dr. Mark Wainberg in his speech, saying, ""We are dismayed that the prime minister of Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper, is not here this evening...The role of prime minister includes the responsibility to show leadership on the world stage. Your absence sends the message that you do not consider HIV/AIDS as a critical priority, and clearly all of us here disagree with you"". Canadian Minister of Health Tony Clement attended in Harper's place. Harper's absence from the conference is the second time the Canadian head of government has decided not to attend the conference. In 1996, former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien did not attend the conference."
"A second controversy, that followed Mr. Stephen Harper's choice to not attend, was the fact that 151 delegates who were in attendance refused to return to their home countries – instead opting to seek asylum in Canada. This development seriously hurt the credibility of the conference and many suggested that the Prime Minister's office may have been justified in its decision to not have Mr. Harper in attendance."

"State Route 107 (SR 107) is a state highway serving Grays Harbor County in the U.S. state of Washington. The highway travels northeast from U.S. Route 101 (US 101) south of Cosmopolis to an interchange with US 12 in Montesano. SR 107 was created during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to a branch of Primary State Highway 9 (PSH 9), established earlier in 1937."
"SR 107 begins at an intersection with US 101 in rural Grays Harbor County between Cosmopolis and Raymond. The highway travels north along the Little North River and east along the Chehalis River through the communities of Preachers Slough and Melbourne. SR 107 turns north in South Montesano and crosses the Chehalis River into the city of Montesano before the designation ends at a diamond interchange with US 12, while the roadway continues north as Main Street into the city."
"Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,300 and 5,800 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Montesano area."
"PSH 9 was created with the primary and secondary state highways in 1937, including a branch that connects the main highway and US 410 in Montesano to US 101 and PSH 14 near Artic. The current truss bridge over the Chehalis River between South Montesano and Montesano was built in the 1950s alongside two other bridges in the area by the Department of Highways. SR 107 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering to replace the PSH 9 branch and was codified in 1970. The new highway was truncated to its current terminus, a diamond interchange with US 12, after Montesano was bypassed by US 12 in 1967. The highway is closed occasionally by seasonal flooding, most recently in 1994 and 2008."

It is occasionally referred to simply as Baranof. Baranof Warm Springs is located at ."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on Warm Springs Bay which is just off of Chatham Strait. Just about a half mile up from the settlement is Baranof Lake, a large glacially-fed freshwater lake. Baranof Lake is fed from small unnamed glacial run-off streams as well as the relatively large Baranof River. Between the half mile outlet between Baranof Lake and Warm Springs Bay there are a series of rapids and waterfalls that have proven to be lethal when run."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on the southern part of a , exposure of a biotite-quartz diorite batholith that crosses northern Baranof Island."
"Baranof Warm Springs is a very small community, having only caretakers in the winter and intermittent visitors in the summer. There are around 15 seasonal homes. The community lies inside the jurisdiction of the City and Borough of Sitka. Other than property taxes and any dock fees from the new dock (2016) there is only one tax-paying commercial enterprise, the Baranof Wilderness Lodge and Resort. The city, in return, funds maintenance of a boardwalk which serves as the main thoroughfare as well as the dock for transient vessels. The community of property owners (BPOA- Baranof Property Owners Association) pools money together to pay for a seasonal (winter) caretaker for seasonally-inhabited residences, the city-owned picnic shelter (possible shelter for those needing it), the public bath house (which features three separate tubs), and the communal warm springs pools. Another caretaker is hired to tend to the Baranof Lodge from October 1 to May 1 when the owners of the Lodge return."
"Baranof Warm Springs was used frequently by the Tlingit of Angoon. People of western descent did not find the springs until 1891. It was serviced by a post office from 1907 through 1912, under the name of Baranoff."
"Baranof Warm Springs appeared on the U.S. Census twice as an unincorporated village. First in 1930 as Baranof with 25 residents and as ""Baronof"" in 1940 with 10 residents. It was later annexed into the City and Borough of Sitka."
"Baranof Warm Springs is accessible via floatplane with regularly scheduled flights leaving Sitka. The trans-island flight is 30 minutes on a clear day and an hour on an overcast one. The Alaska Marine Highway does not service Baranof Warm Springs and there is no scheduled ferry/marine passenger services to the community. Baranof Warm Springs itself does not feature any roads, and the boardwalk does not accommodate ATVs."
The primary attraction is the warm springs. There are a total of nine separate hot springs with temperatures from lukewarm to 120 degrees F. Only one is developed in a natural state and is located right up against the white water of the Baranof River. The community built a public bathhouse at the waterfront to provide an option for visitors not wanting to bathe communally and/or make the 1/4 mile hike up the trail to the natural springs.
"Small tour boats come in frequently in the summer, but also fishermen, and employees of the Hidden Falls Hatchery visit as well. The warm springs is also the terminus (or occasionally the trailhead) of the Baranof Cross-Island Trail. On the northern end of Baranof Lake there is also a Forest Service cabin that is quite popular. The cabin can only be reached by boat or float plane. The terrain is too steep to hike."

Bibi Amtus Salam (died 29 September 1985) was a social worker and disciple of Mohandas Gandhi who played an active role in combating communal violence in the wake of the Partition of India and in the rehabilitation of refugees who came to India following partition.
"Bibi Amtus Salam was born the daughter of Abdul Majid Khan and belonged to a conservative but aristocratic Muslim family of Patiala. She was denied an education owing to the family's observance of ""purdah"" which she shunned in 1925."
"Bibi Amtus Salam was a close associate of Gandhi's and he saw and addressed her as his daughter. Writing to Sardar Patel in 1934, Gandhi noted that the frail Salam's ""heart is gold, but her body is brass"". Salam was an advocate of Hindu-Muslim amity and channeled her efforts to attaining that goal."
"In 1947, as riots occurred throughout India, Gandhi toured Bengal to try and calm tempers. Amtus Salam accompanied him on that trip and fasted with him for 21 days at Noakhali to bring peace there. Gandhi left her there to continue with the efforts of re-establishing communal harmony in Noakhali and later observed that ""you are the moving spirit behind whatever peace has been achieved in Noakhali. It was and still is your most significant work. Only you can sustain it. Wherever you stand, you stand in the capacity of my daughter, do you not?"""
"Amtus Salam had wanted to stay in Patiala during the Partition and its accompanying violence, as a young and single Muslim woman, to further the cause of communal harmony. She opted to stay on India even as her brothers and most of her extended family chose to move to Pakistan and their action both dismayed and angered her. Gandhi arranged for their safe passage to West Pakistan."
"In his ""India Wins Freedom"", Maulana Azad notes that Mohammed Ali Jinnah's title of Quaid-e-Azam (Great Leader) was first popularised by Gandhi who had followed Amtus Salam's suggestion that he address Jinnah thus since the Urdu press referred to him by that title. Azad writes that in following Salam's advice without considering the consequences of his letter, which was published in the newspapers, Gandhi ended up legitimizing Jinnah's image as the Quaid before Indian Muslims."
"Amtus Salam was one of the women to take part in his controversial celibacy tests.. She used to sleep and bathe with him naked with another disciple, Sushila Nayyar also serving him."
"During 1947-48, she worked on the evacuation and rehabilitation of thousands of women kidnapped during the melee that followed Partition. Here she was assisted by Lajjawati Hooja, a member of the Congress and the All-India Women's Congress and Salam made several trips to Pakistan to help with the evacuation of refugees."
"She established the Kasturba Seva Mandir and settled down in Rajpura where she worked on the resettlement of Hindu migrants from Bahawalpur. When the Government of India began constructing a township at Rajpura for the rehabilitation of refugees, she was involved in the work there along with the Hindustani Talimi Sangh who worked on the education of the children in the refugee camps."
"In the 1980s, Amtus Salam served as a permanent invitee on the All India Committee on Jail Reforms. She died in September 1985."

"Almost Home is the major label debut extended play (EP) by American hip hop recording artist Kid Ink; it was released on May 28, 2013, by Tha Alumni Music Group, 88 Classic, RCA Records in the United States. The album was produced by various producers, such as Lifted, Rico Love and Ned Cameron along with guest appearances by Meek Mill, Wale, French Montana, and ASAP Ferg. Upon its release, the EP debuted at number 27 on the US ""Billboard"" 200."
"On January 4, 2013, Kid Ink has announced he had signed a deal with RCA Records and premiered the lead single for his debut project titled ""Bad Ass"" featuring Wale and Meek Mill. ""Bad Ass"" was meant to be a single to tide fans over for his first full-length. RCA associate director of marketing Shani Fuller said, ""We wanted to continue along the theme of being an indie and releasing music all the time,"" ""We just really wanted to feed his fans with new music and a new look as we approached his album later in the year."" Six tracks were selected from more than 140 possible cuts for the disc and a few songs were streamed ahead of release, including ""Sunset,"" a track that Kid Ink says ""really motivated the EP. The EP features additional guest appearances from ASAP Ferg, and French Montana on a remix of his mixtape track ""Bossin' Up"". On the following day, after the EPs release he released a freestyle which was set to be the EPs first track."
"The EPs lead single ""Bad Ass"" was released for digital download on January 22, 2013. The song was released to Rhythm Crossover radio in the United States on February 26, 2013. It has since peaked at number 90 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and number 27 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart."
"The EPs second single ""Money and the Power"" produced by N4, Ned Cameron and Jonathan Lauture, was released on May 28, 2013. It was released to radio on July 19, 2013. The song peaked at number 70 on the German Top 100 songs chart and 52 on the ""Billboard"" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Money and the Power is one of the official theme songs of WrestleMania 31."
"""Almost Home"" debuted at number 27 on the US ""Billboard"" 200 in its first week of release and sold 20,000 copies in the United States."
"Upon its release, ""Almost Home"" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect said ""Ink's got an undeniable ability to infuse that sharp sensibility into even catchier fare like the R&B-tinged goodbye ""Was It Worth It"" featuring Sterling Simms, while elsewhere ""Sunset"" coasts from video game-esque keyboards into a cinematic narrative cruising Cali with no cares."" DJBooth.net said ""Kid Ink knows what he does well and has it down to a fine science; he demonstrate his ability to put together a high-energy song and his hooks are top notch, while not without its flaws, the ""Almost Home"" EP is a good jumping off point for the emcee. I see a lot of talent, but there is room for growth."""
"Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush praised it saying, ""The collection boasts six anthemic tunes that should get you charged for the summer months ahead. Standouts include the bombastic song ""Money and the Power"", the inspiring track ""Sunset"" and the laid-back remix of ""Bad Ass""."" ""The Source"" said of the EP ""What makes this it appealing though is the balance Kid Ink found in allowing listeners into the carefree, TMZ lifestyle he’s caught up in due to his fame and also capturing themes the average person can relate to-grinding everyday to achieve goals."" NMB of ""XXL"" said, ""Throughout the EP, Ink shows confidence in his rhymes and a strong command of his hooks, slinging catchy boasts alongside A$AP Ferg and French Montana on “Bossin’ Up”. Walking the line between singing and rapping on songs like “Fuck Sleep” and “Sunset” Ink’s sound has a distinctly laid-back California feel on the whole."""
= = = Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff = = =
"Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff (5 December 1825 – 8 May 1882) was an English mountaineer, traveller, and author, from 1875 to 1877 the seventh President of the Alpine Club."
"After qualifying as a barrister, Hinchliff abandoned the law and took to a life of travelling and writing. His books include ""Summer Months among the Alps"" (1857), ""South American Sketches"" (1863), and ""Over the Sea and Far Away"" (1876)."
"Born at Southwark, Hinchliffe was the son of Chamberlain Hinchliff (1780–1856), of Croom's Hill, Greenwich, and Lee, both then in Kent, by his marriage in 1824 to Sarah Parish, a daughter of Woodbine Parish of Bawburgh in Norfolk, the sister of Sir Woodbine Parish (1796–1882), a traveller and diplomat. Hinchliff was educated at the West Ham Grammar School, the Blackheath Proprietary School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1849, when he became a member of Lincoln's Inn. Three years later he proceeded MA at Cambridge and was called to the bar, but did not pursue a career as a barrister."
"In 1856, his father died."
"Hinchliff was a minor figure of the golden age of alpinism, between Wills's ascent of the Wetterhorn in 1854 and Whymper's conquest of the Matterhorn in 1865. In 1857 he was a founding member of the Alpine Club, the club meeting in his Lincoln's Inn chambers before it leased rooms of its own at 8 St Martin's Place, Trafalgar Square in 1859. John Ball was elected the club's first President, with E. S. Kennedy as Vice-President and Hinchliff as Secretary. In 1857 Hinchliffe published ""Summer Months Among the Alps: With the Ascent of Monte Rosa"", a work which some twenty years later Mark Twain referred to as ""Hinchliffe's book"". In his ""A Tramp Abroad"" (1880), Twain's narrator advises his friend Harris to read this book to learn about mountain climbing, and a description in it of a fall influences the course of Twain's story."
With Leslie Stephen and the guide Melchior Anderegg Hinchliff made an early ascent of the Wildstrubel on 11 September 1858 and the first ascent of the Alphubel on 9 August 1860.
"In 1861, Hinchliff visited South America, staying with his cousin Frank Parish, the British Consul in Buenos Aires. He spent some months on extensive travels in Brazil and Argentina, with expeditions into the Serra dos Órgãos, Teresópolis, Petrópolis, and Juiz de Fora, and these were recounted in his ""South American Sketches"" of 1863. In 1873 he set off to travel around the world with a friend named William Henry Rawson, and in two years they crossed some 35,000 miles of ocean, while spending a further six months on land. Shortly after his return to England in 1875, Hinchliff was elected President of the Alpine Club, and in 1876 he published ""Over the Sea and Far Away"", an account of his journey around the world. Describing his sad thoughts on the view of Tupungato and Aconcagua from Santiago, Hinchliff reflected that"
"Hinchliff died suddenly at Aix-les-Bains, France, on 8 May 1882. A monument to him stands on the north-west side of the Riffelalp resort in Switzerland. His obituary in the ""Alpine Journal"" said he had had ""a kind of genius for friendship"", while the ""Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society"" noted that ""the Society loses a member who, if not an explorer, was an indefatigable traveller"". In 1910 a climbing anthology called him ""one of the first to penetrate the higher solitudes of the world of ice and snow""."
"Through the 1980s and 1990s, ""FSV"" was as an upper table side in third division play and earned a single season promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga in the 1986–87 following their qualification round win over ""SSV Ulm 1846"". In 1990, they beat ""Rheydter SV"" 2:0 to claim the national amateur championship. The team again qualified for promotion play following their 1992 Oberliga title, but were beaten by ""Wuppertaler SV"". Between 1992–96, ""Salmrohr"" captured five consecutive regional cup titles, however, in the late-1990s the club's performances began to tail off and they slipped to lower level competition."
"An attempt to give ""Eintracht Trier"" a boost into the 2.Bundesliga in 1997 through a partial union that saw a number of ""Salmrohr""'s footballers go to ""Trier"" failed. The next year the club only escaped relegation because a pair of teams that finished ahead of them were denied licenses due to their financial problems. By the turn of the millennium ""Salmrohr"" was playing in the Oberliga Südwest as a fourth division side."
"Most recently the team drifted between the Oberliga Südwest and the Rheinlandliga, winning another promotion in 2011 and finishing sixth in the Oberliga in 2012. From 2012–13 the Oberliga Südwest was renamed Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar, with ""Salmrohr"" continuing in this league. It came second in the league in 2013 and 2014 and narrowly missed out on promotion when it lost to FC Nöttingen in the newly introduced promotion round of the Oberliga runners-up."

= = = Defense Language Aptitude Battery = = =
"The Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) is a test used by the United States Department of Defense to test an individual's potential for learning a foreign language and thus determining who may pursue training as a military linguist. It consists of 126 multiple-choice questions and the test is scored out of a possible 164 points. The test is composed of five audio sections and one visual section. As of 2009, the test is completely web-based. The test does not attempt to gauge a person's fluency in a given language, but rather to determine their ability to learn a language. The test will give the service member examples of what a selection of words or what a portion of a word means, then asks the test taker to create a specific word from the samples given."
"Preparation for the DLAB includes multiple study guides and practice tests. These resources give one the appropriate means by which to prepare for the test and gauge a possible outcome. However, a study guide for the DLAB is not like traditional studying - you are not learning content that will be on the DLAB, but rather learning the style of the DLAB. Someone failing the test or getting a low score can always retake the DLAB but only after a wait of 6 months. For most service members, this is too long and will cause them to miss the deadline for submitting their scores. Adequate preparation is thus a near-necessity."
The languages are broken into tiers based on their difficulty level for a native English speaker as determined by the Defense Language Institute. The category into which a language is placed also determines the length of its basic course as taught at DLI.
"To qualify to pursue training in a language, one needs a minimum score of 95. The Marines will waive it to 90 for Cat I and Cat II languages and the Navy will waive it to an 85 for Cat I languages, a 90 for Cat II languages, and a 95 for Cat III languages. The Air Force does not currently offer a waiver. The Army National Guard is able to waive a score of 90 into a Cat. IV language."
"The DLAB is typically administered to new and prospective recruits at the United States Military Entrance Processing Command sometime after the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is taken but before a final job category (NEC, MOS, AFSC) is determined. An individual may usually take the DLAB if they score high enough on the ASVAB for linguist training and are interested in doing so. The DLAB is also administered to ROTC cadets while they are still attending college. The DLAB is also used for the Australian Defence Force."
"Furthermore, the DLAB is a required test for officers looking to either join the Foreign Area Officer program or the Olmsted Scholar Program. The required grade for these programs is a 105, but the recommended grade is at least a 130 or above."
"Military personnel interested in retraining into a linguist field typically also must pass the DLAB. In few select cases, the DLAB requirement may be waived if proficiency in a foreign language is already demonstrated via the DLPT."
"While these scores are required to enter a language program of that category, often placement is based upon need rather than score. For example, a service member that receives a score of 115 may be placed in Russian (category III). The maximum score on the DLAB was 176, but has recently been lowered to 164."

"Aribert (or Heribert) (Italian: ""Ariberto da Intimiano"", Lombard: ""Aribert de Intimian"") (Intimiano, between 970 and 980 - Milan, 16 January 1045) was the archbishop of Milan from 1018, a quarrelsome warrior-bishop in an age in which such figures were not uncommon."
"Aribert went to Konstanz in June 1025, with other bishops of Northern Italy, to pay homage to Conrad II of Germany, the beleaguered founder of the Salian dynasty. There, in exchange for privileges, he agreed to crown Conrad with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which the magnates had offered to Odo of Blois."
"This he did, on 26 March 1026, at Milan, for the traditional seat of Lombard coronations, Pavia, was still in revolt against imperial authority. He journeyed to Rome a year later for the imperial coronation of Conrad by Pope John XIX on 26 March 1027; at a synod at the Lateran he negotiated a decision of the precedence of the archdiocese of Milan over that of Ravenna. He subsequently joined an imperial military expedition into the Kingdom of Arles, which Conrad inherited upon the death in 1032 of Rudolph III of Burgundy, but which was contested by Odo."
"In the political arena of Italy, power was disputed between the great territorial magnates— the ""capitanei""— with their vassal captains and the lesser nobility— the ""valvassores""— allied with the burghers of the Italian communes."
"Aribert created enemies among the lower nobility, against whom he perpetrated the worst violences, and with the metropolitan of Ravenna, whose episcopal rights, along with those of the smaller sees, he ignored. A revolt soon engulfed northern Italy and, at Aribert's request, Conrad's son, the Emperor Henry III, travelled south of the Alps in the winter of 1036/37, to quell it. The Emperor, however, took the position of champion of the ""valvassores"" and demanded that Aribert should make a defence against charges brought against him, but Aribert refused, on the grounds that he was the emperor's equal."

= = = Egocentric presentism = = =
"Egocentric presentism is a form of solipsism introduced by Caspar Hare in which other persons can be conscious, but their experiences are simply not ."
"Similarly, in related work, Hare argues for a theory of perspectival realism in which other perspectives do exist, but the present perspective has a defining intrinsic property."
"In one example that Hare uses to illustrate his theory (starting on page 354 of the official version of his paper), you learn that you are one of two people, named A and B, who have just been in a train crash; and that A is about to have incredibly painful surgery. You cannot remember your name. Naturally, you hope to be B! The point of the example is that you know everything relevant that there is to know about the objective world; all that is missing is position in it, that is, whose experiences are , A's or B's. This example is easily handled by egocentric presentism because under this theory, the case where the present experiences are A's is fundamentally different from the case where the present experiences are B's. Hare points out that similar examples can be given to support theories like presentism in the philosophy of time."
Several other philosophers have written reviews of Hare's work on this topic. Giovanni Merlo has given a detailed comparison to his own closely related subjectivist theory.

"As Hare points out, the same type of argument is often used in the philosophy of time to support theories such as presentism. Of course, we can say that A is happening on [insert today's date].

She was laid down as yard number 305 on 1 July 1895 at the John I. Thornycroft & Company shipyard at Chiswick on the River Thames. She was launched on 15 February 1896. During her builder's trials her maximum average speed was 30.3 knots. She had her armament fitted in Portsmouth. She was completed and accepted by the Royal Navy in February 1897.

The FS E.424 is a class of Italian railways electric locomotives. They were built in 1943-1951 and have been decommissioned in 2008.
"A design for a small multi-service Bo-Bo locomotive, with speed up to , had been devised by Giuseppe Bianchi as early as in the 1930s, but the project had been halted by the introduction of the E.326 and E.428. After the realization of the 6-axle E.636, it was however decided to revamp the project by adapting to it some solutions already in use on the E.636 (engines, bogies, suspension etc.)."
"Breda SpA workshop provided the three prototypes of E.424 in 1943-1944. Mass production, however, could begin only after the end of World War II, part of the funds provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration program."
The locomotives have been built in four series starting from year 1943:
"Class E.424, having DC type motors like all the Italian locomotives of the time, is a rheostatic-type locomotive; on start, a rheostat is connected in series to the motors and is gradually excluded as speed builds up allowing more current to flow to the motors; unlike other rheostatic locomotives of that time, this is not achieved via the characteristic lever (""Maniglione""), but through an automatic system, called ""Avviatore Automatico"", derived from contemporary first-generation ALe 790/880/883 EMUs."
"The driver simply selects the combination (series or parallel), and the relative rheostat contactors are automatically and gradually closed by this system; in case of failure, the driver can manually rotate an apposite wheel (that also usually rotates automatically as the system advances) to proceed with the exclusion."
"When the rheostat is completely excluded for the series combination, field shunts can be inserted, or the driver can proceed to parallel combination, making a transition, which is handled by a device called ""CEM"" that automatically combines the motors (closing various contacts) accordingly."
"Originally more than one unit could be coupled and be controlled remotely by the first locomotive using a system called ""Comando Multiplo""; on the central part of the cab there also was a door that enabled the crew to pass from one locomotive to another in case of problems. However, because of safety issues and the imperfect reliability of this system (there were no instruments indicating the status of the slave locomotive, so it was not certain if it correctly made a transition or not, for example), it was abandoned and then disassembled."
"Eleven units received compound-type motors, enabling a very fine speed control, in a range included between in series combination, and in parallel."

This eventually flew in 1966 and plans were made available soon thereafter. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992."
"A single engine in tractor configuration airplane, the Mustang II features cantilever low-wing, two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed conventional landing gear, or, optionally, tricycle landing gear."
"The aircraft is made from riveted sheet aluminum with a rounded turtle deck and flat sides and bottom skins. Its span wing employs a NACA 64A212 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 64A210 at the wingtip. Standard engines used include the Lycoming O-320, the Lycoming O-360 and the fuel-injected Lycoming IO-360 four-stroke powerplants.

In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign. The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz and 8VC."
"As of 2015, uBiome offered a $1 million grant program to researchers and citizen scientists for microbiome sampling and related analysis. One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
The company currently employs 100 individuals.
"The company filed for bankruptcy on September 4, 2019 in Delaware (case number 19-11938). In an affidavit filed contemporaneously with the bankruptcy petition, Curtis Solsvig, III the acting CEO stated that the bankruptcy action was taken to allow the company to reorganize amidst ""investigations by certain federal and state investigatory bodies."""
"Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set. In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California. In 2016, uBiome received accreditation from the College of American Pathologists."
", the company first amplifies a portion of the bacterial gene that encodes 16S ribosomal RNA using PCR, then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA gene, in order to categorize the bacteria at the genus level. The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons. A 2014 report in ""Xconomy"" said the company outsources the sequencing. The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer."
In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices.
"uBiome has been compared with Theranos and 23andMe, each of which are also biotechnology companies influenced by Silicon Valley."
"Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval. The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues."
The company obtained IRB approval in July 2013.
"In 2014, people experienced in biotechnology entrepreneurship also raised questions about the ethics of crowdfunding a biotech company, as the risks of such ventures are high even for people with scientific and business sophistication."

"ITV Cymru Wales, previously known as Harlech Television and HTV Wales, is the ITV franchise for Wales. The new separate licence began on 1 January 2014, replacing the long-serving dual franchise region serving Wales and the West of England."
"The licence continues to be held by ITV Broadcasting Ltd, who hold all nationwide Channel 3 licences."
"As of January 2014, the former HTV companies are still legally named ITV Wales and West Group Ltd and ITV Wales and West Ltd. Each of these companies is, along with most other regional companies, owned by ITV plc, though listed at Companies House as a ""dormant company""."
The broadcasting licence was created following the split of ITV Wales & West. It is hoped that the separate licence will benefit local viewers.
"In May 2012, Ofcom raised the possibility of a stand-alone licence for Wales."
"On 25 August 2015, ITV Cymru Wales began broadcasting in HD (prior to this HD viewers in Wales received ITV Central HD), including the company's news service and non-news programming including current affairs and documentaries."
"ITV Cymru Wales produces around six hours a week of national news, current affairs and features programming in English – its flagship programme """" broadcasts each weeknight at 6pm with shorter ""ITV News Cymru Wales"" bulletins throughout the day and during the weekend."

Quentin (Justin Rain) reluctantly admits to his father Rafe (Graham Greene) that he killed Birch when Birch broke into their home and attacked him. He does not tell him though that he kept the artifact."
"Nicky, suspecting that Birch is dead, tricks Rafe into revealing that Birch was killed when he broke into their home, but Rafe takes the blame to protect his son. In the meantime, Quentin has another ""vision"" of his brother Luke (Wesley French), who tells him that he should kill Nicky too because she knows everything, but Quentin refuses."
"Meanwhile, Sukar finds all the items he needs and he and Irisa take over the radio station. Nolan gets there right after them thinking that Sukar wants to direct a falling Ark to Defiance. The falling Ark, if it impacts on Defiance, will destroy the city completely and everyone will die. He attempts to stop him by shooting him and throwing him from the Gateway Arch."
"Irisa however, who does not believe that Sukar wanted to destroy Defiance, completes his task and activates the transmission. It is discovered that Sukar only wanted to change the direction of the falling Ark to save Defiance."
"Doctor Yewll (Trenna Keating), while examining Sukar, finds out why Sukar ""rose"" and why he was healing so fast. It was not because of the God Irzu but because of little robots called nanites that were injected into his body by the razor rain object. Now that Defiance is safe, the nanites have gone dormant, and will no longer heal Sukar's injuries. Sukar survived the fall from the Arch, but he is paralyzed and in coma."

"Rowan Kaiser from ""The A.V. Club"" gave a C grade to the episode saying that despite there were some cool moments and interesting ideas on it, it was not serving a larger purpose. ""“Good Bye Blue Sky” isn't notably worse than several previous episodes of ""Defiance"", but it frustrated me much more than those did. There are some cool moments, some disjointed ones, a lot of interesting ideas, and a famous song covered at the end. I normally enjoy that. But my problem with this episode is that it doesn't serve a larger purpose."""
"Lisa Macklem from ""Spoiler TV"" stated that the episode is particularly well-written. ""I really enjoyed the peeling away of more layers on the show this week. The episode did a good job in illustrating that the tensions don’t just occur between human and Votans – though it’s understandable that those relationships pose the most opportunity for misunderstanding."""
"Jim Garner from ""TV Fanatic"" rated the episode with 3/5. """"Defiance"" this week didn't so much feature a single main story, but instead focused on three arcs. Sadly, this left it feeling like ""Good Bye Blue Sky"" was doing far too much in a short amount of time."""

"SKEPP is an independent Belgian skeptical organization. The organization’s name is a backronym for ""Studiekring voor de Kritische Evaluatie van Pseudowetenschap en het Paranormale"" (""Study Circle for the Critical Evaluation of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal"")."
"SKEPP is a nonprofit organization emanated from the Belgian astronomical society, ""Vereniging voor Sterrenkunde"", and was founded in 1990 by, among others, Prof. Etienne Vermeersch, Prof. Willem Betz, Tim Trachet and Prof. Jean Paul Van Bendegem."
The goals of the organization are:
"SKEPP gets most of its funding from member fees. On the initiative of board member and former editor-in-chief Tom Schoepen, SKEPP has been publishing its own three-monthly magazine since 2000, ""Wonder en is gheen wonder"", a magazine for science and reason, which focuses on both pseudoscientific topics and topics related to the philosophy of science. The editors include Prof. Dr. Johan Braeckman (Ghent University), Dr. Griet Vandermassen (Ghent University), Geerdt Magiels and SKEPP founder Tim Trachet."
"In 2012, SKEPP hosted a series of lectures and discussions, featuring prominent scientists and philosophers, under the name Het Denkgelag, which has since grown out to become an independent non-profit that organises skeptical conferences. In 2015, SKEPP hosted the meant-to-be-yearly event ""Zomerschool Kritisch Denken"" (Summerschool Critical Thinking) aimed at educational professionals. Currently, SKEPP organises the monthly local editions of Skeptics in the Pub in Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven."
"Since 1996 SKEPP gives out annual awards to non-members: the ""Zesde vijs"" (the “Sixth Screw”) and the ""Skeptische Put"" (de “Skeptical Pit”)."
"The ""Zesde Vijs"" is awarded to ""someone who has distinguished themselves in the past year in spreading objective knowledge regarding pseudoscience and the paranormal, or who has made themselves noticed in the media by presenting a nuanced critical view or a thoroughly documented argumentation"". This prize has been awarded to, among others:"
"The ""Skeptische Put"" is awarded to ""someone who, according to SKEPP, has displayed exceptionally uncritical thinking and who has totally misunderstood the popularization of science and knowledge"". The ""Skeptische Put"" has been awarded to, among others:"
"Since its founding, SKEPP has become quite widely known via the Belgian media. They are often called upon to present their critical perspective on paranormal or pseudoscientific topics. In 2004 the organization made headlines when thirty skeptics at Ghent University conducted a “mass suicide” attempt by taking an overdose of homeopathically diluted snake venom, belladonna, and arsenic. The goal of this action was to demonstrate that homeopathic products contain no active ingredients. Additionally, the Belgian health insurance organization were accused of putting themselves above the law as commercial entities by reimbursing alternative treatments. According to SKEPP, by reimbursing alternative treatments, health insurance organizations will give the impression to the Belgian public that these are effective medications or treatments."
"In 2014, the Belgian court of appeal in Brussels proved SKEPP right against the appeal of the Dutch physician Robert Görter, who was called a quack by the organization in 2004."
"Since 1 October 2012 the organization has pledged to award the 1-million-euro ""Sisyphus prize"", to anyone who can demonstrate paranormal abilities under controlled conditions. This includes paranormal phenomena as well as homeopathy."
"The same challenge is also offered by various other European skeptical organizations and serves as the equivalent of the American One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which was offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation."
"As of 8 March 2014, its website describes the prize as ""the 25 000 euro prize"". Applying for the prize would cost 50 euro. It informs that ""the text and protocol are being rewritten and will soon be available again""."

"It is not clear whether any of these pillboxes engaged directly in the 1944 battle for Guam. These pillboxes were clearly designed to repel invaders coming from the sea. The U.S. invasion beginning on July 21, 1944, however, was further to the south and west; the area of these pillboxes was over-run by U.S. forces coming from the south, on about August 2, 1944."

= = = Nelson Diversity Surveys = = =
"The Nelson Diversity Surveys (NDS) are a collection of data sets that quantify the representation of women and minorities among professors, by science and engineering discipline, at research universities. They consist of four data sets compiled by Dr. Donna Nelson, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma during fiscal years (FY) 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2012. These surveys were each complete populations, rather than samples. Consequently, the Surveys quantified characteristics of the faculty which had never been revealed previously, drawing great attention from women and minorities. Furthermore, the Surveys initially came at a time when these underrepresented groups were becoming concerned and vocal about perceived inequities in academia. At the time the Surveys were initiated, (1) the MIT Study of 1999, expressing the concerns of women scientists (including Nancy Hopkins), had just been issued, and (2) underrepresented minority (URM) science faculty noticed URM students increase among PhD recipients without a corresponding increase among recently hired professors. Because the NDS were complete populations, which disaggregated faculty by race, by rank, by gender, and by discipline, URM faculty had the documentation to support their concerns."
"The NDS quantified the degree to which women and minorities are underrepresented on science and engineering faculties at research universities. Because the surveys were complete populations and disaggregated, the degree of underrepresentation was revealed, in ways it had never been revealed previously. For example, the FY 2002 survey showed that there were no Black, Hispanic, or Native American tenured or tenure track women faculty in the top 50 computer science departments. It also revealed that there were no Black or Native American assistant professors in the top 50 chemistry departments. Analogous surveys were carried out for top 100 departments in each of 15 science and engineering disciplines in fiscal years (FY) 2005, 2007 and 2012."
"The Nelson Diversity Surveys made it possible for the first time to know the level and rate of faculty diversification, disaggregated by race, by rank, and by gender. Researchers in the 15 areas of science surveyed were enthusiastic to use these disaggregated faculty data, in order to compare against analogous student data, which had been available from NSF for decades. Many new programs to increase the representation of women and minorities among professors were implemented and PhD and MS research was based on data revealed by the NDS. The NDS were utilized by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, US Congress, Sloan Foundation, the National Organization for Women, universities, and many other organizations interested in diversity in academics. A new area of research was spawned – the Science of Broadening Participation."
"John Francis Donoghue (August 9, 1928 – November 11, 2011) served as the second Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte and then as the fifth Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Atlanta in the United States of America."
"Donoghue was born and raised in Washington, D.C., the second of four brothers born to Irish immigrant parents, Daniel and Rose (née Ryan) Donoghue. On June 4, 1955, after receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and a graduate degree in Sacred Theology from St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland and Roland Park, Maryland, and after ordination to the transitional diaconate, he was ordained to the priesthood for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, by the then-Archbishop of Washington, Patrick O'Boyle, who was later a Cardinal."
"While originally planning to remain a parish priest, Donoghue was asked in 1964 to study for a Licentiate in Canon Law, and was then assigned to the Archbishop of Washington's Office (he did serve in a variety of parish assignments)."
"For the next 18 years, he served on the staff under three successive Cardinals, all now deceased, who were Archbishops of Washington: Cardinals Patrick O'Boyle, William Wakefield Baum, and James Aloysius Hickey. From 1972 until 1983, he also filled the offices of Chancellor and Vicar General for that Archdiocese; in 1984 he also became Moderator of the Archdiocesan Curia, serving in that capacity until his episcopal consecration. He was consecrated and installed as a Bishop on December 18, 1984, following his appointment by Pope John Paul II, as the second Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte."
"In June 1993, he was appointed as the sixth Metropolitan Archbishop of Atlanta, Georgia by John Paul II, replacing the Most Reverend James P. Lyke, O.F.M., who had died of cancer on December 27, 1992, after only two years in office. He led the Archdiocese for over ten years. Donoghue retired as Archbishop on December 9, 2004, and was succeeded by Wilton D. Gregory, who had served as an Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago."

= = = Bubba Wells = = =
"Charles Richard ""Bubba"" Wells (born July 26, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player, playing mostly for minor leagues. He played collegiately for Austin Peay State University and was named 1997 Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year. Selected 34th by the Mavs in the 1997 NBA draft, the little-used small forward's NBA career was short-lived, consisting of just 39 games of the 1997–98 season. However, he did start two games in March 1998, in place of the injured Cedric Ceballos. His brief NBA career did feature one memorable game where he set the record for the shortest amount of playing time (less than 3 minutes) before fouling out, as part of a failed strategy to intentionally foul Dennis Rodman (a notoriously bad free throw shooter) to limit his scoring."
"His NBA career came to an abrupt end in 1998, after he was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Martin Müürsepp, the draft rights to Pat Garrity, and a future first-round draft pick in exchange for point guard Steve Nash. Wells never played a game for the Suns. He was later traded to the Chicago Bulls, also for whom he never played. He later played for the LaCrosse Bobcats of the CBA, the Oklahoma Storm of USBL, the Memphis Houn'Dawgs of the ABA, and overseas in Greece and the Philippines. He played for the Harlem Globetrotters in 2004–05. From June 2005 through May 2015, Wells was an assistant men's basketball coach at Austin Peay."
"On May 28, 2015, his appointment to the staff of Jon Harris at SIU Edwardsville was announced."
"Bubba Wells holds the dubious distinction of being the player with the quickest disqualification due to personal fouls in an NBA regular season game. In a December 29, 1997 game against the Chicago Bulls, then-Mavericks coach Don Nelson employed a desperate tactic to limit the Bulls' offense. He inserted Wells into the game with the express purpose of fouling power forward Dennis Rodman, a notoriously poor free throw shooter, away from the ball."
"The plan failed, however, when Rodman hit 9-of-12 free throws and Chicago went on to win the game 111–105. Wells fouled out late in the third quarter after registering his sixth personal foul in a total of three minutes' playing time. This strategy of intentionally fouling a bad free throw shooter is sometimes called Hack-a-Shaq, since it was later famously used against Shaquille O'Neal."
"The previous record-holder was Dick Farley of the Syracuse Nationals who was disqualified in five minutes on March 12, 1956."
"In August 2007, Wells married Tracee Jones, the former head women's basketball coach at Tennessee State University. The previous summer Wells served as a supporter to Jones on NBC TV game show, ""Deal or No Deal"". Wells has a daughter, Alyiah, and a son, Chase."
= = = Muttart Conservatory = = =
"The Muttart Conservatory is a botanical garden located in the North Saskatchewan river valley, across from the downtown core in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. One of the best-known landmarks of Edmonton, the conservatory consists of three city-operated greenhouses, public gardens, as well as four feature pyramids for display of plant species found across three biomes, with the fourth pyramid hosting as a seasonal display. A fifth minor skylight pyramid lights up the central foyer."
"A donation from the Gladys and Merrill Muttart Foundation provided momentum for the conservatory's construction, with the remaining funding supplied by the Province of Alberta and the City of Edmonton. The conservatory is staffed and operated by the Edmonton Parks and Recreation Department."
"The conservatory's unusual structure, designed by architect Peter Hemingway, is composed of four glassed pyramids built around a central service core. The two larger pyramids are in area, and the two medium-sized ones are in size. Three of the pyramids are devoted to displays of plants from the tropical, temperate, and arid regions respectively, the fourth being used for shows that change with the seasons and which feature massed displays of ornamental flowering plants."
"The Temperate pyramid houses plants typical of temperate climates, from such zones as the southern Great Lakes, Australia, and even the mountainous areas of Asia. Near the entrance and fed by a stream is a bog area, with white water lilies and parrot's feather. The bog merges into a woodland with mostly eastern deciduous trees and low shrubs but including redwoods, cedars and pampas grass. Eucalyptus trees and flowering shrubs complement the Australian section. In the woodland floor and alpine section are many tiny flowering plants, some native to Alberta and others from all over the world. Carefully controlled environmental conditions allow the plants to go dormant in winter and burst into spring growth of green leaves and colourful blooms."
"The plants from the Arid pyramid come from hot and cold dry areas spanning five continents. They share an ability to thrive in environments with dry air, irregular moisture and wide day/night temperature fluctuations. In spring 2013, the Arid Pyramid featured an Agave Americana plant bloom which reached a height of 30 feet before reaching the top of the pyramid. This plant was planted a year after the Muttart Conservatory first opened."
"The Tropical pyramid provides an enormous diversity of species; under a canopy of tall palms, banana and weeping fig are orchids, various hibiscus and the bird of paradise. The plants come from tropical rainforests, evergreen forests or grasslands, and are often showy and bright. A waterfall cascades into the centre of the pyramid where small fish and water lilies make their home. This pyramid has also been home in the past to a kiwi bird and a sloth. On March 11, 2013, the bud to an imported Amorphophallus titanum plant (commonly known as the corpse flower) budded and bloomed here on April 22."
"The ""Feature pyramid"" offers seasonal displays that change several times per year, focusing on themed displays and seasonal celebrations."
"Other amenities at the facility are an outdoor gazebo, gift shop, and the Culina Muttart Café. The café serves several menu items made with locally-sourced ingredients, including herbs and salad greens grown on-site at the greenhouse."
"The facility, owned and operated by the City of Edmonton, is also a popular site for special events, such as weddings. The conservatory underwent a $6.3 million renovation that was completed in June 2009."

"The codice_6 attribute does not always have to literally describe the contents of the image. Keep in mind the purpose and context of the image and what would be useful to someone who cannot see it. The alt attribute is supposed to be an ""alternative"" for the image, usually stating its purpose. For example, an image of a warning sign should not have alt text “a triangle with a yellow background, black border and an exclamation mark”, but simply “Warning!”—unless, of course, the image's purpose is to show what the warning symbol actually looks like."
"Internet Explorer 7 and earlier render text in alt attributes as tooltip text, which is not standards-compliant. This behavior led many web developers to misuse alt when they wished to display tooltips containing additional information about images, instead of using the codice_7 attribute that was intended for that use.

"On the eve of an important ceremony in the Emerald City, Scraps the Patchwork Girl has been making more of a nuisance of herself than usual. After confrontations with Jellia Jamb and Jenny Jump, Scraps decides to run away on her spoolicle (a bicycle made of thread spools). She visits Jinjur's Munchkin Country farm; but Jinjur wants to put Scraps to work, so Scraps leaves quickly."
"At Prof. Wogglebug's Royal Athletic College, Scraps falls in with a 12-year-old prodigy named Alexample. They marvel at the air castle the Professor has dreamed into existence for his coming vacation, as it hovers above the college. Through unfortunate clumsiness, Scraps knocks the mooring line loose and the air castle floats away, with Alexample hanging onto the tethering rope. Scraps flees from the pursuit of the irate Wogglebug."
"Scraps meets a Repairman who magically fixes the damage and staining she's endured in her recent actions. The exasperated Scraps longs to run away from Oz entirely, but doesn't know how to cross the Deadly Desert. The Repairman informs her of a Weather Witch who lives on the highest mountain in Oz; she makes weather for the entire Earth from her windmill there. Scraps decides to get the Weather Witch to blow her across the Desert with wind, and sets out for the mountain."
"On the way, Scraps meets Popla, ""the one and only power plant...the most powerful plant in the world."" (Popla looks like a large shrub, with the face of a beautiful young woman.) Popla longs for release from her bleak and stationary existence, and eagerly transfers herself into a flowerpot to join with Scraps; Popla's strength and resourcefulness prove to be important advantages in their coming adventures. Despite tempestuous winds, the two intrepid travelers reach the top of the mountain. Fanny the Weather Witch agrees to blast them across the Deadly Desert; but additional clumsiness gets them stuck on one of the windmill's blades, which hurls them high into the atmosphere."
"Meanwhile, Prof. Wogglebug stomps toward the Emerald City to complain about Scraps to the Wizard. He encounters Jenny Jump and Jack Pumpkinhead, who have set out in search for the missing Scraps. The Wogglebug decides to join up with them, as the most direct approach to recovering his air castle. (The later chapters of the book alternate between the two plots: the runaway Scraps and her companions, and the searchers pursuing her.)"
"Scraps and Popla land on a friendly cloud, who takes them to a nearby star. The star is a kind of semi-mechanical conveyance, commanded by Captain Batt, who is built of wires and electric components. Predictably, Scraps gets into a fight with him; she punches him in his button nose, which proves to be his on-off button. With Captain Batt shut down, they meet the Twinkler, the star's maintenance man (he looks like Cap'n Bill). Popla tries piloting the star — and crashes into the missing air castle. They find Alexample there, and endure a few peaceful days in its palatial environs. They get to know the inhabitants of the upper air, who include sky fairies and air sprites, and cloud sheep herded by cloud-pushers and sky-sweepers. Scraps and company also repel an attack from sky pirates."
"Things go badly for the searchers below; they are caught in a storm, in which Jack loses his pumpkin head. Jenny and the Professor have to lead or drag his headless stick-body along with them. They wander into an enchanted orchard, where they confront an army of rebellious quinces. By this time, the week of the Wogglebug's planned vacation has expired, and the air castle's time is up: it melts, cracks, dissolves, shatters, and otherwise falls apart around its occupants. They come tumbling down upon the enchanted orchard, and the search party, and the quince army. In a final confrontation, the quince soldiers commit mass suicide by shooting their sooty stems at Scraps. She is so blackened by the soot that she tries to hide from the world."
"The others convince Scraps to return to the Emerald City, where she can be magically repaired. Scraps agrees, but she hides herself under a sheet as she walks through the city streets (like Ojo in ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz""); she causes a panic when she is mistaken for a ghost. Yet Ozma has no trouble in restoring Scraps to normal (if that term applies) with her Magic Belt. Popla and Alexample are welcomed into the ever-growing circle of Ozma's followers."
"In the best Baum tradition, puns come thick and fast throughout ""The Runaway in Oz"". In Chapter 8, ""The Professor Sets Out,"" the reader is informed of the enlarged bug's feelings: ""But though he was in an unsettled state of mind, he was not crushed."" Two pages later, he threatens to become ""hopping mad."" Jenny tells the professor that the Wizard is busy ""ridding the country of dumb little kings and their little kingdumbs."" These three pages can stand as representative of the whole."

"Ujitsuna then went on to win the battle of Kōnodai in 1538, securing Shimōsa Province for the Hōjō."
In 1539 he defeated the Koga Kubo Yoshiaki and gained control of Awa.
"Over the next several years before his death in 1541, Ujitsuna oversaw the rebuilding of Kamakura, making it a symbol of the growing power of the Hōjō, along with Odawara and Edo. He was succeeded as head of the Hōjō clan and lord of Odawara by his son Hōjō Ujiyasu."

"Symptoms of NNN are similar to those of nicotine poisoning and include irritation at the point of absorption (for example, the gums when dipping tobacco is used), nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbances, headache, and chest pain. The substance is also a known carcinogen, meaning that any exposure to the substance can lead to cancer and is proven to cause esophageal and nasal cancer in animals. There is no known ""safe"" levels of NNN ingestion in humans due to its carcinogenic activity. However, in mice, the median lethal dose (LD) is 1g/kg."
"In cigarette smoke, NNN has been found in levels between 2.2-6.6 parts per million (ppm). The FDA has put limits of nitrosamines in other consumable products (such as cured meats) at levels below 10 parts per billion (ppb)."
= = = Supercilium = = =
"The supercilium is a plumage feature found on the heads of some bird species. It is a stripe which runs from the base of the bird's beak above its eye, finishing somewhere towards the rear of the bird's head. Also known as an ""eyebrow"", it is distinct from the eyestripe, which is a line which runs across the lores, and continues behind the eye. Where a stripe is present only above the lores, and does not continue behind the eye, it is called a supraloral stripe or simply supraloral. On most species which display a supercilium, it is paler than the adjacent feather tracts."
"The colour, shape or other features of the supercilium can be useful in bird identification. For example, the supercilium of the dusky warbler, an Old World warbler species, can be used to distinguish it from the very similar Radde's warbler. The dusky warbler's supercilium is sharply demarcated, whitish and narrow in front of the eye, becoming broader and more buffy towards the rear, whereas that of the Radde's warbler is diffusely defined, yellowish and broadest in front of the eye, becoming narrower and more whitish toward the rear. The supercilium of the northern waterthrush, a New World warbler, differs subtly from that of the closely related (and similarly plumaged) Louisiana waterthrush. The Louisiana has a bicoloured supercilium which widens significantly behind the eye, while the northern has an evenly buffy eyebrow which is either the same width throughout or slightly narrower behind the eye."
"A split supercilium divides above the lores. In some species, such as the jack snipe, the divided stripes reconnect again behind the eye. In others, such as the broad-billed sandpiper, the divided stripes remain separate."
"A supercilium drop is a feature found on some pipits; it is a pale spot on the rear of the which, although separated from the supercilium by an eyestripe, can appear at some angles to be a downward continuation of the supercilium."
= = = Adolf of Altena = = =
"Adolf of Altena, Adolf of Berg or Adolf of Cologne, (c. 1157 – 15 April 1220 in Neuss) was Archbishop of Cologne from 1193 to 1205."
Adolf was born about 1157 as the second son of Count Eberhard of Berg-Altena and his wife Adelheid von Arnsberg.
"About 1177 he became a canon in Cologne. Later, in 1183, he became Dean of the Cathedral, and in the year 1191 Cathedral Provost. After the abdication of his uncle Bruno III of Berg he became Archbishop of Cologne in 1193, as ""Adolf I"", or ""Adolf I von Altena""."
"In March 1194 he received his episcopal consecration by Hermann II of Katzenelnbogen, Prince-Bishop of Münster. In the same year Adolf was instrumental in arranging the release of King Richard I of England, whom he received with considerable solemnity in Cologne shortly afterwards, at the beginning of February 1194. He was a declared opponent of the plans for a hereditary empire of Emperor Henry VI and at Christmas 1195 refused Henry's wish for the election of his son Frederick Roger. He gave up his opposition in August 1197 for the secondary election of the candidate chosen in the meantime by the other Electors in Boppard. However, after the death of Henry VI, Adolf declared the election invalid, as the candidate was not baptised and the Emperor had put the Electors under pressure."
"In the ensuing dynastic struggle for the throne between the Hohenstaufen and the Welfs, he crowned on 12 July 1198 the Welf Otto of Brunswick in Aachen as King of the Romans (or German king). Shortly afterwards, Pope Innocent III, who had an interest in weakening the Hohenstaufen and in breaking their power (particularly in Italy), confirmed the election of Otto. On 6 January 1205 however Adolf then crowned the Staufen competitor for the crown, Philip of Swabia, as German king. Philip had already been crowned in 1198, although only in Mainz Cathedral, but he had nevertheless been crowned with the genuine Imperial Regalia and especially the Imperial crown."
"The Pope, who had reserved himself the king's question himself, was irritated by the rumor of the page change and asked Adolf himself for a report. Since Adolf did not want to sacrifice his just hard-won right of the decisive vote in the royal election, a papal presentation, he did not respond to the papal request. However, he overestimated its importance by far."
"On 19 July 1205 Adolf was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III and declared deposed. Already in July, a new archbishop was elected in Cologne. Since one was still in the Rhineland but still in the Hohenstaufen line, his successor could barely prevail against him, so that it came to a schism in the archbishopric of Cologne."
"In 1207 Adolf von Altena was in Rome, where he tried against his successor and fought for his reinstatement as archbishop - without success. Only the murder of Philip of Swabia (21 June 1208) and the changed political situation led to a submission to the pope and a recognition of his successor for himself and his followers, for which he received an annual pension of 250 marks. Adolf, from then until his death, was active in the archdiocese of Cologne as an auxiliary bishop. However his see was not returned to him."
"Dietrich I von Hengebach was deposed by the papal legate, and in March 1212 he was appointed to head the diocese. While initially holding this to be reinstated, he soon realized that it was just a provisional lead. In fact, the Archdiocese was again in the schism, especially since Adolf now argued with Dietrich von Hengebach before the Pope for reinstatement. The verdict was in 1216 and in Cologne it came again to the election of the bishop. The new archbishop became his successor as cathedral provost, Engelbert II of Berg. He was one of his relatives and had always supported him during the time of the schism, including by handing over goods from the cathedral chapter."
"Until his death, in 1220, Adolf was again active as auxiliary bishop in the archbishopric of Cologne. He died on 15 April 1220 in Neuss."

= = = Burgess Model I = = =
"The Burgess Model I, also known as the ""Burgess I-Scout"" and the ""Coast Defense Hydroaeroplane"", was a United States reconnaissance seaplane built for the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1913. It was of conventional Wright Model B design but with an engine mounted amidships in an enclosed fuselage, driving by chains two large pusher propellers mounted on the interplane struts. The undercarriage consisted of twin pontoons. The single example built, S.C. No. 17, was delivered to the Army in January 1913 at the Burgess Company and Curtis factory in Massachusetts, then transported to Florida to complete the training of two officers. After the assignment, it was disassembled and moved to the Philippines in September 1913, where it was in and out of service several times before crashing into the sea near Corregidor on January 12, 1915. It is notable as the first U.S. Army aircraft to conduct two-way radio communication with the ground in December 1914."
"The Burgess Model I was placed into service as Signal Corps Number 17 (S.C. No. 17) in January 1913 to complete the training of Lieutenants Loren H. Call and Eric L. Ellington at Palm Beach, Florida. Following this assignment it was disassembled and shipped by sea to the Philippine Aviation School near Manila, arriving in the first week of September. When it was uncrated for assembly, it was found to have been damaged so severely in transit that both its upper and lower wings needed replacing. 2d Lt. Herbert A. Dargue, a Coast Artillery officer trained as a pilot at the Philippine Aviation School, was detailed October 18 to fly the plane, based on the beach at San Jose on the south side of Corregidor in Manila Bay. After it was placed back into service in November 1913, it was found that center-of-gravity problems with its front-and-back seating arrangement and heavy pontoons made it incapable of taking off with two persons aboard. Dargue continued one-man operations and with a Coast Artillery officer devised a primitive method of signaling with small parachutes and a Very pistol to indicate misses."
"S.C. 17 was reconditioned by January 1914 with lighter pontoons that permitted two-man operation. Its hangar was supplied with a cement floor and a marine railway built down to the water to assist in launching the aircraft. The S.C. No. 17 participated in maneuvers with ground troops in February but was damaged during landing on February 20, and was out of service for a month. Between April 28 and May 15 it resumed adjusting fire for the Coast Artillery before going into storage for the rainy season."
"When he resumed flying activity in the fall of 1914, Dargue began testing a small radio transmitter-receiver built by a local unit, and was damaged again in October experimenting with antenna location. Ultimately a wire antenna was paid out behind the aircraft in flight from a reel. Further problems of engine noise, ignition interference, burnout of the signal detector by proximity of the transmitter, and loss of calibration from engine vibration were all overcome. On December 1, 1914, Dargue and 1st Lt. Joseph O. Mauborgne, the Signal Corps officer in charge of the Fort Mills radio station, began a series seven test flights of the radio. During the third, on December 11, the first two-way telegraphy communication with the ground was performed, at a range of for communication with the ground and for the return signal to the airplane, flying at an altitude of , the first radio signal received by an airplane. On the last flight, December 16, using a switch designed to alternate between receiving and transmitting modes, Mauborgne conducted the first airborne ""conversation"" with the ground."
"On January 12, 1915, Dargue and an enlisted spotter encountered strong winds over San Jose Bay. Dargue lost control attempting to avoid the cliffs on Corregidor, but was able to recover sufficiently to crash-land the plane tail first in the bay, causing a total loss. Because S.C. No. 17 was the only aircraft left in the Philippines, the Philippine Aviation School was closed and Dargue transferred back to San Diego, California."

= = = Chester Weir = = =
"Chester Weir is a weir which crosses the River Dee at Chester, Cheshire, England, slightly upstream from the Old Dee Bridge (). The weir and the associated salmon leap are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"This was originally the site of a causeway across the River Dee. The weir was built in sandstone in 1093 for Hugh Lupus, 1st Earl of Chester, for the Benedictine Abbey of St Werburgh (now Chester Cathedral). It was designed to provide a head of water for the medieval mills on the river. The mills were demolished during the 20th century and the weir was restored to serve the Chester City Council's hydro-electric power station, which operated from 1913 to 1939 on the site of the former mills."
The weir continues to provide three essential roles in maintaining the very substantial water abstractions from the River Dee. It prevents tidal water ingress up-river for all but the highest tides; it provides the water head for an abstraction immediately behind the weir and it holds back what is a long linear lake which enables that largest abstraction to be taken at Huntington for the United Utilities supply to the Wirral and surrounding areas.
"The weir can be navigated by crossing over the top during high spring tides. On the city-side of the weir is the United Kingdom's only example of a weirgate, a low height single lock gate that can be opened to provide extra draft once the water levels on each side of the weir have equalised. This allows carefully planned passage from the non-tidal River Dee, via the short tidal estuary section, onto the Dee Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal (originally the Chester Canal) at certain times of year."
"United Utilities are due to vacate the turbine building by 2013, allowing installation of a new hydro electric generating plant."

= = = Salomée Halpir = = =
"Regina Salomée Halpir (1718 – after 1763) was an 18th-century oculist. She often earns the title of the first female doctor from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. What is known about her life is known from her memoirs, written in 1760, which is a unique example of travel memoir and women's literature. Halpir expressed decidedly un-womanly characteristics and ambitions. Instead of dedicating her life to raising children and being a good wife, as dictated by the 18th-century social norms, Halpir strove to become a successful medical doctor and expressed her hunger for travel and adventure."
"She is known under a great variety of names. Her first name is often given as Salomea, Salome, or Salomėja. In her memoir, she referred to herself as Salomea, but she signed the dedication as Regina. Her maiden name is rendered as Rusiecki, Rusiecka, Ruseckaitė, Rusieckich. Halpir or Halpirowa is her married name from the first marriage. Her name from the second marriage is rendered as Pilstein, Pilsztyn, Pilsztynowa, Pilštyniova, or Pichelstein. Even after bitter divorce from her second husband she continued to use his last name, perhaps because it sounded more noble. In the dedication of her memoir she used the fourth surname – Makowska. It has been suggested that it is the surname of her third husband, but the origin of that surname remains unknown."
"Halpir was born near Navahrudak, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to the family of Joachim Rusiecki of petty nobility. At the age of 14 she was married off to a German Lutheran oculist Dr. Jacob Halpir. The couple moved to Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, where Dr. Halpir practiced medicine and had many clients while facing cut-throat competition from Jewish and Muslim doctors. Despite, or perhaps because of, her being a poorly educated Christian woman in an Islamic country, Halpir was trained by her husband and assisted him in his operations eventually becoming an accomplished physician herself, with a specialty in cataract surgery. Her status as a female helped her find a niche serving female patients and her status as a foreigner helped her skirt Islamic traditions that severely limited women's freedom. Halpir never received any formal training in medicine."
"Later, her husband fell ill. He died leaving Halpir with their 2-year-old daughter, Constance. After this, Halpir embarked on an extensive journey throughout Europe. During the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39), she bought four Austrian prisoners of war. Three of them were ransomed by relatives while the fourth, ensign Pilstein, became her second husband. She traveled to Poland where Michał Kazimierz ""Rybeńko"" Radziwiłł made her husband an officer and offered her the position of doctor's residence in Nesvizh. Harpin traveled to Saint Petersburg to free some Turkish prisoners of war. There she gained access to the imperial court and met Empress Anna of Russia and future Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After several months she returned to Poland. She divorced her second husband, whom she bore two sons, after she accused him of adultery, attempting to poison her, and extortion. She moved to Vienna where Prince József Rákóczi fell in love with her, but she declined his marriage proposal. Halpir became romantically involved with a Polish nobleman, seven years her junior, who took advantage of her wealth. She also accused him of starving one of her sons to death. She returned to Constantinople and became a physician of the women in the harem of sultan Mustafa III. Until recently, her destiny after 1760, when she completed her memoir, was unknown. Dariusz Kołodziejczyk has found that in 1763 she was employed as a physician in the Khan’s harem in Bakhchysarai and as such she served as an informant of the Russian consul Aleksandr Nikiforov."
"Halpir's 388-page autobiography was discovered by a Polish historian Glatman in the library of Prince Czartoryski. The memoir was published as ""Proceder podróży i życia mego awantur"" (My Life's Travels and Adventures) in Poland in 1957. A number of the events in the memoir seem far-fetched and implausible. For example, she described how her leg became limp and visibly shorter due to a magic omen. Therefore, biographical accuracy of her memoir is disputed and some researchers prefer to treat it more as a work of fiction than factual autobiography."

"An Intent in the Android operating system is a software mechanism that allows users to coordinate the functions of different activities to achieve a task. An Intent is a messaging object which provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications in the Android development environment. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities: Intents provide an inter-application messaging system that encourages collaboration and component reuse."
"An Intent is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed. ""For Dummies"" likens an Intent to flicking a switch: ""Your intent is to turn on the light, and to do so, you perform the action of flipping the switch to the On position."""
"The concept was created as a way to allow developers to easily remix different apps and allow each type of task (called ""activity"") to be handled by the application best suited to it, even if provided by a third party. Although the concept was not new, the Android architecture doesn't require elevated privileges to access the components, which makes it an open platform."
"Activities in Android are defined as classes that control the life cycle of a task in the user interface. The activities supported by an application are declared in a manifest, so that other applications can read what activities are supported. Intents in one application can start particular activities in a different application, if the latter supports the message type of the Intent."

"The waving of the hand is a nonverbal gesture that has an unclear origin but is said to have dated back to as far as the 18th century however, it was not called waving and was not used as saying ""hello"", or ""goodbye."" The original gesture of waving was saluting. In the 18th century, knights removed the guard of their helmets to show their identity, following with a salute to show they come in peace; saluting is also used to show others that they are not armed with weapons and do not pose a threat. The action of saluting was formalised only in the 1780s by European armies, and since then, it has become a common way of properly addressing one another in the military setting. There is also an alternate ASL origin. In the 1800s, waving handkerchiefs was a way to show approval or excitement or to call attention for the deaf, and the Romans, which is known as the ""Chautauqua salute."" It is recorded during a Canadian event in 1884 that multiple attendees forgot their handkerchief and so waved their hands in the air as a way to clap during the event.. In modern days, the accepted and common way for a deaf individual to applaud is raising hands in the air and simultaneously shaking their open hand and moving their fingers back and forth."
"Waving ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" to the deaf requires a different protocol and has an alternate meaning than the standard, one action waving gesture that means both ""hello"" or ""goodbye."" For an ASL user or a deaf individual, saying ""goodbye"" is done by repeatedly opening and closing the right hand, and it faces the receiver of the gesture. This method is used to say ""goodbye"" to a group of people; saying ""goodbye"" to an individual is done with a different method. Saying ""hello"" is done by the traditional waving of the right hand. This method is used to say ""hello"" to a group of people, likewise with implying ""goodbye"", there is a different method to say ""hello"" to an individual."
"The waving of the hand has multiple variables and styles of performing the gesture. The common waving of the hand to mean ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the hand side to side, but there are more than one form of waving, each form having its own meaning."
"Waving has four variables: the open palm (is the palm curved or straight), the angle of the wave (big waves or short waves), the elevation of the hand (above the head or held low), and the movement pattern of the wave (sideways rotation, up and down motion, side to side motion)."
"There are different ways to wave the hand; some include the standard side-to-side wave, palm wide wave, wiggly wave (finger wiggle wave), ""flirtatious"" wave, open-and close finger wave, arm wave, and the ""Miss America"" wave."
"People wave by raising their hand and moving it from side to side. Another common wave is to raise one's hand and repeatedly move the fingers downward toward the palm. A variant known as the wiggly wave consists of holding the hand near shoulder level and wiggling the fingers randomly. This can be used to appear cute or flirtatious to the target of the wave. The gesture can be used to attract attention at a distance. Most commonly, though, the gesture means quite simply ""hello"" or ""goodbye"
"The royal wave, also known as a regal wave, pageant wave, parade wave, or Miss America wave, is a similar but distinct kind of hand waving gesture in which a person executes something alternatively described as either a 'plastic grin' with 'fingers cupped' and 'forearm swaying side-to-side' or a ""vertical hand with a slight twist from the wrist"". The gesture is often performed, to various degrees, by different members of the British royal family, signaling anything from regality, class and control to elegance, restraint and character."
"In American culture, waving is a known gesture that means ""hello"" or ""goodbye"". That gesture can also be used to call the attention of someone, for example waving down a taxi, or waving at a friend from a great distance. That gesture can may be interpreted differently and have a different meaning or even be highly offensive in South Korea, Europe, Nigeria, Greece, Bulgaria, Latin American countries, India, Japan, and other places.<ref name=""book/web ref""></ref>"
"In Nigeria, waving the hand with the palm facing outward in front of someone's face is highly offensive and should be avoided."
"In China, women greet other women by waving."
"In Japan, hand waving while the palm is kept outward and near the face is a gesture used to display confusion or that the individual waving does not know or understand."
"In South Korea, it is inappropriate to call the attention of someone with a palm-up arm wave. Instead, the proper way to wave to someone or call for attention is to wave vertically, making sure the palm of the hand is in a downward position. It is not uncommon to see waving among the younger population (in South Korea) to display their departure rather than bowing, which is the traditional way of greeting one another. Waving the hand outward towards the face is also used to grab the attention of a pet or child."
"In Europe, there are two different common forms of waving: the palm-show and the palm-hide. The palm-show is dominant across most of Europe, but Italy predominantly uses the palm-hide wave."
"Waving the hand to say ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the fingers down towards the wrist and back to an open palm position while keeping the palm facing out. Another way to say ""goodbye"" is done by wagging the fingers. That motion (wagging fingers) is also used to say ""no."""
"In Greece, waving the hand with the palm facing out is an insult, rather than a greeting."
"Holding the hand out, palm facing out and all five fingers exposed is offensive and dates back to the Byzantine times, when ""moutza"" would involve prisoners' faces being tainted with charcoal by their own hands and being forced to parade down town streets, ""moutza"". In American culture, holding the hand out like that can be used to call someone's attention or to greet someone."
"In Ireland, the deaf use the hand wave to greet one another. Deaf women use an ""open palms up half moon shape"" type of wave to greet one another. Men, however, use a different way of greeting one another or women."
"In Latin American countries, people greet one another by kissing, hugging or shaking hands. Waving their hand is uncommon, but it neither has any negative representation nor causes offense."
"In Nicaragua, waving to someone is tolerated but does not display proper etiquette. Instead, it is common to hug, kiss, or shake hands, following with the proper time of day (""good morning,"" ""good afternoon,"" or ""good evening"")."

"In 1954, he was a member of the Horace Henderson big band and in 1955 and 1956, he participated in a series of ""battles of the saxes"" with Tom Archia at the C&C Lounge."
"The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the interactive activation model (IAM) and the dual-route coding model (DRC) Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing."
"The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from lexical decision and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision. Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase ""A cow says..."" a person would guess ""moo"" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters)."
"The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by Rumelhart and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for ""C"", horizontal and vertical bars for ""H"", etc.). Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word ""WORK"" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader)."
"According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus. However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE."
"The AVM deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification."
"One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland reportwas that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular ""position"", they would experience the adverse word superiority effect. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word."

He served as head coach for part of a season with the Sacramento Kings, and a single game as an interim coach with the San Antonio Spurs. Hughes also worked in NBA scouting and basketball operations with the Kings, Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic."
"In 1968-1969, Hughes was Head Coach at Long Beach City College, his first collegiate job after coaching in high school. His squad finished 23-5. When Hughes left to be an assistant at Nebraska, he was replaced by Lute Olson, in his first collegiate job."
"Replacing Frank Truitt at Kent State University in 1974, Hughes' teams went 6-20, 12-14 and 8-19 over the next three seasons. The team started 1-10 in 1977-1978 when he was replaced by Mike Boyd."
"In 1978-1979, Hughes was Head Coach and General Manager of the Montana Sky (Great Falls, Montana) in the short-lived Western Basketball Association. The Sky were co-owned by country singer Charlie Pride. Notably, Hughes had Cazzie Russell and Brad Davis on the roster. Hughes was hired by the Sky mid-season when Coach Bill Klukas was fired after a 3-17 start. The league folded after one season."

= = = Maryland Route 170 = = =
"Maryland Route 170 (MD 170) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs from MD 175 in Odenton north to MD 2 in Brooklyn Park. MD 170 connects the western Anne Arundel County communities of Odenton and Severn and the North County communities of Linthicum, Pumphrey, and Brooklyn Park with Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport). The highway connects BWI Airport with Interstate 695 (I-695) and MD 100 and forms part of the Airport Loop, a circumferential highway that connects the airport and I-195 with many airport-related services."
"MD 170 originally served as the main highway between Baltimore and Fort George G. Meade. This highway, which included part of modern MD 174 west of Severn, was mostly constructed shortly after Camp Meade was established during World War I in the late 1910s. The Odenton–Severn portion of MD 170 was originally built as MD 554 in the 1930s, but became part of MD 170 in the mid-1940s. MD 170 went through another round of upgrades in the early 1940s due to its strategic importance during World War II. The highway originally passed through the area now occupied by BWI Airport. MD 170 was relocated north of MD 176 in the late 1940s during the construction of the airport and south of MD 176 in the late 1950s. The highway has been expanded to four lanes around its interchanges with I-195, I-695, MD 32, and MD 100 and along the perimeter of BWI Airport since the 1960s."
"MD 170 begins at an intersection with MD 175 (Annapolis Road) in Odenton. The highway continues south as county-maintained Piney Orchard Parkway, which leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line and the Piney Orchard community. MD 170 heads north on Telegraph Road, which begins as a four-lane divided highway but reduces to a two-lane undivided road and passes through an industrial area. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway again shortly before its diamond interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). MD 170 continues north as a two-lane road with a center left-turn lane that crosses Severn Run. The center turn lane ends as the highway approaches the center of Severn. There, the highway intersects MD 174, which heads west as Reece Road and east as Donaldson Avenue. MD 170 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it approaches its single-point urban interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The highway becomes an undivided four-lane road between MD 100 and its intersection with MD 176 (Dorsey Road) at Harmans. The long ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 100 is unsigned MD 170A."
"MD 170 continues north as Aviation Boulevard and joins the Airport Loop. The highway parallels the Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and the hiker-biker BWI Trail. MD 170 meets the eastern end of Stoney Run Road, which heads east and immediately loops back west and crosses over the state highway and the railroad on its way to the BWI Car Rental Facility. The highway intersects unsigned MD 995 (Amtrak Way), which leads to the BWI Rail Station serving Amtrak and MARC trains, as it gradually curves to the east. MD 170 crosses Kitten Branch immediately before its partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern terminus of I-195 and the northern terminus of MD 995A (Metropolitan Boulevard). The highway passes under the BWI Trail and expands to a divided highway before its intersection with Terminal Road and an at-grade intersection with MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink. Access to the rail line's BWI Business District station is via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection. MD 170 leaves the Airport Loop at its intersection with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), where the highway turns north onto Camp Meade Road."
"MD 170 intersects the Baltimore Light Rail again and begins to parallel it as a two-lane road with a center turn lane. The light rail veers away to the east shortly before the highway's intersection with MD 762 (Andover Road), where the center turn lane ends. MD 170 enters Linthicum and intersects the light rail line a third time and begins to parallel it again shortly before the Linthicum station in the center of the community. The highway intersects MD 169 (Maple Road) and expands to a four-lane divided highway shortly before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). There is no access from MD 170 to eastbound I-695 or from westbound I-695 to MD 170. The highway reduces to a two-lane road again and passes the North Linthicum station just south of MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard) in the center of Pumphrey. MD 170 continues northeast as Belle Grove Road, which veers away from the light rail line. The highway parallels the Patapsco River and passes under I-895 Spur (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) before entering Brooklyn Park. There, MD 170 reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with MD 2, Jack Street, and Hanover Street at the Baltimore city limits. MD 2 heads south as Governor Ritchie Highway toward Glen Burnie and north into the city as Potee Street."
"MD 170 is a part of the National Highway System from its southern terminus in Odenton to I-695 in Linthicum. Within that stretch, there are two sections that serve as intermodal passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. The portions from MD 32 in Odenton to MD 176 in Severn and from MD 162 to I-695 within Linthicum are National Highway System principal arterials."
"When the Maryland State Roads Commission applied numbers to state highways, they assigned MD 170 to its current corridor from Severn to Brooklyn Park and to what is now MD 174 from Severn to Fort Meade. The portion of the modern highway from Odenton to Severn was originally MD 554. Much of what was to become MD 170 was constructed along the Old Annapolis Road between Pumphrey and Severn. A portion of this road ran through the hamlet of Wellham Crossroads in the middle of what is now BWI Airport. The highway was paved in macadam from the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard in Pumphrey to Hammonds Ferry Road in Linthicum by 1910. A second section of improved highway was planned by 1910 from Linthicum south to Wellham Crossroads. A section of highway from the current MD 170–MD 174 intersection in Severn west to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) was built as a concrete road by 1915."
"Construction on the highway from Severn to Linthicum became a high priority with the United States' entrance into World War I; the remainder of the Severn–Linthicum highway and the highway from the railroad at Severn southwest to newly established Camp Meade, now collectively called the Camp Meade Road, were paved in concrete between 1916 and 1919. Belle Grove Road from Pumphrey to Brooklyn Park was also paved in concrete in this period of time. A poorly constructed portion of the Camp Meade Road between Wellham Crossroads and Dorsey Road was repaved with asphalt in 1919. MD 170 was relocated at the railroad crossing when the highway's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed in 1931. The old road, which is now Severn Station Road west of the tracks and Old Camp Meade Road to the east, became MD 483."
"Telegraph Road from Severn to Odenton was built as a concrete road in three sections. The highway was constructed from the right-angle turn in the Camp Meade Road in Severn south to Evergreen Road in 1932 and 1933. Another section of MD 554 was completed from Odenton Road (then MD 180 and later MD 677) in Odenton to a point north of Old Mill Road in 1936. The gap in MD 554 was filled in or shortly after 1940. MD 170 was widened to from Brooklyn Park to Pumphrey in 1940. With the outbreak of World War II, MD 170 was designated a road of strategic importance to connect Baltimore with Fort Meade; the highway was reconstructed as a asphalt-surfaced concrete road in 1942. By 1946, MD 170 and MD 554 had swapped numbers, with the former now the road from Severn to Odenton."
"MD 170 was relocated as a road from MD 176 north to what is now the MD 170–MD 162 junction in 1947 and 1948 to make way for the construction of Friendship International Airport. The highway's interchange with the Friendship International Airport Access Road, which was designated MD 46 and later became I-195, was started in 1950, the same year the airport opened, and completed in 1954. South of the airport, MD 170 ran concurrently with MD 176 from the current MD 176–MD 652 intersection west to current MD 170A, which the highway used to connect with the modern alignment of MD 170. The stub of MD 170 north from MD 176 to Friendship Cemetery on the airport reservation became MD 652. MD 170 assumed its present alignment west of MD 170A when the highway was relocated from MD 176 south to the site of the MD 100 interchange as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway between 1958 and 1960. The old alignment became much of current MD 652 and the portion of MD 652 north of MD 176 was transferred to county maintenance."
"When the expressway spur between MD 168 and U.S. Route 301 (now MD 648) was built between 1951 and 1954, the expressway, which became part of the Baltimore Beltway, included an at-grade intersection with MD 170 between Linthicum and Pumphrey. This junction was replaced with the present interchange in 1967; MD 170 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of the interchange in 1968. MD 170's grade separation with Stoney Run Road on the west side of the airport was built in 1982. The state highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from north of I-195 to MD 162 when the adjacent east–west portion of MD 162 was built in 1988. MD 170 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with MD 100 when the single-point urban interchange was built in 1995. MD 170 had been expanded to four lanes through its interchange with MD 32 and from MD 176 through the I-195 interchange, and had its southern terminus rolled back from MD 677 to MD 175, by 1999."
"MD 170A is the designation for the one-way ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 170 southwest of BWI Airport. The ramp is included in the clockwise direction of the Airport Loop and has a spur near its southern end. MD 170A, which has the official designation of MD 170 Spur, was assigned by 1999."

In 2014 Weitzman paid a world record $9.48 million for the British Guiana 1c magenta stamp. In May 2017, Stuart Weitzman Holdings, LLC, appointed Giovanni Morelli as Creative Director and Weitzman stepped down from his role."
"In the late 1950s, Weitzman's father, Seymour Weitzman and his older brother Warren opened a shoe factory in Haverhill, Massachusetts, called ""Seymour Shoes"". Weitzman began designing shoes for his father's business in the early 1960s."
"Weitzman graduated from George W. Hewlett High School in 1958 and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1963. When Seymour died in 1965, Warren and Stuart ran the business. They sold the business to a company in Spain in 1971, and Weitzman continued to design shoes for the company. In 1994, he bought back the business, but he continues to manufacture his shoe designs in Spain."
"Weitzman is known for providing one-of-a-kind, ""million dollar"" shoes to an Oscar nominee to wear at the Academy Awards, including a pair of platinum sandals adorned with 464 diamonds that actress Laura Harring wore to the 2002 ceremony. For the 2007 Oscars, shoes were designed for and provided to Diablo Cody, who subsequently declined to wear them, stating that she was not aware of nor interested in the publicity attendant with wearing the shoes. Weitzman uses unique materials including cork, vinyl, lucite, wallpaper, and 24-karat gold. His shoes are sold in over 70 countries."
"The eponymous company that Weitzman founded has changed hands a number of times. Jones Apparel Group purchased a majority stake in the company in 2010 and later bought the remaining 45 percent of shares retained by Weitzman in 2012. In January 2015, Sycamore Partners LLC (the private equity fund that owns Jones Apparel Group) agreed to sell the company to Coach, the luxury fashion house, for $574 million. As part of the deal, Weitzman stayed on as a shoe designer for the company."
Weitzman is married to Jane Gershon. Stuart and Jane have two daughters.
"On June 17, 2014, Weitzman, who had collected stamps as a child, anonymously purchased the ""world's most famous stamp"", the British Guiana 1c magenta at a Sotheby's auction in New York for $9,480,000, including buyer's premium, the highest price ever paid for a postage stamp. Weitzman has since identified himself as the purchaser and has lent the stamp to the National Postal Museum for exhibition. In June 2015, Weitzman also identified himself as the current owner of the unique plate block of four 1918 U.S. 24-cent Inverted Jennies, widely regarded as the world's most celebrated philatelic printing error."

= = = Women's rugby union = = =
"Women's rugby union is a sport identical to men's rugby union with the same rules, same sized pitch, and same equipment. However, it has a history which is significantly different, due to various social pressures, and the self-image of rugby union in general. As a result, this history has been largely hidden until comparatively recently, although the game is gaining a higher profile thanks to international tournaments and financial investment."
"The secretive nature of the early years of women's sport—and especially rugby union—ensures that we do not really know where it began. Public reaction to women playing contact sports could be disrespectful, or even violent. In 1881, when two teams played a number of exhibition ""football"" games in Scotland and northern England, several games had to be abandoned due to rioting in or around the grounds."
"While most of these games appear to have been played to the new Association Football rules, it is clear from reports in the ""Liverpool Mercury"" of 27 June 1881 that at least one of these games, played at the Cattle Market Inn Athletic Grounds, Stanley, Liverpool on the 25th, involved scoring goals following ""touchdowns"" and may therefore have been played to at least a version of rugby rules."
"Whether this was the case is unknown. However, a series of sporting cigarette cards, published 1895 in the Liverpool, includes an image of a woman apparently playing what looks like rugby in kit very similar to that described in reports of the 1881 team (see left). It is therefore possible that these ""exhibition"" games similar to those in 1881 may have continued (with no press reporting) or the pictures may have been reprints for earlier illustrations inspired by the 1881 games, or they may just be an ""amusing"" cartoon or an illustration of a sport that was not actually being played. Again no further details are available."
Other than this the official record is silent for most of the nineteenth century. Some girls played the game unofficially as part of their school teams—and the earliest confirmed record of any female definitely playing rugby at any level anywhere in the world comes from a school game.
"This happened at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Emily Valentine's brothers were responsible for the formation of the school's first rugby team in c1884. Emily practised with the team and in c1887 she played for the school, scoring a try."
The first documented evidence of an attempt to form a purely women's team is from 1891 when a tour of New Zealand by a team of female rugby players was cancelled due to a public outcry.
There are also early reports of women's rugby union being played in France (1903) and England (1913) but in both cases the game was largely behind closed doors.
"During the First World War some women's charity games were organised, the most well documented taking place at Cardiff Arms Park on 16 December 1917, when Cardiff Ladies beat Newport Ladies 6–0. Maria Eley played full-back for Cardiff and went on to become probably the oldest women's rugby player before she died in Cardiff in 2007 at the age of 106. The Cardiff team (who all worked for Hancocks a local brewery) all wore protective headgear, which predates their male counterparts by some decades."
"In Sydney in 1921, two women's teams played a game of rugby league in front a crowd of 30,000—a photograph appeared in ""The Times"" in 1922—but pressure from authorities ensured that they did not play again. Throughout the 1920s a popular form of women's football game very similar to rugby called ""barette"" was played across France. The game had only minor differences to the full game (games were 10-a-side and had some minor restrictions on tackling) and there were national championships throughout the decade. It received support from several male rugby players and film also exists of a game being played in 1928. Both barette and the full game of rugby featured in several newspaper cartoons and many photographs exist. For reasons unknown the game appears to fade away in the 1930s."
"In 1930 a women's league playing the full game was formed in Australia, in the New South Wales areas of Tamworth and Armidale, which ran until halted by World War Two. Photographs of women's teams also exist from New Zealand from the same period and during the war Maori women took up the game. After the war in 1956 The ""Belles of St Mary’s""—an Australian women's rugby league team—played games in New South Wales—but even as late as the 1960s Women's rugby was banned in Samoa."
"The 1960s was the decade in which the game finally began to put down roots, initially in the universities of Western Europe. In 1962 the first recorded UK women's rugby union team appears at Edinburgh University, in 1963 female students participate in matches against male students in London, and in 1965 university sides are being formed in France."
"As the pioneering students left university an adult game began to evolve. Initially (1966) this tended to be confined to charity matches between male and female teams (especially at Worthing RFC, England), though the UK's ""Daily Herald"" newspaper includes photographs of girls' teams training in Thornhill, near Dewsbury in Yorkshire in 1965, and at Tadley in Hampshire in 1966—and appealing for fixtures. It is not recorded whether these teams did arrange any games, and so it is not until 1 May 1968 that the first fully documented and recorded women's club match takes place, in France, at Toulouse Fémina Sports in front of ""thousands of spectators"". The success of the event lead to the formation of the first national association for women's rugby union—the ""Association Francaise de Rugby Feminin"" (AFRF) at Toulouse, in 1970."
"1970 also saw the first reports of women's rugby union in Canada, and by 1972 four universities in the United States were playing the game: University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the University of Illinois and the University of Missouri. By 1975 university students at Wageningen in the Netherlands were playing, and in the same year clubs appeared in Spain (Arquitectura in Madrid and Osas in Barcelona). The first non-university clubs formed in 1978 in Canada and Netherlands, and in Italy (Milan) a year later."
"By 1980 there were club championships in the United States and Sweden, and provincial championships in New Zealand. The game first appeared in Japan in 1981 and in February 1982 University College, London's women's team went on a tour to France playing, amongst other teams, Pontoise—the first recorded overseas tour by a UK team (and possibly the first international tour by any team). A few months later on 13 June 1982 the first women's international—Netherlands 0, France 4—took place at Utrecht (see Women's international rugby union for more details on the history of the international game)."
"In the UK 1983 saw the Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU) formed to govern the game across the British Isles. Founder member clubs are: Leicester Polytechnic, Sheffield University, University College London, University of Keele, Warwick University, Imperial College, Leeds University, Magor Maidens, York University and Loughborough University."

She tells Griffin someone is coming, and he attempts to unplug the TV, causing the lights to go out of control. Maddie then tells the family: ""They're here"" while touching their TV screen."
"The following evening, Eric and Amy go to dinner with their friends, leaving the three children at home. They learn that their house was built on an old cemetery, although the property developer was supposed to have relocated the human remains. Kendra wakes up to a strange sound in the laundry room. While investigating the noise, the floor cracks and a corpse's hand emerges. It begins pulling at her foot, but she manages to pull herself up. Meanwhile, Griffin notices the clown dolls seem to be moving by themselves. One clown doll attacks him, but he destroys it and runs from his bedroom. He finds Maddie in her room, scared, crouching in a corner, and tells her to stay while he goes to find Kendra. Maddie is then lured into her closet and becomes lost in an unending void. As she sees her bedroom drifting away further, she is dragged into the darkness by ghosts. Griffin is grabbed through a window by the branches of the old tree outside their house, which pulls him outside. Amy and Eric arrive home to see Griffin being tossed around in the tree branches, which releases its grip when they come close, while Kendra tells them she can't find Maddie."
"The family hears Maddie's voice emanating from the television. Amy places her hand on the television screen while Maddie's static hand is seen to be touching Amy's hand from the other side of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff set up equipment in the house and install GPS devices on everyone in the house. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he breaks down the closet wall, throwing a chair into the darkness inside the closet; the chair falls back into the living room of the house, revealing a possible portal Maddie can escape through. The investigators realize that the haunting is a poltergeist. The lead investigator, Dr. Brooke Powell, decides to call occult specialist and television personality Carrigan Burke (revealed, much later, to be Powell's ex)."
"Carrigan explains that Maddie is a possible psychic, able to communicate with spirits. He reveals that the ghosts are trapped and are angry because only the headstones were moved to the new cemetery, but the bodies remain; they plan on using Maddie ""to free them from their purgatory"". Carrigan comes up with a plan to get Maddie back. He anchors a rope in Maddie's room and tosses it into the vortex. They attempt to use Griffin's toy drone to guide Maddie out, but it is immediately destroyed by the ghosts when inside the portal. Griffin, guilt-ridden over leaving Maddie alone in the first place, goes through the portal himself. When he finds Maddie, the ghosts attempt to destroy the rope to trap them, but Griffin and Maddie grab onto the rope and are brought back through the portal."
"The family get in their car and begin to leave the house, but the ghosts drag them back into the house and attempt to abduct Maddie again. The family saves her from being sucked into the portal, and Carrigan decides that as the only other psychic, he must go into the vortex and lead the spirits into the light. The Bowens flee as the house is destroyed by the spirits soaring into the sky as a beacon of light. The investigative team run to their equipment, looking for a sign that Carrigan managed to get back."
"As the Bowens look for a new house, the realtor shows them a house with lots of closet space and an old tree in the backyard; the Bowens drive away laughing. During the end credits, it's revealed that Carrigan survived the incident and is back filming his ghost program, now hosting the show with Dr. Powell."
"In early September 2013, the crew shot interior scenes for the film in an old residence in Toronto. Exterior shots were filmed on the West Mountain of Hamilton. Principal photography began on September 23 and ended on December 13, 2013."
"On August 6, 2014, the film's release date was shifted from February 13, 2015 to July 24, 2015. On March 4, 2015, the date was shifted again to when it was previously set for ""Spy"". It was released in 3D."
"The film's first trailer was released on February 5, 2015. Forrest Wickman of ""Slate Magazine""'s opinion was that the trailer made the film appear to be too similar to the original film. James Hibberd of ""Entertainment Weekly"" said that the trailer ""retains and amplifies several elements from the original"", and praised that ""the modernizing doesn’t result in, say, the family’s daughter being kidnapped by ghosts in Snapchat"". Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting stated that ""while every fiber of my being wants to reject it, [the film] actually looks pretty insane"", and praised the trailer's final shot. Ben Kuchera of ""Polygon"" also opined that the trailer appeared to be similar to the original film, but that it ""looks great, as a horror movie""."
"""Poltergeist"" was released on DVD Blu-ray Disc and Blu-ray 3D on September 29, 2015. The Blu-ray editions included an extended cut of the film."
"On April 10, 2019, it was announced that the Russo brothers would helm a new remake of the franchise."
"On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 31% based on 129 reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads: ""Paying competent homage without adding anything of real value to the original ""Poltergeist"", this remake proves just as ephemeral (but half as haunting) as its titular spirit."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""C+"" on an A+ to F scale."
"Writing for ""Variety"", Andrew Barker called it ""generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary"" and concluded: ""Even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates ""Poltergeist""s themes, it’s hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings"". Neil Genzlinger gave the film a mostly positive review in ""The New York Times"", writing: ""The new ""Poltergeist"" might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane, even if they do now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes"". Eddie Goldberger echoed that sentiment in The New York Daily News, writing ""It doesn't approach the original--really, how could it? But the new ""Poltergeist"" is a fun, worthy horror entry."" Tirdad Derakhshani wrote in ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"": ""It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled"", adding: ""Why would anyone want to remake ""Poltergeist"" in the first place?"". Writing in ""The Daily Telegraph"", Mike McCahill called the film ""an efficient scare-machine"". Bilge Ebiri wrote in ""New York"" magazine: ""This new ""Poltergeist"" isn't anything special... But it's not a travesty, and that feels like cause for brief celebration""."
"Other critics took a more skeptical view of the film. Writing a review for ""The Village Voice"", Alan Scherstuhl stated, """"Poltergeist 2015"" is to ""Poltergeist '82"" what today's shipped-frozen-to-the-store Pizza Hut dough is to the kneaded-on-site pies the chain's stoned cooks tossed in the Reagan era. It's the same kind of thing, with the same shape and some shared ingredients, but the texture's gone limp, and there's no sense of occasion about it, and there's some unpalatable goop stuffed in the crust. In a pinch, it beats pizzalessness — but just barely."" Linda Cook wrote in ""The Quad City Times"", ""The ""Poltergeist"" remake is OK, but won't stay with you."" Randy Cordova in ""The Arizona Republic"" wrote, ""Ultimately, the whole affair is forgettable."""
"""Poltergeist"" grossed $47.4 million in North America and $48.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $95.6 million against a budget of an estimated $35 million."
"In North America, ""Poltergeist"" made $1.4 million during its Thursday night showings from 2,500 theaters, and an estimated $9.4 million on its opening day. Through its first three-day opening, it grossed $22.6 million from 3,240 theaters, debuting at fourth place at the box office behind ""Tomorrowland"", ""Pitch Perfect 2"" and """". In comparison to prior horror film reboots, its opening is well below the openings of 2009's ""Friday the 13th"" ($40.57 million), 2010's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" ($32.9 million), 2003's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ($28.1 million), and right below 2005's ""The Amityville Horror"" ($23.5 million)."
"Outside North America, it earned $8.3 million on its opening weekend from 3,750 screens in 36 countries, finishing at sixth place at the international box office. In the UK, Ireland and Malta it opened in third place with $2.2 million and Brazil with $2 million."

= = = Bye Bye Blues (film) = = =
Bye Bye Blues is a 1989 Canadian film. It was written and directed by Anne Wheeler and produced by Alberta Motion Picture Development Corporation with the assistance of Allarcom Limited.
"During World War II, Daisy Cooper (Rebecca Jenkins) returns home to her small Alberta town after she and her soldier husband, Teddy (Michael Ontkean), are split by the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. While waiting for the war to end and to learn if Teddy is alive or dead, she joins a swing band as a singer to provide for her family, performing with them in many community halls. Daisy and her children initially live with her husband's parents, but later rent a house for themselves, as Daisy chafes under her in-laws' scrutiny. Daisy struggles to balance societal expectations of fealty and commitment to her children, while also struggling to financially support herself and her children by travelling and performing with the band. A trombonist in the band has a secret past and a not so secret yearning. Daisy struggles with an impossible choice as she hears that Teddy is returning home."
"Her husband's sister, a somewhat similar free spirit, befriends an Australian airman in Alberta to train in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan."
"The cast also includes Luke Reilly, Leslie Yeo, Kate Reid, Wayne Robson, Robyn Stevan, and Stuart Margolin."
"The film was nominated for twelve Genie Awards at the 11th Genie Awards in 1990, and won three: Best Actress (Jenkins), Best Supporting Actress (Stevan), and Best Original Song (""When I Sing"" by Bill Henderson)."
"Springwater School in Starland County, Alberta, Canada was used as a set."
"There are a number of buildings in Alberta's Ghost Town - Rowley, Alberta."
This town's buildings were refaced and looks like a Hollywood movie set - hence its nickname Rowleywood.

= = = Dean Kiely = = =
Dean Laurence Kiely (born 10 October 1970) is a former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is the goalkeeping coach at Premier League club Crystal Palace. He won eleven caps for the Republic of Ireland as a player. Kiely has previously worked as the goalkeeping coach at West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City.
"Born in Salford, Lancashire, Kiely trained with the West Bromwich Albion youth system as a schoolboy before being accepted into the FA School of Excellence at Lilleshall. After Albion he progressed through the Coventry City youth system as a trainee before signing a professional contract on 30 October 1987. He went to Ipswich Town on loan in November 1989 but failed to make any league appearances. Kiely joined York City on loan on 9 March 1990 before joining permanently in May, when he was given his first chance at regular first-team football. He made 210 league appearances for them between 1990 and 1996, and played in their 3–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the League Cup."
"Following a trial with Plymouth Argyle, Kiely signed for Bury on 15 August 1996 for a tribunal-decided fee of £125,000. He spent three seasons at Bury, making 137 league appearances in the process. He was instrumental in Bury winning the Second Division title in the 1996–97 season, most notably with an 88th-minute penalty save in the penultimate game of the season from Watford's Tommy Mooney. Bury requiring a point to guarantee a second automatic promotion in as many seasons had Kiely to thank after he kept the scoreline at 0–0 in a memorable day at Vicarage Road."
"Kiely moved to Charlton Athletic for a fee of £1 million on 26 May 1999 and made his debut on 7 August against Barnsley. He was Charlton's regular keeper from 1999 to 2005, and was popular with the club's fans as well as having a majestic ""shut out"" rate. Having been signed from a lower-division club he was seen as an example of Alan Curbishley's ability to spot talent in unheralded players. Kiely made a point-blank save from Birmingham City player Christophe Dugarry in a game at St Andrew's on 3 November 2003; Charlton went on to win the game 2–1 and Kiely later named the save as the favourite one of his career. He also saved a penalty from Crystal Palace's Andy Johnson to help secure a 1-0 win in December 2004."
"He signed for Portsmouth for an undisclosed fee on 25 January 2006, and played a large part in their escape from relegation that same season. His Pompey debut was in the FA Cup against Liverpool at Fratton Park in a 2–1 defeat. After David James signed for Portsmouth on 11 August, he voiced his frustration at having to compete with a top goalkeeper for the No. 1 spot, and with Jamie Ashdown also on their books, he opted to leave Portsmouth in the autumn."
He signed for Championship club Luton Town on a one-month loan
"on 23 November 2006, making his debut in the 2–1 away defeat at Southampton on 25 November. He then joined Championship side West Bromwich Albion on 30 January 2007, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract, as a replacement for Russell Hoult. Kiely made his Albion debut in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle the following day."
"Kiely reached the milestone of 700 senior career appearances on 1 September 2007, and recorded a clean sheet as Albion beat Barnsley 2–0. He signed a new deal with West Brom in January 2008, which would expire in June 2009. Kiely's clean sheet in the 3–0 home win against Plymouth Argyle on 1 March 2008 saw him named in the Championship Team of the Week.<ref name=""Team Of The Week (03/03/2008)""></ref> Later that month however, he was the subject of criticism and booing from his team's own fans during Albion's 4–3 victory over Colchester United, but retained his starting place. He nonetheless kept 18 clean sheets in all competitions to win the Championship Golden Glove award, while Albion won promotion to the Premier League as champions and reached the FA Cup semi-final. Since then, Kiely had to play second fiddle to England international Scott Carson. In spite of that, he was awarded a one-year extension at the club as a 'reward' from boss Tony Mowbray for his professionalism. And following an injury to Carson in training, Kiely was handed his first Premier League start against Wigan Athletic on 9 May 2009, producing some fine saves as the Baggies won 3–1 to keep their survival hopes alive, earning praise from Mowbray in the process. Mowbray was also quick to hail Kiely's professionalism throughout the season in handling his situation with dignity. That performance ensured that he kept his place for the club's final two games of the season, although he was unable to prevent relegation following a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Liverpool. On 24 May 2009 he kept a clean sheet in the club's final game against Blackburn Rovers as the match finished in a 0–0 stalemate."
"Since relegation to the Championship Kiely has once again had to be content playing second fiddle to Carson, who was named the new club captain by new manager Roberto Di Matteo, but on 8 December 2009 he made his first Championship appearance of the season as a replacement, coming on for the sent-off Carson and saving a penalty (though Peter Whittingham scored from the rebound) in a 2–0 home defeat to Cardiff City. He went on to play a run of three games while Carson sat through a suspension following his headbutting of Cardiff striker Michael Chopra, against QPR (2–2), Peterborough United (2–0), and Scunthorpe United (3–1). Kiely had also been performing the duties of goalkeeping coach following the retirement of former trainer Joe Corrigan, and in April 2010 was officially named goalkeeping coach of the club. On 18 April 2010, Kiely made his fifth appearance of the season as a half-time substitute for the injured Carson in a 2–0 home win over Middlesbrough. He retired as a player at the end of the 2010–11 season after West Brom opted against extending his contract, however he remained at the club as a coach. In January 2015, upon the appointment of new West Bromwich Albion manager, Tony Pulis, Kiely was released by the club. In March 2015, he was appointed Norwich City's goalkeeping coach."
"In September 2017, Kiely was appointed the goalkeeping coach at Championship club Preston North End."
"In January 2018, Kiely joined Premier League club Crystal Palace as goalkeeping coach."
"Kiely played for England at under-15 (13 caps), under-16 (13 caps) and under-18 (four caps in 1988) levels. He made one appearance for Republic of Ireland B, starting in a 4–3 win over League of Ireland XI on 9 February 1999, in which he was substituted for Nick Colgan. He went on to represent the Republic of Ireland at full international level, earning his first cap as a substitute in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-off against Turkey in November 1999. He retired from international football in February 2003, but in April 2008 Ireland's assistant manager Liam Brady suggested that Kiely could make a return to the squad. The rumours were then confirmed when he returned to the Ireland squad in Giovanni Trapattoni's first squad as manager in May 2008. He won his first cap in five years when he appeared in the Republic's 1–1 draw with Serbia that month, playing the full 90 minutes. On 28 May 2009, he walked out of the Ireland squad after Trapattoni informed him that he would be replacing Shay Given with Keiren Westwood for the second half of the friendly International against Nigeria at Craven Cottage on 29 May. He was capped 11 times by the Republic of Ireland, last appearing in 2008."

= = = My Fellow Americans = = =
"My Fellow Americans is a 1996 American comedy film starring Jack Lemmon and James Garner as feuding ex-presidents. Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Esther Rolle, John Heard, Wilford Brimley, Bradley Whitford and Jeff Yagher are also in the cast. It is named for the traditional opening of Presidential addresses to the American people."
"Lemmon's perennial collaborator, Walter Matthau, was slated to costar. Health problems kept him from appearing so Garner was chosen to star opposite Lemmon for their first project together."
"Republican Senator Russell Kramer of Ohio (Jack Lemmon) wins the Presidential election, narrowly defeating archrival Democratic Governor Matt Douglas of Indiana (James Garner). Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the now-incumbent Kramer. Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President, William Haney (Dan Aykroyd), defeats Douglas. His Vice President, Ted Matthews (John Heard), is widely seen as an idiot, and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the administration. A further three years later, Kramer is spending his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions, while Douglas is finishing his own book and going through a divorce."
"Meanwhile, the Democratic Party learns about ""Olympia"", codename for a series of bribes from defense contractor Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) paid to Haney when he was Vice President. The Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Hollis (Wilford Brimley) asks Douglas to investigate. Hollis offers the support of the Democratic Party for a Presidential run in return for his help. Douglas accepts, hoping to beat Haney and get back into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Haney and his Chief of Staff Carl Witnaur (Bradley Whitford) plot to frame Kramer for the scandal. When rumors begin to suggest that Kramer was involved in Olympia, he begins his own investigation."
"NSA agent Colonel Paul Tanner (Everett McGill) has Reynolds assassinated when he attempts to tell Douglas the truth about Olympia. Kramer arrives at the scene to find Douglas with Reynolds' body. Before they can flee, Douglas and Kramer are forced to board Marine One by White House officials, claiming to be taking them to Camp David at the request of Haney. During the flight Douglas realizes that they are heading in the wrong direction. Suspicious, they force the pilots to land. They disembark just before the helicopter explodes."
"Kramer and Douglas are left stranded, with the realization that the explosion was meant to kill them. They decide to go to Kramer's Presidential Library in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio to obtain records the overly-frugal Kramer kept of all meals served during his time in the White House, which will prove Haney was present at a key meeting with Reynolds. During a series of misadventures, they meet a variety of ordinary Americans and see the effects their terms in office have had. After several close encounters with NSA agents, they arrive at the library and discover the evidence has been tampered with to implicate Kramer. A guard gives Kramer a message from Reynolds' secretary stating that Witnaur had recently met with Reynolds. Douglas and Kramer kidnap Witnaur and with Joe Hollis's help, force him to reveal the plot to frame Kramer, though Witnaur claims to have no knowledge of the attempts on their lives, blaming Tanner and Haney. They at first decide to report Witnaur's confession to Kay Griffin (Sela Ward), a Fox News journalist, but Douglas, based upon their adventures, convinces Kramer go to the White House to confront Haney, seeing it as a chance of redemption for their poor choices as Presidents."
"They manage to sneak into the White House with the help of the White House Executive Chef Rita (Esther Rolle) and make it to the Executive Residence only to discover that Haney is giving a press conference outside. Tanner traps Douglas and Kramer in a guest room but they utilize a secret tunnel to escape while the NSA gives chase. Tanner catches up with them and is about to shoot them when he himself is killed by Secret Service Sniper Lieutenant Ralph Fleming (Jeff Yagher), who has recognized the presidents from a chance encounter at a gay pride parade during their adventure, and disobeys orders to shoot them."
"Douglas and Kramer interrupt Haney's speech and take him to the Oval Office to talk. There they play Haney a tape of Witnaur's confession, but Haney denies knowledge of Reynolds' murder or the helicopter explosion. Haney agrees to resign and proceeds to give a resignation speech, claiming to have heart problems. Douglas and Kramer muse that the idiotic Matthews will now be elevated from Vice President to President and realize that the only way it could have happened was under these circumstances. The pair confront Matthews who admits that he, not Haney, had engineered the entire plot so that he could become President, knowing Haney would take the fall. Matthews explains that his stupidity was just an act, but Douglas secretly records his confession on tape. Matthews is sent to prison."
"Nine months later, Douglas and Kramer are running together as independents in the Presidential election, arguing which of them will be the nominee for president. Douglas distracts Kramer by throwing a dollar on the floor, and takes to the podium to announce himself as the Presidential candidate, much to the chagrin of Kramer."
"Most of the principal filming for the film was done in the mountains of western North Carolina. Scenes were filmed along the Broad River where it flows into Lake Lure in Rutherford County, Dillsboro, along the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad; Waynesville, where a giant clown sign crashes through their windshield as they try to flee and where they find the baby in the stolen car is in Marshall, North Carolina; and in Asheville, at the Biltmore Estate."
"In Asheville, North Carolina, the downtown area stands in for an unnamed town in West Virginia. There, the Western Carolina University Marching Band portrays the ""All Dorothy Marching Band"" (a fictional group based upon gay icon Judy Garland's character in ""The Wizard of Oz""), at a gay pride parade."
"In his memoirs, Garner wrote that he enjoyed working with Lemmon but felt the director ""was a self appointed genius who didn't know his ass from second case and Jack and I both knew it."""
The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10.
"Roger Ebert of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" praised the performances of Lemmon and Garner but felt the movie was ""a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities"". However, he said that ""a lot of the cheap shots are funny, and maybe the climate is wrong for sharply barbed political satire. I dunno. This is not a great comedy and will be soon forgotten, but it has nice moments."" James Berardinelli of ""ReelViews"" also complimented the actors, writing ""Lemmon and Garner slip comfortably into their roles"" and saying the movie has ""some good one-liners"", but he criticized the ""failed attempts to inject embarrassingly trite melodrama and recycled action sequences into the story"" and also felt the political satire was ""weak and obligatory"". Mick LaSalle of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" described ""My Fellow Americans"" as a ""pleasing but mediocre film, with a great cast, a great story and a misguided script."""

After Zelalem received his citizenship, Sunil Gulati, head of U.S. Soccer, revealed that the board for U.S. Soccer had started the process to allow Zelalem to become eligible to play for the U.S. national team. Due to a FIFA rule designed to prevent players from naturalizing to and representing nations to which they lack ties, Zelalem was subject to waiting a minimum of five years before he could start to represent the United States.

But in March 2014, he withdrew from the Germany under-17 national team for the Group 5 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship elite round fixtures, and again turned down the Germany under-18 national team for friendly matches versus France in March 2015, citing his desire to represent the United States instead."
"Prior to making his one-time switch to the United States, Zelalem was eligible to represent Ethiopia internationally, due to his parents' nationality. In October 2013, Ethiopia's coach Sewnet Bishaw and Ethiopian foreign minister Tedros Adhanom stated that they hoped Zelalem would opt to play for Ethiopia, but Zelalem turned down the opportunity."

= = = Nema aviona za Zagreb = = =
"Nema aviona za Zagreb (""There Is No Plane to Zagreb"") is a 2012 Dutch film by Louis van Gasteren. The film is a retrospective of events in the director's life from 1964 to 1969, filmed by him in that period and reflected on from his vantage point over 40 years later at the age of 90. It is also Jan de Bont's first film credit as cinematographer since 1992's ""Basic Instinct""."
"In 1964 van Gasteren decided to film all his movements, both outward and inner. He narrates early in the film, ""I wanted to make a film about my memories, my observations and experiences. As a filmmaker, I can make that visible."" Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, ""I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take (he takes a deliberate step forward in the room) – also inwards (points to his chest) – everything I am involved in (gestures at the objects in the room)."""
"The film crisscrosses the globe. Countries the film is shot in include the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, Yugoslavia, France, Canada, West Germany, the United States, India, and Spain. The film mixes documentary with enacted scenes, and is shot in both color and black-and-white."
"The film winds up being a journey of a man in search of truth, seeking to shed lies and illusions, as well as reconcile his relationships with human beings."
"As the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren—a documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands—is seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when ""anything was possible."" He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not."
"We then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the carousel and sees the sights, including a ""Fat Lady"" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds."
"From there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day."
"The film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in Belgrade. The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"" (""There is no plane to Zagreb"" in Serbian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. ""What ""Nema"" expresses is good will and a great incapacity. ""Nema"" and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark."" What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth."
"He begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with LSD, which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use."
"Shortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy’s parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God."
"First asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did."
"From the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English."
"At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a café in which a flamenco singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, ""a little angel of God."""
"At the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film."
"In his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute."
"The credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word ""nema,"" as ""Really and Sincerely"" by the Bee Gees plays."
"He received his Bachelor’s of Business Administration from The University of Notre Dame, and a Master's of Management degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University."
"From 2013 to June 2018 he was President and CEO of the Committee for Economic Development, a non-partisan, business-led public policy organization that delivers well-researched analysis and reasoned solutions to the nation’s most critical issues."
"In 2017, in collaboration with Joseph Minarik, Senior Vice President and Director of Research at CED, Odland co-authored ""Sustaining Capitalism: Bipartisan Solutions to Restore Trust & Prosperity"". The book lays out a clear plan for how business and policy leaders can generate prosperity for business and society now, all while making capitalism sustainable for generations to come.

= = = Mr. Blotto = = =
"Mr. Blotto is a jam band from Chicago, Illinois. They blend hard rock, original rock, southern rock, folk music, and country rock. They formed in 1991, and continue to tour extensively in the midwest area. Along with their seven album releases and four DVDs, they have also released four ""official bootleg"" albums of their live recordings. Their most recent release ""Live at the Leaf"" chronicles a weekend in New Orleans playing at the legendary Maple Leaf. It was released in 2018."
"The core of Mr. Blotto is the brother songwriting team of Mike and Paul Bolger, who had played together in garage rock bands throughout high school. They went in separate directions musically when they attended different colleges, Mike leaning towards the hardcore punk stylings of Hüsker Dü, and Paul focusing on the resurgence of 70s rock like Aerosmith, while eventually discovering Crosby, Stills and Nash and the Grateful Dead, who would later become huge influences. After Paul graduated he decided to pursue the life of a full-time musician while Mike opted to become a lawyer. Paul landed a gig as the house singer in a Polish club in Chicago called ""The Cardinal Club."" It was here that Paul met guitarist Bob Georges and they decided to begin playing together."
"Earlier the Bolger brothers played in the 1980s in a group called Fred, alongside future members of the Freddy Jones Band."
"Paul and Bob found drummer Alan Baster at a jazz night, and hired him on. After several auditions for a bass player yielded no results, Paul convinced Mike to be an interim bass player. The band as a four-piece started hitting Chicago area open mic nights and outlying bars, developing their roots-oriented jamband sound and weaving a large amount of reworked Grateful Dead songs into their sets to supplement the originals being penned by Paul, Mike and Bob. As their audience grew, Mike quit being a lawyer and became a full-fledged member."
"They released Parking Karma and found their way into the larger bars and venues of the Chicago scene. After the album was released, Dave Allen - an old college bandmate of Paul's - joined on keyboards, filling out the bass-acoustic guitar-electric guitar-keyboards-drums ensemble that has remained consistent through personnel changes since."
"In addition to Piano, Synths, & Hammond B-3, Dave supplied another singing voice and an ability to improvise lyrics that complemented a long-standing element of the early Blotto show, the ""Reggae Rap,"" in which Paul would freestyle over a rock-steady type of beat."
"In the mid-90s, they released a second CD, ""Bad Hair Day,"" and continued their process of steadily playing shows in the Chicago area. By the end of the decade they had built their audience to the point that they were a significant draw at local performances and festivals."
"1998 saw a third CD, Ancient Face; in 1999 Bob Georges was replaced by Mark Hague. The introduction of Mark (who had played with the Freddy Jones Band) marked a creative period for the band, and he helped pen the next generation of Mr. Blotto tunes. Paul, Mark & Mike started meeting every Monday to work on new original ideas. In these sessions, any idea would be chased down and put to tape. These songs became Cabbages and Kings, the 4th CD which (93.1) WXRT called the band's best release yet."
"Around this time, the band addressed the constant demand for a Live Record. Mr. Blotto had been, from its inception, an improvisational band and had always allowed people to record the shows. A taper path was built that included an analog to digital converter, a distribution amplifier, and an open invitation for all to enjoy the high quality of a constant gain board patch in either digital or analog. As a result, clean Mr. Blotto boots began to cross the country, often in advance of the band—this is especially true outside of the Midwest, where they rarely tour."
"Seeing as not everyone had a portable CD burner or DAT, Mr. Blotto began issuing Live Shows and Compilations. The Bootleg Series is a single CD of songs handpicked by the band for their unique characteristics, where the Just Did It series is made up of double disc sets from one particular show or run of shows."
"A flashmob event known as The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever was officially created in 2016 and is held annually. Fans gather in locations around the world to recreate the ""red dress"" video."
"The song has been interpreted by comedians Steve Coogan and Noel Fielding in 2011 as part of the BBC fundraising telethon Comic Relief. Coogan sang the song in the 1999 show as part of a medley of other Bush material in character as Alan Partridge. Fielding performed to the song in the 2011 series of Let's Dance for Comic Relief, placing in the final of the competition."

= = = The Impossible Voyage = = =
"The Impossible Voyage (), originally released in the US as An Impossible Voyage and in the UK as Whirling the Worlds, is a 1904 French silent film directed by Georges Méliès. Based in part on Jules Verne's play ""Journey Through the Impossible"" and modeled in style and format on Méliès's earlier, highly successful ""A Trip to the Moon"", the film is a satire of scientific exploration in which a group of geographers attempt a journey into the interior of the sun."
"Since the film is silent and has no intertitles, the proper names and quotations below are taken from the English-language description of the film published by Méliès in the catalog of the Star Film Company's New York Branch."
"A geographic society called the Institute of Incoherent Geography plans to make a world tour in such a way as to ""surpass in conception and invention all previous expeditions undertaken by the learned world."" At a meeting headed by President Polehunter, ""assisted by Secretary Rattlebrain, by the Archivist Mole, by the Vice-president Humbug, the members of the office, Easily-fooled, Daredevil, Schemer, etc., etc.,"" the members listen to Professor Daredevil's plan for the world tour, but reject it for being out-of-date. The president then welcomes the eccentric engineer Crazyloff (in French, Mabouloff; ""maboul"" is French for ""crazy"" or ""crackpot""), who explains his project for a new ""impossible"" voyage, using ""all the known means locomotion—railroads, automobiles, dirigible balloons, submarine boats…"" The unusual plan is accepted enthusiastically, and preparations begin."
"When work is complete, the machines and travelers are loaded onto a train and are sent to the Swiss Alps, where the travelers will begin their journey. The first board an automobile, the Auto-Crazyloff, and journey through the mountains. In an attempt to run over the summit of the Rigi, the travelers crash at the bottom of a precipice. They are saved by mountaineers and rushed to a Swiss hospital."
"After they have recovered, they board a train with their vehicles, and make a second attempt at running over a summit: this time, the Jungfrau. Getting higher and higher every minute, with dirigible balloons attached to the train, they rise into space and are swallowed by the Sun. The travelers land with a crash. They are happy to be alive, but the heat is too much. All but one of the travelers are loaded into an icebox but are suddenly frozen. The remaining traveler, Crazyloff himself, finds a bundle of straw among the debris and starts a fire to melt the ice. The travelers thaw and are happily moved over to the expedition's submarine, which is launched off a cliff on the Sun, plummets through space, and falls into an ocean on Earth."
"After a few minutes of underwater travel, a boiler problem causes the submarine to explode. The travelers are thrown up into the air, landing safely at a seaport amid the wreckage of the submarine. They return in triumph to the Institute of Incoherent Geography, where a grand rejoicing is held for them."
"An optional 50-meter-long epilogue, ""Supplément ""Voyage à travers l'impossible"""" (advertised in the US as ""Supplementary Section of the ""Impossible Voyage""""), was sold separately. The epilogue begins in Crazyloff's study, where he is criticized by the Institute of Incoherent Geography for losing so much transportation equipment during the voyage. At the top of the Institute's tower, he presents his plan for recovering the equipment: a powerful magnet able to attract the automobile lost in Switzerland, the train that was eaten by the Sun, and the submarine destroyed at sea. The plan is a success and is celebrated at a banquet where Crazyloff is applauded by his scientific colleagues."
"The supplementary section was believed lost until the 1970s when the Méliès scholar John Frazer discovered and examined it in the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences among surviving negatives from Star Film's New York offices. However, a 2008 Méliès filmography by Jacques Malthête lists the supplement as lost."
"""The Impossible Voyage"" was made during the summer of 1904. The film, running to 374 meters, was Méliès's longest film to date, and cost about 37,500 (7,500) to make. In its staging and design, the film is symmetrical with Méliès's ""A Trip to the Moon"": while the astronomers' progress toward the moon in that film is consistently depicted as left-to-right motion, the Institute of Incoherent Geography's progress toward the sun in ""The Impossible Voyage"" is consistently right-to-left. While most of the film was shot inside Méliès's glass studio, the scene at the foot of the Jungfrau was filmed outdoors, in the garden of Méliès's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis."
"A print of the film (though not the supplemental epilogue) was deposited for American copyright at the Library of Congress on October 12, 1904, and the film was sold in French, American, and British catalogs by the Star Film Company. As with at least 4% of Méliès's entire output (including such films as ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The Rajah's Dream"", ""The Kingdom of the Fairies"", and ""The Barber of Seville""), some prints were individually hand-colored and sold at a higher price."

For the 2000–01 season he went to the Czech Republic to play for HC Sparta Praha of the Czech Extraliga. He returned to North America after only a year, and made it back to the NHL during the 2003–04 season with the Chicago Blackhawks, playing 41 games, scoring just one assist. He moved to the Austrian Hockey League for Klagenfurt AC for the 2006–07 season before retiring from professional hockey."

"Howard Gordon (born March 31, 1961) is an American television writer and producer."
"He is well known for his work on the Fox action series ""24"" alongside the Showtime thriller ""Homeland"", which he co-developed with Alex Gansa and Gideon Raff, and for the FX political drama ""Tyrant"", which he co-developed with Craig Wright. He also produced the NBC science fiction thriller ""Awake""."
"Gordon was born to a Reform Jewish family in Queens, New York City and graduated from Roslyn High School. After graduating from Princeton with a major in creative writing in 1984, Gordon came to Los Angeles with fellow filmmaker Alex Gansa to pursue a career in writing for television. Both broke into the industry with single episodes of ABC's """". Their ""Spenser"" work turned industry heads, and the pair joined the series ""Beauty and the Beast"" as staff writers, and were later named producers."
"In 1990, the Gansa-Gordon team was signed to a two-year deal with Witt-Thomas Productions, during which they produced several pilots. One was an ABC project called ""Country Estates"", which caught the attention of producer Chris Carter."
"Soon after, Carter invited Gordon and Gansa to join ""The X-Files"" as supervising producers; Gordon wrote or co-wrote several scripts each season, before departing from the series in 1997 to pursue other projects."
"After co-writing one episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", Gordon created his own show, the short-lived ""Strange World"" in 1999. ""Strange World"" went to seed 13 episodes in, but Gordon and ""Strange World"" writer Tim Minear's services were quickly snapped up by ""Buffy"" creator Joss Whedon on another project: ""Angel"". After two years with ""Angel"", Gordon jumped ship in 2001 for FOX's successful ""24"", where he would write several episodes in Seasons 1 & 2, then crafted the entire story arcs for Seasons 3 and 4. Gordon temporarily left ""24"" in the middle of the 2004 season to re-join Minear, this time as co-creator of another FOX series, ""The Inside"". Despite ""The Inside"" 's cancellation and short run, talk circulated of including the two Minear-Gordon series, ""Strange World"" and ""The Inside"", on a special DVD set sometime in 2006."
"Beginning in 2006, Gordon became ""24""'s showrunner, a title he held through its final season."
Gordon is also the author of the Gideon Davis novels.
"In 2010, after finishing ""24"", Gordon began co-developing (along with Gideon Raff and Alex Gansa) the thriller ""Homeland"" for Showtime. Based on the Israeli series ""Prisoners of War"", it centers on a woman (Claire Danes) who works for the CIA and is convinced a recently returned American prisoner of war (Damian Lewis) has been turned by al-Qaeda. The show premiered Sunday, October 2, 2011, at 10/9 central. It has been met with major critical acclaim and maintained a steady viewership rating throughout its first season. Showtime premiered its fourth season on October 5, 2014."
"In 2012, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing the ""Pilot"" of ""Homeland"" and the series itself won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series."
"In 2011, Gordon signed on to NBC's new Kyle Killen fantasy pilot ""Awake"" as an executive producer. When NBC picked the project up to series status, Gordon added writer and showrunner to his occupational duties on the show. The series only ran from March 1 to May 24, 2012 before it was cancelled."
"Most recently, 2015 would see him working as an executive producer on the horror-drama series ""Second Chance"" for Fox Television Network. The pilot for ""Second Chance"" is based on a script written by Rand Ravich, who also worked as an executive producer on the series."
= = = Klotho (biology) = = =
Klotho is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KL gene.
"This gene encodes a type-I membrane protein that is related to β-glucuronidases. Reduced production of this protein has been observed in patients with chronic kidney failure (CKF), and this may be one of the factors underlying the degenerative processes (e.g., arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and skin atrophy) seen in CKF. Also, mutations within this protein have been associated with ageing, bone loss and alcohol consumption. Transgenic mice that overexpress Klotho live longer than wild-type mice."
"Klotho is a transmembrane protein that, in addition to other effects, provides some control over the sensitivity of the organism to insulin and appears to be involved in ageing. Its discovery was documented in 1997 by Makoto Kuro-o ""et al."" The name of the gene comes from Klotho or Clotho, one of the Moirai, or Fates, in Greek mythology."
"The Klotho protein is a novel β-glucuronidase (EC number 3.2.1.31) capable of hydrolyzing steroid β-glucuronides. Genetic variants in ""KLOTHO"" have been associated with human aging, and Klotho protein has been shown to be a circulating factor detectable in serum that declines with age."
"The binding of certain fibroblast growth factors (FGF's) viz., FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, to their fibroblast growth factor receptors, is promoted via their interactions as co-receptors with β-Klotho."
"Klotho-deficient mice manifest a syndrome resembling accelerated human aging and display extensive and accelerated arteriosclerosis. Additionally, they exhibit impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation and impaired angiogenesis, suggesting that Klotho protein may protect the cardiovascular system through endothelium-derived NO production."
"Although the vast majority of research has been based on lack of Klotho, it was demonstrated that an overexpression of Klotho in mice might extend their average life span between 19% and 31% compared to normal mice. In addition, variations in the Klotho gene (SNP Rs9536314) are associated with both life extension and increased cognition in human populations."
"The mechanism of action of klotho is not fully understood, but it changes cellular calcium homeostasis, by both increasing the expression and activity of TRPV5 and decreasing that of TRPC6. Additionally, klotho increases membrane expression of the inward rectifier channel ROMK. Klotho-deficient mice show increased production of vitamin D, and altered mineral-ion homeostasis is suggested to be a cause of premature aging‑like phenotypes, because the lowering of vitamin D activity by dietary restriction reverses the premature aging‑like phenotypes and prolongs survival in these mutants. These results suggest that aging‑like phenotypes were due to klotho-associated vitamin D metabolic abnormalities (hypervitaminosis)."
"Recently it has been found that the decreased Klotho expression may be due to DNA hypermethylation, which may have been induced by the overexpression of DNMT3a. Klotho may be a reliable gene for early detection of methylation changes in oral tissues, and can be used as a target for therapeutic modification in oral cancer during the early stages."

"Toward the end of the war, Rupe resolved to get into the entertainment industry. After losing money he had invested in a small record company, he spent $200 on what were called ""race records"" at the time to systematically analyze them and determine the formula for records that would sell. He decided that the secret lay in a big band sound with a churchy feel. He found the recording talent he needed in the many after-hours clubs in the Watts district. He and Ben Siegert first started Juke Box Records in 1944 and after a few hits, he broke with his partners and started a new company, Specialty Records. The label soon thrived with Roy Milton, Percy Mayfield, and Jimmy Liggins, along with a very successful gospel catalog. The major producers for the label were Rupe, Robert ""Bumps"" Blackwell, and J. W. Alexander. Johnny Vincent was a sales representative for the company."
"Rupe had a love of gospel music, and in 1947 he began recording gospel quartets such as the Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Pilgrim Travelers, Alex Bradford, Dorothy Love Coates and Sister Wynona Carr. His taste for gospel carried over into secular music and influenced his choice of artists to record, such as Guitar Slim, Don and Dewey, Lloyd Price, Larry Williams, and Little Richard. It led him to value feeling over technique in the recording studio. Concerns about religious objections to the secularization of gospel music, combined with a contract dispute, resulted in his decision not to put out a pop record with gospel singer Sam Cooke. He recorded but ultimately chose not to release two songs that later became big hits, ""You Send Me"" and ""Summertime""."
"In 1952, Rupe first traveled to New Orleans because of his attraction to the gospel sound of Fats Domino who played piano in the band of Dave Bartholomew, a former trumpeter with Duke Ellington. It was on this trip that he auditioned and then recorded Lloyd Price."
"Rupe obtained his most successful artist when Little Richard, then a little-known recording artist, followed Lloyd Price's suggestion and sent Rupe a demo record. Art sent Blackwell to New Orleans to do a recording session. During a recording break Little Richard sang an obscene song while playing the piano. Blackwell sensed that it was a hit, but after the lyrics had been cleaned up, there was no time to teach the song to a piano player. So Little Richard both played and sang the only song to emerge from that first session, done in just three takes, ""Tutti Frutti"", one of the most significant rock and roll records ever made. Rupe also recorded Guitar Slim, with a young Ray Charles on piano. In addition, Specialty issued some of wildest R&B records, such as ""Cherokee Dance"", by Froggy Landers; ""(Everytime I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone"", by Roy Montrell; ""Drunk"" by Jimmy Liggins; and the rock & roll ""Moose on the Loose"", by Roddy Jackson."
"When asked why Specialty was so successful, Rupe credited his own ability to produce rather than his business skills. In the early 1960s, he stopped producing records but remained active in the music business as a publisher. He returned during the fifties revival period in the late 1960s but only to reissue landmark recordings of the R&B era. Rupe sold Specialty to Fantasy Records in 1991. However, it is worth noting that the contracts that were given to the artists to sign left Rupe and others at the label with full ownership and publishing rights of the music. Richard signed a contract with Specialty Records in 1955. He reportedly gave the label full ownership of all the music he recorded with them in return for 50% of the royalties earned. In his authorized biography, he states that he sold his publishing rights to “Tutti Frutti” for $50, leaving him with a small half-cent royalty rate per record sold. In 1959, Little Richard left the label and filed a lawsuit claiming he never received his royalties. He settled for $11,000 and waived his rights to royalties from such hits as “Tutti Frutti” and “Long Tall Sally”."
"During the 1960s and later, Rupe became increasingly involved in oil and gas investments. Success in this area allowed him to establish the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation, a philanthropy based in Santa Barbara."
He turned 100 in September 2017.
"In 2007, Rupe was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame."
"On December 15, 2010, it was announced that Rupe will be awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Award (along with former Elektra Records founder Jac Holzman) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
"= = = Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South = = ="
"Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South () is the full title of the English translation of the novel written by the French science-fiction author Jules Verne, and centers on the story of James Burbank, an antislavery northerner living near Jacksonville, Florida, and Texar, a pro-slavery southerner who holds a vendetta against Burbank. Originally published in France in 1887, the book received a tepid reaction upon its release in the United States, partly because of Verne's inexpertise regarding some details of the American Civil War, and has since fallen into obscurity compared to many of Verne's other works."
"Texar and Burbank are bitter enemies, Burbank's northern view of slavery as an evil being an unpopular stance with Texar and the rest of the community, deep in the Confederate States of America. On top of this disagreement, though, Texar is angry at Burbank for past legal troubles Burbank has brought upon Texar, and, despite Texar inventing a perfect alibi that allows him to escape conviction, Texar feels the need for vengeance and eventually becomes a prominent and powerful member of the Jacksonville community. Using this newfound power, Texar turns the townsfolk against Burbank and leads a mob that destroys the Burbank plantation, known as Camdless Bay. Burbank's daughter Dy and caretaker Zermah are both kidnapped by a man claiming to be Texar and are purportedly taken to a place in the Everglades called Carneral Island. En route, and after enlisting the help of the United States Navy, they find a separate group searching for Texar in response to crimes that apparently happened in the same time as the ones at Camdless Bay but in a distant location. This opens up the realization that there is one real Texar and one who is not, and the search continues now, not only for Dy and Zermah, but for the answer to this mystery."
"""Nord Contre Sud"", the original French title of the book, was first published in its fully illustrated edition in November, 1887, by J. Hetzel et Cie, Paris."
"In the first American (and first English) translation, ""Nord Contre Sud"" (North Against South) was relegated to a subtitle and the book's title was made ""Texar's Vengeance"", quickly re-translated as ""Texar's Revenge"". This edition was published by George Munro, New York (1887), a translation by Laura E. Kendall as part of the ""Seaside Library"". Since then, however, there have been more minor variations on the title, some editions referring to the title as ""The Texar's Revenge"", others omitting the title completely in favor of the more simple ""North Against South"". The most common and generally most accepted American version of the title is the full ""Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South"". There have also been a handful of editions that have split the book into two volumes, those being ""Burbank the Northerner"" and ""Texar the Southerner"", both of which are contained in most editions of the book. Various cheap editions were published in the U.S. for the next 20 years by W. L. Allison, Hurst, and others."
"The first fully illustrated edition in English was ""North against South"" published by Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, London, December 1887. This is a different anonymous translation from the one published by George Munro. In 2007 the first fully illustrated edition of ""North against South"" in the U.S. was published by the Choptank Press of St. Michaels, Maryland as a Lulu Press book, a replica re-publication of the Sampson Low first edition."
"[In Jules Verne's] story of ""Texar""... a very thin streak of narrative is padded to almost unwieldy proportions by a quantity of remarkably inaccurate information about the rebellion.

The Vicesima hereditatium was a Roman 5% tax on inheritance money.
"No inheritance tax was recorded for the Roman Republic, despite abundant evidence for testamentary law. The ""vicesima hereditatium"" (""twentieth of inheritance"") was levied by Rome's first emperor, Augustus, in the last decade of his reign. The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings. The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated—from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband. Roman social values on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse. Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source, but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of Trajan's reign."
= = = Alice Mary Baldwin = = =
"Alice Mary Baldwin (born January 24, 1879, Lewiston, Maine; died 1960) was a historian and educator, noted as the Dean of the Woman's College of Duke University from 1923 until her retirement in 1947."
"Baldwin was born in 1879 in Lewiston, Maine, the eldest of five children of a Congregationist minister. She moved with her family at the age of nine to East Orange, New Jersey, where she was educated in private school before entering Bates College in 1896. After one year, she transferred to Cornell University where she was named to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and from where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1900."
"Baldwin remained at Cornell to receive her master's degree in history in 1902, and then went to Europe on a fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and research in Sweden. (The subject of her master's thesis had been ""Gustavus III of Sweden: A Study in Enlightened Despotism."")"
"Returning from Europe in late 1903, Baldwin took a series of teaching positions culminating in a position as Instructor of History, and later head of the Department of History, at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While at the Baldwin School, she pursued graduate studies in history at Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as studies in education at the Teachers College of Columbia University."
"In 1921, Baldwin left the Baldwin School to attend the University of Chicago to pursue her doctorate degree."
"In 1923, Baldwin took the job as Acting Dean of Women at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina (later to become part of Duke University). Seeing little opportunity for a woman in the 1920s to become a full professor at the University of Chicago, Baldwin remained at Trinity to become Dean of Women and Assistant Professor of History. While at Trinity, Baldwin completed her doctoral thesis (on the topic of New England clergy and the American Revolution) in time to receive her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1926."
"Baldwin's responsibilities as dean and as an active teacher (which she believed necessary to remain effective as an administrator) left her no time for research, and she produced no further scholarly historical material after this time. She did, however, maintain active memberships in various women's educational organizations and North Carolina historical organizations. She also encouraged student participation state and national women's organizations as well as the formation of a number of student-led organizations on campus; under her guidance and example, students launched organizations such as a Forum Committee to invite speakers to East Campus, DISTAFF, a monthly magazine edited entirely by women, the Nereidians, a synchronized swimming club, and numerous honorary and leadership societies such as Ivy, Sandals, and the White Duchy, a counterpart to the Order of The Red Friars."
Baldwin retired from Duke University in 1947.
"As an historian, Baldwin is best remembered for her doctoral dissertation ""The New England Clergy and the American Revolution"". Her other writings include:"
"Baldwin has been held up as an example of the key issues in the intellectual life of women in the early twentieth century. Upon her retirement, she ordered that her papers and notes be sealed for twenty years. Upon their unveiling, it was revealed that Baldwin had struggled bitterly with her role as a female educator and on the education of women in general. She had found little documentation of interest in her research in the lives of women in colonial times, and left unfinished many papers and treatises in which she expressed the disdain she uncovered for the education of women in America."
"Baldwin remains a much-beloved figure at Duke University and is credited with advancing the prestige of the Woman's College at Duke and the education of young women. One of the most prominent buildings on Duke's East Campus, the auditorium anchoring the campus, is named in her honor in recognition of her dedication to the institution."
"Recognizing Baldwin's contributions to the University, Duke has created the Alice Mary Baldwin Collection within their library, wherein all of Baldwin's papers are available for review and research."

"Zi Mo seems to be close to the Way, but he does not understand the following: the proper measure is defined as following the Way at the right time; the middle is defined as others with the proper measure; and the position between Yang Zi and Mo Zi is not the place to seek the middle."

"If one just knows that one should not sever ties with others but does not know how to weigh others to give evenly, then there is no danger of becoming an egoist, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect themselves will also be seen as approaching egoism and consequently one will not dare act in like manner."
"If one understands that one should not sacrifice oneself for others but cannot give to others on an individual basis, then there is no danger of loving indiscriminately, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect the whole Empire will also be seen as approaching indiscriminate love and consequently one will not be willing to act in like manner."

"There are two types of printing and publishing related to the eight-legged essay, one for the exams themselves and the other for public purposes. After the test-takers finished with their exams, their papers were collected in the testing room and sent over to be graded. They were then printed with the graders' comments and in the order of the score rank. During the late Ming Dynasty, commercial publishing also increased in the face of increasing commercialization of culture. The public printing, publishing, and dissemination of the essays prompted more people to be interested candidates of the civil service examination during the Ming and Qing dynasties."
"One virtue of the eight-legged essays is that its composition is well defined and easy to follow. For the purpose of administering a large group of exam-takers, this structure allowed convenient regulation as the exam-takers were not likely to deviate from the requirements. Thus, this format contributed to ensuring standard and fairness in the civil service examination system. The examiners could reduce the amount of time spent in grading exams by being accustomed to this format, and uncertainties in the grading schemes were reduced. A scholar named Tian Qilin defended the eight-legged essay by arguing that it embodies the complex Chinese cultural and literary tradition."
"As early as the 17th century, the form's adoption was blamed for the decline of classical poetry and prose during the Ming Dynasty. The critic Wu Qiao wrote that ""people exhausted themselves on the eight-legged essay, and poetry was only composed with their spare energy."" Writing at the same time, the political theorist and philosopher Huang Zongxi echoed these sentiments. Also, the essay did not allow for any personal opinion and was completely impartial. As a result, it led to the gradual narrowing of people's innovative thinking and consequently their minds, thus achieving a constraining effect on Chinese people and the nation. The eight-legged essay has been associated with the ""petrification in Chinese literature"" and ""China's cultural stagnation and economic backwardness."""

Unlike the Model A, it featured a true elevator carried at the tail rather than at the front. It was the last Wright model to have an open-frame tail. The Model B was a dedicated two-seater with the pilot and a passenger sitting side-by-side on the leading edge of the lower wing."
"Besides their civil market, the Wrights were able to sell aircraft to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps (S.C. 3, 4, and 5) and to the United States Navy as hydroplanes (AH-4, -5-, and -6), in which services they were used as trainers. Furthermore, the Wrights were able to sell licenses to produce the aircraft domestically (to the Burgess Company and Curtis, which designated it Model F), as well as in Germany. The deal with Burgess was the first license-production of aircraft undertaken in the United States and most of the approximately one hundred Model Bs produced were actually built by Burgess. A modified Model B, redesignated Model EX (for Exhibition) achieved fame as the ""Vin Fiz Flyer"", the first aircraft to cross the United States. Burgess also planned a refined version as the Model G, but this was never built."
At least three original Model Bs were extant in 2007.

The station has a 'contemporary easy listening' format, playing classic and recent melodic popular music aimed principally at listeners over 40."
"The station operates on three FM frequencies; the three were previously separate stations centred on each of the broadcast areas, which have over time combined into a single regional service. The station is also available online."
"The station launched under its current identity and format on 4 July 2010; it has operated under various owners, formats and identities previously, with the three services having launched independently of each other in 1999 as a series of local stations each focused on a specified broadcast area. All programming is now identical across the three licence areas."
"The Breeze is based at Roman Landing in the Kingsway area of Southampton, sharing facilities with another Nation Broadcasting-owned station in the region, Sam FM."
The 107.8 FM service launched under the name SouthCity FM on 5 September 1999.
"In 2004, the licence was acquired by Southampton Football Club, who renamed the station as The Saint, effectively making it an FM version of their existing club station of the same name (which was broadcasting on digital TV and online). The service was at this point based at studios within Southampton FC's ground, St Mary's Stadium."
"On 26 July 2007, Southampton FC confirmed it had sold the station to South Wales-based radio group Town & Country Broadcasting - a firm headed by lifelong Southampton FC fan Jason Bryant (formerly of Talksport and Virgin Radio). The sale led to a rebranding of the station as 107.8 Radio Hampshire from 6 August 2007. As Radio Hampshire, the station combined adult contemporary music with information and breaking news from Southampton FC; match coverage also continued, and the station continued to be operated from the studio at St. Mary's."
"Radio Hampshire joined Nation Radio, 102.1 Bay Radio, 102.5 Radio Pembrokeshire, 97.1 Radio Carmarthenshire, 97.5 Scarlet FM and 106.3 Bridge FM in the T&CB portfolio."

= = = Ribbon category = = =
"In mathematics, a ribbon category, also called a tortile category, is a particular type of braided monoidal category."
"A monoidal category formula_1 is, loosely speaking, a category equipped with a notion resembling the tensor product (of vector spaces, say). That is, for any two objects formula_2, there is an object formula_3. The assignment formula_4 is supposed to be functorial and needs to require a number of further properties such as a unit object 1 and an associativity isomorphism. Such a category is called braided if there are isomorphisms"
"A braided monoidal category is called a ribbon category if the category is left rigid and has a family of ""twists"". The former means that for each object formula_6 there is another object (called the left dual), formula_7, with maps"
such that the compositions
"equals the identity of formula_7, and similarly with formula_6. The twists are maps"
such that
"To be a ribbon category, the duals have to be compatible with the braiding and the twists in a certain way."
"An example is the category of projective modules over a commutative ring. In this category, the monoidal structure is the tensor product, the dual object is the dual in the sense of (linear) algebra, which is again projective. The twists in this case are the identity maps. A more sophisticated example of a ribbon category are finite-dimensional representations of a quantum group."
The name ribbon category is motivated by a graphical depiction of morphisms.
A strongly ribbon category is a ribbon category C equipped with a dagger structure such that the functor †: C → C coherently preserves the ribbon structure.
